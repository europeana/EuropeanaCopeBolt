                  "The goal of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is to offer everyone unrestricted access to Germany’s cultural and scientific heritage, that is, access to millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music and other sound documents, as well as films and scores, from all over Germany. As a central, national portal, the DDB is aiming to bring together and network digital content from all of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions. The DDB should secure Germany’s connectivity and competitiveness in the areas of science, research and education, but also make it possible for anyone to access Germany’s unique cultural heritage and knowledge conveniently via one central point of entry. The fact that this entire wealth of information is now at our fingertips, centrally accessible to anyone who can use a PC workstation with an Internet connection, independent of time and location, constitutes a fundamental improvement to our opportunities in the areas of research, education and the economy.\n\nWe have some way to go until this vision is realized in its full potential. The digitisation of Germany’s cultural and scientific heritage is a process which will unfold over many years.\n\nThe first, publicly available beta version of the DDB went online in November 2012 and the first fully-fledged version will be launched on 31st March 2014. New functions are continually being added to the portal.  The number of participating cultural and scientific institutions - and with them, the amount of accessible virtual content - is set to rise steadily."

        intro: 'International Congress on Architectural Archives ‘Professional Experiences in Cultural Diversity’ at Braga (Portugal), 25 to 27 September 2019.'

        body: "<p>The issue of aggregation in the museum field is a live topic which still deserves more attention than it has had before in the Central European Region. The European scene of aggregation shows amazing diversity. The aim of the conference is to present different working models for museum aggregation both on national and European levels. What is the function of Europeana in the field of aggregation? What is the Europeana Aggregator Forum? What are the different solutions on national levels? By answering these questions, the audience gets a wider overview on aggregation. Furthermore, they can adapt some elements of the working solutions in their own museum environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about registration and the programme, please consult the <a href=\"http://www.scholagraphidis.org/icom-conference--2019.html\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n"

ODOCH'19 aims at attracting both IT researchers and industrials, already participating to the main conference, who are eager to discover new domains of application of their research, and professionals of humanities who will recognize in ODOCH'19 and, likely for the first time, in CAiSE, the chance to explore new opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ODOCH’19 will be held in Rome on June 3rd, 2019, in conjunction with the 31st International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (<a href=\"https://www.caise19.it/\" target=\"_blank\">CAiSE'19</a>).

        intro: "<p>***\_ INVITE ONLY\_ ***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana meeting under the Romanian Presidency aims to highlight the impact of exposing cultural heritage online, and to provide a platform to discuss the importance of national aggregation infrastructures to the digital transformation of cultural heritage sector using Romania as a case study.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Central hypothesis:</strong><br>\r\nEurope currently has a leading position in the world in digital cultural heritage. This leading position has been built through large investments of the EU (in Europeana and related projects) and of the Member States (in digitization and national infrastructures). Securing this leading position in the future, in particular with the advent of new technologies such as AI, is dependant on our ability to continue to invest in strong distributed European and National infrastructures, in digitization and in shared standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants will include cultural policy makers from EU member states, Romanian cultural policy makers, Romanian cultural heritage institution decision makers and representatives of the European Commission. The meeting will be facilitated by Europeana Foundation with support from inspirational speakers and experts from the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The meeting will address the following topics:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The positive impacts and the challenges of making cultural heritage available on the web for cultural heritage institutions. We will investigate both the European context as well as the specifics of the situation in Romania;</li>\r\n    <li>The importance of solid national aggregation infrastructures to complement the pan-european initiative (Europeana) and the domain expertise.</li>\r\n    <li>The necessity to adopt shared and open frameworks (data models, licensing frameworks, publishing frameworks, etc.) to support the free flow of data across distributed networks;</li>\r\n    <li>The importance of jointly investing in policies that secure that technologies that will determine the future of digitization and access, such as machine learning and AI, will benefit the sector and guarantee their sovereignty.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Objectives: </strong>The meeting intends to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Stimulate reflection, in the context of Romania (case study), on the impact of exposing digital cultural heritage; Examine various perspectives, needs and concerns of the actors;</li>\r\n    <li>Investigate best practices for aggregation models in other countries and share common experiences/solutions, supported by speakers from European aggregators;</li>\r\n    <li>Identify the challenges</li>\r\n    <li>Design recommendations for policies, frameworks and standards;</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Output: </strong>Based on the participants’ input and the outcome of the discussions, a ‘Position Paper’ will be developed.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'DARIAH Annual Event 2019: "Humanities Data"'
        intro: "<p>The DARIAH annual events bring\_together humanities scholars with a strong vocation for new ways of knowledge production. As a European Research Infrastructure for the Humanities and Arts, DARIAH addresses the complex topic of Humanities Data at the <a href=\"https://dariah-ae-2019.sciencesconf.org/\">DARIAH\_Annual Event 2019</a>, six months after the launch of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On the occasion of this year's event, Europeana Research has co-organised a workshop in collaboration with DARIAH,\_under the title\_<strong><em>Cultural Heritage Reuse Cases: Facilitating the Exchange of Perspectives between Heritage Professionals and Researchers</em></strong>. It will take place on Wednesday, 15 May 2019, h 16-18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying the shared needs of the hugely diverse communities falling under the umbrella of the humanities is not an easy task. Improving access to cultural heritage data can be recognized as one of such widely shared needs. Since there are hardly any disciplines where source materials curated in and produced by galleries, libraries, archives and museums are not widely, or not used at all, improving access to and the reusability of these sources is one of the major data management challenges in the field of arts and humanities. The lack of a clear and comprehensive framework that could serve as a general baseline for interactions between scholars and cultural heritage institutions can be recognized as one of the greatest barriers in optimal reuse of cultural heritage data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://datacharter.hypotheses.org/77\">DARIAH Cultural Heritage Data Reuse Charter</a> aims to set up principles and mechanisms for improving the use and re-use of cultural heritage data issued by cultural heritage institutions and studied and enriched by researchers.\_This workshop will focus on the identification of the major gaps that typically occur in interactions\_between CHI professionals and researchers in different settings. It will bring together (re)use case studies from the cultural heritage sector, presented by Europeana Research and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/research-community\">Europeana Research Community</a>, and from the research world, presented by humanities scholars from the DARIAH network. These inputs will be co-analyzed and discussed together\_to uncover those critical aspects of the respective workflows where the two perspectives find less resonance with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Workshop organisers and moderators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/alba-irollo\">Alba Irollo</a>, Europeana Foundation</li>\r\n    <li>Erzsébet Tóth-Czifra, DARIAH</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Speakers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/erik-buelinckx\">Erik Buelinckx</a>, KIK-IRPA ~ Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage</li>\r\n    <li>Sally Chambers, University of Ghent</li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/steven-claeyssens\">Steven Claeyssens</a>, KB ~ National Library in the Netherlands</li>\r\n    <li>Marie Puren, CNRS ~ French National Center for Scientific Research</li>\r\n</ul>"

        body: "<p><strong>1000-1030 Arrival and coffee</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1030-1230 Symposium on new EU Copyright Rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on the newly adopted Copyright in the Digital Single Market directive. Together with representatives from the European Commission (Copyright Unit), the Federation of European Publishers and IFRRO, we will explore what the new copyright rules aimed at cultural heritage institutions will mean in practice and how cultural heritage institutions and rights holders can work together to ensure maximum benefit to Europe’s cultural heritage institutions and their users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The session will provide an opportunity for an exchange of views with Commission officials involved in drafting the new rules and with representatives from rights holder organisations who will be an important partner for cultural heritage institutions working with the new rules. The main focus of the discussion will be articles 8-12 of the new directive that deal with access to out of commerce works and extended collective licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1230 - 1330 Lunch (provided)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1330 - 1530 Copyright Community Meeting</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focused on developing which issues the Copyright Community will focus their efforts on in 2019, and what their ambition and role is beyond this. Further, the governance of the community will be discussed, and a provisional plan for developing the community Steering Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This session will be facilitated through a series of exercises that enable group discussion around common issues, and the identification of the role of the community in helping address them. The output of the session will be a work plan for 2019 describing the issues the copyright community seek to address, with clear actions assigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please note: We have limited space available</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network Association can reimburse 6-10 members of the copyright community to attend this meeting, depending on costs, according to the ENA reimbursements rules. Members who are able to self, or partially fund the attendance of this meeting are very welcome and this would be very much appreciated by the Network Association. Requests for reimbursement will be granted on first come first serve basis until the budget allocated is used.</p>\r\n"

Under many jurisdictions, works are effectively free of copyright and enter the public domain&nbsp;on January 1, 70 years after the death of the author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public Domain Day happens every first of January&nbsp;to celebrate that new works have become available for the public to reuse. These works&nbsp;can be used on Wikipedia, remixed to new works and or in new publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Celebrations in The Netherlands</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 10th of January 2020 we will discuss, look at and listen to the works that are now part of the public domain in The Netherlands and their makers who died in 1949. This is the third year in a row that this event is organised.&nbsp;The event will be in Dutch. It will take place at the&nbsp;Beeld &amp; Geluid in Hilversum, and you can register through <a href=\"http://publiekdomeindag.nl/2020/aanmelden\">this link</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>International celebrations in 2020</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways to celebrate Public Domain Day and we give you a few ideas in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/public-domain-day-2020-how-to-get-involved\">this post</a>.&nbsp;For more information about celebrations internationally, please have a look at the <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you interested in contributing?

Walking in the streets of the two districts, testimonials will be heard from those working among shops, workshops, markets, regenerated buildings and memories of industrial archeology.<br><br>\r\nThese jobs protect knowledge which are based on consumption methods and preferences that identify us culturally. The walk is organized in collaboration with Europeana as part of the Europe at Work season. It's goal is to share\_the history of Europe through ours working lives in the past and present. Europe at Work brings together stories of our working life staff with archive material on industrial heritage and work. Because work is not just what we do. It's often who we are and where we come from. It is an integral part of our heritage cultural.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meeting point: Exit Metro B Piramide</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italiano- Passeggiata culturale organizzata dall'<a href=\"http://www.appasseggio.it/index.php?it/365/chi-siamo\">Associazione culturale GoTellGo</a> nei quartieri romani di Testaccio e Ostiense per ascoltare storie su mestieri scomparsi e mestieri in essere. Passeggiando nelle strade dei due quartieri, verranno sentite testimonianze di chi lavora tra botteghe, officine, mercati, edifici rigenerati e memorie di archeologia industriale. Questi mestieri tutelano conoscenze sulle quali si fondano modalità e preferenze di consumo che ci identificano culturalmente.<br>\r\nLa passeggiata è organizzata in collaborazione con Europe at Work, progetto del portale delle collezioni digitali Europeana, che ha l’obiettivo di condividere la storia dell'Europa attraverso le nostre vite lavorative nel passato e nel presente. Europe at Work mette insieme storie della nostra vita lavorativa personale con materiale d'archivio sul patrimonio industriale e del lavoro. Perché il lavoro non è solo quello che facciamo. Spesso è chi siamo e da dove veniamo. È parte integrante del nostro patrimonio culturale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Punto d'incontro: Uscita Metro B Piramide</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><a href=\"http://www.appasseggio.it/\" target=\"_blank\">www.appasseggio.it</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europe At Work- Exploring occupation at Fiskars'
        intro: null
        body: "<p>English - On the occasion of the 70th Anniversary of <a href=\"http://www.fiskarsmuseum.fi/en\">Fiskars Museum</a>, the museum requests the pleasure of the company of the general public to participate in a Documentation Day of Work at Fiskars. It all started in the 1930s when office worker Laura Holmström inaugurated the assembling of old photographs from Fiskars. Together with midwife Gerda Gers she took the initiative to found a Museum. In 1949 on October the 30th Fiskars Museum opened its doors in the premises of the former office building of the Machinery Workshop.<br><br>\r\nIn the course of the Documentation Day, memories connected to work at Fiskars will be collected. The assembling constitutes part of the theme ”Europe at Work” run by Europeana Collections. The purpose of the Documentation Day is to share personal stories and memories of work and working lives at the ironworks now and then. What kind of work you did or still do is not important. All memories are equally important! Please bring artifacts, photographs or other documents that the Museum can digitize. There are no requirements to donate material to the Museum. The stories will be published in the europeana.eu Collections portal together with other work related to memories around Europe.The event is organized in corporation with Europeana Collections and the National Library.<br><br>\r\nOpen Doors and coffee from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.<br>\r\nCollection of memories from 1 to 5 p.m.<br><br>\r\nAdmission is free all day!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suomi -\_TYÖNTEKOA FISKARSISSA OSANA \"EUROPE AT WORK\"-tapahtumaa<br><br>\r\nFiskarsin museo juhlistaa 70-vuotista taivaltaan kutsumalla yleisö osallistumaan <a href=\"http://www.fiskarsmuseum.fi/fi\">Työntekoa Fiskarsissa</a> tallennuspäivään. Kaikki alkoi, kun konttoristi Laura Holmström aloitti vanhojen valokuvien keräämisen 1930-luvulla. Yhdessä kätilö Gerda Gersin kanssa he tekivät aloitteen museon perustamisesta, ja Fiskarsin museo avasi ovensa 30.10.1949 konepajan vanhassa konttorirakennuksessa.<br><br>\r\nTapahtumapäivänä kerätään talteen fiskarsilaiseen työntekoon liittyviä muistoja. Muistojen keruu teemalla ”Työnteko Euroopassa” on osa koko Euroopan kattavia kokoelmapäiviä. Päivän aikana kaikki ovat tervetulleita kertomaan muistojaan työn teosta Fiskarsin ruukissa, ennen ja nyt. Työnkuvalla ei ole väliä, kaikki työkokemukset ovat arvokkaita. Mukaan on suositeltavaa ottaa työhön liittyvä esine, valokuva tai dokumentti, jotka museo digitoi. Materiaalia ei tarvitse lahjoittaa alkuperäisenä museolle. Tarinat julkaistaan europeana.eu-kulttuuriperintöportaalissa, johon on koottu työmuistoja ympäri Euroopan. Tapahtumajärjestelyissä yhteistyökumppaneina ovat Europeana ja Kansalliskirjasto.<br><br>\r\nAvoimet ovet ja kahvitarjoilu klo 11–18<br>\r\nMuistojen keruu klo 13–17<br><br>\r\nTapahtumapäivänä museoon on vapaa pääsy!<br><br>\r\nSvenska -\_ARBETE I FISKARS SOM EN DEL AV \"EUROPE AT WORK\"-evenemanget<br><br>\r\nFiskars museum firar sin 70-åriga strapats genom att bjuda in allmänheten att delta i insamlingsdagen <a href=\"http://www.fiskarsmuseum.fi/sv\">Arbete i Fiskars</a>. Allt började då kontorist Laura Holmström på 1930-talet började samla gamla fotografier från Fiskars. Tillsammans med barnmorskan Gerda Gers togs initiativet att grunda ett museum och 30.10.1949 öppnades Fiskars museums dörrar i Mekaniska verkstadens gamla kontorsbyggnad.<br><br>\r\nUnder dagen insamlas minnen anknutna till arbetet i Fiskars. Dokumentationen är en del av det europeiska ”Europe at Work” - Arbete i Europa evenemanget som arrangeras av föremålsportalen Europeana. Under dagen är man välkommen att dela med sig av sina minnen av arbete i bruket förr och nu. Vad du jobbat eller jobbar med spelar ingen roll. Alla minnen är värdefulla! Du får gärna ta med dig föremål, fotografier eller dokument som museet kan digitalisera. Man behöver inte donera materialet. Berättelserna publiceras i europeana.eu portalen tillsammans med övriga arbetsrelaterade minnen från hela Europa.<br><br>\r\nÖppet hus och kaffeservering klo 11–18<br>\r\nInsamling av minnen klo 13–17<br><br>\r\nFritt inträde till museet under hela dagen!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>This conference aims to bring together an encompassing perspective of two distinct disciplines to explore the relationship between the visual arts, the sciences and the current climate crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, we live in a world which is experiencing unprecedented global change. From melting glaciers to increasing wildfires, tropical storms to population displacement, understanding how our planet is changing is crucial to both ours and the planets future. Recent media attention of the climate crisis has generated an urgent need for an international awareness of these pressing issues, with the youth climate activist Greta Thunburg and Extinction Rebellion, among others, inspiring a public climate movement. Highlighting these major world concerns, Art + Anthropocene aims to bring together an interdisciplinary approach to art and environment for all audiences, so as to better communicate climate change and the Anthropocene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please consult the <a href=\"http://artanthropoceneyork.mystrikingly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Across Europe, different studies indicate that the numbers of cultural and arts audiences are dropping despite innovative approaches to cultural services and continuous professional isation of cultural organisations, including museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprehending its responsibility as the recipient of the Kenneth Hudson Award (EMYA, 2018), the Estonian National Museum dedicates its both annual conference to the relevance of contem porary museums, to looking for the formula to the good museum', and to delivering exceptional quality to the public. The approach to museum renewal at the Estonian National Museum was set in a particular societal context and had particular expectations. The conference will contribute to this discussion, focusing on the particular con- texts in which contemporary museums operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the conference, please consult the <a href=\"http://enmconferences.ee/relevance-2020/abstracts\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Awarded one of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/grants-programme\">Europeana Research Grants</a> 2019, KU Leuven organised a workshop in Leuven on 11-12 March 2020 and a public event in Brussels on 12 March 2020 in collaboration with Europeana Research.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop was the only event that could take place as an in-person event in the 2019 run of the Research Grants Programme due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The public event planned by KU Leuven at its conclusion was also cancelled for the same reason. You can explore the full programme for these initiatives <a href=\"https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/fac_kalender/bestanden_kalender/art-markets-publicevent-20200312.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop brought together experts in art history, digital art history, digital cultural heritage, cultural studies, cultural economics, computer science and finance to address questions including; how can we reconcile and link powerful digital platforms so that art market and cultural heritage researchers can move beyond the case study approach to discover and analyse patterns that help us to understand the worldwide circulation of both European and non-European art throughout the ages? How can we transform new scholarly insights into widely accessible narratives and (virtual) exhibitions targeted at a wider audience?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_Read the workshop report, provided by Professor Koenraad Brosens, KU Leuven, and find below a link to the text of the keynote by Professor Hubertus Kohle, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, which was part of the programme for the public event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Art Market Studies in Digital and Global Dimensions: Report from the workshop\_</strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-2dce4c1b-7fff-26b6-8849-5b3610474f33\">by Professor Koenraad Brosens, KU Leuven</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recontextualisation and Comparative Views</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The availability and accessibility of both big and thick data, coupled with a growing number of empirical studies on Western and non-Western markets for art, should allow art market studies to move:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond painting;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond price;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond Europe and the US;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond the traditional dichotomy primary versus secondary market;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond the case study approach;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>beyond provenance data.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>By broadening the scope and recontextualising data, we will be able to compare, correlate and explain the prices of an array of fashion goods in particular places and moments in time, leading to a better understanding of the behavior, development, dynamics, and sizes of art markets on a local, regional and international level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Data Practices</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Data (geographically and chronologically diverse) should be discoverable and explorable. The Linked Open Data model is the most effective methodology to achieve these goals. However, seeing the cost and complexities of LOD, individual researchers are encouraged to keep on building relational databases. By using controlled vocabularies and authority lists, these datasets can eventually be shared and linked.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Institutions and researchers creating datasets should carefully document and publish their process and workflow, as well as the rationale behind their data modelling, data collecting, data curating, and data publishing strategies. This transparency allows users to open the box and to assess the dimensions and qualities of the data.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>When researchers distill analyses and arguments from datasets (or simply use data), they should cite the datasets, together with the (online) publications explaining the nature and structure of the datasets.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The development of next generation user interfaces should be collaborative undertakings led by computer scientists and developers and including art market researchers and cultural heritage managers. User studies (for example focusing on the effectiveness of tools allowing for probabilistic links and serendipitous discoveries) are needed to develop the next generation of data analysis and data visualisation tools.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Keynote ‘Make the data dance’ by Professor Hubertus Kohle, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘For a long time, the political and cultural life of the citizen was characterised more by passivity than by opportunities for participation. People went to the polls every few years, watched political programmes on television, possibly took part in rallies.They attended the performance of a play, looked at pictures in museums or watched the latest James Bond in the cinema. The behavior here was mainly receptive, at best evaluative activities took place inside the subject or could be discussed in the close vicinity of the family, school or workplace. Do not misunderstand me: For all we know, there is no better solution for the practice of democracy, but there might be ways to improve it […].’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.digitalesbild.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/make-the-data-dance/\">Read the full keynote.</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The current global health emergency has forced libraries and museums to organise digital engagement strategies, from #MuseumsFromHome to making digital broadcasts. However, this doesn’t mean that copyright laws have been suspended from working: how do we deal with copyright in this public health emergency? What are the important things we need to be looking at when we make our digital engagement strategies? Where can we go to find openly available content from museums and libraries? How do we make sure that we can legally preserve some of the current records being created by these digital engagement strategies? This webinar explores some of these questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The webinar took place on 26th of March 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ariadna Matas (Copyright Policy Advisor, Europeana Foundation)</li>\r\n    <li>Sarah Pearson (Legal Counsel, Creative Commons)</li>\r\n    <li>Andrea Wallace (Lecturer in Law, Exeter University)&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Resources</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Join the Europeana Copyright Community</a> to find out more about copyright and the cultural heritage sector, network with peers and hear about relevant events, resources and opportunities.</li>\r\n    <li>The text below offers an edited version of the conversation at this webinar; it was originally posted in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/copyright-open-access-for-glams-in-the-age-of-covid-3a35e67f7a1\">OpenGlam Medium</a> by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/evelin-heidel\">Scann</a>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can be shared from the collection of my institution at this moment?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Short answer</strong>: it depends! Rely on existing limitations and exceptions, fair use and open licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ariadna</strong>: In terms of managing risk, it’s difficult to say, there are a lot of questions around copyright. And there’s something here that the Open GLAM community has been saying for quite a long time now: that we need to look at copyright from the get-go. Whenever an artwork enters the institution, we need to look at the issue of copyright from that moment, so whenever a situation like this arises, going digital is much easier. There are many institutions that don’t integrate this in their way of working, some big institutions have been doing this for a long time, but other institutions that we might not be hearing from haven’t made clearing copyright part of their process inside the institutions. This is a small lesson but one that we need to think about in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: It’s always helpful to divide things up into buckets or categories. Copyright issues are relatively simple when you are talking about stuff that the museum owns, or that is in the public domain. There’s another category of copyrighted works that you don’t have the copyright to, and so there you either need to have permission, whether is a CC license or some sort of express agreement with the copyright holder, or rely on an exception and limitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this context, with this public health emergency, where physical access to the works is not an option, obviously, the arguments of limitations and exceptions are a lot stronger at this moment. This doesn’t make limitations and exceptions foolproof, by any means, but makes them stronger. And then the third bucket of stuff is the copyright of things that you are creating right now, and in some ways this resembles the first category, but there are special considerations to think about there. For example, when you are creating a virtual tour of the facilities, or capturing copyrighted works in what you are doing, you want to think about how much you are capturing. And if it’s purely incidental, that’s not going to be problematic, but if you are really focusing on a particular work, then you might want to think about copyright, and whether you are adding some commentary, for example. So there are still things to think about copyright in works that you are creating right now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can I do a digital exhibit of an author that is alive, an author in the public domain, and an author that died a while ago but is still not out of copyright? What kind of solution would be good for this?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Short answer</strong>: it depends! Consider partnering with other institutions, or even with the Google Cultural Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: This is exactly the type of connections that are ideal for this situation, and that potentially might be one of those grey areas that you and your collaborators might feel comfortable pushing. I hate to be the awful copyright lawyer that says “it depends”, but it does. It depends on the jurisdiction, it depends on the exceptions that are in place within that jurisdiction, where the institutions are located, where the licensing agreements might be between the institution and the artists, if the work is in copyright. And you might decide to go with all public domain content to be safe, but then, of course, we start to think about how that’s skewing everyone’s perception on what art is valuable and what stories are important to tell. We keep going back seventy years prior to everything that is conclusively in the public domain so we feel comfortable using it, and we start to then miss out on a lot of great contemporary enrichment, especially and potentially to more relevant things that are going on at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the role of fair use and limitations and exceptions in this context? Can the GLAM sector push for something similar to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10baTITJbFRh7D6dHVVvfgiGP2zqaMvm0EHHZYf2cBRk/preview#heading=h.yrwelxtxcfgr\">Public Statement of Library Copyright Specialists: Fair Use &amp; Emergency Remote Teaching &amp; Research</a> or <a href=\"https://blog.archive.org/2020/03/24/announcing-a-national-emergency-library-to-provide-digitized-books-to-students-and-the-public/\">Internet Archive’s Emergency Library</a>?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ariadna</strong>: I was trying to compare this statement with the context in which I work, which is Europe and a digital library. This statement is great because a lot of librarians are coming together to support the people they work for, or work with, which are their peers in the university. So if I have to think: “Who would be the equivalent in a digital library like Europeana? Who is this sector we are working for, and that we are trying to support in this, always, but in particular now in this time?”. We have colleagues in our office that work with the education and research sector, and it’s always very interesting and complicated at the same time to communicate what people can do with our collections. We rely very strongly on CC licenses and tools, and on<a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/\"> Rights Statements</a>, but it’s always quite complicated to make sure that the user is really understanding what they can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have exceptions and limitations in Europe that may allow a re-user to go beyond what the Rights Statements or the license indicates, and how do we communicate this to educators that may think from a license that they can’t use it for online teaching when they actually can? Now that everything is moving digitally, librarians that would often be there to support the person at the university and guide them on which materials to use or not, are not available, so people now have to rely on more standardized information on a website. How do we inform educators, researchers and others about the possibilities of relying on limitations and exceptions? In Europe we have some limitations and exceptions, they are not perfect, but we should not forget about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: This is a real opportunity to push the line a bit, especially around exceptions and limitations. A lot of times practitioners in the US are very hesitant to rely on fair use. This is a time where we can have a lot more comfort than any other time to rely on fair use and other exceptions and limitations. And that could have ripple effects when this is over. Then we’ll be able to see that the world didn’t end, that it didn’t kill copyright, in fact, maybe it even made the whole system work exactly as it should.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: I don’t think copyright is going to fly out of the window. In our jobs and positions we’re very aware of how important it is to protect the value and the rights of the rightsholders. I don’t think any of the things that people are thinking go beyond that. We’re probably approaching this from a pretty risk-adverse perspective, and also a sensitive perspective around the rightsholders, but we are also thinking about who feels comfortable to push some of those grey areas around what the limitations and exceptions allow us to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There will be some interesting growth around these exceptions because they will be tested, and I don’t think that it will be the type of thing that crumbles the copyright system. If anything, it can make it more fair and equitable, for both users and rightsholders. We have to be aware of the risk in doing some of those things and being comfortable with what that brings. So I will encourage people to embrace the risk around some of those grey areas because they are probably now not as risky as one could potentially think they could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And there’s also a big question here around who will have access. We’re seeing this at the university, where students are going back home with poor quality wifi and with less access to digital means, so we need to think too about how to build in different forms of engagement. We need to make the access and the digital discussion a bit more equitable. In reality, all of this is going to push people who have digital connections and digital access forward, and we’re going to potentially lose a lot of the engagements from people that can’t access what is going on digitally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>My museum is running a social media campaign to encourage people to engage with us by creating their own content. What should we do with the copyright of the content that people are sharing with us?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Short answer</strong>: consider a CC license. Watch the Terms of Use of the platforms you are using. Consider changing the Terms of Use of your website for user generated content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: A lot of the content creation that institutions are engaging with at the moment will be really interesting types of engagement. There might be other things to consider aside from copyright — for example, a video shot from someone’s house might have privacy issues that we need to consider. But even the output, the video itself could attract copyright. And when we are thinking about copyright, the incentives for it, and the fact that an institution might not necessarily see those engagements as the type of assets that could be eventually commercialized, we can have discussions around how to manage that content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If we’re doing this type of videos, we might want to ask for permission to put a CC license to make this stuff reusable in the future. Do we do a CC BY, or a CC BY SA, or a CC BY NC? What would be then the different types of uses that could be put into place as we continue to remain at home and look for new ways to connect with each other? For example, educational videos being produced now might be eligible for being used under a limitation and exception, but those limitations and exceptions are always going to be jurisdictional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we might want to think then about licensing things a little bit more openly — because we have actually no intention to commercialize it in a way that we would normally think about for intellectual property that would be generated during this time. And there might be content that absolutely brings commercial value back to the institution. There’s going to be a lot of really interesting data that is produced over the next period of isolation in terms of what new parameters around copyright and suitability then get applied to reuse in a digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: A relatively easy solution for that is allowing for people to apply a CC license when they are uploading content to a platform, and that’s a common solution for that problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: And then, some of the content might not be as risky as we think, because when we are thinking about social media the terms and conditions are really broad contracts that would apply to the content that is being submitted. What is also interesting to think about it’s potentially user generated content, as institutions start working directly with users or inviting digital participation, thinking about what that might look like going forward. And how to design equitable practices around asking for a license instead of asking a user to assign certain rights or waive them in any content that they generate, like a non-exclusive license to the institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a lot of dark areas in cultural institutions websites, where you look at how they manage user generated content, and the language is constructed in very hard legalese terms, you grant “forever, in perpetuity, rights over any digital media now and forever known, you waive moral rights, the rights to be associated with the work, etc”. Work with your lawyers during this stage to design more equitable practices around this, and make the user generated content and public engagement aspect of rights management future proofed pursuing appropriate practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Is this the time to implement an Open Access Policy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Short answer</strong>: No. But you can start the conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: We should not rush to put a CC license to works or collections right now. First, because licenses<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-happens-if-the-author-decides-to-revoke-the-cc-license-to-material-i-am-using\"> are irrevocable</a>, so you shouldn’t rush that decision. There are also a lot of complicated rights issues involved most of the time inside collections. You just don’t want to slap a CC license on something without really thinking about it, particularly for these important collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: There is a lot of work that goes into preparing collections for open access, and it shouldn’t be underestimated. Doing open access well is a standard too high for anyone to think about now. You can’t just say: “you know what, let’s just take our collection and make it available online now!” We’ve got time, and we’ve got digital content. Probably incremental steps are as far as anyone should be aiming at the moment. Sharing information with others that are already doing it, starting the conversation, and networking and staying connected with people that are also going through these things are probably the most helpful things to do at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ariadna</strong>: It’s not the time to be opportunistic right now about open access. Those who have already embraced open access can still be present online and engage with their audiences, but it is important to remember that some institutions haven’t been able to do these digital transformations for several reasons, it can be for a lack of capacity, of resources, not necessarily for a lack of support for open policies. We can learn a lot from the Open GLAM movement and from those who are already doing open access, and understand that these policies already had a purpose, for a period like this one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I already have an Open Access policy and a digital engagement strategy, what’s up for me?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Short answer</strong>: collaborate by collecting data and generating metrics that help build the case for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: Right now it would be very fruitful to experiment in different ways with the content that you have as open access content, and keep track of metrics, and do documentation. It doesn’t have to be anything formal, but it would be good to have some case studies under our belts for when the dust settles, so we can point at them and say: “look what happened when we shared these works freely, and we had this great engagement from this number of people”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: There could also be interesting baby steps that can occur during this time. If previously everything in your collection was set up to be CC BY NC, and the rights assessment has been done already in your collection, then the institution can take the next step to go CC BY SA, or CC BY; so we could see some incremental changes, because some of the work has already been prepared. And then it would be interesting to see the change in metrics. For example, some institutions on Sketchfab have changed their 3D models licenses from a CC license to CC0 recently, so there could be a natural jump in reuse. Documenting and collecting metrics around that could be really important to making some of the arguments, either internally, or for other institutions if they have access to that data and case studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So what happens when the dust settles? What are your thoughts for the future?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ariadna</strong>: For fair use and fair dealing countries, there is going to be a lot around assessing where the grey areas of the law are, and assessing whether you want to champion them and test them. For a lot of countries with more specific exceptions and limitations it’s a good opportunity to test how far they go, and whether they allow us to bring forward all the projects that it would be interesting to develop in the digital world. Some of these limitations and exceptions are a lot more strict in the way in which they are written. But I think that it still would be interesting to keep on documenting the problems, especially now that there are copyright reforms going on in Europe. This is a good test for our laws, and to see whether they are fit for the digital age and the way we’re driving towards the reforms. It’s also important to look at what the scientific publishing sector is doing, and to see how some sectors are coming together to find a solution that is flexible for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sarah</strong>: Thinking in what this means for open access generally, down the road, to me it’s hard to imagine that this situation doesn’t have ripple effects. We are going to realize that, one, whatever we do online doesn’t ever replace being face to face, seeing something in person, and having a real human experience. We’re going to be feeling that very viscerally right now when we can’t have that. This speaks to the concerns that some institutions usually have, “what if digital destroys the market that I have for my physical space?” We’re going to have a lot of reassurance about that. We are also already seeing how these digital tools can be really meaningful ways to connect with one another, and create connections with creative works. This will have ripple effects and increase people’s willingness to share more broadly, whether is with CC licensing or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Andrea</strong>: Right now everyone is turning online, and trying to network, and trying to connect, and circulate the new things that people are doing. It will be an interesting space to watch so we start adjusting our expectations around copyright and if this forces some legal reform or new thinking around what these crossroads issues mean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Disclaimer: The content of this post does not constitute legal advice nor does it refer to any particular or specific situation.

        title: 'Open Access, paving the way to making Portugal''s museum collections available online'
        intro: 'To cater to working families the course will be held over two days 5th and 7th of May 9h30-12h30'
        body: "<p>This workshop aimed at Portuguese-speaking heritage professionals seeks to show how museums and heritage collections made available online in high resolution with open licenses benefit: the fields of education, research, the public generally and are a pre-requisite for the uploading of content to heritage portals such as Wikipedia and Europeana. Those who take part in the course will gain an understanding of how to use online platforms to make their collections available to all, along with developing knowledge on how to do so from a licensing standpoint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information and registration, please consult the <a href=\"http://acessocultura.org/acesso-aberto/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Portugese</strong>:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Acesso aberto: acesso universal às colecções dos museus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Este\_ curso de formação visa\_ mostrar como as colecções online e em alta-resolução de acesso aberto – isto é, objectos que se encontram no domínio público -, facilitam o ensino, estudo e investigação das colecções, para além de ser uma excelente ferramenta de promoção de um museu. O acesso aberto constitui ainda um pré-requisito para a inclusão de conteúdos nas plataformas Wikipédia e Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neste curso, apresentamos as ferramentas disponíveis e as boas praticas necessárias para que os museus possam disponibilizar as suas coleções online. Discutimos os resultados observados em museus que seguem uma política de acesso aberto. Falamos ainda sobre os objectos que se encontram fora do domínio público e que têm diversos estatutos em termos de propriedade intelectual, que devem ser identificados.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information and registration, please consult the <a href=\"http://acessocultura.org/acesso-aberto/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: 'Along with the tourism industry, cultural and creative sectors are among the most affected by the current coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis'
        body: "<p><strong>The current crisis is particularly critical for cultural and creative sectors due to the sudden and massive loss of revenue opportunities, especially for the more fragile players.</strong> Some actors benefit from public support (e.g. public museums, libraries, theatres) but may experience significant budget shortfalls. The sector includes major multinational companies with sustainable revenues (e.g. Netflix), but many small companies and freelance professionals essential for the sector could face bankruptcy. This crisis creates a structural threat to the survival of many firms and workers in cultural and creative production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Today, more than ever, the importance of culture and creativity for society is clear. </strong>The availability of cultural content contributes to mental health and well-being, and many cultural institutions have provided online and free content in recent weeks for that purpose. Sustainable business models during and after the initial crisis are imperative for the sector’s survival. Leaving behind the more fragile part of the sector could cause irreparable economic and social damage. The current challenge is to design public supports that alleviate the negative impacts in the short term and help identify new opportunities in the medium term for different public, private and non-profit actors engaged in cultural and creative production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join a series of discussions followed by targeted training for policy makers and practitioners:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17 April 2020, 15.00-16.30 CET</strong> - Coronavirus (COVID-19) and cultural and creative sectors: impact, policy responses and opportunities to rebound after the crisis, co-organised with the European Creative Business Network (ECBN) - participation open through registration</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please consult the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/cfe/leed/culture-webinars.htm#Museums\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n"

Speakers&nbsp;introduce the tool, discuss their own experience working with&nbsp;OpenRefine, answer questions and offer their support to colleagues interested in using the tool in their workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The webinar took place on the 20th of April 2020, between 13.00 - 14.00 CET.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Rob Davies, Cyprus Institute of Technology</li>\r\n    <li>Cosmina Berta, DDB</li>\r\n    <li>Tom Miles, Europeana Sounds</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>Questions from participants&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Is OpenRefine suitable for results of surveys? Is there a visualisation option on the data? (Tamara NBS)&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina’s answer at minute 47:42 in the recording</em>: You have the tabular format where you can browse, you can use the faceting that can be used for statistical purposes. I always try to export the data and look at the end result. You have various possibilities for&nbsp; looking at the data, so faceting (and under-facetting), clustering and exporting offer very nice opportunities to analyse it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Could you repeat how to export data in EDM? (Laura / Hispana)&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cosmina recaps how to export data in EDM at minute 49:00 in the recording.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Would&nbsp;your data partners be interested in using this tool at source, so that you already receive cleaned data? Or are your data partners using it? (Adina, Europeana Foundation)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cosmina answers at minute 52:00 in the recording:&nbsp;</em>Not really. Data providers offer data over OAI PMH and they program the interface for different formats and they will not change it for our (Europeana Aggregator) purposes. Others might be interested, if resources are available they might try. Museums use their own export tools for their own format. At German Digital Library we try to unify the data from various providers (in various formats) under a&nbsp; common format which is the DDB-EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom answers at minute 53:20</em>: I’m the main user of OpenRefine and use it regularly, and am able to look at the data, and have a conversation with the data provider and offer to&nbsp; change some values for them. Some data providers may not have the time or skills to do that themselves. It’s a powerful tool to see how something can be revised, if you are used to the faceting and cleaning functions what seems a laborious exercise becomes quite simple. I’d be happy to offer training on this to whoever needs it, as I think this is a very good aggregator tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">If more aggregators are interested in working with OpenRefine, would you, Cosmina and Tom, be happy providing support or what is your view of organising support for more people working with OpenRefine? (Henning, Europeana Foundation)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom answers at minute 59:12 in the recording</em>: I’d be happy to help, we could have an OpenRefine user group on Basecamp is maybe an option, where Cosmina and I would be able to assist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina answers at minute 1:00:10 in the recording</em>: A hands on webinar would also help, everyone bring a dataset to work on together during a webinar. We could use Basecamp to share the recipes, commands, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">How does it work to get another source, like a thesaurus, available for reconciling other than wikidata? (Lois Miller)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cosmina answers&nbsp;at minute 55:22 in the recording:&nbsp;</em>I use GND - the controlled vocabulary used by libraries in Germany, there’s a list of extensions available&nbsp; where you download openrefine from.&nbsp;<em>Cosmina shows practically how this works at minute 56:30 in the recording.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Do you need a training period to get familiar with the tool? (Rob, CUT)&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom answers at minute 1:02:00 in the recording</em>: It’s mostly crash and burn, bite the bullet, install it, click around and see what becomes out of it.&nbsp; There’s lots of information on github and the links we shared. But it would be good to have some sort of forum, to discuss together what the solution is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina answers at minute 1:03:53 in the recording</em>: Crash and burn, is indeed the way I learned it too. The biggest difficulty was exporting the data after cleaning and performing all the operations I needed, but after googling and reading forums I found what I was looking for. On stackoverflow they have a subgroup where they answer questions really quickly</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom adding to that at minute 1:05:12:</em> I had difficulties in exporting data in EDM, with Cosmina’s help, I was able to learn that.&nbsp; At Europeana Sounds we use MINT as a mapping tool but Open refine could do everything for you, be used from scratch,&nbsp; or to cover some gaps that are in the mapping tool that you are using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina adding at minute 1:06:23 in the recording:</em> Exactly. We haven't talked about the disadvantage of Open Refine, as it has its limits. The biggest set that I was able to handle in OpenRefine was of 150.000 records, over 1mil lines, and the tool gets very slow. What helped was spilling the sets in subsets</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom adding at minute 1:07:15:</em> Other thing you can do is allocate more memory&nbsp; - here’s how you can allocate more RAM to OpenRefine on your computer: <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ-Allocate-More-Memory\">https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ-Allocate-More-Memory</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Why Open Refine? Do you know other tools out there that can do similar things? (Rob, CUT)&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina answers at&nbsp; minute 1:09:06 in the recording</em>: Other than MInt,I’m not aware of other tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tom answers&nbsp;at&nbsp;minute 1:09:13 in the recording:</em> It’s more what people would be more comfortable using, like&nbsp; Python, or other programming languages. Until now, I was using google sheets, excel and Mint. For me the real&nbsp; benefit of Open refine is that it allows you to have an overview, gives a break down of values.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina adding at minute 1:10:50 in the recording</em>: This answers Tamara’s question, because the statistical overview on facets, it is actually what you would like to see. In my experience, smaller sets are messier than big sets than the ones that are automatically generated. From the smaller institutions we get messy data, sometimes in xsl or word tables and it is very difficult to put that in a structured format, and here OpenRefine helps a lot.</p>\r\n"

On stackoverflow they have a subgroup where they answer questions really quickly</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom adding to that at minute 1:05:12:</em> I had difficulties in exporting data in EDM, with Cosmina’s help, I was able to learn that.&nbsp; At Europeana Sounds we use MINT as a mapping tool but Open refine could do everything for you, be used from scratch,&nbsp; or to cover some gaps that are in the mapping tool that you are using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina adding at minute 1:06:23 in the recording:</em> Exactly. We haven't talked about the disadvantage of Open Refine, as it has its limits. The biggest set that I was able to handle in OpenRefine was of 150.000 records, over 1mil lines, and the tool gets very slow. What helped was spilling the sets in subsets</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tom adding at minute 1:07:15:</em> Other thing you can do is allocate more memory&nbsp; - here’s how you can allocate more RAM to OpenRefine on your computer: <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ-Allocate-More-Memory\">https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/FAQ-Allocate-More-Memory</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f2fe1668-7fff-f3f6-5c2e-6ed7841305b8\">Why Open Refine? Do you know other tools out there that can do similar things? (Rob, CUT)&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina answers at&nbsp; minute 1:09:06 in the recording</em>: Other than MInt,I’m not aware of other tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tom answers&nbsp;at&nbsp;minute 1:09:13 in the recording:</em> It’s more what people would be more comfortable using, like&nbsp; Python, or other programming languages. Until now, I was using google sheets, excel and Mint. For me the real&nbsp; benefit of Open refine is that it allows you to have an overview, gives a break down of values.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Cosmina adding at minute 1:10:50 in the recording</em>: This answers Tamara’s question, because the statistical overview on facets, it is actually what you would like to see. In my experience, smaller sets are messier than big sets than the ones that are automatically generated. From the smaller institutions we get messy data, sometimes in xsl or word tables and it is very difficult to put that in a structured format, and here OpenRefine helps a lot.</p>\r\n"

Each country in Europe has different copyright laws and the heritage was digitized in different ways, but luckily the records on our site have licensing information, so we know exactly what can be used and how. For social media platforms, we have a four page document and according to this document, what we share on social media is content that is freely re-usable, which means public domain, CC0, CC BY and CC BY SA. Therefore content which is marked with a non-commercial license cannot be shared on social platforms. For content with a ‘no reuse statement’, we seek individual permission. But because it is hard to manage individual permissions, we try to stick to the open content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: The Getty has a pretty robust social media program, that includes the Getty Museum, the Conservation Institute, the Research Institute and the Getty Foundation. Everyone has their own different social media account, and some of the programs have multiple ones on different platforms. It’s definitely a designated job function: only certain staff are allowed to manage those social media accounts. Our social media policy is really just focused on keeping personal and professional activities separate, on one hand, and then just guidelines about content, tone, and following copyright. On our social media we are not just posting content from the collections, but when we are sharing collections’ material, if they are in copyright, we do it only if we have a license, or if we have a good fair use case. Otherwise it’s a lot of public domain material. And also as a private foundation, content-wise, we have to steer clear of certain political and lobbying activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: A lot of that for Newfields is very similar in our efforts. Any of our posting to social media it’s broadly governed by our intellectual property and social media policies. We only have certain staff within our marketing and communications team who are authorized to develop the content for our different social media channels, and we have guidelines as far as creating any new accounts and what that looks like for the branding and the Newfields voice. Of course this includes following all copyright laws and licensing in many occasions, or looking into where we already have broad, non-exclusive licensing agreements with different artists and works in our collection. We also work on seeing where we do have the opportunity to do a fair use utilization. Otherwise we are looking at maintaining our relationships, either with donors, or artists, or their estates, and often looking and seeking permissions. That can make a difference as well. When we look at that we ask ourselves: are these just regular posts at a social media account, or is it a post that it’s gonna be a paid post and promotional that is going to get more use than regular postings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you operate these principles in practice, for example giving attribution on social media?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: Attribution can take up valuable character space, but if it’s a post where we are going to rely somewhat on fair use, including that attribution is another way that helps strengthen our case. With my team we are pushing on what are shortened captions and credit lines that we can include, and where we are pulling things out, like dates or materials, that can make credit lines longer. Some credit lines can be like three miles long, so you need to work with them to know where there can be the main tags and then the subsequent credit lines follow. Twitter tends to be the hardest in that; it’s a lot of working with reply tweets, and creating chain responses. Our social media and marketing team have become very good at including that information. If we are working with a license having that information is a requirement. If we are going for fair use, the credit line helps support that. We also have some cases where we are a little more risk-averse and we make sure that we seek a license and have approval before posting, for example if we want to show the “behind the scenes” of an installation of some artworks, where we need to be respectful of the desires of the artists or their estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: For us it’s similar. Twitter can be quite tricky. We usually either post images where we just try to give as much attribution as possible, and then a link. If it’s an editorial piece that is being published, then we make sure that within the body of this editorial we have all the credit information included, and then we just use a short link to link people to it. What I wanted to share and that I find interesting is Instagram. Due to this link issue, we were quite late to the game actually with Instagram. The content that we share is not ours; we only give access to the content from other institutions across Europe, so we were very careful around only sharing public domain, CC0 content, and then tagging the institutions that were very active on Instagram. Now, with Instagram, we have this linking bio as a landing page, so when you click there, you can actually find back the post that we posted on Instagram, and then just scroll down and from there you can click through and find every record page. This was our way to be active on Instagram and to provide the information according to our standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: I would echo a lot of what Anne said, but it is a challenge because space is limited. I’m comfortable if the information is one click-away. Most of our posts highlight something that we are doing; it’s either a show, a press release, an object page. We are trying to push traffic to come back to our website, where all the information will be. If it’s public domain it doesn’t matter; if there is a license, that might have more requirements, including attribution, we’ll try to work some version of that into the post itself. I think we finally moved away from wanting to actually embed the image in the photo itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Annelisa Stephen</strong> (Assistant Director for Digital Content Strategy, Getty Trust): It’s interesting hearing people using Twitter threads and putting captions in an additional tweet. Traditionally in the past, as Mikka said, we extended the image canvas and we added the required lender or credit line, but that it’s a bit awkward, visually, and it also alters the image slightly, so it’s not a great solution. We came up with a new solution when we redesigned some pages on our website: to avoid captions, we have the metadata embedded in the image and it’s one click away from the actual full caption. We haven’t yet implemented that fully on social.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the workflow for social media in your institution? Do you review social media posts that include artworks before they go live (Question from the public).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: Not necessarily every single one. We’ve done a lot of recurrent training with our marketing and communications team, and we have put a lot of work into developing our social media policy. We have a pretty good amount of trust in our team, in what they are drafting and putting out. Usually if they are embarking on a broad new campaign that really deviates in some way from anything that we’ve done in the past, they will usually reach out just to double check that it’s in accordance with standard procedure. A lot of that tends to be around a campaign for an exhibition, or we are highlighting things around our collections, or certain installation or certain programming, so we have already been part of some early discussions and plans; for an exhibition we already have a pre-approved set of imagery that we can utilize and that was done months before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: Only designated people are allowed to manage those accounts and I trust them. There is ongoing training, and I feel comfortable that people generally know the rules. If there are questions they do bring them to me, but I’m comfortable that we have good controls and systems in place around what gets posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: From the point of view of the person posting, I have freedom to decide. I don’t check the guidelines on a daily basis, because otherwise it would be just impossible. Our team is responsible for creating tutorials and blog posts and we always try to have an image that is open, that we know that we can pick up on social media without major searching. This is something that helps a lot. Sometimes there are pieces of content that change their license, and I’m not aware of the change, so I have to go back and look because there’s something wrong there. In general, not on a daily basis, but if there’s something wrong we have to keep informed and control our more tricky cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What considerations do you have before posting content to social media in relation with its terms of use?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mikka: You should read them. Read the terms of use. They are different for every platform, but generally speaking, the platform will assume that the poster owns the copyright or controls what they are posting. The platform won’t claim ownership of it, but it will say that by posting, you are giving a sort of guarantee that you have permission to post it, that you control the content, and all of the necessary rights, not just copyright, but also rights of privacy and publicity, or rights of trademark, music if it’s a video. Basically you are taking full responsibility for having all of that and being able to give the platform that license to display it, and share it, and do whatever they are going to do with it within the functionality of the platform. For us, that’s a very broad license, and that means that you can’t necessarily post a lot of things that you don’t have permission for, so it’s very restrictive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do the Creative Commons licenses and the Terms of Service interact? For example, if you have a content marked as CC NC, can you share it on social media? (Question from the public)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: To the extent that the platform is commercial, and by the terms of service says you are giving the platform the license to use it for their own marketing purposes, or commercial purposes, that wouldn’t be within the spirit of the NC license. When you use something with a CC BY NC license, the requirements are basically that you give attribution, which is possible on platforms, but also you only use it for non commercial purposes. You can debate the extent to which is commercial, what’s commercial, because the license doesn’t define it, but there’s room for interpretation. The conservative approach would be that hosting in a social media site, if not itself a commercial act, would be granting a license to others to use it for commercial purposes, and that would not be consistent with the license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: An example of this kind of commercial use would be, for example, you put the post, and the commercial platform is using the reaction of their users to build their profiles and they might be sold. You might be doing it in goodwill, but still in the end, there’s someone making profit, and according to the license, you have no right to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sarah Pearson (Legal Counsel, Creative Commons)</strong>: I can jump in. Several years ago, Creative Commons spent quite a bit of time doing analysis of terms of service on different platforms on this issue. I read many different, more terms of services that I’d like to admit. We spoke with the legal counsel at Twitter and other platforms, but I will note that we never spoke to an in-house counsel that had that very literal and strict interpretation of the Terms of Service. Almost every set of terms requires that you either own the copyright or have the right to use it, and we found that generally speaking, no one came out saying that you wouldn’t be able to upload CC licensed content that you don’t own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Non Commercial interpretation is interesting to me as well. I think that to the extent that there is any issue, it’s an issue for the platform. If anyone is commercializing there it is the platform, and I think it would be really hard to find that the uploader is somehow on the hook for the platform’s commercialization of that content. It’s a really literal interpretation of the terms of service and it seems that it would be a very tough argument to make. From Creative Commons perspective, we tend to think about it as, you either own the copyright, or you have the right to use it under a CC license. CC licenses don’t allow sub-licensing, so it’s not that the uploader is granting a license to the platform, the platform is just arguably using it under the licenses, and to the extent that it’s a problem with Non Commercial, I think it would be a problem for the platform itself. But I also understand that you could interpret that the uploader will be on the hook for it. But I’ve never heard that argument being made by the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What directives have you given to your marketing team around what can and what cannot be used in social media? At my institution there’s no way for marketing and communications to know which objects have copyright restrictions, and they also don’t have access to the image assets. How do you deal with this obstacle, especially if you don’t have a DAMS? (Question from the public)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: We have a DAMS that does have rights metadata in it, and a certain amount of rights metadata has to be associated with the object before it can be put into the DAMS. Annelisa can explain this further. Everyone has access to it, when they need it. I don’t know for sure that all of the content that we post to our website comes out of the DAMS, some of it might come from other places, but in theory that’s the goal. And I give trainings on how to read the information from the DAMS and how to figure out what’s appropriate. People posting to social media need to have information on rights status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Annelisa</strong>: On the workflow side, on the social media side, we’re really lucky to have this really well implemented DAMS, that has support from the IT side, but also even more importantly, support from a Rights and Reproduction person. That’s particularly true with the Getty Museum Rights Manager, Cherie Chen, who is extremely detail-oriented and puts in extensive information about everything: if it’s restricted, if it’s restricted from download, and she tries to unlock the asset on a one-on-one basis. There are also different fields for rights, like Mikka says, and she trains us to read that and understand it. For exhibitions we also have a folder system in the DAMS. There’s a folder with all the approved images for posts and website, and there’s a subfolder with a subset of these images that’s also approved for social.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often images are approved for the web or for distribution to the media, but it’s not approved for our own social platforms, which is frustrating. Communications and the Rights Manager work a ton together to create that folder, which is completely indispensable for us, so we can know which things are approved. We also get involved in drawing requests when rights are going to be requested. There are all requested as a package. Some media that we think will work well on social media, can often be different from things like the ones that the media relations team will prefer to distribute. There’s a lot of people and effort involved in making that system work, and there is always every possible weird restriction under the sun in some contracts in terms of what you are allowed or not to do. You have to strike a balance between completeness in the record and what actually someone has time to do on the rights side to keep things going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: We also have a DAMS where we have rights metadata. My department works on adding that information, and gives trainings so the rest of the staff can understand how to interpret that and read it. Our marketing &amp; communications team has access to the DAMS, so they can get to what they need. Prior to implementing that, it was a lot more hands-on. There is a lot of work that goes into that rights research and management and sharing that information, but you also need to acknowledge that there can be other things aside from just copyright that we need to consider in any given image. Perhaps when the work was acquired, are there contractual restrictions to a use that need to be considered, or there could be issues of privacy and publicity that might come up that we also need to layer in the back. That is harder to communicate and have all that input in the DAMS. With special exhibitions we avoid inputting that additional content into our DAMS, because it’s not ours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are licenses that need to be brought into consideration for a specific use for an exhibition or a program, so we have a pretty extensive folder structure that we have put together utilizing OneDrive. In those folders we have those image files, and then also corresponding documents that include the caption, credit information, if there’s any restriction, how it can be used, how it can’t be used. All that is clearly packaged, so they can take it and run with it. Even with a DAMS, it’s still a lot to communicate and there are always things that are not there, and you need to remind people of that in training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: For us it’s more straightforward, since we are aggregating data. If it’s on the website, it should be okay to use for my team, and to put it on social media. There is a team called Data Partner Services that makes sure that all the content incoming is good quality, correctly licensed, and compliant with our publishing framework. So for us to post on social media, we actually use the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do the new digital engagement strategies that museums are experimenting with [during the COVID pandemic] mean for the legal department, and for the social media guidelines that you have in general? How do these new strategies push the conversation on fair use and reuse?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: At the Getty, there has not been really yet any kind of dramatic shift or anything that has changed legally in terms of our approach or on our perception of our relationship with the platforms. Maybe on the margins there have been some cases where I’m taking more expansive views on fair use. From a legal standpoint I haven’t seen a lot of shift. It’s much more on the content side and the strategy side. In which new ways we can engage the audience and what are the things that maybe didn’t work so well in the past that are working better now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Getty Museum challenge of “take three household objects and recreate a work of art” wouldn’t have worked pre-COVID. Pre-COVID, that team would have been “that doesn’t work, challenges are never a good idea, they always kind of fall flat”. Now everyone is trapped at home, so it did take off in a way that we didn’t expect. We also think that people will start to burn out on screens so we may see a drop-off in the use of social media as a way to engage. People are pushing a lot of content. A lot of it is great, but it’s just a lot. But legally we haven’t really changed our approach. Others might have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: We haven’t really changed our approach too much either at Newfields. From the legal side, copyright law hasn’t changed, or the practices and requirements around that. We still need to function within those frameworks, and really falling back and relying on the policies and procedures that we already have in place. There has been a huge push on the content side: what else can we get on our main website, and promote on social media, and push people back to the website, and different engagement strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The additional work for Rights &amp; Reproductions has been to review what content do we have that is digitally based that perhaps was already created, but when it was created it was initially created for in-gallery use only? And how can we repurpose that? How can we get that on social media? How can we get that on our website? And we need to review all of that again, including some media that we were going to be using under a fair use assessment. It’s not so much that any of the process or legal requirements have changed. It has changed on the content side, and then seeing what that meant for an increase in some different workloads, and having to revisit some work for different allocations and users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: We didn’t change anything, but all of what we do all of a sudden become very relevant and very important, and we are trying to be an example on how to do things online for the institutions in Europe. So we produce more content maybe these days, we do more webinars, but workflows remain the same and we of course try to do some stuff around relevant topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is probably also the biggest challenge in educating your users in how to actually use the content, so do you have any guidelines or strategies on how users can reuse the content that you are sharing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: Some of these strategies we have been doing for a long time now. For us, for example, we did the GIF IT UP! contest way before this crisis. What I would like to say about that which is interesting is that not always the audience will understand immediately. In the GIF IT UP! contest, a GIF making contest we organize every year in October together with DPLA, Digital NZ and Trove, we ask people to make GIFs from openly licensed content. There are always some submissions coming that are not openly licensed, but our choice is to try to educate people. Everyone who sends a submission which is mainly correct but has the wrong license, will receive an email, explaining what happened, why, and they are invited either to re-do the GIF with openly licensed content, or to seek permission. So, I think this should be also an element to think about when you do activities that actually seek engagement. Will you reject something that is incorrect if you have a contest or a challenge? How will you deal with that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: At the Getty we started our open content program back in 2013, before I joined the Getty. My predecessor in the Legal Counsel’s role decided to create a custom set of terms of use, and put a lot of content on the website about Open Content, and what you could do with it, basically anything you want, and we definitely have tried to be as clear as possible with that. Over time, I think that it has become clear it is still not as findable as we would like. We are looking to transition over using a CC0 to make it more findable. We are not there yet, but we are getting there. In the intervening seven years, CC licenses have become a lot more common currency, people understand them better, although there’s still training to do around that. But I think the more we can use sort of a single set of nationally legible machine-readable terms, that’s probably going to help our users, and we’re planning to do that in combination with the Rights Statements. It is a challenge to clearly and concisely communicate something, especially if you are a copyright geek like me, because there is a lot of nuance, and knowing that a lot of people actually don’t read the fine print on these things, especially if there are other rights implicated not covered by the license, like privacy rights or publicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens with other rights that are not copyright in these social media strategies and engagements, for example privacy? How do you deal with those?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: With the Getty Museum Challenge people were posting that stuff themselves. We don’t know necessarily that everyone who is in one of those are actually themselves, they might be posting things of other people, but it goes back to those terms of service. When the users are posting to the platform, they are taking responsibility for saying that they got the permissions, and simply by posting it, assuming that you are posting a picture of yourself, if your profile is public, you are publishing it, and sort of really obviating privacy concerns, at least for yourself, assuming that everyone else knows that they are in the picture, and that they are ok with it being shared like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, we actually went above and beyond by seeking permission whenever we wanted to feature one of those tweets, making sure those users where okay with this, featuring it, promoting it, even though you could take the position that they sort of consented to all of that just impliedly by just participating in your challenge and by using your hashtag. So we want to be respectful. Sometimes you go and ask for permission even when legally you might not need it, in some cases just to maintain a good relationship with your stakeholders. But I didn’t have any privacy concerns around that, and I feel very comfortable again that our team was handling our followers and the participants really respectfully. And when we promoted it, we steered people towards our own open content, like that was what we were hoping people would use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted people to engage with our collection, and we were pushing them to use the things that were not restricted by copyright. Of course, a lot of people ended up doing stuff like taking stuff from other museums, or maybe public domain from other museums that wasn’t necessarily open content, or the museums hadn’t made it open, or maybe they were riffing on copyrighted content. That’s between them and the platform, but certainly we would never want to push our users to infringe anyone’s copyright and we really wanted people to engage with our open content. But we are careful to do that, whenever we are creating these tools, to really try to make sure people understand. They do need to be mindful of the copyright status of the things they are posting online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Any last comments?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mikka</strong>: I just want to say that there’s a lot of talk in the air around what does the pandemic mean for copyright, and should we be making more exceptions, and you might have following this sort of thing about the Internet Archive and the National Emergency Library, and the sort of back and forth between publishers and Internet Archive, and I also remember there was a question that arose in the last call you did about online exhibitions that maybe could be done now. I just want to caution, even though I’m an open access proponent, I definitely feel that it’s important to be measured about all this, and think about what it is exactly about our changed situation that might merit pushing boundaries of copyright? It’s not just that we are home, it’s not just that works are in another place, because that’s always been true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll have a stronger case for pushing the boundaries if it’s really truly tied to the facts, and this sort of unusual situation that we’re in right now. I don’t think that responding to the crisis necessarily means that “all bets are off, do what you want for this limited period of time”. I don’t think that’s quite the right approach. This is my personal opinion. So I would caution people to just think really carefully about what is it about the project they want to do that is made harder or impossible by our current situation, and not just the usual stuff, like putting stuff online is hard, copyright is hard, getting permissions is hard: that’s always been true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Anne</strong>: Definitely, I second that. That it’s absolutely true, and while we are in this situation, and at the end of the day, while there might be pushing some boundaries we still need to proceed cautiously because the laws itself haven’t changed, so we still need to make those risk assessments and look cautiously into everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aleksandra</strong>: I think this is a good moment to just think about our digital approaches, not necessarily to do all things online, just kind of realise how many opportunities there are. I guess that in the future, of course, museums will re-open, and everyone will love going there, but maybe the next step will be something that merges everything we learned about these engagements, and what people are actually able to do and want to do if they have time and good content, with physical visits. So I think that actually figuring out digital strategies is a good activity for this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Disclaimer: The content of this post does not constitute legal advice nor does it refer to any particular or specific situation.

        body: "<p>Kicking off on International Museums Day, May 18, and continuing June 1-4, the AAM Virtual Annual Meeting &amp; MuseumExpo (#AAMvirtual) will bring you networking opportunities, inspiring programming, and the MuseumExpo to a new virtual experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our new format comes a new theme and programming adjusted to reflect the current global crisis. It’s clear that how we choose to move through the impacts of the pandemic will determine the future of our museums for years to come. Therefore, we’re excited to announce the theme of #AAMvirtual, Radical Reimagining. Envisioning a new future requires us to ask what decisions we can make that will not only help us overcome the immediate threat, but help us to rebuild a more sustainable, inclusive, and powerful museum field. This is our opportunity to work together, break from the past, and reimagine the field anew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AAMvirtual will include keynote speakers, over 30 breakout sessions, a virtual exhibit hall, and online networking events to connect with museum professionals from around the globe. Registrants will have access to transcribed recordings of the full program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the event, please consult the <a href=\"https://annualmeeting.aam-us.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

In June 2020, Europeana is offering\_a special series of online workshops to support strategic planning and capacity building for the sector,\_facilitated by noted digital cultural strategists <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-peter-edson-6582291/\">Michael Peter Edson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspervisser1982/\">Jasper Visser</a></p>\r\n"

The insights they provide will help us develop frameworks to address these needs, and we will be sharing the process and outcomes widely to benefit all. There will be further opportunities to contribute and collaborate as we continue on this journey, so please continue to check Europeana Pro news to hear more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to take part</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops are open to thought leaders and innovators who work in the GLAM sector and GLAM organisations.

Exploring digital Art History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rLL_8FSiYo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stuart Dunn is Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College, London and Principal Investigator of the Ancient Itineraries project, which examined ways in which ways of digital thinking can be brought to bear on the field of art history. Drawing on these discussions, this talk briefly presents and critique the use of graph visualisation as a means to represent individual objects. This ‘flips’ the conventional approach to network analysis for art objects, which represents collections of objects as networks. By equating individual artworks with individual networks, we can deconstruct, and thus move to overcome, the reductive and quantitative barriers that some have identified to using digital methods for art history. This talk took place on 10 June 2021.</p>\r\n"

This is what we often hear but is this really the case? What challenges are we facing as researchers in today’s online search systems and why? How do we know that we are finding all relevant information important for our research? This talk explores some of these questions. It took place on 11 June 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Koraljka Golub is Professor of Library and Information Science, Head of the <a href=\"https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/iinstitute/\">iInstitute </a>and co-leader of the <a href=\"https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/digital-humanities/\">Digital Humanities Initiative</a> at the Linnaeus university. She is a lecturer and a researcher in the field of digital libraries and information retrieval, particularly on topics related to integrating existing knowledge organisation systems with social tagging and/or automated subject indexing, and evaluating resulting end-user information retrieval.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregators deal with a mass of heterogeneous data coming from multiple cultural heritage institutions. In the process of cleaning, harmonising, enriching and organising data, they follow different strategies. How this data is handled by each institution, plays a decisive role on the (multilingual) search and discovery functions they can offer to their users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This webinar explores&nbsp;the methodology followed by the Greek National Aggregator <a href=\"https://www.searchculture.gr/aggregator/portal/?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">SearchCulture.gr</a> for its data enrichment processes, as well as sharing the advantages and disadvantages of the approach and lessons learned along the way. Participants in the webinar&nbsp;also compare and discuss other different enrichment strategies and gather input which will inform future strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This webinar took place on the 23 June 2020 11.00 - 12.00 CEST.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Haris Georgiadis,&nbsp;SearchCulture.gr Technical Lead (Head of e-Services Department, <a href=\"http://www.ekt.gr/en\" target=\"_blank\">National Documentation Center</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Agathi Papanoti, Data Ingestion Specialist (National Documentation Center)&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Resources</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The slides of the webinar can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Webinars/ECC_EKT_Webinar_Enrichment.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Questions from participants&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you treat the source metadata schema? Do you ask the content provider/curator to put the relevant keywords and information in dc:type? And then he/she operates the tool?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of our providers documented their content in DC (oai_dc, ese, edm) via OAI-PMH. For those that don’t use a specific schema we perform an initial metadata mapping to the EDM elements before the aggregation (our infrastructure supports web crawling and scraping from website pages and thus allows us to do that). The enrichment tool is operated by the EKT curator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you want to enrich Place and Actors (persons or organisation)? If not why not? If ‘yes’ how would you do it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Place and Agent enrichments are our iminent developments. We aim to enrich spatial metadata with Geonames or Wikidata. We will also conduct enrichments based on dc:creator, dc:contributor and dc:subject using an extensive file of agents (historical figures, actors, politicians etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you foresee a future where machine learning can be used to automate the manual mappings even further. If so, do you have projects or R&amp;D planned in this area? Who else is working in this area?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could use machine learning techniques in the future in combination with the rest of our methodology, however:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>The large variety of subjects and material</li>\r\n    <li>The large number of subjects in our two subject vocabularies (app. 2000)</li>\r\n    <li>Poor original documentation</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>will hinder machine learning (it will be difficult to feed with enough corpus data for each voc subject).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you allow providers to review and possibly approve your enrichments?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far this has not happened. The EKT enrichments are being presented in distinct fields and the original metadata is not altered. However we are open to providers’ suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When you link a historical period to specific dates, how do you deal with the issue that maybe a period is applied to different regions at different chronologies? Examples: Bronze Agein the Aegean, Ottoman period in Crete.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some periods have a strict local scope (e.g. minoan, cycladic and helladic periods) and as a result their year ranges tend to overlap. We call those periods relative. The rest of the periods cover the entirety of Hellenic territory and are less debatable with respect to their timespans. We call those absolute. In our vocabulary, absolute periods have neither overlaps nor gaps when they have the same parent and relative periods have at least one absolute ancestor. When the provider has set a “relative” time period for their content we follow their lead. When we can’t be sure about the locality we assign the corresponding “absolute” period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does your system include skope notes that explain the use of the terms in EKT vocabularies?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far we have not added skope notes in our vocabularies. However most of the terms in our “type” vocabulary have bilingual skos:definition fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

What projects and in what way have you been involved in projects around rights clearance, from either a research perspective or a practitioners perspective?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>I work at the British Film Institute and the projects and things that I’ve been involved with over the years focused around the archive digitization project. We started in 2012 with something that was called “Unlocking Film Heritage”. It was a five-year project to digitize 10,000 films from our collection and the collections of the national and regional archives of the UK. These were films dating from around 1895 up to around 2012 as the most recent. They were digitized and put into our digital preservation infrastructure at the BFI National Archive, and then published on our video on-demand platform, BFI player, which is available in the UK and Ireland. It is accessible through a searchable map, so all these films were pinned to locations where they are filmed in the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My work for that project was devising the overarching approach to how we would tackle copyright research, rights research, negotiations and some risk management. Also how we dealt with orphan works, seeing as they came midway through that project. Currently we’re now working on a much larger project to digitize our videotape collections. There’s about a hundred thousand videotapes from our collection and those of the regional and national Archives. A lot of it is television, so it’s more complicated from the rights point of view. Our main access ambition for that is to make available as many as possible, we don’t really know how many. We want to make them available on a new service we’re developing for UK public libraries. That’s the work I’m involved in at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Victoria: </b>I’ve been involved in rights more from the research side of things. My PhD is with the digitization of archive collections in the UK and how copyright law affects that, so I talked to a lot of our cultural heritage institutions like the British Library, Glasgow School of Art and the British Film Institute. And also through some other projects that I have been involved in, we looked at some approaches taken by institutions in the Netherlands, for example, Stadsarchief Rotterdam, and also the National Library of the Netherlands. I don’t do a huge amount of rights clearance myself, I’m interested in how other people do rights clearance, and particularly how they manage their risks and how they are making archival material available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>Victoria, now I can’t wait to read your dissertation. So to understand how I approach rights statements and rights clearance you have to understand that I have worked in this field for twenty or thirty years, and where I am right now is the result of great frustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So how do I approach these things? Basically I always start with: “what is the material?, how did we get it?, what are the conditions associated with it?, do we know anything about it?”, and much of the time is “meh”. You know a little or something, you know what’s on the surface, but even as a lawyer immersed in libraries, archives and museums, it’s still really important to work with subject matter specialists, whether they’re cataloger or metadata specialists, people who know about the material and how it got where it is as best as we can put it together. I’m a big fan of record-keeping, which I guess it’s appropriate with our field explaining what the logic is of how we’re approaching something. I also have a career history, and I occasionally hear from people who come across a file I put together 25 years ago and it’s actually helpful to them for whatever preservation project they’re doing or what they’re trying to do anew. It is worth the time to invest in record-keeping and having it in human language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While I’m a lawyer, and there’s a set of terms of art and language, I’m really interested in these as records to the file, so that normal people, “the future me” as I call it, can understand what we were thinking when we made a statement, especially if the law changes or there need to be adjustments or maybe there are more liberal approaches. So what I do is very immersed in my interest and love and knowledge of the institutions themselves and the people that work in them and their expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The framework varies by organization and by project. There’s a lot more work to be made across our fields, to be more interoperable, to have more consistent standards, but that is still an ongoing struggle, and I started to understand this very early in my career. There was a project that I think ICOM did to standardize the ways damage was described for couriers, for example, a crack or a cut. And even something that seems as simple as a crack was not an easy thing to define or discuss in those contexts, and that was important for insurance purposes, if you were lending exhibits and moving things around. So that difference in language, even within the same language, is complicated and also exciting. So whether you keep your information in a spreadsheet, whatever system it is that you use, on that front I’m a little bit more agnostic about, and I tend to work with whatever the expertise in the organization might be. I could go on but I’ll stop there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">How do you define a framework, or do you base your approach in a standardised framework that you define or someone else defines?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Victoria: T</b>he projects I looked at, some were quite early digitization projects, they were taking place in the ’90s, early ’00s, and the archivists involved really didn’t have any other examples of large-scale rights clearance that they could follow. They were starting from scratch in terms of developing a framework. A lot of those frameworks by their nature are internal documents or internal procedures. And what I’ve noticed is that a lot of the projects that have come after that have been either like reinventing the wheel or also starting from scratch. In the last couple of years as more information and more resources are being made available, more people are publishing their frameworks. That’s really useful for all of the other institutions that maybe don’t have the same resources to tackle rights clearance as other institutions. One of the ones that I’ve seen that’s been used fairly widely is the Wellcome Library’s approach to rights clearance. I’ve also seen recently that the National Library of Scotland have published their risk management framework for rights clearance, as well as obviously Melissa’s work with the Hathitrust, looking at copyright as a design problem, which I think Melissa you’re gonna talk about a bit later on, and the work that Annie has done at the BFI. I think as more of that information percolates out to the cultural heritage sector, archivists, curators, everyone, will be a bit more confident in approaching and developing their own frameworks that are appropriate for their own institutional context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>The Wellcome Trust work on the “Codebreakers” and the report you did Victoria with Christy Henshaw from Wellcome was really influential and important for when we started working on Unlocking Film Heritage project. I was scouring to see if there was any information out there that was going to help me. It was the first time we took this proactive approach to actually formulate a framework internally about how we were going to manage this, and lots of things came up to the surface really early on. For example, key things like the discrepancy across the organization about how people understood some fundamentals of copyright; ownership; authorship; duration; duration for film in the UK is particularly mind-boggling, and there were so many different rules that somebody had picked up from somewhere, lots of anecdotal basis for saying why something was in copyright or out of copyright. That was also the first time we really started to build a proper framework for establishing risk, and that’s an ever-evolving thing as well. We’re constantly adding to it, what things you need to consider, how you might judge something as being a high risk or low risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It still feels like I’m a newbie in many ways. It has been now eight years almost, but for each project you do, you have to look at it sometimes afresh. Because obviously you might be looking at very particular kinds of material, and also what your end use is going to be, will also determine quite a lot in terms of that risk of whether you’re going for relatively low risk uses around non-commercial public access, or whether you’re hoping to commercialize things as well. Also if you have touch points with colleagues in other departments along that workflow, and how you’re trying to fit in your rights workflow with the technical work, the curatorial work, the end product publication work. There’s all those things to make sure you’re doing the right bit of work at the right time, as far as possible, to make sure that everything’s running smoothly as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>Again, I would completely validate everything that Victoria and Annabelle just said. A couple of things. Victoria mentioned that feeling of “reinventing the wheel” about processes. Partly in her context I think she was referring to something like a lack of transparency early on in these projects. It’s hard to say, but that may be due to, just like professional practice, or people were thinking that the internet was as big as it might be. It was different, I mean. I started in this area around 1995, and at that time the Library of Congress, where I was working, wasn’t sure whether to go with laser discs and CD-ROM copies of the collections, or provide access through the Internet, because this was just the cusp of when the web existed. So you still had to have to dial up and dial up didn’t work very well and it wasn’t very widespread. So technology shifts our social assumptions about what’s possible, what’s necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I do share, I have a certain frustration with the amount of new material that I see coming out that’s not really new, that’s maybe not very informed by past knowledge. I think we spend more time on certain things that we maybe don’t need to worry about quite as much, or that there’s somebody’s already stepped through that before so you could get to the next thing. One of the tools that we have at the University of Michigan Library, on our website, is a Digital Project Proposal Process, or DPP. It’s actually fairly simple in terms of what it asks. It tries to gather a certain range of information from a curator, an archivist, an historian, or a librarian, or to whoever is proposing a collection. Most of it is not legal information per se, and the process gives a framework for decision making about what is possible, what’s not possible, how to make priorities within an organization. I’m sure there are many tools like that that are available, but I would encourage, even if you take any one of them and tailor it to your own administrative framework, you get consistent results and consistent record-keeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I did have a question for Annabelle. You mentioned that some of the projects that you were dealing with are only available in the UK and Ireland, and they sound amazing. I’d love to see them. We have questions like that, there are times where we have things that are in the public domain in the US but they’re not abroad, or we have rights reversions issues. We do have users who express some frustration. One of the things I would love to see is a larger library exceptions for access more broadly, among our collections globally, even if it were limited to us qualified institutions, meaning that you had to go to the library, COVID aside. I’m just curious about that access piece, if you can explain it more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>There are decisions that are not necessarily copyright, but definitely copyright plays a part in the decisions of the terms in which we are making our platforms available. Part of it has to do with the focus of the mission of the British Film Institute as an UK publicly funded body. The idea is that we are publicly funded, therefore the UK public should be able to see their national collection, and that’s our core aim. We do make subsets of what we digitize available on our YouTube channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But it’s an interesting point in terms of the approach we took for the “Unlocking Film Heritage” project, which was quite a limited set of rights, and we were deliberately quite conservative in that ask, because we weren’t offering any fees or royalties to rights holders. In some respects with hindsight we should have asked for more, particularly from those rights holders who aren’t in the business of distributing films themselves. Lots of those companies that because of whichever history have ended up with rights to certain collections, they may or may not have deposited directly with us, they’re not doing anything with them, they may not fit anymore with their brand or their priorities. So it seems we’ve slightly missed an opportunity that we didn’t take on wider rights back then at the time. But for the purposes of the ultimate objectives, this is one of the things around project management, is you have this deadline and this volume of work that you have to try and clear in a certain way. So you want to devise it so you’re going to get the most positive answers from right holders to clear it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thinking further ahead, I’m also a member of the Libraries and Archives Corporate Alliance and there’s lots of discussion, quite a lot of it prompted by COVID-19, about the major issues for access for education and cultural heritage organizations, who right now can’t provide any kind of access because they can’t actually get into their buildings. Obviously looking at what could possibly happen in terms of a new exception, expanding the current exceptions, to make providing that access easier for the cultural heritage sector, libraries, archives and museums, the big question is around the national scope of these exceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we’re happy to make things available in a certain way, there is always this question. Do you have to consider an additional risk if you’re going to make things available globally? We don’t necessarily know the ins and outs of the worldwide jurisdiction. Maybe there’s some sort of MOU or there’s certainly drivers that could be done through organizations, international organizations, that can help push this. A lot of the time we sort of look across the Atlantic and go “why don’t we have fair use! and help us all out”. It’s a mixture of organizational priorities about why we make things available in a certain way. I would love it for us to make more things available, much more widely, given the differences around domestic laws. The public domain issue, the shorter term rule, all that kind of thing comes into it. We quite often get people who say, “well it’s in the public domain”, and we go “yes, that’s over there, it’s not here necessarily”. There’s probably more learning to do on that as well, about how all that really functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">In terms of timing, when to do the right bit of work at the right time, at your respective institutions, when does the rights assessment happen? Is it based on project funding, is it at the beginning or at the end, are there conditions regarding rights clearance before even imagining a digitization project?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>I can speak to that. Generally speaking I’ve worked very hard in the organizations that I’ve worked with to get at least the preliminary rights review started both early on or before a project to see what they have. If you have something where everything is in copyright and everything will require permissions or a fair use assertion, does the institution want to proceed? Because that’s another kind of investment and iterative way. It is not unusual for us to ascertain fair use in certain cases; it is not unusual to make a preservation decision to scan things for access copies, even maybe in a reading room but maybe beyond. But it’s as much a part of doing the preliminary work. Let’s say you have a really fragile paper and you need particular equipment, it fits into that same early planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Victoria: </b>As early as possible, ideally. A lot of the projects that I’ve looked at in my research didn’t consider rights issues until after the funding had been awarded. There are a lot of examples, anecdotally, of projects basically grinding to a halt because rights clearance wasn’t considered at the right stage in the project. As early as possible, as Melissa says, and also in terms of conditions with rights clearance, before even imagining digitization projects, there are some funders that require certain licensing conditions to be met for the digitization output. That has an effect on the types of permissions that you’ll be requesting as part of the rights clearance process. So for some funded projects it does have to be built-in very early. To be fair, most funders now recognize it as an issue and they’ll ask you to explore it during the actual funding application process now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>From an archive point of view, our Rights team works across the archive, and also we have a separate distribution collection, where we’re the distributor and sales agent doing more commercial work with films. But we’re very reactive, in that it’s driven by projects. The projects are usually content driven. It would be a dream if we could actually do a rights lead digitization project, where those are the overarching decisions about what you decide to invest in, but very unlikely to happen. People don’t get so excited about that as they do about interesting collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the things that I’ve certainly noticed is we put quite a lot of effort into devising these workflows and guidance for a project, but we haven’t really got to the point of transferring that into the business as usual work. Our archive collections are huge. We estimate we own rights on about 1% of them, we’ve probably done rights research on some point percent of them, just for these projects, and if we want to get to the point of really having quite a revolutionary change in terms of the access we can provide, we need to go right back to the beginning, and start a program that might work discreetly at tackling the basic copyright status of collections and works, alongside the donor to identify any donor restrictions, and provenance. But that again would be a huge undertaking to start outside of the projects at this stage and not something that would be feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>There are some things that become sort of obvious, things that you suddenly realize in doing work that weren’t obvious to you before. When I started working on the Rights Statements project with colleagues who were in Europe who didn’t have fair use, and the difference between information about a work and a licence regarding a work were two very different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started to realize that for me having started this in the 90s, I’m in the crowd that Victoria was talking about, we now have hundreds if not thousands of collections online globally that say something like “we think we have sufficient right, but we don’t really know; you’re on your own if you want to use or reuse”. That was really fine and even that was even really progressive for many years. But I would say 10–15 years ago we found that we are running into ourselves, creating our own orphan works problems, or exacerbating them. We’re having graduate students who aren’t confident using material from online collections in their scholarly monograph. And it’s sort of obvious, but it’s not obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve got this like “next meta ecosystem”. Life is short, but I would love to do a project that basically goes out and audits hundreds of these statements and just provides feedback to the group that did it. There’s one University that was an early participant in this kind of thing, that has medieval materials and they have that kind of statement. It is a common approach. For any single museum, library, or archives this may not be a priority, so I think this is a project that we need to figure out as a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">How do you store or record your rights information and assessment data? How do you recommend documenting rights information and clearances, so people in the present and future can find cleared materials?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>To be honest, it’s still an embryonic thing. For a very long time it was anecdotal, and there’s a lot of information kept in a lot of different places. So Excel sheets, Word documents, unscanned paperwork. We have a rights and royalties database, which does hold some information about titles that we have in active distribution. We have a collections information database that would record, say original credit information about the works in the archives. But the one thing we’ve not really had is any kind of central repository for the rights information, and that’s both across the kind of usage permissions for archive holdings, and the journey that a work goes through from a rights point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We do have one internal document called “the distributor history” doc which has this information built up over many years, from different colleagues, about how organisations or people’s rights have travelled around, being bought, divided up, sold, rebought, divided up, goes on and on. What we’ve noticed is that a lot of the time information is usually retained either in Excel or emails for a project, but we then struggle with how to put that information somewhere in a more structured way that then it’s available for other people to look at, so you don’t have to go back and start at the beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The only thing we started to do right now is we link a person’s name or an organization name back to a record in our central collections information database, which has a unique identifier. We’re literally just adding a hyperlink to where that record is in system, and then have the name of the company, that link, and the narrative, which is basically telling the story of what information you found in the latest bit of research you’ve had to do, and then keep that updated and introducing a kind of validation, so that you can see who the last person was to update this information. At the moment that’s as far as we’ve got.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would love it if we could actually move that into a proper database. At the moment it’s just this Excel, and to be honest we are kind of stuck. I don’t really have a recommendation other than trying to do that, where you’re building up some system. It can be an Excel where you are linking back to a structured data set that potentially could help you, so one day you might be able to then migrate all that information into that system, so it’s attached to the relevant record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">(Thanks to Annabelle who generously shared her templates “Examples Rights Research Tracker — British Film Institute” &amp; “Example Rights Information — British Film Institute”).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Victoria: </b>A lot of the projects that I’ve looked at range from everything, from paper files to Word documents, Excel sheets to Access databases, to using the collection management system that they have in-house. A lot of collection management databases just wouldn’t have the granularity needed for complex rights information, and that’s what a lot of the projects that I looked at found, they ended up using basically Excel sheets or Word documents to record a lot of it. And a lot of it does involve background research, going into old accession records, and donation records like paper files, and starting the research from there and then sort of building on it with whatever you find online for a lot of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It needs to be scalable to the institution that you work at and the resources that you have. The classic thinking about it, it’s almost from a digital preservation point of view, as long as it’s in a widely used accessible format and kept it in that format, it’s fine. You don’t want to end up in a situation where all your information is in a database that your institution decides to stop supporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>I started using this expression, “help your future you”, and even if that’s the equivalent of a written finding aid, like the old-fashioned statement of “this is what’s in this box” kind of thing. There’s a tendency, for institutions that are concerned with memory and material memory, we’re really not great about certain kinds of corporate records. If you’re in a museum and you have registrars, you have frequently very well organized materials, but they may or may not be connected to other parts of the organization. Same for a library, where you can have catalogers who aren’t necessarily involved in the transactional pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well-organized files that include contracts and other documentation are of extraordinary value. They simplify later research and scholarship. They reduce administrative costs. Just that marginal additional effort of that project documentation is a huge step forward as we figure out how to share that information more broadly or make it available for researchers who are trying to figure things out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">How do you define risk assessment if you’ve got a tight budget? What information do you need to know to make decisions around what to publish and what not to publish?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>Usually I would try and break down the works that we’re looking at by certain categories, so the title. Title it’s important, if you have that. We don’t always have that, right now we’re working on tapes and it just says “tape” and then there’s a number. We don’t yet know what there’s on the tape, so title of the work. Date of production, or date made, or date released. If you can have release dates and production date that’s great. Copyright status, ownership status, which actually maybe that’s something you would look at a bit later, but hopefully you would have that, title, day, copyright, ownership status, publication status, those are probably the top five things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below that there are other things you could break it down. Mostly talking about film and TV, for instance, if it’s a major, if it’s for broadcast or was it a film for theatrical distribution, was it a commercially produced or non commercially produced? Fiction or nonfiction are really handy categories just in terms of alerting you to what kind of potential underlying rights there might be. Those are the key bits of information, you can then use those, talking about television works, for instance, knowing that kind of information then gives us a much clearer idea to understand under what terms of trade those programs will likely have been made. So commissioning broadcasts are likely to own rights, or the independent production company, what the underlying clearances would have been, how they would have been cleared. Usually it’s quite limited, so you always know you need to go back and re-clear everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So those bits of information then you overlay them with the other information you’re researching around the context of, the type of material it is, when it was produced, and for what reason it’s produced. For instance the ownership question might then lead you to right holders and establishing whether these right holders are currently active, if they’re still in the business, whether they’re quite strong enforcing rights, do you have a relationship with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each one then takes you on to another further, drilling down as a criteria which would help you inform the level of risk. We tend to break up risk into the nature of the works themselves, so that the content, subject matter, commercial production or not, relationship with rights holders and donors, and then the other risk factor is around the actual use you’re planning for. At the moment we’ve got this thing with two columns, which each have a score gives you a total score and then you come up with a higher, low or medium risk. It sounds simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>Annabelle was describing sort of all the detective work. I start with the question of what are you doing and why. If you can’t articulate a good reason for whatever it is you’re doing, figuring out who all the rights holders might not necessarily be at the top of the order of operation. So if somebody says, “I’m clearing out my office, can you scan my files now that I’m an emeritus faculty?”, it depends. I may be selective, and that’s maybe a delicate conversation, but what are you doing and why can help mediate where your risk tolerances are for a particular collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, if something is from the 1940s and it’s mostly orphan works and it’s in copyright, but it has really significant scholarly or current value, in the US because we have fair use, I would lean towards making those materials available in some capacity. I don’t know if the absence of fair use in other countries is a non-starter for other kinds of institutions, who don’t have that and that’s that’s a significant thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I really quickly wanted to respond to a question in the comments in the chat about all the things that are not copyright, so things like sensitive materials, privacy. These are not formally in our current process, but they’re all things that I screen for, and look at, and put a few pairs of eyes if I’m having questions, because sometimes any one of us doesn’t see issues that may be apparent to someone else. I do think that this is more than copyright and it should be treated that way. Berkeley Library has a new guide on dealing with the indigenous materials question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Victoria, I understand that as part of your research you had some findings around the outcomes of rights research, where you found that institutions that were worrying a lot about taking some risks found that rights holders were super happy that these works were being disseminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I want to agree with Annie and Melissa on those last points about what’s the sort of minimum that you would want going into rights clearance. I would also emphasize, probably partly because I come from an archives background, but I’m obsessed with provenance. The more you know about the circumstances of the creation of the item in question, in particular it really goes back to thinking about not just copyright but the sensitivity of the material, and whether it was created in the course of employment, or whether it was created for a creative commercial purpose, whether it was created by an indigenous community for a specific purpose, all of that. There’s thinking about these things through a rights based framework, but then there’s also thinking about these issues through a more sort of ethics of care approach, and how you would want those materials to be treated if you put yourself in the shoes of their creator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What I would emphasize is thinking about it from the creators’ point of view, as much as it is about what we want to do with the materials, and setting or balancing the risks of doing something against the benefits, that will accrue from doing something is really important as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of examples from my own research where archivists have gone through the process of: they’ve done a rights audit, they’re doing digitization, they’re contacting rights holders for permissions. Most of projects, where they were able to find contact details for rights holders they were very close to 100% positive responses to rights clearance requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main issues with rights clearance continues to be non response and orphan works, but if you do actually manage to contact a rights holder for the kind of — for the most part — non-commercial and public good digitization that institutions are doing, most rights holders will say “yes”. They also found that, in terms of the follow-up correspondence that we had with rights holders was that they were generally really pleased to see the material being digitized and being used for public good purposes, like research or outreach and things like that, and some did actually become involved in other projects with the institutions in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That was a relatively small number of institutions I found through a survey of the UK that actually did third party rights clearance at scale, and that’s what they were getting back in terms of response. I think in particular in the Glasgow School of Art, when I did my research with them, they were doing their rights clearance process in the aftermath of the fire that gutted the Mackintosh building in Glasgow. So I think also depending on circumstances, depending on the timing of digitization projects as well, you’ll get very positive responses and people taking an interest and wanting to do more for the institution off the back of those projects. Particularly, it might be a donor that you haven’t been in touch with in a while, it might be a rights holder that wasn’t aware that their material was actually held by the institution in question, so it’s either renewing a relationship that may have been untended or it’s developing a new relationship with them, with individuals that didn’t realize that they were represented in the institution’s collections. There’s all sorts of unexpected goodwill and good things can happen as a result of that process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa: </b>I agree with that, anecdotally, people are generally pleased that grandma’s papers exist, that there’s some connection and they’re usually just pretty happy about it. There are situations that I’ve seen where typically it’s the first generation, the children of the creator, who want to assert rights, sometimes they’re willing to do a joint arrangement, frequently after they’ve gone to a lot of trouble of asserting those rights and working after thinking that it was something that’s going to make them rich. After a decade or so they realize that’s not likely to happen, or they didn’t understand the rights that they actually had (or didn’t) themselves. They may have a product that’s, say, commercially owned by a film company and they think that, as “the children of”, they have rights that they may not even have in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The other thing we’re starting to see is current archiving practices, around recording protests and active digital humanities projects, where at one level we have people filming themselves and putting them on social media in a very very public way. So, what could be wrong about collecting that and making that available in some way? But frequently we have either children or people who are protesting and who could be targeted by their governments in a more granular way. I don’t think there’s an answer if we either have those materials or share those materials, but there’s a lot of conversation about that, and it’s a different flavor from the kinds of things that you were rightly talking about Victoria, but I think it’s timely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Victoria: </b>Absolutely, and there’s definitely a thread of, I think that as Eira Tansey’s says, “no one owes their trauma to archivists”. I think archives have to be very careful about how they collect material and particularly in the current situation. That’s definitely a strand of thought that’s developing at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">How is BFI handling the orphan world’s with the European Union orphan works came with the forthcoming Brexit?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>I don’t think there’s any plan for the BFI to remove any of the works registered as orphan works of the EU IPO from our player platform or from our special YouTube playlist, of about 170 of the 270 or so works that we’ve registered. Basically we are calculating it as a pretty low risk, in that they’ve been up there for quite a long time, we carried out very good due diligence when we registered them, we haven’t had claims. We might have had one person who came out and said, “oh I think this might be mine”. I don’t see that we would make any change in terms of how we’re making them available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What’s going to happen after that I’m not sure. At the moment the BFI has never made use of the UK licensing scheme. I am involved in the EnDOW community project, which has a tool to help people do a diligent search and the current project is to try and get the public engaged in this, and helping, so crowdsourcing the diligent search. We’ve put forward a list of around 30 films and we’re waiting for people to help with that. If diligent search is carried out and if it is an orphan work, we would then probably put them through for the UK licensing scheme. I’ve never gone through that application process and obviously there are costs involved in making an application, in getting a license from the UK IPO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s painful in a way, given the amount of work we invested in incorporating the orphan works into our workflows. Some of these projects actually helped raise the profile of rights research in particular, which is an area that certainly at the BFI I think is still in a sort of chrysalis phase, in terms of how it’s viewed as an important part of what the organisation does. It has yet to become the beautiful butterfly we know it can be. But we invested all that, we’ve put these things out there on the EU IPO, and then their life may be quite short, which is heartbreaking. So whether the UK itself will agree to introduce its own exception, I don’t know. I hope that something would be done to allow that for us to continue to make these things available and not necessarily push us down the route of having to go through the licensing scheme. We’ll see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Final thoughts or comments?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Melissa:</b> I want to encourage people to email me, because there are a lot of valuable products out there but it gets a little bit overwhelming. I am interested in writing something, but I also don’t want to reinvent the wheel. I feel like the sort of long lists of wiki style resources are super helpful but it’s a lot to dig into, and I’d like to figure out something that’s more conversational in tone for people. I’d also like to work on writing about these topics, which end up being really rarified topics, so it’s good to be with our family, or collecting GLAM family. But people beyond the profession need to understand why all this is important, and why these institutions are important to support them. So I’m thinking it through some projects, and would really welcome any thoughts about that kind of audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d8e694b3-7fff-6298-6878-68baac2ba4ec\">Annabelle: </b>I can’t believe how quickly the time went! We can carry on for hours and hours on this conversation. I’m planning to share information on the work we’re doing now on the current project, hopefully to let other people see how we’re trying to deal with some of these issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b>Victoria: </b>If people want to pull together a list of resources, there is the copyright cortex which is a database of research, tools and guidance around rights issues for cultural heritage institutions. I don’t know whether we have anything specific for rights clearance, we could probably pull together a guide of some resources that people might find useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Disclaimer:&nbsp;The content of this post does not constitute legal advice nor does it refer to any particular or specific situation.

        intro: "When large parts of Europe went into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Europeana events team and the Europeana Network Association’s specialist communities had to start to work very differently. Big physical events went digital. Face-to-face discussions became screen-to-screen. The focus of conversations changed. The need to connect to other people was more important than ever.\r\n"

        title: '16th History of European Integration Research Society (HEIRS) Conference'
        intro: 'Capturing Europe in Digital Sources: New Approaches for European Integration History?'
        body: "<p>This HEIRS annual conference’s format matches its theme: what does the digital European historiography look like? The blossoming of covid crisis related collecting platforms show how the digitisation of many social relations have opened the opportunity for historians to create their own archives on current events. More generally, the sources produced by European institutions have increasingly been made available online. Beyond EU archives, European platforms of transnational collections of digitised sources like Europeana have shown how rich such collections can be but also how difficult it is to overcome the national silos. This wealth of material does not equate with an enhanced use or eased access, due to technical, legal problems or issues of digital literary among researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to join the discussion on what European digital archives entail and what researchers made with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/16th-history-of-european-integration-research-society-heirs-conference-registration-110091029232\" target=\"_blank\">Please register until 28.06.2020</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Programme </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12:00-13:00 - Historians using and producing digital archives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Dieter Schlenker - Digitisation projects at the Historical Archives of the EU</li>\r\n    <li>Christoph Brüll - When historians create their archives: the making of covidmemory project</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13:30-16:00 - Digital sources on European history : eased access, new tools?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Claude Ewert - Digital Accessibility of EU Archives: A case study on digital archive research concerning EC- USSR Relations</li>\r\n    <li>Jan Rohden - Archive collections, digitization and collective historical memory: the project “German files in the central archive of the Russian Ministry of Defence (CAMO)”</li>\r\n    <li>Robert Fiedler - European integration and the example of teaching history: a historical comparative study through corpus linguistics – an approach for European historiography?</li>\r\n    <li>Anselm Küsters - EU Competition Law and Economic Schools of Thought: A Text Mining Perspective</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>16:30-17:30 - Digital and digitised EU archives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Ludovic Delepine - From Emotion to Cognition: Engaging Citizens in the European Integration History.</li>\r\n    <li>Silvia Sevilla - Preservation of EU websites.

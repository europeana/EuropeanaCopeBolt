        title: 'Greek holdings from the Bodleian Libraries'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'Collection of 2,470 images of Greek manuscripts which includes not only texts and illuminated manuscripts from the Byzantine empire and Renaissance Italy, but also an important accumulation of papyri from the ancient world.'
        body: "<p>The present collection starts with five of the most famous and fragile of the Bodleian's Greek holdings, in complete sets of recent scans. The D'Orville Euclid (AD 888) and the Clarke Plato (AD 895) were each made for and annotated by Arethas of Patrae, and survive as major witnesses for their respective texts. The other three items are each in their own way so fragile that their preservation in digital form is especially vital. The earliest is a papyrus roll from Herculaneum (P.Herc. 118), dating from before the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79: the roll was given to Oxford University by the Prince of Wales in 1810, and mounted in twelve frames when it was opened at Naples in 1883-4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13th-century Byzantine manuscript, MS. Barocci 131, is a vast miscellany of classical and Byzantine texts by Michael Psellus and many others, some rare or unique to this witness; its early paper is softened and crumbling, and the scans allow close study of its tiny script. Finally, the 14th-century Menologion has suffered badly from the flaking of the paint-layers which is so characteristic of Byzantine illuminations: it depicted the saints in a rich sequence of miniatures which covered almost every page.</p>"

For instance, users can access to trench maps illustrating the Battle Front in France and Belgium with well represented trenches and wire entanglement, or the maps of the British battles during 1918, or the Brussels Water Supply Map that shows location of standpipes, springs, wells etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interesting is the map of the march through Belgium and Germany across the Rhine to Bridghead. It shows the route of 29th Division who marched from Renaix in Belgium to Cologne in Germany to secure the Rhine bridgehead immediately following the end of the First World War.</p>"

        datatype: Documentation
        intro: 'The Piranesi Collection provided by the Complutense University Library of Madrid contains digital copies of engravings realised between the years 1748-1806 and published in Rome and Paris.'
        body: "<p>Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720 –1778) was an Italian artist famous for his etchings of Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection mostly presents the long series of vedute of Rome realised in 1748–1774 which established his fame. The remains of Rome kindled Piranesi's enthusiasm. He was able to faithfully imitate the actual remains of a fabric; his invention in catching the design of the original architect provided the missing parts; his masterful skill at engraving introduced groups of vases, altars, tombs that were absent in reality; and his broad and scientific distribution of light and shade completed the picture, creating a striking effect from the whole view.</p>"

        body: "<p>Currently, the virtual library contains 1001 manuscripts from 42 different libraries. On the E-codices site, complete digital reproductions of the manuscripts are linked with corresponding scholarly descriptions. 40 manuscripts produced under Abbot Frowin in the early years of the monastery of Engelberg (Canton of Obwalden), a unique collection in Switzerland that shows how, in the High Middle Ages, a conventual library collection was planned and built up. Manuscripts containing texts from Greek antiquity in the Greek language, manuscripts containing medieval and early modern translations of Greek classics, and manuscripts containing medieval commentaries on key works of Greek antiquity. Outstanding examples of Carolingian book art such as the richly illustrated Prudentius Manuscript, created around 900 in the area of Lake Constance containing the poems published by Prudentius in the year 405, as well as a later added eighth work. Circa 30 medieval manuscripts from the Abbey Library of St. Gall and so forth. The virtual library will be continuously updated and extended.</p>\r\n\r\n"

        title: 'The Library of Charles V preserved in the National Library of France'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'The collection gathers several precious items, for example the first French encyclopedia in the vernacular language ''Image du monde'' by Gossuin de Metz and the wonderful richly illustrated atlas of Nautical Charts by Abraham Cresques.'
        body: "<p>This collection was digitised in the context of the Europeana Regia project and contains manuscripts from the 13th to the 15th centuries from the old library assembled by Charles V (r. 1364-1380). Several classic and modern authors translated into French: Aristotéles, Giovanni Boccaccio, Titus Livus as well as the Justinianus law code in French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worth mentioning are the bibles translated into French and the bibles owned by the French kings: the Bible of Louis IX, the Bible of Charles V and the Petite Bible historiale of Charles V which was the predominant medieval translation of the Bible into French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore there are works by famous French authors: Guillaume de Digulleville (Latin poems), Guyart des Moulins, Christine de Pisan (the first European professional writer), Gérard de Montaigu who wrote the Compilation of Perpetual Pontifical Privileges accorded to French Kings and Queens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The library assembled by Charles V and lodged in the Falconry Tower at the Louvre was more than a fabulous collection of books (over 900 volumes in 1380) put at the disposal of the king and his counsellors. It was quite extraordinary for its time in having nearly 2500 texts in French, thus illustrating the promotion of French as the language of learning and government. The library was a sign of royal authority, a prerogative of the king of France, and was, in this sense, already a State library.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The library is deeply committed to digitizing its unique and extremely rare holdings. Thus, 357 manuscripts, mostly Carolingian manuscripts, created during the 8th and the 9th centuries, were digitized in the context of the Europeana Regia project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the collection includes also some examples of manuscripts coming from the library assembled by the Aragonese kings of Naples or from the old library assembled by Charles V (r. 1364-1380). Most manuscripts orginated from the dissolved Bavarian monasteries, among which was the Freising Cathedral library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Freising holdings are extremely rich in manuscripts of the 8th and 9th centuries, 72 of which contain decorative elements, mainly initials. The exceptional Freising collection, which has come down to us almost completely intact, puts art historians in the rare position to study the development of the ornamentation of initials in a single scriptorium during the Carolingian period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_<a href=\"http://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/index.html?c=kurzauswahl&amp;adr=daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/ausgaben/uni_ausgabe.html?projekt=1263566068&amp;ordnung=sig&amp;recherche=ja&amp;l=de\" target=\"_blank\">Bavarian State Library</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>This collection is divided into two major groups: ‘Regents and Nobles’, which includes the portraits of European and non-European Regent dynasties and ‘People’. ‘Regents and Nobles’ is divided into six categories: popes, emperors, kings, nobles, Austrian dukes and other kings. ‘People’ is organised into eight categories: ‘office holders’, ‘citizens’, ‘women’, ‘clergy’, ‘scientists’, ‘artists’, ‘military’ and ‘marginal groups’. Within the historical categories, portraits are grouped by eras and centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection originally dates back to the year 1785 when the young Archduke, later Emperor Francis I (1768-1835), acquired the first engravings for his private collection. Lastly, these documents have been collated by The Picture Archive of the Austrian National Library, Austria’s largest picture documentation centre and the centre for digital images of all holdings and collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Picture taken from: http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/ImageDetail.aspx?p_iBildID=7685454)</p>"

        title: 'World War One Posters, Small Form Graphics and Children’s Drawings'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'The picture material for Europeana Collections 1914-1918 consists for one part of children’s drawings illustrating and World War I. Another large part of this collection are the World War I posters which are probably the best known form of propaganda during WW1.'
        body: "<p>The collection contains posters from the Austria-Hungary empire as well as from the German Reich and the countries of the Triple Entente (about 500 items in total) covering official pronouncements, conscription calls, decrees, collection calls, war bonds and propaganda posters. The collection is completed with small form graphics used to call the civilian population to participate in fundraising activities postcards, satirical graphics and cartoons. The distribution of flyers created a powerful psychological persuasion helping to spread comforting or intimidating ideas and this is well represented in this collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postcards designed by famous artists such as Fritz Schönpflug Karpellus and Adolf Fritz Gareis, as well as school essays which illustrate the influence of propaganda on children and adolescents are also included. Explore 1135 Hungarian First World War announcements, most of which were printed in Hungarian and some in a multilingual manner (in Slovakian, Serbian or Romanian, Italian, Slovenian, Croatian, Polish and Russian as well as Hungarian).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The announcements inform us about medical examinations, conscription, military drafts, desertion and military successes but also about life in the provinces. The latter can be classified into the following topics: state finances, security, traffic, transport and postal system, agriculture, labour shortage, supply of food, health, charity and propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Preview image taken from:http://www.bildarchivaustria.at/Pages/Search/Result.aspx?p_eBildansicht=2&amp;p_ItemID=3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

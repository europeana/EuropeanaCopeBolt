        title: 'Letters by Italian personalities during World War I'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'The National Library of Italy (Rome) makes available online 8 valuable manuscripts written by important Italian personalities, such as Gabriele d''annunzio and Giuseppe Prezzolini, relating to the First World War.'
        body: "<p>This digital collection contains one of the leaflets which was ‘bombed’ on Vienna by the air squadron of Gabriele d’Annunzio (1863-1938), the Italian poet-soldier of World War One. It contains propaganda in which d’Annunzio highlights the allied victories in Italy (Piave) and in France (Marne) during the final months of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users can also see the letter by Goffredo Monti to Antonio Bruers, 14 April 1917. Goffredo Monti was a student who supported Italy’s entry into the war. In this letter from the front (where he died some months later), he wrote of his disenchantment to Antonio Bruers (1887-1954). A letter by Gabriele D’Annunzio (1863-1938) some months after Italy joined the war. It is addressed to Admiral Camillo Maria Corsi, Commander in Chief and Minister of the Italian navy. Moreover, a letter by Giuseppe Prezzolini to Federico Comandini, 18 July 1915. This letter is written on headed paper from 'La Voce', The Voice, an influential pro-war literary journal that wanted an overhaul of Italian culture.</p>"

The collection reflects the changes in Latvian history and promotes digitisation as a way of involving both cultural heritage institutions and the public in the creation of a database of local history.'
        body: "<p>‘In Search of Lost Latvia’ includes digital copies of ancient drawings, postcards, photos from the end of the 19th century until today. From ruins of medieval castles to railways and roads, from mills to river valleys, from ancient crafts to public buildings, the project documents the economic, social and cultural life of Latvia’ s society. Among more than 26 000 images and object descriptions online are for example photographs of timber rafting – now a lost craft, railways and women collecting mushrooms (taking a break and feeding the local cats!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, the Latvian cultural landscape has changed significantly. Part of the natural, historical, artistic and architectural heritage, as well as the economic and social structures didn't survive. Latvian cultural heritage suffered two world wars and the German and Soviet occupation.</p>"

        datatype: Data
        intro: 'The National Library of Serbia preserves precious sound treasure on 78 rpm gramophone records in its Special Collections. There are around 599 records, and the oldest ones date from the beginning of the past century (1901-1902), and the earliest ones are from the sixth decade of the 20th Century.'
        body: "<p>Collections genre designation covers from folk and popular to classical and jazz music, along with a few speech recordings (comedy, poetry, language courses). It is worth mentioning that records appear in three dimensions – 17.5, 25 and 30 cm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collection has an important national heritage value, as far as Serbian records are concerned, for it contains many earliest Serbian sound recordings made in Serbia or abroad. On these, old, dusty shellac disks have been recorded not only divine voices of most famous singers and performers, or unique musical works, but also messages from Serbian ancestors, musical gems recorded for us to listen to, keep, and treasure, and to understand and remember them.</p>"

They also contain a wealth of depictions of coats of arms and other detailed illustrations, some of which were made by local Frisian artists.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Another very special feature of the collection is that it demonstrates the keeping of such an album as a general family activity in The Netherlands from the 16th and 17th century. The albums of Homme, Juw and Pieter van Harinxma are good examples. They offer unique insight into the past by means of the entries made within in these albums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, an album amicorum is a booklet whereby the owner collected contributions of friends, acquaintances or famous contemporaries he/she knew. This kind of album was mainly popular in academic circles and originated during a period in which many students did not confine themselves to one particular university, but made a so-called academic 'grand tour' which led them to universities throughout major Europe centres. The album was a loyal companion during these trips and was filled with the contributions of professors who taught them and by fellow students and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_<a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/bronnen-zoekwijzers/databanken-mede-gemaakt-door-de-kb/alba-amicorum-in-nederland\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of the Netherlands</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>John Thomas was born in West Wales and worked as a photographer, specialising in landscape images of Wales and portraits of notable Welsh people, particularly church and chapel ministers. John Thomas started off selling cartes des visite of Welsh celebrities of the day. He also took photographs of ordinary people, often at their place of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is best remembered today for his topographical views. John Thomas challenged the work of photographers such as Francis Frith and James Valentine who portrayed only the scenic beauty of Wales. He learnt the rudiments of photography and in 1863 he began taking photographs of the famous by inviting a number of well-known preachers to sit for their portraits. The enterprise was a success and by 1867 he was confident enough to establish his own photographic business, The Cambrian Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He worked as a photographer for about forty years, and during that time he travelled widely in the north, mid and south Wales taking photographs of landscapes as well as people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_National Library of Wales<br><a href=\"https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/photographs/johnthomas\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/photographs/johnthomas</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Welsh Landscape Collection includes prints from all areas of the country. A wide variety of prints showing urban and rural areas, mountains and coastline, from north, south, east, west and mid Wales can be found.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On this digital collection users can access a number of galleries which contain a selection of prints by some of the most prominent artists in the Welsh Landscape collection. Additional prints of the counties of Wales can be found by searching on subject or location on e-Resources. There are a large number of prints showing famous buildings such as Caernarfon Castle and Tintern Abbey. There are also examples showing the industrial tows of Neath and Swansea, historic towns such as Monmouth and Conwy, natural wonders, castles and mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View for example the David Cox Gallery. You can see David Cox (1783 – 1859) at his best in the Welsh Landscape Collection, especially in his etchings of the Snowdonia mountains. He was an expert in light and shade, understanding the passion for ‘picturesque’ images amongst the wealthy English. The collection offers also the Paul Sandby Gallery, the Henry Gastineau Gallery, the John Preston Neal Gallery, the William Henry Bartlett Gallery, the Sir Richard Colt Hoare Gallery and the Julius Caesar Ibbetson Gallery.</p>"

        title: 'Geoff Charles Photographic Collection'
        datatype: Data
        intro: "<p>A website presenting photographs of Wales and the English border during the Second World War, 1939-1945, taken from the Geoff Charles collection, including: 6000 photographs searchable by names, places and subjects. Specific themes including agriculture, evacuees and everyday life.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Geoff Charles worked as a photojournalist in Wales from the 1930s to the 1970s and was the photographer of record in Welsh-speaking Wales for most of that period. Today his archive is one of the treasures of the National Library of Wales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If any of his photos should be singled out, then those of Tryweryn deserve special mention. Wales held her breath; would this community be allowed to live or would it drown beneath a new reservoir to supply Liverpool? The village drowned, but not before Mr Charles photographed many images that recorded a way of life and a community which disappeared simultaneously. Whilst life in the Tryweryn valley was no different from that in many other parts of Wales, the threat to its existence ensured that every detail of life was meticulously recorded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collection is an opportunity to share memories, stories and experiences. Furthermore It offers an interactive education section for use by schools and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_National Library of Wales<br><a href=\"https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/photographs/geoffcharles\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/photographs/geoffcharles</a></p>\r\n"

North Wales followed soon afterwards with its first weekly, The North Wales Gazette, established in Bangor in 1808 by the Broster family of Chester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later The Carmarthen Journal was to appear, which sought its readership in west Wales. In addition there is The first Welsh language weekly to be published Seren Gomer, founded by Joseph Harris in 1814. Unlike the others already mentioned, Seren Gomer saw itself as a national newspaper, which sought to serve the emtirety of Wales and strengthen the Welsh language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also worth mentioning is the featured first daily newspaper to be published in Wales The Cambrian Daily Leader (1861) but it was the Western Mail (1869) that was to become Wales’ foremost daily newspaper and it continues as such today.</p>"

        intro: 'Among the drawings of the most representative Romanian artists preserved in the Romanian Academy Library are the drawings of Nicolae Grigorescu (1838-1907). More than 345 drawings, watercolours and pastels are included in the collection.'
        body: "<p>Nicolae Grigorescu was educated in France, at Barbizon. He is the promoter of a new artistic way of thinking, choosing the plein-air, which he treats according his own temperament and artistic vision. Known as the greatest lyrical artist of Romanian painting, his art reflects the village microcosm, landscapes of a calm beauty, being also a creator of psychological portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an example the collection offers 'Fancy-Dress Man'. This portrait, as well as Rodica, Old Jew, shows the artist’s concern for the line elegance, the psychological study of faces, focusing either on movement, or dreamy and serene in resting, tragic in capturing the passage of time. The precious silhouette of costume, enlightened with white chalk, is cut in charcoal hatchings and estompe, creating an illusory world of the carnival costume.</p>"

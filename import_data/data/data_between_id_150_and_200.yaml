        title: 'Luna collections - Western Manuscripts'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'The Bodleian Libraries made freely available online a highly important collection of digital items of western manuscripts from the Medieval to the Modern Period. The collection gathers classical literary manuscripts, Bible manuscripts, Anglo-Norman literature, French literature and poems, Irish manuscripts and British poems and romances (particularly written in Middle English and Old English).'
        body: "<p>The Anglo-Norman literature is well represented by the decorated 12th-century manuscript \"La Chanson de Roland\" in Anglo-Norman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most manuscripts are richly illuminated such as the precious manuscript \"The Romance of Alexander (accumulated epic romances of Alexander the Great) in French verse, richly decorated by the Flemish illuminator Jehan de Grise and his workshop (1338-44).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, worthy mentioning is the 'Illustrated Guide to Oxford University' prepared for Queen Elizabeth I, with drawings by John Bereblock, Fellow of Exeter College, of the colleges and University buildings, most of which are the earliest known. This is very likely the copy presented to the Queen by Neal on 5 Sept. 1566.</p>"

        title: 'Greek holdings from the Bodleian Libraries'
        datatype: Documentation
        intro: 'Collection of 2,470 images of Greek manuscripts which includes not only texts and illuminated manuscripts from the Byzantine empire and Renaissance Italy, but also an important accumulation of papyri from the ancient world.'
        body: "<p>The present collection starts with five of the most famous and fragile of the Bodleian's Greek holdings, in complete sets of recent scans. The D'Orville Euclid (AD 888) and the Clarke Plato (AD 895) were each made for and annotated by Arethas of Patrae, and survive as major witnesses for their respective texts. The other three items are each in their own way so fragile that their preservation in digital form is especially vital. The earliest is a papyrus roll from Herculaneum (P.Herc. 118), dating from before the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79: the roll was given to Oxford University by the Prince of Wales in 1810, and mounted in twelve frames when it was opened at Naples in 1883-4. The 13th-century Byzantine manuscript, MS. Barocci 131, is a vast miscellany of classical and Byzantine texts by Michael Psellus and many others, some rare or unique to this witness; its early paper is softened and crumbling, and the scans allow close study of its tiny script. Finally, the 14th-century Menologion has suffered badly from the flaking of the paint-layers which is so characteristic of Byzantine illuminations: it depicted the saints in a rich sequence of miniatures which covered almost every page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><canvas dir=\"ltr\" height=\"753\" width=\"1668\"></canvas></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        intro: 'The Bodleian’s collections of early printed books contain over 6000 incunables (books printed before 1500).'
        body: "<p>The stories these collections tell cross many centuries and continents. Technological and business innovation in 15th-century Germany launched a printing trade that supplanted manuscript copies of many scholarly and religious works, and made possible new forms of text and illustrative practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the most valuable items in the collection are 'Russkaia pravoslavnaia tserkov’ (a picture calendar of the Russian Orthodox Church) and 'Chroniques de France' (The Chroniques of Monstrelet -1390?-1453- form one of the most important historical works of the 15th century. This edition was long considered to have been an incunable. The decorated miniatures illustrate the content of the chapters: they have been painted over printed synopses, the text of which has been written in by hand in the margin).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporaries and later collectors who appreciated the skill of the printers and valued the books as fine objects ensured their preservation in libraries, where they survive as witnesses of every stage in a profound transformation of communications technology.</p>"

        title: 'Masterpieces of the non-Western book'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'Circa 1,800 images of some of the Bodleian Libraries most valuable and most fragile manuscripts from many cultures of the Near East and Asia. This collection of digital items brings together a wide range of material produced in and relating to Asia, the Near East, and South Asia.'
        body: "<p>The Hebrew, Islamic, and South Asian collections are particularly rich in fine illustrated and illuminated manuscripts. The Bodleian’s Islamic collections include many fine examples of Arabic and Persian manuscript ornamentation. Illumination is regularly found in Quáns as well as in manuscripts commissioned by wealthy patrons. There are illuminated Qur’ans from the Mamluk period, Safavid and Qajar Persia, and Ottoman and Indian examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Islamic collection also includes: Scientific and technical Arabic manuscripts, Celebrated illustrated Mamluk literary manuscripts; Geographical works with maps and albums of paintings assembled during the time of the Mughal Empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Persian collection includes many fine manuscripts representing successive styles of the long tradition of Persian miniature painting from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Of the highest quality is the Bodleian’s copy of the poet Jami’s Abode of Spring, created for the emperor Akbar in Lahore in 1595 (Bodleian MS. Elliott 254).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an important collection of over 800 paintings in the Mughal style, dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. More popular bazaar art is represented by just over 100 Kalighat paintings made in the later 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of the Bodleian’s Hindu texts are without illustration of any kind, the notable exceptions being some highly decorative eighteenth-century sacred texts on rolls of highly-burnished paper, probably to be kept as amulets. Tibetan manuscripts come from the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Finally, the main collection includes Malay, Chinese, Japanese and Korean masterpieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_<a href=\"http://bodley30.bodley.ox.ac.uk:8180/lun...\" target=\"_blank\">Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts preserved by the Bodleian Libraries'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'Around 25,000 images selected mostly from Western Illuminated Manuscripts Collection (with a few from early printed books collection) of the Bodleian''s older image library of 35mm slides and filmstrips. The manuscripts are mostly archives and manuscript volumes in western languages from the Byzantine Empire, mostly on parchment or paper and in codex form and are written both in Latin and Greek and in the European vernaculars.'
        body: "<p>Amongst the manuscripts of monastic provenance are treasures such as the only one of the four major sources of Old English poetry to be illustrated – the so-called ‘Caedmon manuscript'. The Collection also shows administrative documents from several religious houses such as the 13th-century exemplars of Magna Carta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amongst the English medieval manuscripts are masterpieces such as the early Gothic Douce Apocalypse. There are also Irish manuscripts providing mportant sources for the early and medieval history of Ireland, e.g. Annals of Inisfallen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second in number are those manuscripts from Italy, but the Collection is also strong on manuscripts from continental Europe north of the Alps. Medieval Germany is also well represented, above all by the manuscripts rescued after the depredations of German ecclesiastical libraries during the Thirty Years’ War. Finally, the strengths of the rare books holdings are in theology, law, the classical tradition, mathematics and English Drama and Literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_<a href=\"http://bodley30.bodley.ox.ac.uk:8180/luna/servlet/ODLodl~1~1\" target=\"_blank\">Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford</a></p>\r\n"

For instance, users can access to trench maps illustrating the Battle Front in France and Belgium with well represented trenches and wire entanglement, or the maps of the British battles during 1918, or the Brussels Water Supply Map that shows location of standpipes, springs, wells etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interesting is the map of the march through Belgium and Germany across the Rhine to Bridghead. It shows the route of 29th Division who marched from Renaix in Belgium to Cologne in Germany to secure the Rhine bridgehead immediately following the end of the First World War.</p>"

        title: 'Photographs of Canada during the First World War'
        datatype: Documentation
        intro: 'Photographs of Canada during the First World War.'
        body: "<p>This collection of digital Items of photographs covers an important period in Canadian history. Between 1895 and 1924 new provinces join the Confederation, one of Canada’s most influential Prime Ministers is in office, the First World War changes a huge number of Canadian lives and the country itself becomes increasingly independent and influential on the world stage. All of this is depicted in the collection with national events treated to local interpretations and international conflicts given a uniquely Canadian perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection includes photographic record of the Indian Army in Europe during the First World War. These photographs were shot by Charles Hilton DeWitt Girdwood, when the Indian Army went on expedition to France in July-September 1915. This Indian collection consists of about 350 images. The two main groups are of wounded Indian soldiers in Brighton and Bournemouth (all with typed captions), undated but probably taken in April-May 1915, and then a series from France showing Indian and British troops, mostly dated 23 July - 8 September, with a short break in mid-August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a small number of post-air-raid photographs from England, presumably taken in early 1915, and two of Kitchener's recruiting speech at the Guildhall in early July. Most photographs show units of the Indian Corps - infantry of the Lahore and Meerut Divisions, and cavalry of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions. This included a number of regular British units, which were mixed with Indian forces, as well as some Territorial Army reinforcements assigned to join them. A number of unnamed artillery, medical, and support units are shown, and there are four photographs of New Army units of 19th and 20th Divisions, apparently in transit through the Indian Corps area.</p>"

        title: 'Photographs of Canada during the First World War'
        datatype: Data
        intro: 'This collection of digital Items of photographs covers an important period in Canadian history. Between 1895 and 1924 new provinces join the Confederation, one of Canada’s most influential Prime Ministers is in office, the First World War changes a huge number of Canadian lives and the country itself becomes increasingly independent and influential on the world stage.'
        body: "<p>This is all depicted in the collection with national events treated to local interpretations and international conflicts given a uniquely Canadian perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection includes photographic record of the Indian Army in Europe during the First World War. These photographs were shot by Charles Hilton DeWitt Girdwood, when the Indian Army went on expedition to France in July-September 1915. This Indian collection consists of about 350 images. The two main groups are of wounded Indian soldiers in Brighton and Bournemouth (all with typed captions), undated but probably taken in April-May 1915, and then a series from France showing Indian and British troops, mostly dated 23 July - 8 September, with a short break in mid-August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a small number of post-air-raid photographs from England, presumably taken in early 1915, and two of Kitchener's recruiting speech at the Guildhall in early July. Most photographs show units of the Indian Corps - infantry of the Lahore and Meerut Divisions, and cavalry of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions. This included a number of regular British units, which were mixed with Indian forces, as well as some Territorial Army reinforcements assigned to join them. A number of unnamed artillery, medical, and support units are shown, and there are four photographs of New Army units of 19th and 20th Divisions, apparently in transit through the Indian Corps area.</p>"

        intro: 'This collection of digital items brings together more than 200 titles of trench journals from the First World War.'
        body: "<p>Including for instance 'Le Soleil d'Or …riant', a rare example of a trench newspaper, written on the Eastern Front by the soldiers of the Sixth Division of the 148th Infantry East Army. Created by soldiers for soldiers, trench newspapers were written at the front or close to it. Often marked by dark humour, they aimed to lift the morale of the troops. Only a few copies were produced; they were handwritten and mimeographed (a cheap and quick form of printing). They generally had a short run, although a few titles such as Le Poilu reached 30,000 copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These publications are in many respects a rare and moving testimony of the psychology of World War One soldiers.</p>"

Often marked by dark humour, they aimed to lift the morale of the troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a few copies were produced; they were handwritten and mimeographed (a cheap and quick form of printing). They generally had a short run, although a few titles such as Le Poilu reached 30,000 copies. These publications are in many respects a rare and moving testimony of the psychology of World War One soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by:\_<a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/collection-items\" target=\"_blank\">British Library</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: 'Posters from the First World War held by the British Library. Collection of digital items of Russian, French and English propaganda posters from the First World War.'
        body: "<p>Collection of digital items of Russian, French and English propaganda posters from the First World War. These posters show symbols and slogans of nationhood and patriotism, the use of women as symbols, victims and homemakers and how the fighting nations depicted the enemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the posters are those representing atrocity propaganda focused on the most violent acts committed by the German and Austro-Hungarian armies, emphasising their barbarity and providing justification for the conflict. The British placed immense reliance therefore on propaganda to justify the war to the people, to help promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince the population that their sacrifices would be rewarded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remarkable is the poster of Lord Kitchener’s heavily mustachioed face and intimidating finger imploring the British population that ‘Your Country Needs YOU’. British recruitment posters changed in tone, from appealing to an individual’s honour to ‘mobilisation by shame’. Savile Lumley’s famous poster of 1915 depicted two young children asking their father about his military prowess after the war: ‘Daddy, what did YOU do in the Great War?’ .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also featured in this collection are the War Loan posters which were the largest category of posters issued between 1914 and 1918 as the governments appealed to the civilian population to help finance the war. The need to raise money to pay for the war by means of war bonds provided one of the most important patriotic themes for posters, for example: ‘Turn Your Silver into Bullets - at the Post Office’. In France, a similar poster, designed by Jules Abel Faivre in 1915, depicted a large gold coin with a Gallic cockerel on it, crushing a German soldier, with the slogan: ‘Deposit Your Gold for France - Gold Fights for Victory’.</p>"

Some of these pamphlets were also an important tool of war campaigning towards soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worth mentioning for instance is the pamphlet \"Al soldato d'Italia perchè ricordi\" with dramatic photographs of the Italian prisoners aimed to incite revenge. This collection also documents the changing role of women’s labour during wartime (see: Per convincere le donne alla Guerra) as well as women’s civilian and military contributions to the war effort. In addition, this collection offers the drawings by the greatest chronicler of German brutality and militarism, the most famous anti-German propagandist of the Great War: Raemaekers (Netherlands 1869). The use and result of what is recognised as modern warfare are documented in these publications.</p>"

        intro: 'Italian and foreign newspapers from the First World War period. This digital collection offers access to 1.256 issues of newspapers from the WW1 period.'
        body: "<p>Most newspapers are Italian special editions aimed to narrate the bloody war in Europe, for instance \"Il Giornale del Soldato\", \"La Guerra Italiana\", \"La Grande Guerra Europea\", \"Panorama\", etc. The images and the news presented by these journals track sentiment about the war week by week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Events of the war are detailed, creating a pictorial record of both the war effort and life at home. Some periodicals include an illustrated and photographed history of World War I that graphically documents the people, places, and events important to the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the collection includes foreign war newspapers as the famous \"The New York Tmes\" mid-week pictorial, which was printed by the advanced new technology of \"rotogravure\", which allowed reproduction of finely detailed photographs and illustrations (it was so popular that it was continued well into the Twenties).</p>"

They contain poems, sketches, short stories, jokes, plays, letters, editorial cartoons, articles and a wider commentary on military and civilian life written and illustrated by the soldiers. Produced, mostly unofficially, by every type of unit engaged in the war, they are a reflection of their units and were principally distributed only to the members of the unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trench journalism functioned to sustain morale and develop a military culture by providing outlets for soldiers to socialise, share accomplishments, and vent frustrations with military life. These unique, though little-known, journals provide an essential counterpoint to the official histories of the First World War.</p>"

It includes several war diaries by army lieutenants, because many combatants recorded the daily events of their experiences in the form of a diary.'

Also featured within this collection are personal narratives written by people who relate a given aspect of the war such as the testimony of such participants as nurses and chaplains. Finally, the collection also includes some letters and correspondences.</p>'

Those drawings are immensely informative and could even be considered as important historical documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They reflected the government and public attitude at that time and express the thoughts and fears, sentiments and emotions of people. The Great War of 1914-18 was certainly not one of the funniest events to be recorded on drawings. However, the sense of humour played a major part in maintaining the morale of troops and civilians during the war.</p>"

Official reports and publications deal with Indian troops, the war in the Middle East, and Indian government policy. For instance there are war diaries and records detailing pay increases for the ‘native army’ following the First World War, papers and correspondence of Admiral of the Fleet John Rushworth Jellicoe, first Earl Jellicoe, who served as First Sea Lord between 1916 and 1917, Douglas Haig’s account of operations on the Western Front, papers and correspondence of Horatio Herbert Kitchener, First Earl Kitchener, etc.</p>"

        title: 'Wickiana Collection of 16th century news reports'
        datatype: Data
        intro: "<p>The Wickiana Collection is recognised as one of the most significant collections of news reports and documents pertaining to current events dating from the 16th century. It contains single-leaf and illustrated broadsheets, pamphlets, prints, handwritten texts and drawings, including 439 illustrated broadsheets (woodcuts).</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>These time capsules form one of the most important archives pertaining to a particular epoch, namely that of the Reformation in Switzerland. Johann Jakob Wick (1522-1588), after whom the collection is named, was the clergyman at the Predigerkirche and its associated hospital in Zürich from 1552 and then second Archdeacon, and thus also Canon, at the Grossmünster in Zürich from 1557.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He assembled and arranged contemporary news documents chronologically between 1559 and 1588, also integrating further material from the period approx. 1505 until 1559 into his collection. In pictures and texts, the documents bear witness to contemporary life, reporting on such phenomena as natural occurrences – comets, earthquakes and floods -, physical deformities in animals and humans, sensational crimes and political events of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the comet of 1577 is described as “terrible and wondrous” (“schrecklich und wunderbarlich”). The collection can be regarded as manifesting the climate of crisis at a time of religious and political turmoil: Huldrych Zwingli (died 1531) had recently predicted the end of the world. Wick’s collection of documents may have been regarded by him and his contemporaries as harbingers of the Last Judgement.</p>\r\n"

        body: '<p>Top-quality colour lithographic images produced from black-and-white photographic negatives, a technology which reached its zenith before the First World War. The process was invented in the 1880s by Hans Jakob Schmid (1856–1924), an employee of the Swiss company Orell Gessner Füssli—a printing firm whose history began in the 16th century. Füssli founded the stock company Photochrom Zürich (later Photoglob Zürich AG) as the business vehicle for the commercial exploitation of the process and both Füssli and Photoglob continue to exist today.</p>'

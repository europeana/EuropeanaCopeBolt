The Fest will happen in the same channel. Before the hackfest, the teams will receive a list of experts who will mentor them with a 30 minutes session with up to three mentors during the hackathon.</p>\r\n"

Additional requirements could lead to burdensome or prohibitive conditions that make the system difficult to comply with by cultural heritage institutions. Instead, best practices can be agreed through the stakeholder dialogues.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Make use of the option to adopt <strong>cut-off dates</strong> to simplify the determination of what is out of commerce&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In line with the Directive’s article 8 and recitals 31 to 36 and 39 to 44, ensure that the exception to copyright applies when no <strong>sufficiently representative</strong> collective management organisations exist for the specific type of work and right. The sufficient representativity of a collective management organisation should be based on a set of objective criteria. Have clarity on when to consider a collective management organisation ‘sufficiently representative’.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Encourage early <strong>stakeholder dialogues</strong> through which cultural heritage institutions, collective management organisations and rights holders, by area of work, can have a constructive dialogue to ensure that the system works in practice.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information on what to advocate for throughout the transposition of the Directive, we recommend consulting the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Articles-8-11-Use-of-out-of-commerce-works-b0091ea89dac4cca96fe537293ed22e6#021099ecba134bd1aa7e93f335e8412c\">Communia guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/3552203#.YuEDSnZBxMw\">Guide for Libraries and Library Associations</a> by EBLIDA, IFLA, LIBER and SPARC Europe.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>How do the out of commerce works provisions relate to the Orphan Works Directive?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The out of commerce works provisions in the 2019 CDSM Directive and the exception defined by the 2012 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012L0028\">Orphan Works Directive</a> are two distinct systems that can be used by a cultural heritage institution when clearing of rights of in-copyright materials. Cultural heritage institutions should evaluate which option is more suitable to clear rights in the specific collection, but it should be noted that the orphan works exception is more limited in scope and is likely to be much more burdensome to use. Below we outline some of the main differences of each of the systems:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-32e843a7-7fff-0d67-a3e6-8a3ea4d22d70\">Scope: </b>the Orphan Works exception only applies to text-based, cinematographic and embedded copyright-protected material whose authors are not known or cannot be located. It thus leaves out relevant cultural heritage materials such as photographs and other materials that are not embedded. Instead, the out of commerce works provisions include any type of material as long as it was never or it no longer is subject to commercial exploitation. Most orphan works are likely to also be out of commerce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Obligations</strong>: The orphan works system requires a (cumbersome) diligent search to be conducted, with a list of mandatory sources and the obligation to record the search results. There is no such thing in the out of commerce works provisions, only a ‘reasonable effort’ to determine that the materials are out of commerce.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Exception, licence, remuneration/compensation</strong>: the orphan works system relies on an exception to copyright, in principle not remunerated, with no licence to be obtained. However, the opt-out by the rightsholder can lead to a compensation for the use made, to be paid by the cultural heritage institution. For out of commerce works, a licence should be obtained if a sufficiently representative collective management organisation exists. An exception applies if that is not the case. The exception is in principle not remunerated, and no compensation is foreseen for the use made in case of opt-out.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Directive describes out of commerce works as any type of materials that are in the permanent collections of a cultural heritage institution and are out of commerce. The Directive clarifies that these could be owned or permanently held, ‘for example as a result of a transfer of ownership or a licence agreement, legal deposit obligations or permanent custody arrangements’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By ‘out of commerce’, the Directive includes materials that were never in commercial circulation, such as unpublished manuscripts, sound recordings, photographs, amateur films, personal correspondence, etc., and materials that were in commerce, but no longer are. This determination can be done on the item as a whole, rather than by checking every possibly protected work or material contained in the item. Importantly, the Directive makes a few precisions in this regard, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">materials that are in commerce only to a very limited extent (e.g. in second-hand shops, or the theoretical possibility to obtain a licence) can be considered to be out of commerce</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">an item can be considered to be out of commerce even if there are adaptations of it (e.g. translations, derivative works) available in commerce</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">And an item should not be considered to be out of commerce if a version of it (e.g. subsequent edition) is still available in commerce</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive excludes sets of items consisting predominantly of materials from outside of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A more detailed overview of these conditions is available in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBT28EHlos0\">this presentation</a> at the <a href=\"https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/datathon-2022?inheritRedirect=true\">EUIPO datathon</a> (<a href=\"https://euipo.europa.eu/tunnel-web/secure/webdav/guest/document_library/observatory/documents/OOCWP/Datathon-2022/What_is_an_out_of_commerce_work-EUIPO_Datathon_en.pdf\">slides here</a>) as well as in the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Articles-8-11-Use-of-out-of-commerce-works-b0091ea89dac4cca96fe537293ed22e6#021099ecba134bd1aa7e93f335e8412c\">Communia guidelines</a>, the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/3552203#.YuEDSnZBxMw\">Guide for Libraries and Library Associations</a> by EBLIDA, IFLA, LIBER and SPARC Europe and the <a href=\"https://ifrro.org/page/resources-public/\">IFRRO guide</a>.</p>\r\n"

                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Article 8 of the CDSM Directive opens the possibility for member states to establish a cut-off date. The Directive does not go into any detail of what these could look like, but these should be generally understood as dates before which certain types of materials are presumed to be out of commerce. Cut-off dates simplify the ‘out of commerce determination’ that the cultural heritage institution needs to do by minimising the need to make a ‘reasonable effort’ to determine that materials are out of commerce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive clarifies that such requirements should not ‘extend beyond what is necessary and reasonable, and shall not preclude being able to determine that a set of works or other subject matter as a whole is out of commerce, when it is reasonable to presume that all works or other subject matter are out of commerce’. This could be, for example, the case of books in print where it is reasonable to believe that some are in commerce if the effort to conduct a search is reasonable, for example via automated processes when checking certain databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While some countries have recognised cut-off dates directly through the transposition text, some consider adopting them through further regulatory measures, and others, such as the Netherlands, are discussing possible options via the stakeholder dialogues to implement them through memoranda of understanding.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: ''

                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p>Not all countries that have transposed the Directive have adopted a cut-off date, but there are a few examples so far, and they generally consist of one of the following types:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c58b9009-7fff-7c7b-f33d-70061fb830fe\">‘Static date’: </b>a specific date before which certain types of works are considered to be out of commerce. The date always remains the same. For example, in Hungary, literary works last published in Hungary on or before 31 August 1999 are out of commerce, unless the contrary is proven.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c58b9009-7fff-7c7b-f33d-70061fb830fe\">‘A moving wall’: </b>a number of years before which certain types of materials are presumed to be out of commerce. The date will therefore move as years pass, opening the door to more materials being presumed to be out of commerce. For example, in France, all types of materials are considered to be out of commerce if their first publication or communication to the public dates back thirty years or more.\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Differently from the two types of cut-off dates described above, in which the presumption is for the out of commerce status, some countries have established a ‘static’ date after which certain types of materials are presumed to be ‘in’ commerce (‘Limited window’). For example, all books that have been published less than 10 years before a specific date are considered to be in commerce unless the contrary is proven.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the ‘types’ identified above, member states have brought in various specifications. For example, the Hungarian example contains a reference to ‘last’ published that requires an additional check for that date of publication. On the other hand, Italy refers to a cut-off date which in practice does not act like any of the cut-off dates described above, as it presumes that materials that are not available in commercial channels for at least 10 years are out of commerce, which in practice still requires making an out of commerce determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generally, a ‘moving wall’ is recommended over a ‘static date’, given that, as described above, as time moves forward more and more materials will likely become out-of-commerce. Using a specific date only produces a one time benefit for the cultural heritage institution, whereas a moving wall is a recurring benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is reasonable to expect that the duration of a cut-off date is adapted to the type of work, whose nature will determine the probability that it is out of commerce at a sooner or later stage. For example, Estonia’s cut-off dates are moving walls of 50 years for works in general, 20 years for serial publications, and five years for ‘pamphlets’.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'What is a ‘sufficiently representative’ collective management organisation? What criteria should be used to make such a determination?'
                subtitle: ''
                anchortitle: ''
                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Determining what is and is not a sufficiently representative collective management organisation is a crucial aspect. When no ‘sufficiently representative’ collective management organisation exists, cultural heritage institutions can make out of commerce works available online on the basis of an exception to copyright. Instead, when a ‘sufficiently representative’ collective management organisation exists, cultural heritage institutions can only publish out-of-commerce works by concluding a licence with such organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While it is for each member state to define what ‘sufficiently representative’ exactly means, we can confer from the text of the Directive that the collective management organisation must represent a significant number of rights holders in the relevant types of work, that this has to be determined on the basis of its mandates, and for one, some or all of the rights mentioned in the Directive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to be able to make such a determination in a way that is fair, transparent and non-debatable, it is important that clear objective criteria on the basis of accessible information are defined. This way, there can either be a joint agreement on which collective management organisations are considered representative on that basis, or cultural heritage institutions have sufficient information to make that determination by themselves and have a clear understanding on the situations in which they should seek to conclude a licence and the situations in which they shouldn’t, without facing any legal insecurity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of representativeness is also an important discussion point in the context of government-organised stakeholder dialogues. In the Netherlands, for example, cultural heritage institutions argue that if there is no collective management organisation that a cultural heritage institution would generally reach out to obtain a licence for works that are in commercial circulation, the collective management organisation in question should not be seen as being sufficiently representative for that same type of work when it’s not in commerce. The <a href=\"https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-copyright-legal-matters-working-group/\">LIBER Copyright &amp; Legal Matters Working Group</a> published a <a href=\"https://libereurope.eu/article/liber-statement-regarding-out-of-commerce-works/\">statement on out of commerce works</a> arguing that ‘LIBER is convinced that collective management organisations are not, and should not be, representative of the makers of works that have never been in commerce and/or were never intended to be in commerce’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Under the Directive, Member States are “free to establish specific rules applicable to cases in which more than one collective management organisation is representative for the relevant works or other subject matter, requiring for example, joint licences or an agreement between relevant organisations”. There is concern that if a cultural heritage institution is required to reach out to more than one collective management organisation for the same collection of works, this would make the process unnecessarily burdensome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An approach that has worked effectively is where one collective management organisation is the contact point and will re-distribute royalties with the other relevant collective management organisations, so that cultural heritage institutions only have one contact point. In Germany, for example, the collective management organisations for text (<a href=\"https://www.vgwort.de/startseite.html\">VG WORT</a>) and visual arts (<a href=\"https://www.bildkunst.de/en/homepage\">VG BILD-KUNST</a>) have worked together to facilitate the licensing of books and printed works to ensure that the entire content of a book with text and illustrations can be combined in ‘one licence’. In this process, VG WORT assumes the ‘leading part’ by taking over the billing, technical tasks and internal affairs between the collecting societies.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'Should ‘customary channels of commerce’ be defined and if so, how and by who?'

                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The lack of commercial availability of an item needs to be determined on the basis of checking ‘customary channels’ of commerce. According to article 8 of the Directive, ‘a work (...) shall be deemed to be out of commerce when it can be presumed in good faith that [it] is not available to the public through customary channels of commerce, after a reasonable effort has been made to determine whether it is available to the public’.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No definition or list of channels is provided by the Directive, but it does establish that ‘customary channels’ should take into account ‘the characteristics of a particular work’. While we recommend that if any channels of commerce are identified as relevant, these are not established as mandatory, but as good practice, in order to avoid reaching a situation similar to that of the orphan works exception. As described in the question ‘How are ‘out of commerce’ works defined?’, second-hand shops should not be considered as a customary channel of commerce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For books, a books-in-print database, in particular using ISBN numbers, could be considered a reasonable source to check, although it leaves out early works that were not catalogued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For sound recordings, Spotify, Deezer, and YouTube could be an option, and for audiovisual or film works, Netflix and similar platforms, as well as local streaming platforms. However, in order for this search to create the least burden possible, a source should ideally be open, free to use, and machine readable for it to be considered a suitable option, which is unfortunately not the case for streaming platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As regards other types of works: ISSN numbers could be checked for periodicals, ISMN for sheet music, and ISTC for textual works, as well as ISNI. In the field of visual arts, image libraries, image collective management organisations and auction house catalogues could also be consulted. Collective management organisation’s catalogues can also assist when they contain information about when works have been used in customary channels.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'How should ‘works contained in works’ be treated when determining whether a (main) work is out of commerce?'
                subtitle: ''
                anchortitle: ''
                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive clearly states that the determination of whether a work is out of commerce should be done on the basis of the ‘work as a whole’. This is a crucial concept that helps avoid a situation in which the determination of the ‘out of commerce status’ would be too burdensome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result, in principle, it would not be necessary to check the out of commerce status of photographs contained in a newspaper or of music contained in a film, for example. However, there might be situations in which the cultural heritage institution has ‘easily available information’ about a work contained in the ‘main’ work being in commerce. If this is the case, the cultural heritage institution could consider looking at the status of the works contained in the (main) work. This is as long as the process does not become unreasonably onerous or disproportionate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The notion of the ‘work as a whole’ is used in the Directive to refer to the determination of the ‘out of commerce status’. It is unclear whether this notion applies in other circumstances: for example if an author of a ‘work contained in a work’ decides to opt out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, the notion of ‘main’ work might require some consideration on a case by case basis. It could be questionable, for example, to consider a ‘collection of poems’ as the ‘main work’, leading to a situation where the commercial availability of the underlying poems is ignored, even if they may have also been published separately in the past and could be considered a ‘main work’ in themselves. The individual poems might be in commerce even though the compilation is not (and vice-versa). Cultural heritage institutions should make best efforts and act in good faith when doing these case by case analyses.</p>\r\n"

The Directive does not place any limitations on the website having to be that of the cultural heritage institutions: it is therefore possible to display the materials on a third-party website, such as that of an aggregator, as long as it is non-commercial. More permissive approaches might be established in certain member states through the transposition laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the Directive, cultural heritage institutions can legally share the materials in all of the European Union. When using the materials under the exception, a specific mandatory provision guarantees that this is the case, and it does so by creating a legal ‘fiction’ according to which any use of the out of commerce materials should be understood as taking place in the member state in which the cultural heritage institution is established. When using the materials under the licence, the licence should be able to cover uses in any European Union member state but not outside of the EU where the works might be still in commerce and where the EU legislation does not have jurisdiction.</p>\r\n"

They should be sector-specific (various dialogues should run in parallel) and should have representation from the cultural heritage sector, collective management organisations, and rights holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the Directive, these dialogues should be used to agree on possible best practices to determine what materials are out of commerce; ensure the relevance, adequacy of terms and publicity of licences; and provide legal certainty with regard to the representativeness of collective management organisations and the categorisation of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about the stakeholder dialogues in the questions that follow, in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/be-part-of-the-discussions-on-out-of-commerce-works\">this post</a>, as well as in the <a href=\"https://ifrro.org/page/resources-public/\">IFRRO guide</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Articles-8-11-Use-of-out-of-commerce-works-b0091ea89dac4cca96fe537293ed22e6#021099ecba134bd1aa7e93f335e8412c\">Communia guidelines</a> and the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/3552203#.YuEDSnZBxMw\">Guide for Libraries and Library Associations</a> by EBLIDA, IFLA, LIBER and SPARC Europe.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>What is a good setup for the stakeholder dialogues, and who should participate?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Directive establishes that stakeholder dialogues need to be sector-specific. Breaking up stakeholder dialogues into groups also makes them more manageable. For example, there can be dialogues on written works, audio (phonograms), audiovisual works, photographs, visual artworks, databases and software. There is no indication on the regularity or the duration in time of these dialogues, or the specific outcome that should be foreseen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As pointed out in the question above, each dialogue should at least have representatives from cultural heritage institutions, collective management organisations (if existing) and rights holders. The cultural heritage sector could be represented by sectoral institutions or can consider appointing a person from a specific institution. The person involved should have a strong copyright knowledge and/or knowledge on the practical implications of the decisions that might be made at the stakeholder dialogues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive does not preclude the possibility of inviting other types of organisation who can provide additional insight and enrich the discussion, for example into how the commercial exploitation of a type of work works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>If a government has not set up stakeholder dialogues even though the Directive has been transposed, how could cultural heritage institutions prompt these dialogues?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Setting up stakeholder dialogues is an obligation for all member states, as set forth in the CDSM Directive’s article 11. If governments do not initiate this process, cultural heritage organisations should approach their representatives to encourage the organisation of stakeholder dialogues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If this does not succeed, cultural heritage institutions could still seek to make progress by approaching collective management organisations and rightsholder representatives directly in situations in which it is clear that they are likely to be sufficiently representative. Through an informal dialogue with these organisations, important information can already be exchanged – including in relation to the licensing of future digitisation projects - and consensus can be sought. Such an approach, that would not preclude an agreement being made under formal, government-organised stakeholder dialogues, would help to advance work on digitisation projects and provide some legal security to cultural heritage organisations.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Whenever a sufficiently representative collective management organisation for the type of materials and rights in question exists, cultural heritage institutions should seek to obtain a licence from the collective management organisation in order to make the out of commerce works available online. It is therefore very likely that many cultural heritage institutions will have to enter into negotiations with collective management organisations for the dissemination of certain collections. In addition, the Directive clarifies that ‘a lack of agreement on the conditions of the licence should not be interpreted as a lack of availability of licensing solutions’, that is, the fact that the licence negotiations are not successful does not remove the obligation from having to obtain a licence. It is therefore essential for cultural heritage institutions that the licence negotiations lead to a positive outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to do that, it is important to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Enter the negotiations with a constructive mindset, leaving aside the belief that the conclusion of the licence might be unfair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Presume that the collective management organisation understands and is willing to support the cultural heritage institution’s mission and will not enter negotiations in bad faith.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Determine, ahead of the meeting, the concrete outcome expected, including the best-case and worst-case scenarios. Have clarity on whether you seek a licence for a very specific collection, or to initiate a negotiation for many collections and therefore understand the possible fees.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If the focus of the licence is on a specific collection, be familiar with its size, the type of materials that it is made of, the commercial ‘stakes’ that rights holders might have, how the materials are generally distributed and how long the commercial lifespan of the items generally is.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Familiarise the collective management organisation with the nature of the collection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                title: 'What should the text of a licence for out of commerce works between a cultural heritage institution and a collective management organisation contain?'
                subtitle: ''

                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Directive specifies that when concluding licences for out of commerce works, CHIs and collective management organisations “should remain free to agree on the territorial scope of licences, including the option of covering all Member States, the licence fee and the uses allowed”. For cultural heritage institutions, it is also important to make sure that the text of the licence provides clarity on the following aspects:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The materials covered, that is, the identification of the collections, and for example an acknowledgement that public domain materials are outside of its scope.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The type of exploitation authorised, which should at least foresee what is allowed by the Directive and the national law. In principle this includes reproduction, distribution, communication to the public or making available to the public via non-commercial websites. You could envisage having a clear identification of the websites through which the materials can be shared, e.g. the institutional website, a national aggregator and Europeana.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The duration of the licence.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A clarification that the licence is non-exclusive.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The territorial scope of the licence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The fees to which the exploitation of the materials are subject. Different approaches to agreeing fees are possible, including for example a fee per usage of the work, a lump sum for as long as the materials are out of commerce and in copyright, or a yearly indexed fee, for example. If regular payments are a burden on a cultural heritage institution, it is possible to instead aim at a one-time payment. The fee should be adapted to the nature of the works (e.g. whether they are more “recently” published or not).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about the conclusion of licences for out of commerce works in the <a href=\"https://ifrro.org/page/resources-public/\">IFRRO guide</a>.</p>\r\n"

In this case, they can approach the national collective management organisation who can in turn liaise with a collective management organisation in the other Member State.

Uses outside its territory fall under other jurisdictions or specific bilateral agreements covering such uses (contracts, partnerships, licences, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, cultural heritage institutions using the out of commerce mechanism can consider using technical measures preventing access to the works concerned from outside the European Union.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the works for which the collective management organisation has a mandate, the licence could be broader but it is not the case for works made accepted under the extended element of the licence or for works used under the exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Should cultural heritage institutions allow access from outside the EU to copyright-protected works that could still enjoy copyright protection and/or could be available in-commerce in territories outside the EU, without specific agreements allowing such uses, they would risk infringing the rights of the rightholders in the territory concerned and therefore become liable. To ensure legal certainty for cultural heritage institutions as well as for the EU, cultural heritage institutions should prevent access from outside the EU to the works they make available as part of the out-of-commerce mechanism, unless they can benefit from specific agreements covering the use of these works in other territories.</p>\r\n"

The platform encourages people to dive into audiovisual clips from various European heritage collections available on the Europeana website in detail in a friendly and fun way while enriching the clips for future use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The subtitles used by the platform are created automatically by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-subtitled-ai-pipeline-and-training-suite\">Europeana Subtitled AI Pipeline</a> which automatically generates closed captions and subtitles videos using automatic speech recognition and machine translation from EU languages to English.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Subbit! platform was developed by Translated as part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled Generic Service project.</a> The platform is currently only available in English, and can be used in several online browsers. The platform connects with Europeana by aggregating revised subtitles and closed captions via the Europeana Annotations API.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Benefits of the platform&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Subbit! platform encourages professionals and the general public to work directly with audiovisual archival content and European heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Events using the platform motivate participants to improve and practise their language skills.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The platform and events promote the call for more accessible audiovisual archival material for multilingual audiences and awareness of audiovisual online collections.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-f344f6c4-7fff-7601-c5e5-aad2c7979004\">How to use the platform</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A <a href=\"https://subbit.eu/how-it-works/\">Subbit! online training suite</a> consisting of 13 videos was prepared to introduce the platform, as well as offer&nbsp;training on advanced features of the tool.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the video below, Francesco Fedele of Translated, explains how you can use the Subbit! platform and invites cultural heritage institutions to organise community campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Video is a rich medium, but as a combination of different components - images and sound - it can be difficult to make it accessible. One way to address this is to add subtitles and translations to the videos, something which the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled project</a> worked on. This has included developing resources which offer cultural heritage professionals guidance about subtitling and translating audiovisual collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AI Pipeline</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To create the Europeana Subtitled AI pipeline, the project created and integrated two systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT). The first one allows the transcription of audio into the corresponding text, formatting it into proper closed captions. The second one translates the transcribed text from a local EU language into English, formatting it into proper subtitles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The subtitling pipeline allows data providers to generate automatic captions and English subtitles for thousands of videos in seven European languages: German, Greek, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Romanian and Slovenian. Approximately&nbsp;250 hours of videos were post-edited by professionals and compared with two metrics commonly used for the evaluation of machine translation: <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~snover/pub/amta06/ter_amta.pdf\">Translation Edit Rate (TER)</a> &nbsp; and the&nbsp;BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pipeline to automatically produce the subtitles was developed by the project’s technical partners, FBK and Translated, who adapted and optimised the ASR and the MT engines. The pipeline is an independent third-party service which is currently integrated with Europeana via the Europeana APIs. The pipeline will be maintained for at least three&nbsp;years after the end of the project and it will be developed further within the project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai4europeana-an-ai-platform-for-the-cultural-heritage-data-space\">AI4Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Training suite</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To explain the workings of the Europeana Subtitled AI pipeline, project partners created the Europeana Subtitled training suite, which consists of video tutorials and guidelines which outline the impact of automatic speech recognition and machine translation technologies and the use of the developed tools for the cultural heritage sector. The training suite was used for the instructor led training sessions in October and November 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The resources developed by the project below help cultural heritage professionals and aggregators to understand:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The steps you need to take to enrich&nbsp;audiovisual collections with subtitles and translation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Which variables to take into account to determine the usability of&nbsp;audiovisual collections, from training AI to publication with subtitles and translations</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Where to find more information in case you want start working on subtitles and translation for&nbsp; audiovisual collections</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An introduction to Automatic Speech Recognition and Machine Translation&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subtitling has been a manual process since its introduction in the early 1900’s. Today, computers can interpret the audio and guess what is being said through Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This transforms speech into text, which can then be used for Machine Translation (MT). For an outsider this might appear an easy process, but the process of generating ASR and MT is very complex. So complex that humans are still needed to improve and validate the groundwork that machines can do. In the video below, researchers Mauro Cettole and Matteo Negri explain what happens in the black box of ASR and MT.

For example:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How good are individual voices distinguishable from other sounds?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How good do speakers articulate their words? Do they have an accent that makes it harder to understand what they are saying?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Is the video you want to add ASR and MT to of the same period in time? Or do people speak differently from the dataset that was used to train the machines?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The determination if a video can be used for ASR and MT can be a case by case consideration. For some collections this can be a consideration on a collection level, for example for news reports by the same reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making improvements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To improve and validate&nbsp; the automatically generated subtitles and closed captions, the project partners created the Subbit! Platform, which allows the post edit of the machine generated enrichments by cultural heritage professionals and the general public through online edit campaigns. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/subbit-platform\">Find out more</a>.</p>\r\n"

In the book sector, it will cover many books published in the EU, solutions should be found with CMOs.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This exclusion does not apply if the out of commerce work is used under the licence and the collective management organisation in the country in which the cultural heritage institution is located can sufficiently represent that third country, for example because a representation agreement has been concluded. As a result of the logic described in the Directive, it should be understood that the exception would not apply in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exclusion applies to ‘sets predominantly consisting of materials from’ outside of the European Union. Sets that contain works from outside of the European Union, but where the majority of the materials are from within the European Union, can be used under the out of commerce works provision. However, in certain circumstances, materials are individually used and not as part of a set. In this case, and even though the Directive does not address this question in particular, the logic of the Directive would seem to point at excluding materials from third countries when evidence of that is available.</p>\r\n"

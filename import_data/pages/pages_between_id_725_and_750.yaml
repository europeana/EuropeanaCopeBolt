This is because web browsers restrict resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain it was served (Collections in this case). The CORS standard is needed because it allows servers to specify not only who can access its resources but also how these resources can be accessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is especially important for</p>\r\n\r\n<p>providers who share resources via IIIF as CORS is essential for our IIIF viewer to perform the image information requests and to obtain the presentation manifests. Without CORS, although the IIIF resources will be displayed in the provider’s website, it won’t be possible to be viewed in the Europeana Collections portal. For more information about <a href=\"https://enable-cors.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CORS</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HTTPS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providers of IIIF resources are encouraged to deliver their resources over HTTPS so that they can be included in our web page without issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Embedding of media resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for an item to be embedded in the Europeana Collections portal, there must be a valid <a href=\"https://oembed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">oEmbed</a> endpoint (see example from <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/oembed?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2F3d-models%2Fsaint-laurentius-church-of-ename-around-1500-9e5f19f6416942e49f1a7360d3043503\" target=\"_blank\">SketchFab</a>) available where the media referred to in the item is displayed using a third party viewer or player. An exception is made for some data partners that do not support oEmbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the metadata side, a link to a webpage where the item can be displayed and which can be mappable to an oEmbed URL is provided within edm:isShownBy. In order to do this and because there is no information in the metadata that relates the webpage link to the oEmbed endpoint, the Europeana Collections portal has to apply additional logic to convert the URL provided in edm:isShownBy into an oEmbed URL that can be used for embedding. For this, it uses an <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/europeana-portal-collections/blob/develop/config/initializers/oembed.rb\" target=\"_blank\">internal registry of oEmbed endpoints</a> which consists of both a public list and manual additions made by the Collections development team (which also includes the Europeana oEmbed implementations to cover the exceptions). This means that whenever a new dataset is added that uses a different oEmbed endpoint it will need to be added to this registry.</p>\r\n"

The competition encourages people to explore and remix cultural heritage material while also helping audiences to learn about image licensing in an interactive and fun way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIF IT UP is supported by <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifitup\">GIPHY</a>, the world's largest library of animated GIFs. GIFs created through the competition are featured on the site, helping bring the collections they are based on to even wider audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore previous editions of the competition below and check back on this page for updates on the next round!</p>\r\n"

        title: Transcribathon
        intro: "<p>Europeana Transcribe is an online citizen science initiative for the enrichment of digitised material from Europeana. Engagement with the platform is supported by events known as transcribathons.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About the platform</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/\">Europeana Transcribe</a>\_aims to engage the public in transcribing, annotating and georeferencing Europeana’s vast collection of digitised items - particularly handwritten materials - amassed from libraries, archives and museums from all across Europe. The tool offers another way for users to engage with the material shared through <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana</a>\_while also using crowdsourcing to enrich and enhance this material.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Benefits of the platform</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improved accessibility</strong>: Creating machine-readable enrichments opens up new possibilities for the analysis, distribution and reuse of digitised heritage material.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Public engagement</strong>: Encouraging the public to work directly with digitised cultural heritage artefacts encourages fosters a deeper understanding of European heritage and encourages new connections with history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digital skills</strong>: The platform encourages participants to improve their understanding of metadata, ability to read old and unusual writing styles and practice foreign language skills.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Digital inclusion</strong>: Transcription and enrichment open up new possibilities for digital inclusion, enabling text and data to be translated and automatically converted to audio, tactile graphics and braille.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meaningful contributions</strong>: Every enrichment or transcription made through the platform makes Europeana’s content more usable and searchable, and participants can see an immediate impact from their work.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the platform, Europeana regularly runs Transcribathon events in cities across Europe. Participants attending the events transcribe handwritten texts from Europeana or national aggregator platforms in teams and present their results to a jury. Prizes are awarded for accuracy and volume of transcriptions and the format offers an innovative way to engage participants with their cultural heritage. Contact Ad Polle for more information about holding a Transcribathon.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the physical events, thematic and competitive ‘runs’ are regularly held on the Transcribe Europeana platform. These showcase Europeana's rich and fascinating collections by highlighting content for transcription, and offer prizes for those who transcribe the most material in a set period of time.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/\">Explore Transcribe Europeana</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>For this issue of EuropeanaTech Insight we focus on 3D which is rapidly becoming one of digital cultural heritage’s leading formats and is an area where many institutions are building capacity and discussing approaches and principles. High-resolution 3D digitisation of archaeological monuments and historic buildings has become widespread for research, conservation and management; and 3D digitisation of museum objects is increasingly common. The take-up of 3D technology is bringing new opportunities for the sector - institutions are offering innovative and engaging ways for people to access heritage content for education, tourism and personal enjoyment. While 3D is helping the sector to address some challenges it is also throwing up new ones - how best to embrace 3D given access to new technologies and the speed of technological change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent EuropeanaTech task force on 3D content, led by Kate Fernie, explored how to increase the availability of 3D content in Europeana. In this edition of Insight, we’ve invited 4 contributors who were involved in the task force to discuss their institutions, projects and products related to 3D presentation of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s our hope that with these perspectives coupled with the final task force report EuropeanaTech can shine a light and bring attention to questions related to 3D digitisation and cultural heritage through Europeana and the sector at large.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: 'Ronald Haynes, University of Cambridge'

                templates: body
                body: "<p>If space is the final frontier, then we naturally turn to 3D images and models to help us explore and express that frontier. For the many aspects of space, and of our world, we have widespread options to produce good 3D models which are increasingly available to specialists and the general public alike, including on common devices. However, the many ways people scan, process, adjust, store, present and use those models create many challenges for us to readily share those models, whether in the present or in a sustainably preserved state to enable continued sharing well into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/\" target=\"_blank\">IIIF 3D Community Group</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework 3D group) has been an enthusiastic partner to the work of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">3D content in Europeana Task Force</a>, and is working with many 3D-active groups and developers engaged in the existing, as well as emerging efforts aiming to produce practical and interoperable 3D models, along with 2D (IIIF) image and 3D model integration. Just as the Task Force highlighted concerns about improving the policies, standardisation and means of delivery associated with 3D, the IIIF 3D Community Group is building greater engagement with partners in the academic, commercial and non-profit sectors who are keen to collaborate in advancing and developing 3D image technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While IIIF has developed a set of APIs (application programming interfaces) which are derived from shared use cases and based on open web standards, it is also a community that implements those specifications in both server and client software. This combination of collaborative casework and community development has helped IIIF coalesce ways to address many of challenges associated with the coordinated use of 2D images, notably in the cultural heritage and GLAM (Galleries/Gardens, Libraries, Archives, Museums) areas, and has similarly developed institutional interoperability with Audio/Video content specifications. The efforts to extend those developments to be more inclusive of 3D materials does, however, literally add extra dimension and complexity to the mix. (See the figure below for an earlier example of a lasting standard for 3D/VR, well preserved and digitally transferred to still be usable on modern devices.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/ronald1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center>Early Virtual Reality tech (1800s-present) – stereograms, a lasting standard! Source: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/SherlockHolmes1954\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.org/details/SherlockHolmes1954</a> (Episode 28) Public Domain</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the challenges facing the collaborative community work of the 3D Group, there are key considerations for preservation options (e.g. with the <a href=\"https://www.dpconline.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Preservation Coalition</a>, and <a href=\"http://gis.wustl.edu/dgs/cs3dp/\" target=\"_blank\">CS3DP </a>- Community Standards for 3D Data Preservation). Keeping sight of the required outcomes of sustainability and long-term usability is a helpful lens through which to focus the efforts, including regular reviews of practical approaches to scanning and capture or construction of models, and the strengths or otherwise of various file formats, whether preferable for size and transmission speed, for display clarity, for research details, and/or for effective printing. As noted in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/3D-TF-final%20report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Task Force report</a> there are many well-known file formats, including ones perhaps especially familiar to those involved in 3D printing (e.g. STL, PLY, OBJ, the ISO-standard AMF, 3MF – e.g. see: <a href=\"https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printer-file-format/\" target=\"_blank\">2020 Most Common 3D Printer File Formats</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for those concerned more with 3D display, especially display via the web – whether for research or clinical or general interest uses, we see more use of file formats such as <a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/gltf/\" target=\"_blank\">glTF</a> (GL Transmission Format, e.g. used by <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sketchfab</a>, <a href=\"https://www.morphosource.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MorphoSource</a>, Smithsonian <a href=\"https://3d.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">3D Program</a> and <a href=\"https://www.si.edu/OpenAccess\" target=\"_blank\">Open Access</a>), the ISO-standard <a href=\"https://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d\" target=\"_blank\">X3D</a> (e.g. key users in the <a href=\"https://www.web3d.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Web3D Consortium</a>), and the medically-oriented<a href=\"https://www.dicomstandard.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> DICOM </a>(standard for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, integrating data such as from X-ray, CT, ultrasound and MRI scans, along with patient information). (See the figure and video link below for an example of the 3D extension of the open source Universal Viewer, a standard for IIIF projects, in late development and being implemented in Morphosource for integrating 2D and 3D content.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsJ6BL9U9PQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<center>3D extension of <a href=\"https://universalviewer.io/\" target=\"_blank\">universalviewer.io </a>shown with glTF and DICOM models in <a href=\"https://www.morphosource.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Morphosource.org</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p>The variety of 3D file formats, along with the feature preferences and performance limitations which influence the selection process made for the main web-based viewer developments, is part of the inevitable process of reducing what is for many an unmanageable number of options and moving toward a more manageable set of formats. While niche or specialists file formats may remain for various purposes, improving file conversion options will continue to help in the transition to the more popular and increasingly common formats. This is the natural evolution toward practical and enduring standards, and the timing of the process will largely be down to the strength of uptake and persuasive influence by the collaborative community involved. Building on open standards for text and 2D images, and working together to ensure the seamless combination with 3D objects, should help reduce existing digital divides and increase overall accessibility, by ensuring the broadest overall data interoperability. In addition, it may be helpful to ccollaboratively clarify and develop guidance on file format selection (e.g. why certain projects choose to use glTF, X3D, DICOM, and related compression, or large-model options).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor which is expected to influence the move toward more manageable 3D file formats are the developments and adoption of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/\" target=\"_blank\">WebXR</a> (Web eXtended Reality, designed for delivering VR and AR to devices, including head-mounted displays, through the Web). This move toward device independence, and more universal development cycles via Web deployment, has significant support and deployment from organisations such as Amazon, Google, and Mozilla (e.g. see: <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Hubs</a>), Google. While not currently using WebXR, a good example of some of the great potential for putting the power of AR/XR more directly into people’s hands can be seen with the <a href=\"https://mergeedu.com/?cr=0750\" target=\"_blank\">Merge Cube </a>and their partners <a href=\"https://www.classvr.com\" target=\"_blank\">ClassVR</a>, with for instance some engagement experiments being trialed or planned in some museums in Texas, and at Harvard and Cambridge universities, as well as some course-related testing in Oxford University. (See the figure and video link below, for an example of some initial tests of using the AR/XR capabilities of the Merge Cube to display and interactively inspect cultural heritage models taken from Sketchfab.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTG9NLsEpWA\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Some initial experiments with Sketchfab models handled with the Merge Cube</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the details of an object’s width and height (e.g. X and Y axis), working in 3D raises the natural question of extending this by adding depth (e.g. a Z axis). There also are questions about annotation and metadata (with examples of work in progress to be seen with Universal Viewer and Morphosource and with the open source <a href=\"https://smithsonian.github.io/dpo-voyager/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian Voyager viewer </a>and the <a href=\"https://3d.si.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Smithsonian 3D Program</a>). There are challenges around finding or collectively identifying suitable reference workflows (e.g. to clarify the full set of equipment, process, people and capabilities needed for 3D production - ideally in an increasingly interoperable format), and about exploring options for smaller and less well-funded institutions to access suitable workflow and production options (e.g. through better joint funding or other means of ensuring the growth of interoperability).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To adequately attempt to address these challenges we plan to continue to liaise and work with other 3D-active researchers and groups, to build the alliances and collaborative efforts. We are reviving some previously-articulated 3D technical challenges (from a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/digital/iiif-digital-collections-in-dialogue\" target=\"_blank\">IIIF meeting at the V&amp;A museum</a> in London), to combine with more recent developments, along with gathering user needs and stories (e.g. see <a href=\"https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-3d-stories/issues\" target=\"_blank\">initial IIIF 3D examples and use cases</a>). We also are planning to organise further events to clarify a set of suitably-representative examples and use cases (including as part of the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/event/2020/boston/\" target=\"_blank\">2020 IIIF annual conference</a> <em>ed note: this event has now been postponed)</em>. The <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/\" target=\"_blank\">3D Community Group</a> is co-chaired by Ed Silverton (Mnemoscene, Universal Viewer), Tom Flynn (Sketchfab), and Ronald Haynes (Cambridge University) and meets monthly for a conference call. Please join us next time, share your user stories, and share in this evolving area – more details can be found via: <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/\" target=\"_blank\">https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>There is a great understanding that many of our important cultural heritage and archaeological sites are vulnerable and exposed to potential threats including natural disasters, human aggression and the ever-increasing impact of climate change. Once destroyed or damaged, these important structures and objects of our past are lost forever. Over the past decade, there is a growing recognition that 3D digital documentation methods can play an important role in the preservation of cultural heritage structures and objects. The 3D digital documentation of the cultural heritage objects and structures also enabled experts such as conservation scientists, archaeologists and historians to gain an incredible level of access to very high-resolution data, which in turn allows for the identification of new features and subtleties which are not easily recognised by the naked eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The 3D-ICONS Project </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2012-2015, the <a href=\"http://www.discoveryprogramme.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Discovery Programme</a> participated in the <a href=\"http://3dicons-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">3D-ICONS Project</a>: a pilot project funded under the European Commission’s ICT Policy, which established a complete pipeline for the production of 3D replicas of archaeological monuments, historic buildings and artefacts to contribute this content and the associated metadata to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the project, a selection of representative cultural monuments were recorded in Ireland, including the UNESCO world heritage sites of Brú na Bóinne and Skellig Michael and several others sites which are currently on the UNESCO tentative list including the medieval monastery of Clonmacnoise, the Royal site of Tara and the western stone forts of the Aran Islands. Many of these sites are National Monuments conserved and maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.archaeology.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">National Monuments Service of Ireland</a>, but also hugely popular with tourists and visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recording methodology employed to document these monuments and structure in high resolution was dependent on the scale of the site and could be divided into three categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Cultural sites defined by landscapes were documented using existing airborne laser scanning (ALS) resources, both from fixed-wing and helicopter-based systems (FLI-MAP 400).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Upstanding monuments and architectural buildings were surveyed using a Faro Focus 120 terrestrial laser scanner with geo-referencing provided via GPS corrections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Detailed objects such as carved stones and architectural details were recorded using an Artec EVA handheld optical scanner.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/anthony1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center>Recording the 3D structure of one the internal tombs at Knowth, Brú na Bóinne using a terrestrial laser scanner (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Initial Results</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although three very diverse techniques were employed in data capture, the result of this digitisation was similar across the project: high-volume, high-resolution 3D data. These scientific datasets are of exceptional value to engineers and architects and they can play a major role in monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage sites. Point clouds are an increasingly common survey output and most geomatics professionals are comfortable viewing and manipulating such data in specialist software. However, to the general public, such data can be very difficult to access and understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interaction normally requires installing third-party viewers, and navigating through the point cloud; an unusual environment for the inexperienced and can be disconcerting, as solid walls can appear transparent as the space between points increases on closer inspection. Also, 3D models have relatively large file sizes, commonly over 15 GB, which can be difficult to distribute via the web and a challenge to display on a standard computer.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/anthony21.PNG\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>&nbsp;View of the point cloud data collected at Staigue Stone Fort, Kerry Gaming Solution for Lightweight Modelling (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution came from applying techniques and software more commonly associated with the gaming industry and their creation of photorealistic game assets. By using a low polygon, retopologised model and employing UV texture maps (normal, ambient occlusion, colour maps) user perception of high-resolution models of cultural heritage objects was achieved but with much lower and manageable file size, with the final file size being approximately only 2% of the original. During the later phase of the project, the online 3D viewing platform Sketchfab had reached maturity and was the platform of choice for delivery of our content through the internet to a wide amount of users within both a desktop and mobile platform. Additional functionality has emerged over time including the ability to embed narrative within models and provide an enhanced virtual tour of many of the sites and monuments</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/anthony3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Application of the gaming modelling in the reduction in file size for online presentation of cultural heritage objects (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode\">CC BY-NC</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Continued Use of the Data </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EU funding of the 3D-ICONS project ended in January 2015, and as such, the project and its activities came to a close. However, the outputs and legacies of the project were far from over. In addition to the 230 Irish 3D models made available online during the project, the amount of 3D content being created by the Discovery Programme has now reached 400 sites, monuments and artefacts available both through Sketch Fab and the Europeana portal. The number of users following the Discovery Programme content within Sketchfab is now 8,500 user, with the top model receiving 59,000 views and provides the Discovery Programme with a great way to engage with new audiences whose focus isn’t primarily that of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<div class=\"sketchfab-embed-wrapper\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; vr\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://sketchfab.com/models/8fd7eb2762304af88b7745b98924b4e9/embed?preload=1&amp;ui_controls=1&amp;ui_infos=1&amp;ui_inspector=1&amp;ui_stop=1&amp;ui_watermark=1&amp;ui_watermark_link=1\" title=\"A 3D model\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal; margin: 5px; color: #4A4A4A;\"><a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/newgrange-co-meath-8fd7eb2762304af88b7745b98924b4e9?utm_medium=embed&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=share-popup\" style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #1CAAD9;\" target=\"_blank\">Newgrange, Co.

Through word of mouth, we became aware that the 3D-ICONS website (www.3dicons.ie) was being used as a classroom resource by primary and secondary teachers in local schools including the teaching of History of Art at Leaving Certificate level. In the first-year history class, teachers have utilised the 3D content to illustrate to their pupils the different monumental structures and historic art forms, encouraging the use of the content through using tablets and video projectors within the classroom environment. Also, teachers have used the resource to educated and orientate student before they visit one of the recorded monuments as part of a class trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourism: Ireland’s tourism attraction is strongly associated with the wealth of cultural heritage sites that appeal to visitors from around the world. The experience offered to the visitor ranges from free unguided access to controlled tours with restricted access, such as in the Brú na Bóinne World Heritage site. By repurposing the data collected within the 3D-ICONS project and adding additional content, models and visualisations the Office of Public Works (OPW), who manage many sites, has delivered a richer and increasingly interactive tourist experience. Laser scan data of a passage tomb; which is closed off from public access, has been made virtually assessable through the use of a high resolution, photorealistic rendered models which guide the public through this normally excluded space. In addition, high-resolution 3D models of megalithic art are now presented to the public in a purpose-built visitor attraction where they can view enhanced visualisations of the Neolithic artwork and understand the different artistic motifs used in the past. The ability to reuse data initially collected for conservation to enhance and valorise cultural heritage sites is a powerful proposition when considering the potential to propagate the use of 3D content across the range of 750 sites managed by the OPW.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/anthony5.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Still image from the virtual tour visitor experience installed at Knowth, Brú na Bóinne (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative Sectors: Through the identification of 3D content through portals such as Europeana and Sketchfab, the Discovery Programme has commercially licensed several 3D datasets to a range of creative sectors for reuse. These include film production companies who have used the 3D models for the pre-production process: enabling the visualisation and providing efficiency planning at filming locations and in post-production in the creation of visual effects. As many of the 3D models have been retopologised into lightweight versions, game developers have licensed content enabling them to reuse authentic, off the shelf models within their development pipeline. Architects have also reused content where the association of Cultural heritage sites to their own sites aids in their marketing. The Discovery Programme has also had the opportunity to license data to individual artists who have repurposed 3D data within their medium of choice, creating something completely new but also authentic artworks and based on our shared cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By developing often serendipitous reuses of the 3D data created by the Discovery Programme, it has highlighted the lack of formal structure and support in the promotion of 3D cultural heritage content across the range of potential sectors. The benefits of recording our finite cultural heritage objects in high-resolution 3D data do not only benefit the improvement of our understanding and management of this resource by professional sectors. By ensuring that this data can be promoted and reused by a wide range of sectors and actors benefits both the wider public in enabling access to their shared heritage but also to the authentic exploitation of our cultural heritage by several industries and the potential for this to partially fund some activities within the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Introduction.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D Data is a hot topic in the world of Cultural Heritage and a number of ongoing projects are developing guidelines and examples of how to aggregate 3D content to Europeana. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">The Europeana Common Culture project </a>3D activity, led by Trinity College Dublin, has been working with the 3D Content in Europeana Task force on best practice recommendations for 3D content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been working with <a href=\"https://www.tii.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">Transport Infrastructure Ireland</a> as an industry partner, who have provided a selection of the 3D cultural heritage data collected in the course of their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Using 3D content</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D content is complex, and how you publish it will depend on the expected use cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct download of a 3D model may be the preferred option for expert users and researchers. 3D printing is another use case for 3D content, typically requiring the download of a .stl or .obj file version of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downloading a model does not, however, provide a very satisfactory experience for the majority of users without access to specialised software. For these users, a browser-based interactive visualisation is much more useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As VR technology becomes more widespread and affordable, more and more users will also want to be able to view 3D content using a VR headset in addition to browser and download options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our 3D work, we wanted to look at options to enable each of these use cases for the 3D content aggregated to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Preparing 3D Data for Aggregation </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a National Aggregator, we are not involved in creating 3D data, rather we offer storage, preservation, discovery on a national portal, and aggregation to Europeana. This means that we have little control over the data capture process and we work with a wide range of 3D formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our aim was to create a semi-automated data processing pipeline which would rely primarily on open source software such as CloudCompare, Meshlab, Blender or programming-based solutions such as open3D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working with a dataset provided by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which consists of Terrestrial Laser Scans of Faro Focus S120 and Leica TS15. Some of the images in this article use the Dysert Bridge model from that dataset. These 3D files come in a range of industry specific point cloud formats with data points ranging from 3 million to 296 million. A point cloud file is essentially a set of points in 3-dimensional space, which when viewed together show an object or landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although such large files may be useful for research, 3D printing, and other specialised use cases, they are not ideal for web delivery or in-browser rendering. In order to generate more lightweight 3D models, we adopted a surface reconstruction method which removes some detail and specifies only the surface of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Pre-processing:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to construct a smooth surface, it is necessary to get rid of noise, outlier points, misalignments and gaps in the data using a variety of filters. Once this is done, a process called data decimation is used to downsample the data, reducing the number of points, while keeping original properties such as colours, normals, etc. intact. Data decimation uses procedures such as voxel grid or octree to average out similar points, simplifying the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Normal Computation</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normal computation is an important property of geometric surfaces and is required to implement the correct light source to generate shading and visual effects. In the case of a smooth surface, a normal is defined to be perpendicular to the point's tangent surface and hence represents a localised surface approximation for that specific given point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normals need to be oriented to make them consistent along a particular direction. An orientation method such as Minimum spanning tree (MST) or orienting normals along the main axes (e.g. x,y,z) gives us an approximation of the surface of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/kathryn1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: Visual depiction of computed normals (a) Indoor scene of a room, source Open3D (b) Dysert Bridge Co. Kerry with open3D (Source TII) (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>For smooth normal computation, we can specify the local surface as a plane, triangulation or quadratic depending on whether the point clouds have sharp edges, noise or curvy surfaces or specify the nearest neighbour extraction using octree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Surface Reconstruction:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surface reconstruction is the generation of a lightweight watertight surface for dense point clouds. We opted for the well-known Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm, an implicit surface representation technique that creates a 3D mesh from a point cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/flow-diagram.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: Poisson Surface Reconstruction Algorithm (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 4.0</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Steps involved in the algorithms are displayed through the flow diagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/kathryn2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: 3D Surface reconstructed of Beheenagh Bridge , Co.

We opted for open and neutral formats such as OBJ and STL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Aggregating 3D objects using EDM</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Share3D</a> project’s Dashboard tool serves as a good example of what constitutes rich EDM descriptive metadata for 3D content, while the<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/3dicons/3dicons-d51-report-on-3d-publication-formats-suitable-for-europeana\" target=\"_blank\"> 3DIcons project’s Report on 3D Publication Formats Suitable for Europeana</a> gives good guidance on file formats. There is little guidance at present, however, on how to map 3D content to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Publishing Framework identifies four different content tiers, each one with an associated scenario:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Tier 1: Europeana Collections as a search engine</li>\r\n    <li>Tier 2: Europeana Collections as a showcase</li>\r\n    <li>Tier 3: Europeana Collections as a distribution platform</li>\r\n    <li>Tier 4: Europeana Collections as a free re-use platform</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve Tier 1 the specific recommendations for supported content types typically specify that at least a thumbnail image and a link to the content file or to a webpage where the file can be viewed be provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Tiers 2-4 it is recommended that a higher quality version of the content file or an embeddable object is provided along with the thumbnail image. A link to a webpage where the file can be viewed may also be provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this for 3D content, the EDM record might include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>A thumbnail still image preview in the edm:Object field</li>\r\n    <li>A link to the 3D model file or to an embeddable object (e.g. Sketchfab embed code) in edm:isShownBy</li>\r\n    <li>A link to a webpage where the object can also be viewed in edm:isShownAt</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Careful consideration should be given to whether a direct link to a 3D model or an embed code is the best option. If your models are likely to be of more interest to researchers, then the downloadable 3D model file may be the most appropriate option. This is unlikely to allow the model to be visualised within the Europeana platform however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to appeal to the widest audience, an embed code is likely to be the best choice. Optionally, an additional downloadable 3D model file link might be provided in an edm:hasView element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3DIcons project recommended 3D PDF, HTML5/WebGL, Unity3D/UnReal and pseudo-3D as preferred content types. In fact, the most widely used 3D format in Europeana is 3DPDF. Typically, these datasets include a direct link to the 3DPDF file in edm:isShownBy. Unfortunately, Adobe is now dropping support for the creation of 3DPDF. Although still viewable via some PDF viewers, many viewers do not support the 3DPDF format, and there is no wide support for web-based viewers. The format also does not allow the 3D source object to be easily extracted for reuse which some other viewers do allow. Thus, despite the large numbers of Europeana 3DPDF objects, the Common Culture 3D activity is not recommending 3DPDF, instead focusing on WebGL viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sketchfab is one of the most popular WebGL viewers in use in Europeana Collections. It also benefits from the support of other projects such as Share3D which has developed a dashboard which integrates with Sketchfab and allows the creation of rich descriptive metadata and aggregation to Europeana via CARARE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An obvious advantage of online solutions such as sketchfab is that the content provider or aggregator doesn’t need any storage capacity. Sketchfab also has a built-in option to view a model with a VR headset. However, these are proprietary solutions which often involve costs depending on the size and number of objects published. There could also be issues with the longevity of the service or the intellectual property rights of 3D content shared on such platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self-hosted viewers such as 3DHOP or the Simthsonian’s Voyager require storage capacity and server hosting, but as open source solutions they may be more sustainable in the long term. We are currently looking into both Sketchfab and open source self-hosted options.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.morphosource.org\" target=\"_blank\">MorphoSource</a><sup>TM</sup> is a public web repository where subject experts, collection curators, and the public can find, download, upload, and manage three dimensional (3D) (and 2D) media representing physical objects, primarily biological specimens. Soon the site will support cultural heritage and other object types as well. Compared to other online resources, the strength of MorphoSource is in its support for the specific, emerging needs of users for whom 3D imagery is data and evidence for research and education. Specifically, it emphasizes paradata including support for 1) describing the sometimes complex acquisition and modification narratives for 3D media, 2) deep nuanced metadata for 3D and 2D imaging modalities, and 3) efficient tracking and managing of media by collections organizations. MorphoSource is the largest resource for biological 3D data with regard to data depth (~100,000 datasets) and diversity (30,000 specimens and 12,200 species). As a result, it has extensive adoption by its research community (~11,000 active users, 200,000 downloads, and 3.7 million views) and growing impacts for scholarship (~550 citing publications) as well as education. Once upgraded with cultural heritage object support (est. Fall 2020), the repository will run on a Ruby on Rails web application. The MorphoSource Rails application is a specialized data management platform dedicated to providing deep support to independently operated collections organizations for archiving, curating, and managing access to 3D and 2D media representing, based on, or related to physical objects and data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Challenges and Benefits of 3D Data Representing Physical Objects</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D digitization of physical objects provides an enormous opportunity to accelerate advances in and access to knowledge related to natural and cultural history, biodiversity, geology, geography and culture. Compared with access to a physical object, access to a 3D digital object can allow a user to examine more quantitative (and often otherwise inaccessible) information related to shape, materials, or internal structure. Additionally, 3D digital objects provide unparalleled accessibility, because users are not hindered by geographic distance or the number of other individuals and/or machines simultaneously examining that same virtual object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For academic use cases, there are also significant challenges associated with purely virtual examination of physical objects. Principally, there is a risk that the virtual object is not a reliable representation of the physical object, or that the virtual object becomes inaccessible or misrepresented over the long term due to data corruption, lack of context, or file format obsolescence. This risk must be addressed and minimized as much as possible. There are several key components to mitigating such risks: 1) granular documentation of 3D image creation and modification (i.e., paradata); 2) use of open and supported file formats; and 3) use of standardized data models and metadata terms by repositories as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parenthetically, we note that these challenges are much less of a problem for 3D imagery that is not intended to accurately represent a physical object of natural historical or cultural relevance (e.g., a 3D painting of a toy unicorn), or in cases where the imagery is meant to summarize interpretations based on physical objects in order to express academic concepts (e.g., a 3D animation of a beating heart). In other words, we are focused on issues associated with 3D imagery that are meant, in some sense, as data for analysis or evidence of something that exists/existed in the real world. MorphoSource Rails as a repository platform has been created specifically to address the particular challenges associated with these 3D data, which differentiates it from other available web 3D resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Media Preview Of 3D Models and Volumes</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though much of the rest of this article will be devoted to the use of MorphoSource Rails to preserve provenance and the details of image acquisition narratives, equally important is providing potential users with tools to quickly and easily preview and even work with the 3D data in the repository. When displayed next to essential metadata on image data format, dimensions, and resolution, these previews dramatically facilitate users’ ability to determine whether a particular dataset meets their individual needs. By default, Hyrax supports the IIIF-compliant <a href=\"http://universalviewer.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Viewer</a>, which provides web-embeddable media previews for a diversity of 2D media and document formats. While the Universal Viewer is an excellent open framework, the collective developing it has not yet had the opportunity to build out strong 3D support. To provide deeper support for 3D, MorphoSource has collaborated with <a href=\"https://mnemoscene.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Mnemoscene</a> and created <a href=\"https://github.com/aleph-viewer/aleph\" target=\"_blank\">Aleph</a>, a web viewer for 3D models and volumes that can be used by itself or natively as a Universal Viewer extension. This viewer leverages open source frameworks for robust 3D display, including Three.js, A-Frame, and AMI Medical Imaging Toolkit, and has been built to be extendible for future AR/VR applications. Figure 1 below shows an embedded Aleph/Universal Viewer preview of a biological specimen object which is interactable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://morphosource-demo.lib.duke.edu/universalviewer/dist/uv.html#?manifest=/concern/media/qf85nb306/manifest&amp;config=/universalviewer/dist/config.json\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1. An embedded interactive 3D preview of a biological specimen object.</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Representing Complex Image Acquisition Paradata</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most difficult problem we have seen data producers, repositories, and community-standards groups struggle with is how to record image acquisition paradata in a granular standardized way while also accounting for the diversity and complexity of data creation workflows. MorphoSource Rails addresses this challenge with a data model (Figure 2) that represents media, physical objects, imaging devices, and other things as a network of “entity” records that can be related to each other using “event” records (i.e., “objects” and “events” from the PREMIS Data Dictionary). Each record, whether representing an entity or an event, has specialized metadata for describing that object or action. Media files are related to both the record of the “physical object” they represent and the record of the “device” or tool used to image that object by an “imaging event” record. A complex series of derivative media can then be represented as a long chain of parent and child media entities connected by processing events.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/Figure2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2. Schematic diagram of MorphoSource Rails data model. The workflow shown is that of a relatively simple CT scan imaging process.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Agents or users are not tied directly to data creation workflows: data are contributed through a user or team MorphoSource Rails account (Figure 2, bottom row and management icons throughout). Ownership and management rights flow from and can be modified by users and teams. As part of this management functionality, users and teams determine how and by whom data are accessed or modified. Organizational teams are special certified user groups that officially represent a collection or imaging facility organization. They have default management status for all specimens associated with their organization and view access to all media associated with specimens they manage. Records associated with an imaging event and derivative chain can be owned by multiple users and teams in an ad hoc way. Any user can create projects containing media for the purpose of tagging resources used in lesson plans or research articles, for example. Users can create projects that give special access permissions for media they own to any number of other individual users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This data model maps to virtually any image creation scenario and supports the long and complex image acquisition workflows and data relationships required for scientific and academic use cases that treat imagery as data (Figure 3). Our submission form anticipates that raw data may often be unavailable, and our processing event structure anticipates that some users will prefer to use one event to specify multiple sequential processing activities, while others might specify the same workflow through multiple events with fewer activities in order to preserve a number of intermediate media files (Figure 3A). In addition, during data submission, users are required to choose an imaging modality from a controlled vocabulary, which allows preloading of modality-specific metadata profiles and restricts allowable formats for media upload.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/Figure 3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3. Schematic diagram demonstrating the ways in which the MorphoSource Rails data model allows the platform to have a UI supporting complex image acquisition narratives. 3A shows how the processing event model can reflect the creation of a photogrammetry model with only initial and terminal media archived, a variety of intermediate media, or any point between these extremes. 3B shows how the data model can describe media resulting from multiple imaging events or even multiple imaging modalities.</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>An Example Photogrammetry Deposit</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To demonstrate the flexibility of this approach, we present an example deposit of a cultural heritage object imaged with photogrammetry (Figure 4). The cultural heritage object here is <a href=\"https://nasher.duke.edu/artwork/2213/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pacha with ears of corn</em></a>, an Inca vessel dated to 1438 – 1532 in the collection of the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University and imaged by the Wired Lab for Digital Art History &amp; Visual Culture, Duke University. Figure 4 below is a screenshot of how this model is represented on MorphoSource Rails. The upper portion shows the initial top page view of this media object. A short description of the media, including its status as a cultural heritage object and the physical object which it represents, is indicated in the header banner. Below this, the media can be previewed and interacted with to the right. To the left, primary media metadata is provided, including title, creator, file format, and relevant data resolution properties such as the number of points and polygons for this 3D model. Though it is not shown, immediately below this page view a user would find metadata relating to licensing, citation, ownership, and other similar information, as well as other media related to the current media.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/Figure4.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 4. MorphoSource Rails media show page. ¬</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The lower portion of Figure 4 shows the MorphoSource Rails media show page scrolled down to the section Image Acquisition and Processing in Detail. In this section, the complex image acquisition paradata that led to the creation of the current media are displayed. The first two collapsed events – Image Acquisition and the first Image processing – describe the creation of a collection of raw-format camera images and a derived collection of masked TIFF-format images generated from the raw-format images. The first expanded processing event visible here describes the creation of a dense point cloud media file from the masked images. The final processing event describes the two processing steps used to generate the current media, a textured surface model, from the dense point cloud. Each of these event sections contain a link to the media that was generated from that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://morphosource-demo.lib.duke.edu/universalviewer/dist/uv.html#?manifest=/concern/media/79407x19s/manifest&amp;config=/universalviewer/dist/config.json\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5 is an embedded view of the decorative art object described above using the Aleph viewer, and is interactable.</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important priority for MorphoSource Rails is to provide extensive and customizable support for collections organizations (Figure 6). Collections with little institutional infrastructural support will benefit most from utilizing the MorphoSource web repository and cloud storage. Larger institutions with greater means to produce and host large numbers of datasets and international institutions may prefer other options. Specifically, we expect larger institutions to be interested in leveraging the tools MorphoSource has built for documenting paradata, generating interactive previews, and managing downstream use of data, while still utilizing their own storage infrastructure. We are very interested in beginning collaborations to attempt federations of locally managed MorphoSource instances. Please reach out to us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/3D/Figure6.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 6.

Cultural heritage institutions are facing immediate and real issues, yet have also quickly risen to the challenge, with numerous online initiatives to stay connected to their audiences through digital culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The need to embrace and support the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage sector and to do so in an inclusive way, has never been more important. The vision of this strategy, a digitally powered cultural heritage sector taking its place at the heart of society, is confirmed. The building blocks of the strategy to support that, remain the same. The priorities for its implementation in the near and longer term are and will further be reflected upon as the immediate and post-crisis challenges become clearer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whatever our ‘new normal’ will look like, Europeana will continue to work with and for the cultural heritage sector to empower digital change, in response to this crisis and in the longer term.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Europeana should never simply follow the latest trends. Where it has specialist expertise, it should lead them. Where that expertise lies with other organisations or networks, it should collaborate with them. And it&nbsp;should always contribute to a Cultural Commons that benefits institutions and citizens. Here are four trends that influence our strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Public expectations</strong><br />\r\nCultural heritage institutions are increasingly expected to embrace openness and participatory processes and to make the public part of their curatorial processes. This changes the traditional institutional culture – from exclusive, introvert and authoritative to open, inclusive and&nbsp;collaborative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Market forces</strong><br />\r\nCultural heritage institutions work with global players such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple as well as with commercial image services and digital solutions based in their own countries. These partnerships are important. But a strong public alternative is crucial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Technological innovation</strong><br />\r\nTech is changing all the time. Europeana can help the cultural heritage sector to use technologies in ways that support its digital transformation - to lead with technology, not be led by it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Global perspectives</strong><br />\r\nClimate change is putting physical heritage at risk. As a community, the Europeana Network Association can surface concerns, approaches and best practice for responses at both institution and sector level. Both the climate crisis and the COVID-19 crisis remind us to work together as a global community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>What does this page show?\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data presented on this page is collected via the ENUMERATE survey, a bi-annual survey which collects data from cultural heritage institutions across Europe. The goal of this survey is to create a reliable baseline of statistical data about digitisation, digital preservation and online access to cultural heritage in Europe. This page explores whether the presence of a digital strategy has an effect on internal expenditures and activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is a digital strategy?\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the ENUMERATE survey, a\_digital strategy is a plan of action which clarifies how your organisation will go about the digitisation process. It could elaborate on the presentation of your online collection, your acquisition policy, the process of digitising the analog collection or your organisation’s policy for digital sustainability. Having a digital strategy could have an impact on certain aspects of an institution’s activities.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you dive in, take a look at our user's guide on how to navigate the data visualisations in the Power BI Dashboards.</p>\r\n"

The goal of this survey is to create a reliable baseline of statistical data about digitisation, digital preservation and online access to cultural heritage in Europe.

                title: 'NAISC-L: An Authoritative Linked Data Interlinking Approach for the Library Domain'
                subtitle: 'Lucy McKenna, Christophe Debruyne & Declan O’Sullivan'
                anchortitle: 'NAISC-L: An Authoritative Linked Data Interlinking Approach for the Library Domain'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>In 2017 we distributed a questionnaire to Information Professionals (IPs) in libraries, archives and museums (LAMs) in order to explore the benefits and challenges that they experienced when using Linked Data (LD) [1]. Of the 185 responses, over 60% indicated that LAMs face multiple barriers to using LD particularly in the areas of LD interlinking, tooling, integration, and resource quality. A more in-depth exploration of the interlinking issue highlighted that the processes of ontology and link type selection (determining and describing the relationship between two entities) were areas of particular difficulty. Participants also mentioned that LD tools are often technologically complex and unsuitable for the needs of LAMs. With regards to data integration, participants indicated that mapping between different vocabularies used across datasets poses a significant challenge. Participants also expressed concerns regarding the quality and the reliability of many currently published LD resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to the results of the survey, we developed a LD interlinking framework and accompanying tool specifically for the library domain. This framework and tool are summarised below, however, a more in-depth description of the framework can be found in McKenna, Debruyne and O’Sullivan (2019) [2]. We also discuss trialling NAISC-L at the Irish Traditional Music Archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Semantic Web and Linked Data</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Web contains a vast amount of information presented in the form of documents linked together via hyperlinks. In order to find specific resources on the Web, search engines are used to rank webpages based on relevancy via keyword searches. While this is done to great effect, unlike humans, computers have very little understanding of the meaning of data on these webpages nor do they understand how they relate to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Semantic Web (SW) is an extension of the current Web in which individual units of information/data are given a well-defined meaning, and where the relationships between data are defined in a common machine-readable format [3]. These units of data are known as entities and an entity could be a person, place, organisation, object, concept or Thing. <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data.html\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Data (LD) involves creating unique identifiers</a> for these entities and then linking them together by meaningfully describing how they are related. Entities can be linked to endless amounts of other related resources, creating a Web of Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A LD dataset is structured information encoded using the Resource Description Framework (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/RDF/\" target=\"_blank\">RDF</a>), the recommended model for representing and exchanging LD on the Web. RDF statements take the form of subject-predicate-object triples, which can be organised in graphs. Subjects and objects typically represent an entity such as a person, place or Thing, and predicate properties describe the relationship between the two. RDF requires that Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs), such as URLs and permalinks, are used to identify subjects and predicates. An object can also be identified by a URI or by a literal (i.e. plain text). These URIs allow for the data to be understood by computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Linked Data Interlinking</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LD is classified according to a 5 Star rating scheme(https://5stardata.info/en/) and, in order to be considered 5 Star, a LD dataset must contain external interlinks to related data. LD interlinking describes the task creating a relationship between an entity in one LD dataset to an entity in another LD dataset. Interlinks can be used as a way of representing that both entities describe the same Thing or as a way of indicating that they are similar or related to one another in some capacity. Such links have the potential to transform the Web into a globally interlinked and searchable database allowing for richer data querying and for the development of novel applications built on top of the Web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon reviewing the data on the Linked Open Data Cloud (https://lod-cloud.net) for some of the leading library LD projects, such as those of the Swedish (<a href=\"http://libris.kb.se\" target=\"_blank\">LIBRIS</a>), French (<a href=\"http://data.bnf.fr\" target=\"_blank\">BnF</a>), Spanish (<a href=\"http://datos.bne.es/inicio.html\" target=\"_blank\">BnE</a>), British (<a href=\"http://bnb.data.bl.uk\" target=\"_blank\">BNB</a>) and German (<a href=\"https://portal.dnb.de\" target=\"_blank\">DNB</a>) National Libraries, it was found that the majority of interlinks are to authority files and controlled vocabularies. Although these types of interlinks are extremely useful, there is a notable lack of interlinks created for purposes outside of authority control. For instance, interlinking could also be used to enrich data by linking to external resources that provide additional information and context for a particular entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Our Research</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of our research was to develop an interlinking framework that would encourage the creation of different kinds of LD interlinks and that was designed with the needs of the library domain in mind. In order to remove some of the challenges experienced by librarians when working with LD, we also developed an accompanying graphical user-interface which was designed to be used by metadata experts rather than technical LD experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>NAISC-L</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NAISC-L stands for Novel Authoritative Interlinking for Semantic Web Cataloguing in Libraries. The word NAISC (pronounced noshk) is also the Irish word for links. The NAISC-L approach encompasses a LD interlinking framework, a provenance model and a graphical user-interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NAISC-L interlinking framework is a cyclical, four-step method to creating an interlink (as outlined below in Figure 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1 NAISC-L Interlinking Framework (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Step 1: first requires the user to select entities, from an internal dataset, which they would like to create interlinks from. The user is then required to search for and select entities in external datasets which they would like to create interlinks to.</li>\r\n    <li>Step 2: guides the user through the process of selecting a property/predicate that accurately describes the relationship between an internal and external entity, thus creating an interlink. This process first requires the user to determine the type of relationship between the two entities using a natural language term e.g. ‘is identical to’, ‘is similar to’, ‘is associated with’. Following this, the user is then presented with a list of properties/predicates which represent the selected relationship type. Using the provided property definitions and examples, the user is then guided to select the property most suitable for interlinking the entities.</li>\r\n    <li>Step 3: involves the generation of provenance data, using the NAISC-L provenance model, that describes who, where, when, why and how an interlink was created.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Step 4: involves the generation of the interlink and provenance RDF data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The NAISC-L provenance model uses <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/\" target=\"_blank\">PROV-O</a> as its foundation as it is the W3C recommended standard for describing provenance data and because it can be easily extended for domain specific purposes. We used PROV-O to describe who, where and when an interlink was created. We then extended PROV-O to include interlinked specific sub-classes and properties. This extension, called NaiscProv (see Figure 2), is used to describe how and why interlinks were created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: NasicProv PROV-O Extension (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The above framework and provenance model are accessible to the user via the NAISC-L graphical user-interface (GUI). The purpose of the GUI is to guide users through each of the steps outlined in the framework. An iterative user-centred design approach was followed in the creation of the GUI meaning that Information Professionals were involved in a series of cyclical tool design and testing phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1 of the framework is represented on the GUI similarly to the image in Figure 3 below. Here the user can enter a label, URI and a description of a particular entity. The user also has the option of describing the entity as per the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (<a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FRBR</a>) model in order to aid in the interlinking process. In the case of selecting a Related Entity, the user is presented with a list of LD datasets in which they can search for a Related Entity. Each of LD datasets were given a quality score based on three quality metrics – Trustworthiness, Interoperability and Licensing. The datasets included in NAISC-L were selected based on the results of the 2017 survey, discussed above, from which a list of commonly used LD datasets was derived. As part of the same survey, participants were asked to select the evaluation criteria they apply when using/searching for external data sources, the results of which informed the quality metrics chosen for dataset analysis. The aim of providing this data quality score was to assist users in selecting high quality and authoritative resources to interlink with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: Entity Selection (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2 of the framework is represented in a step-by-step process which guides the user in selecting the type of relationship type between a pair of entities (see Figure 4 and 5), followed by selecting a property which represents this relationship (see Figure 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure4.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 4: Related Entities (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure5.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5: Relationship Type Selection (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure6.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 6: Property Selection (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3 of the framework is completed automatically by the tool (e.g. date, time, user), except, when creating an interlink the user is required to enter a justification for the link in order to provide the ‘why’ portion of the provenance model (see Figure 7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure7.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 7: Justifying an Interlink (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4 of the framework is again completed automatically by the tool.

Figure 8 below demonstrates a visualisation of a single interlink - in this case a link between the entity for James Joyce’s short story ‘The Dead’ held in the Bibliothèque national de France (BnF) to an entity for a collection of items related to the story held in the library of University College Dublin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Lucy/EuropeanaImages/Figure8.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 8: Interlink Graph Visualisation (created using <a href=\"https://gojs.net/latest/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">GoJS</a>) (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Using RDF Turtle syntax, Figure 9 below demonstrates the provenance of the interlink (*<http: 61=\"\" 96=\"\" interlink=\"\" linkset=\"\" naisc.adaptcentre.ie=\"\">) displayed in Figure 8.

ITMA was recently involved in the LITMUS (<a href=\"https://www.itma.ie/litmus/info\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Irish Traditional Music</a>) project which focused on the development of the first LD framework tailored to the needs of Irish traditional song, instrumental music, and dance. The project included the development of the LITMUS ontology to represent contemporary and historical Irish traditional music practice, documentation and performance, as well as the LD pilot project. This project involved using 20 years of TG4 Gradam Ceoil (Irish music awards) performance data in order to create a LD dataset which demonstrated the use of the LITMUS ontology and vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over one working week, three Information Professionals (IPs) at ITMA used NAISC-L for a short period each day in order to create a set of 30 interlinks. These interlinks created connections from some of the people/groups mentioned in TG4 Gradam Ceoil LD dataset to related entities in the Virtual International Authority File <a href=\"http://viaf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">(VIAF</a>), an OCLC-hosted name authority service. The aim of these interlinks was to provide authoritative information on specific individuals or groups, as well as to create links to other libraries which contributed to the VIAF record for these entities. Such links could be used to guide ITMA patrons to related resources held in other institutions and, in turn, direct VIAF users to data held at ITMA. The IPs who trialled NAISC-L found the framework and interlinking process to be engaging, functional and useful for their needs. The IPs were able to use NAISC-L as part of their cataloguing workflow and, even though the IPs had little to no prior experience with LD, all were able to successfully create interlinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Future Directions </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the NAISC-L trial at ITMA, some minor suggestions to improve the GUI were made by the IPs. Using this feedback, the GUI will be updated and, once complete, NAISC-L will be made available as an open access interlinking tool for libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A demo of NAISC-L can be found @ <a href=\"https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~mckennl3/naisc/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.scss.tcd.ie/~mckennl3/naisc/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>References</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] McKenna, L., Debruyne, C., &amp; O'Sullivan, D.

                anchortitle: 'Digital Sources and Research Data: Linked and Usable'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Max Planck Institute for the History of Science can draw from a comparatively long history of digital scholarship, notably through its ECHO (Cultural Heritage Online) initiative that began to digitise historic sources and publish them on the web as early as 2002. Since then and continuing until the present day, research projects from various fields have been studying, annotating, and contextualising digital sources that have become increasingly available in recent years. In addition to common scholarly outputs such as books or journal articles, these projects produce digital outputs in the form of websites, databases or virtual exhibitions – typical artefacts of digital humanities research. Maintaining these artefacts has proven to be challenging: unlike their physical counterparts they do not end up in the library and instead live on scattered servers and ageing software systems. This makes maintaining long-term access to these resources difficult, and ensuring that they are usable and interoperable with evolving digital technologies nearly impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>MPG-DRIH: Our Solution to Securing Research Data and Restoring the Digital Research Lifecycle</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While natural and social sciences have been dealing with collecting and archiving research data for a long time, this term entered the humanities quite recently. Research data in the humanities in the form of published books (stored and catalogued in libraries) and unpublished paper collections (stored and often at least catalogued to a rough extent in archives) has remained stable over many decades. Scholars follow certain rules of citation and add bibliographic data to their work to make their research comprehensible and traceable. With the transition to a large variety of digital publication environments, and especially new formats of publication, this system changed and caused the previously well-functioning research lifecycle (Figure 1) to crack. The lifecycle works on the basis of scholarly publications, which build on existing publications and flow back into retrieval and archival systems. Libraries have reliably accumulated publications over centuries and thus secured the functioning of the research lifecycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since research projects have become more digital, we face the growing challenge of digital research data produced by various projects at our institute and scattered across numerous websites and databases in different formats. The format of scholarly output is changing: currently this output does not necessarily flow back into any reliable information system that guarantees persistent data retrieval, and the research lifecycle as we know it from the print age is disrupted. A question that, in our opinion, is still under-addressed in the current and widely-led discussions about research data and suitable research data infrastructures for the humanities is: What kind of research data are we dealing with in the different disciplines? At the MPIWG we are dealing mostly with (digitised) books, articles, artefacts and archival sources. Research projects currently produce, besides publications in traditional formats such as papers and monographs, scholarly annotations in databases and websites, virtual exhibitions, podcasts and videos. When setting up new digital projects, researchers tend to “reinvent the wheel” over and over again. Due to a lack of technical standards we are often ending up with research data that is tied up with different (outdated) software, making it incompatible with each other, and which finally causes valuable data to vanish. Offering our researchers a suitable set of standards right from the start of their project is therefore one of our most important aims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ambition with the digital research infrastructure MPG-DRIH is to close the digital research lifecycle: to make sure that digital research outputs can be discovered, accessed and reused. We achieve this through the adoption of a common model to represent our digital knowledge and the implementation of linked data technologies for data storage and exchange. About three years ago a team of librarians and IT researchers began to develop MPG-DRIH, a digital research infrastructure for the humanities to address an immediate need: the ability to maintain digital humanities research outputs in ways that they remain accessible and usable in the long term. The most important part of the philosophy guiding us through the project is to separate data from software. From the beginning we design the projects for end-of-life. Our aim is to retain the data, while we most likely will not be able to retain neither custom user interfaces nor ageing software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Library, Research IT and Scholarly Projects – Building a Growing DH Framework through Fruitful Collaboration</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cooperation between library and research IT professionals in this project has proven very successful and has shaped a clearer vision of where in the framework of research data management future responsibilities, expertise and fields of work will have to be situated. Another crucial point for the successful development of our infrastructure is a close collaboration with humanities scholars: a close involvement of library and IT professionals in humanities research projects means they gain a thorough understanding of the kind of data that is produced as well as the requirements towards an infrastructure to store the data. In our experience, all sides benefit immensely from this collaboration. Exchanging ideas and expertise helps humanities scholars to develop their projects within a digital framework and to explore digital methods right from the beginning. Using – for example – controlled vocabularies early on opens up many more opportunities to explore data at a later stage. Using controlled vocabularies and digital research tools means not only adding a new lick of paint to the same result, but also has a noteworthy impact on the research process and methods themselves, leading them step-by-step towards genuine digital research: what has been understood for some time now under the term “digital humanities.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time the librarians gain significant new expertise: they extend their traditional fields of work and increasingly grow into the field of data modelling, becoming consultants for scholars when it comes to picking specific vocabularies and terms to model their data. Since librarians are experts in metadata, their development towards data modelling is quite clear; the significant difference is that their work now enters the research process at a much earlier stage. While in the print age librarians only started to produce metadata once the result of the research process was finished, they are now acting from the beginning and throughout the entire research process as consultants for data modelling. This enables librarians as well as IT professionals to ensure that the research data can be integrated into retrieval and archival systems once a research project ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Architecture and Tech Stack</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture we developed for our infrastructure is comprised of three main components: a repository as a permanent storage for digital and digitised sources, working environments for scholars to conduct their digital research, and a knowledge graph (Figure 2). The repository implements tried and tested standard software such as Fedora Commons, as well as standard interfaces to resources, such as the image exchange API IIIF. The working environments contain two areas: the project-specific software environment and the data archive. While researchers are working on a project, they use specific software and custom interfaces that may not be usable and maintainable in the long term and which therefore will be switched off at the end of a project. What remains after a project has ended is the research data, which is stored in the data archive along with a mapping onto a common data model, which will then be ingested in the knowledge graph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the knowledge graph we realise our vision of making all our digital artefacts – be they sources, annotations or entire research databases – centrally accessible and usable. The system is not specific to our use case but has from the start been developed in exchange with other Max Planck Institutes who will themselves adopt the system and contribute their research data to an inter-institutional knowledge graph. Key challenges are to bring data from various sources together in ways that retain the original context and detail, and to provide users with an environment in which they are able to make sense of this vast information resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A knowledge graph in our use-case is a means of storing data in a way that is interlinked and semantically meaningful. The interlinking is based on the principle of linked data, a concept coined by the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners Lee. Instead of linking webpages through hyperlinks, which is how the web still largely operates, linked data connects individual pieces of data. To achieve this, every single piece of data needs to be made identifiable through a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This makes linked data immensely useful for our research lifecycle because it allows scholars to reference not only books and documents, but also datasets and even individual data points. Many resources are already linkable through URIs. The Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) for example provides identifiers for persons, works and locations, among other things, and Wikidata as an open structured knowledge base contains identifiers for almost anything. This means that for many things researchers need not to invent new identifiers, but can link to existing references, which in turn connects their research outputs to a growing linked data cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linking to references is also one building block of what we mean by our knowledge graph being semantically meaningful. By linking to an authority record on, for example, Paris (the city), a researcher can make evident that they are not talking about Paris (the mythological figure), or vice versa. What is often implicitly evident for humans, or can be described in written publications, needs to be made explicit in digital data. This is especially the case when data needs to live on its own, separate from software interfaces that might provide context to human users. We address this challenge by harmonising all input data to a common model with which we can, to a certain degree, represent the complexity of humanities research data: CIDOC-CRM, a reference model for harmonising cultural heritage data. Besides providing classes for common types of entities such as persons or places, CIDOC-CRM formulates a language for describing events and processes. In the humanities and especially in history we cannot take for granted that certain terms and processes are universally understood and remain constant. For example, an author of a 12th-century manuscript has little in common with an author of a present-day publication. The processes of writing and book production, and what we are able to know about them, are strikingly different. Using CIDOC-CRM we can represent an author of a manuscript not by using the term 'author', but by modelling the processes of the creation of a text according to our understanding that we are able to derive from historic sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that our knowledge graph becomes extremely detailed – it has to be in order to store what we need it to – but at the same time rather complex to navigate. To make such a rich graph usable, we implement a user interface built on <a href=\"https://www.researchspace.org/publications.html\">ResearchSpace</a>, a software system based on the semantic data platform <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/metaphacts/metaphacts-community\" target=\"_blank\">Metaphacts Open Source Platform</a>. ResearchSpace implements a search interface that operates on an additional abstraction of the data that represents all entities and processes on a small set of fundamental categories and relations [2]. The author of a 12th-century manuscript may then be found by simply searching for the 'creator' of a 'thing', while the detailed description remains accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we have successfully implemented a pilot [1], which is accessible online. We started to implement the entire system together with our partners in September 2018 and are currently deploying the first version of it at our institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Esther/lifecycle.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: The main components of our digital research infrastructure (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Esther/architecture2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: The Research Lifecycle (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>References</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] Kräutli, F. and Valleriani, M., 2018.

                anchortitle: 'Design for Simple Application Profiles'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application profile (AP) has been a defining feature of Dubin Core-style metadata since the early years of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. \"Application profile\" was <a href=\"http://(https://web.archive.org/web/20190924035542/http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue/25/app-profiles/\" target=\"_blank\">defined in 1999</a> as a schema with \"elements drawn from one or more namespaces, combined together by implementors, and optimised for a particular local application\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, profiles take many forms with respect to base vocabularies and to other profiles. Some profiles are subsets of a vocabulary (or of another profile), while others are supersets. Some profiles use terms from a single namespace while others \"mix-and-match\" terms from multiple namespaces. Some profiles are expressed in HTML, PDF, or spreadsheets for human consumption, while others are coded in database, programming or schema languages for machine processing. In practice, profiles have a wide range of uses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>To document community consensus.</li>\r\n    <li>As templates for creating data.</li>\r\n    <li>For analyzing or validating data.</li>\r\n    <li>For merging or selecting data from multiple sources.</li>\r\n    <li>For ingesting data from others.</li>\r\n    <li>For retrieving or displaying different views of data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-2000s there was a push to formalize the model for application profiles, or \"description set profiles\", on the basis of a <a href=\"https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/abstract-model/\" target=\"_blank\">DCMI Abstract Model</a> and to encourage the documentation of profiles with functional requirements, domain models, and user guides the <a href=\"https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/singapore-framework/\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles</a>. In 2008, a draft Description Set Profile Constraint Language <a href=\"http://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dc-dsp/\" target=\"_blank\">DC-DSP</a> proposed a language for expressing application profiles as sets of templates that could be matched against instance data to validate conformance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These specifications achieved little traction among metadata implementers due, in large part, to their strong basis in RDF, which at the time was itself only just getting traction in the form of Linked Data. A W3C workshop in 2013 reviewed existing approaches, including DC-DSP, and led to the finalization of Shape Expressions <a href=\"http://shex.io/shex-semantics/\" target=\"_blank\">ShEx</a> and Shapes Constraint Language <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/)\" target=\"_blank\">SHACL</a> -- powerful and expressive schema languages that superseded the simpler DC-DSP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A Simple Tabular Model for Application Profiles</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2019, the <a href=\"http://dublincore.org/groups/application_profiles_ig/\" target=\"_blank\">DCMI Application Profiles Interest Group</a> (DCAP-IG) has revisited the DC-DSP model but from a different angle. The goal now has been to enable \"spreadsheet-enabled\" non-experts -- people who are more comfortable with Excel or Apple Numbers than with XML, SHACL, ShEx, or Python -- to create application profiles in a simple tabular format that can be used to generate actionable validation schemas. The first iteration of this Simple Tabular Model for Application Profiles (AP-STM) was presented at SWIB19, and in 2020, the Interest Group continues to discuss <a href=\"https://github.com/dcmi/dcap/tree/master/prototypes/\" target=\"_blank\">variant prototypes</a> of this model.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/swib/simple1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Simple example (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple tabular model is being designed to support:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The most common and basic use cases for profiles.</li>\r\n    <li>The creation of profiles in a tabular format by the \"spreadsheet-enabled\".</li>\r\n    <li>Conversion into PDF or HTML for human consumption.</li>\r\n    <li>Conversion into validation schemas in XML, SHACL, or ShEx.</li>\r\n    <li>Use, when required, as a stepping stone to more complex profiles expressed in schema languages.</li>\r\n    <li>Simple documentation for users in multiple languages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/swib/languageEG.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Goal: A small set of value types (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Design choices</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, the Simple Tabular Model should be simple enough without being too simple. Issues and tasks that are still open as of April 2020 include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Defining a small vocabulary of column headings in plain language that makes sense to non-experts.</li>\r\n    <li>Defining a core vocabulary of value types such as Literal, IRI, IRI Stem (base URI), Pick List... (see illustration below).</li>\r\n    <li>Clarifying how value constraints can be expressed in (ideally) no more than two columns (e.g., value type `IRI Stem` plus value <a href=\"http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/\" target=\"_blank\">`http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/</a>`).</li>\r\n    <li>If the AP-STM model is to conform to the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 4180 format for Comma-Separated Values (CSV</a>), which does not support tabbed spreadsheets, deciding whether namespace prefixes should be declared in additional columns or separate files.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentation of the model will need to include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>AP-STM Model specification, defining the structure of templates and terminology used.</li>\r\n    <li>Example AP-STM instances: CSV files filled in with constraints used for describing specific types of thing, such as paintings or books.</li>\r\n    <li>Examples of validation schemas in XML Schema, SHACL, or ShEx generated from the AP-STM instances.</li>\r\n    <li>Conversion scripts, such as Python programs for generating ShEx schemas from CSV files.</li>\r\n    <li>Example instance data validatable by the example schemas.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Wikidata entity schema example</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The example presented at SWIB19 is a small proof of concept that shows the simple tabular format being used to produce Wikidata entity schemas.

In the <a href=\"https://github.com/johnsamuelwrites/ShExStatements/tree/master/examples/wikidata\" target=\"_blank\">ShExStatements project</a>, John Samuel has improved on the code for converting AP-STM tables into ShEx schemas for validating Wikidata items.

                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.performing-arts.eu\" target=\"_blank\">The Specialised Information Service Performing Arts</a> (SIS PA) is part of a funding programme by the German Research Foundation that enables libraries to develop tailor-made services for individual disciplines in order to provide researchers direct access to relevant materials and resources from their field. For the field of performing arts, the SIS PA is aggregating metadata about theater and dance resources from currently, mostly, German-speaking cultural heritage institutions in a <a href=\"https://vufind.org/vufind/\" target=\"_blank\">VuFind</a>-based <a href=\"https://www.performing-arts.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">search portal</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we focus on metadata quality and its impact on the aggregation workflow by describing the different, possibly data provider-specific, process stages of improving data quality in order to achieve a searchable, interlinked knowledge base. We also describe lessons learned and limitations of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Julia/Fig1_jb.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1. Schematic depiction of a knowledge graph in the performing arts domain. (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC </a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\" target=\"_blank\">0</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Challenges in Aggregation</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata that is aggregated in the SIS PA origins in different branches, i.e. libraries, archives and museums, different types of performing arts such as theater, dance, puppetry or performance art and overlaps with other disciplines like filmmaking and music. Due to this variety, in which different standardizations and archiving workflows are preferred, the gathered metadata tends to be very heterogeneous in data format, metadata standard, data model and vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, differences in scope and detail of description as well as the handling of entities yields further challenges for the aggregation process. Especially the description of performances as some data is described object-centric while other collections focus on the description of events. In order to give the user a preferably consistent search experience, it is important to normalize this heterogeneity and make the collections linked and searchable on common entities and terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Workflow</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from the originally delivered metadata, the current workflow to achieve aggregated linked data that researchers can access in the discovery system consists basically of four stages: (1) thorough analysis and documentation of the delivered data, (2) preprocessing of the original data, (3) modeling and transforming the preprocessed title and authority data to EDM for more interoperability, (4) postprocessing, interlinking and enrichment of the entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Julia/Fig2_jb.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2. Data workflow from originally delivered data to enriched data that is indexed in the search engine. (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC </a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\" target=\"_blank\">0</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>1 – Data Analysis</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first stage involves thorough analysis of the delivered metadata in cooperation with the data providers to understand the data structure and given information. This step is key in improving the search experience for users because it determines where what kind of information is found in the collection. The metadata is validated to find possible problems like invalid data and duplicate or missing identifiers that need to be handled in-house. A short analysis report for the data provider is written that documents statistics and facts about the data. It further contains a first draft on how the data could be mapped into the SIS PA data model regarding the content of the data fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis reports can also be used to find common structures and vocabularies in the data and generate best practice guidelines about performing arts related metadata. This knowledge is shared among others with the study group ARCHIV of the Society for Theatre Studies in Germany. In addition, we are following the activities in other projects on performing arts data like <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Performing_arts\" target=\"_blank\">WikiProject Performing arts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2 – Preprocessing</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second stage, where most steps are data provider specific, the metadata is preprocessed which means that it is prepared to be mapped into the internal SIS PA data model which is based on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM). Since most of the data is delivered in XML serialization and XSLT mappings from the Europeana community transforming XML files to EDM can be reused, all data that is not delivered in XML is converted to XML in this step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Huge data files are split into smaller, more manageable batches while one-record-files are merged to larger batches. Depending on the original data quality and standardization, special characters like non-sort characters are normalized and certain free text data fields are parsed to make their content available for the search. Normalization is also needed if the content is not strictly following the rules of a certain metadata standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>3 – Mapping</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After normalization, the data is mapped into an extended version of EDM. Deeper insights into the extensions of the data model to make it meet the needs of performing arts can be found <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-for-performing-arts-metadata\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Besides reusing existing mappings from the community, several new mappings to EDM were written for individual data models following the findings of the analysis report. This transformation maps the original data fields into the corresponding EDM classes and properties on a very basic level. Further enrichment will be done in the next stage in order to be able to do as many enrichment and normalization steps as possible in the same way for all data providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hierarchies and other relations between records are preserved or generated if possible. If a data provider delivers their own authority data that is not already linked to e.g. GND or VIAF, this data is mapped to EDM contextual classes like edm:Agent or edm:Event as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>4 – Enrichment</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fourth workflow stage, which is enriching, all data is gathered in an XML database and is normalized once more. Date values are mapped to UTC standard, while language values are mapped to ISO standard. The data is validated in terms of missing mandatory fields, collection hierarchy errors, plausibility checks for dates and other problems that might have occurred during the mapping. After the title records are normalized and validation errors corrected, authority records from data providers and authority identifiers used in the title data are gathered and stored in a separate authority database. This authority data is matched to the GND as it is widely applied in the German speaking community and some of the data providers make use of it already. By means of the <a href=\"http://blog.lobid.org/2018/08/27/openrefine.html\" target=\"_blank\">lobid-gnd service</a> that is integrated into Open Refine’s reconciliation tool, authority records from data providers are matched to the GND and a project team member checks manually if the match was correctly made (s. Figure 3 as example for matching results). As authority records that do not exists in the GND yet are added during the project, the GND is gradually complemented with more agents and events from the performing arts domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Julia/Fig3_jb.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3. Results of the current GND matching task for the local agent database of the German Dance Archive. (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC </a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\" target=\"_blank\">0</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>For all GND identifiers used in the data, the GND entity dump from the German National Library is loaded to enrich the authority data. For example, alternative labels in the authority index help to improve search results and occupations that are based on a common vocabulary enhance faceting. In case the data contains GND identifiers that are no longer valid, these are replaced by the associated new GND and the GND type is corrected if it is not corresponding to the contextual class. After enrichment is done, the performing arts knowledge base can be used for various purposes. In the SIS PA, the title and authority data are indexed each into one search index core and are accessible through the <a href=\"https://www.performing-arts.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">project’s discovery system</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to achieve metadata roundtripping, the results of the analysis and enrichment are given back to the data provider in form of simple .csv files. The files contain, if applicable, corrections and normalizations like the standardization of date and language values as well as concordance lists of local authority identifiers and GND identifiers. This process offers the possibility to enrich the original database of a data provider. Though, as many data providers do not have the capacity or technical support to automate the import of metadata, the modified data is often ingested manually if time allows which simultaneously allows for verification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Lessons Learned</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thorough analysis of the delivered metadata in close cooperation with the data providers in order to make the data as useful and findable as possible is key in upgrading the search experience for users. By working together and exchanging results, the data quality can be improved both for the data provider and the aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the matching task from literals to entities is hard to automate retrospectively and prone to error, we noticed it is important to make data providers aware of this problem so that the in-house data preferably already contains authority data. We did not attempt to match literals without further information to authority data yet as the automatic matching approach on in-house created authority data already lead to errors that had to be corrected manually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also learned that the use of database and pipeline tools can improve the workflow substantially. XML databases like <a href=\"http://www.basex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BaseX</a> that are made for the task of managing huge amounts of XML can reduce the process time immensely while pipeline tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/luigi\" target=\"_blank\">Luigi</a> can help to keep track of all the small steps of the process.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'Empirical evaluation of library catalogues'
                subtitle: 'Péter Király, Gesellschaft für wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung mbH, Göttingen'
                anchortitle: 'Empirical evaluation of library catalogues'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>How should a book be described properly? This question has a long past (and an even longer future) with several proposed methods which evolved over time. In the current epoch in the history of cataloguing or in other words bibliographic control we see the end of a period, and the start of a new one. In the past decades practitioners and researchers called attention to different drawbacks of MAchine Readable Cataloging, shortly MARC (see famous witty phrases such as “MARC must die”, or “Stockholm syndrome of MARC”), and there is an intensive research on the next generation of the proper bibliographic metadata schema and format, but MARC is not only still with us, it also makes the overwhelming majority of catalogue records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When in the 1960-s Henriette Avram and her colleagues invented MARC the available information storage space was much less than it is nowadays, so the information should be compressed, therefore one of the main technical features of MARC is that wherever a piece of information could be described by an element of a closed list of terms this path has been chosen. The record contains abbreviated forms, while the standard describes the abbreviated terms in detail. It makes the human understanding of MARC difficult in its native form, but makes the machine readability and thus validation easy. Theoretically at least. The problem is that during the decades while the basic structure of MARC remained the same, MARC continued to grown into a giant standard, with a number of such small or big dictionaries (which sometimes are externally developed and maintained by other organizations, such as the content classification schemes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the current research is to estimate the quality of the records by measuring structural features, and find those records which could be improved. With the statistical analysis librarians and those who would like to work with or understand data for different purposes can get an overview of the catalogue. This overview might be helpful as well in the transition to the new bibliographic format. Knowing the data is necessary every time, independent of the format. The research is manifested as an open source software called Metadata quality assessment tool for MARC records. The tool's source code is available in the following repositories: <a href=\"https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc</a> (backend with a detailed user guide), <a href=\"https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc-web\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/pkiraly/metadata-qa-marc-web</a> (web based user interface). A demo site with the catalogues of Universiteitsbibliotheek Gent (Belgium) is available at <a href=\"http://134.76.163.21/gent/\" target=\"_blank\">http://134.76.163.21/gent/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the ideal form of metadata assurance workflow follows a particular cycle (of which the the tool covers steps 2-4):</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>ingest/transfer data from the catalogue to the measuring tool</li>\r\n    <li>measuring individual records</li>\r\n    <li>aggregation and statistical analysis of the record-level metrics</li>\r\n    <li>reporting</li>\r\n    <li>evaluation with domain experts</li>\r\n    <li>improving the records within the catalogue (if necessary)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with other open source MARC tools, the main characteristic of this one, is that it handles semantics of the data. The tool contains a Java model of the MARC21 standard, so it keeps track the following information about MARC data elements: name, URL of the definition, acceptable codes and their meaning, value constraints, indexing rules, corresponding FRBR functions, historical codes, applicable dictionaries, BIBFRAME name (if there are) and other rules. It is built in an extensible fashion, so the ruleset covers not only MARC21, but several MARC variations, such as the Deuthche Nationalbibliothek's MARC version, OCLC MARC (not fully implemented), and locally defined fields in different libraries (Gent, Szeged, Finnish National Library). When the tool reads a MARC record, it creates a triplet for each data element: location (field, subfield etc.), value, the definition of the data element. Thus way, it can validate all the data against its definition. Since the definition, or a machine readable format of MARC standard is not available elsewhere, the tool provides a way to export this data model export into a JSON scheme called Avram (named after the creator of MARC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool runs a couple of measurements. Their results (stored into CSV files) are rendered by a lightweight web interface. The user interface is intended for the librarian, and it also contains a search interface for the catalogue, in order to connect the results of the analyses and the records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Validation</b></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/peter/validation.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Validation results grouped by error types (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/peter/validation-details.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Individual errors. The columns are: location (where the error occurred), problematic values, link to the standard, number of occurrences, number of records (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The validation analysis iterates all parts of the records and checks if the value fits the content rules, e.g. it has a proper abbreviation, the date encoding represents a real date, or the ISBN/ISSN numbers are valid. It groups the errors according to their location (record level, control field, subfield etc.). A common problem in almost every catalogue is that they use data elements which are locally defined but without publishing their documentation. In those cases, it is not possible to decide if the value of such an element follows the rules or not, thus the user interface provides two statistics: errors including these problems and “clear” errors. The result of validation of 16 different library catalogues was published in Király, 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/peter/completeness.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p>This analysis checks how field groups, fields and subfields are distributed in the collection. Field groups are the large categories under which the MARC standard lists individual fields, such as Numbers and Code (fields 01X-09X), or Edition, Imprint (25X-28X). The resulting tables show how many records contain a particular data element (both in count and percentage), shows the occurrences, its central tendencies (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum). The tool also shows the top terms within the data element, and the user can see which records contain that element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Functional analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/Julia/functions-with-scales.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Functional analysis (details). The y axis represents number of records, the x axis represents percentage of the enabling fields available in records. (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The FRBR defines 12 functions (such as search, identify, sort, display) which should be supported by bibliographic records. Delsey initialised a map between these functions and the individual data elements. The analysis at this stage checks how much portions of the data elements belong to a function are available in each record, then visualize the histograms of the support of functions. Since a usual record contains about 200 data elements, while the map handles more than 2000 elements which support functions (the MARC21 defines about 3000 elements), even the “richest” records can not support more than 10-15% of the functions, so the histograms display a relative support. It's intended use is to compare the support of individual functions, so the librarian can conclude that a catalogue has more data supporting selecting than searching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subject (classification) analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/peter/classification.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5. (in 'Subject (classification) analysis' section) (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In MARC, there are fields to support different methods of content description. The analysis checks all these fields and explores how they are used: how many records have at least one content description, how many terms are attached to the record, what kinds of classification schemes or Knowledge Organisation Systems (KOS) are used, what are the additional fields alongside the term (such as the source of the term, the version of the KOS etc.) The user interface provides links to the list of individual terms within a KOS, where the terms' links trigger searches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Authority name analysis</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authority names are more similar than subjects in terms of it provides normalized names for persons, meetings, corporates and even titles, which may or may not contain additional information, such as identifiers to vocabularies, dates and titles associated with the name, nature of contribution in the current record. This analysis follows the structure of the subject analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Weighted completeness</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/SWIB19/peter/weighted-completeness.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 6. (in 'Weighted completeness' section) (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Completeness of MARC fields</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simple completeness takes the same importance for every field. In the literature, there are two suggested solutions to add weights of fields to emphasize importance. Thompson and Traill setup a scoring calculation for 19 data elements giving points by occurrences (in the range of 0 to theoretically unlimited). Their purpose was to select the best from MARC records vendors provided alongside ebooks. Carlstone followed a similar strategy but she was interested in MARC records of electronic serials (here a record might have negative numbers if it misses particular data elements). The tool implements both analyses, and provides visualizations for the score histograms (both for the total score and the individual factors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Future plans</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming period, I would like to concentrate on the details of the KOS, particularly on two questions 1) if the record refers to a hierarchical KOS, whether it uses generic or specific terms (located close to or far away from the top-level terms of the hierarchy) 2) If we see the catalogue as a graph in which the records represent the nodes and subjects represents edges which connects records together, what are the nature of this network. Another development direction is to enhance the tool to cover other formats such as PICAplus and UNIMARC. I work together on these tasks with Verbundzentrale des GBV (Göttingen), ZBW – Leibniz-Informationszentrum Wirtschaft (Hamburg) and the Agence bibliographique de l'emseignement supérieur (Montpellier).

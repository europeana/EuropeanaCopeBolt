        intro: "<p>This partnership aims to promote the digital preservation of Chinese - Asian - European cultural heritage through digitisation of cultural resources</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana China is a joint initiative from the China National Center for Culture Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ‘CASS’, Recursive Technology, PostScriptum and Europeana Foundation. It began in December 2018, and aims to promote the digital preservation of Chinese - Asian - European cultural heritage through digitisation of cultural resources. In particular, the partnership will:\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Facilitate cooperation between research and cultural institutions in China and Europe in the fields of digital cultural heritage;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Explore possibilities for exchange of knowledge and best practices concerning digital cultural heritage platforms;\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Explore ways to promote Chinese cultural heritage in Europe and, respectively, European cultural relics in China.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Activities and outcomes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Events</strong><br>\r\nThe initiative was promoted at two high-profile events in China and Europe. At the invitation of Tsinghua University, Europeana’s Executive Director Harry Verwayen presented Europeana at the International Symposium on Cultural Heritage Conservation and Digitisation (CHCD) in Beijing on 13-14 September 2018. This biannual event attracts foreign experts from over 30 countries and regions, promoting a tradition of international collaboration and exchange on the theme of cultural heritage, digital technologies, conservation and digitisation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the Europeana China initiative was promoted during a dedicated networking session ‘EU-China: Silk Road Cultural Dialogues’ within the framework of the ‘ICT2018: Imagine Digital – Connect Europe’ event, organised by the European Commission and the Austrian presidency in December 2018 in Vienna. The session provided the opportunity to establish a closer relationship between interested parties from the digital cultural sector in Europe and China and to explore potential synergies and projects of common interest in the fields of cultural heritage conservation and digitisation. The session also focused on the discussion of various standards, techniques and solutions for digital heritage and cultural expression which are used in East and West.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>\_ \_ \_ \_<img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Projectpartner/ChinaEuropeana.png\" style=\"max-height:400px;\"> <em>\_Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of Europeana Foundation and Prof. Zhang Xiaoming, Deputy Director of the China National Center for Culture Studies\_of CASS signing the Europeana China Initiative, Europeana Network Association AGM 2018, Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></h6>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>East Meets West in Greece Initiative starts.</strong> The <a href=\"https://emwg.site/\">EMWG</a> Initiative was inaugurated at the Hellenic Ministry of Digital Policy in November 2018.

This plan should include special measures for the revival of cultural tourism, one of the largest and fastest growing tourism segments worldwide which accounts for 40% of all European tourism. Tourism needs cultural heritage and cultural heritage needs tourism. But we recover from this crisis by using it as an opportunity to promote more innovative and sustainable forms of tourism. In doing so, we will deliver lasting benefits for public and private owners of heritage sites and the communities that surround them, generating higher quality experiences and greater enjoyment for visitors.'</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>From autumn 2021 - spring 2022, a Europeana&nbsp;Initiative-wide <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/digital-transformation-task-force\">Digital Transformation Task Force </a>aimed to build capacity for digital transformation across Europeana. This Task Force included representatives from the Europeana Network Association, Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, Europeana Foundation and independent consultants. During the course of its work, the Task Force organised three consultation sessions where 44 participants provided input on digital activities (572 comments in total) and digital skills (228 comments in total) from an individual, organisational and network perspective. This has resulted in two publications that can be downloaded below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The ‘Guide to Digital Transformation in Cultural Heritage’ </strong>aims to support the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector across Europe. It is written for the people who work in, around and for the many different museums, galleries, archives, libraries, heritage sites, arts organisations&nbsp;that hold and protect cultural collections and seek to engage audiences with them. It offers recommendations that frame an approach to digital transformation for the whole cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>Digital Transformation Report</strong> on the Task Force details the work that&nbsp;independent charity Culture24 was commissioned to guide and support. It covers the Task Force’s activities between October 2021 and the publication of this report in June 2022 and introduces the ‘Guide to Digital Transformation in Cultural Heritage’ that has been produced collaboratively by the Task Force as a separate stand alone document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the above, initiative-wide discussions will continue to determine the role and responsibility of Europeana as a whole and of its three separate bodies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

However, there are exceptions to this rule which make the calculation quite complex. The moment from which the counting starts varies depending for instance on the type of work, if the work was published, if it is anonymous or published under a pseudonym, or depending on the authorship. Terms of protection that are longer than the 70 years after the death of the author can exist in certain countries, as defined in national legislation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There might also be works contained inside a work whose copyright protection expires at a later stage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While determining whether a work is in the public domain can be very complex, there a few rules and criteria established in the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0116\">Term Directive</a> that are worth noting:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection expires 70 years after the work has been lawfully made available to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For audiovisual works, the standard term of copyright is 70 years after the death of the last author among the principal director, the authors of the screenplay and dialogue, and the composer of music especially written for the film.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For works of joint authorship, the term of 70 years is calculated from the death of the last surviving co-author.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The rights of producers of phonograms expire 50 years after the fixation is made.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European copyright laws have a series of exceptions or limitations to copyright that allow individuals or institutions to use copyright-protected works without needing permission from the&nbsp; rights holder. In the European Union, most exceptions or limitations are designed to support a specific activity in a specific context, and there is no ‘general’ exception such as ‘fair use’ in the United States. Some exceptions and limitations widely recognised in the European Union cover:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The making of copies by cultural heritage institutions for preservation purposes</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The publication online of out of commerce or orphan works (further described below)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To display of a work in a classroom</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The citation of parts of a work for research purposes&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These, and other exceptions and limitations to copyright, can be essential to support a cultural heritage institution’s activities. It is therefore important that cultural heritage professionals are informed of the possibilities that they offer in their countries. Exceptions and limitations to copyright are not fully harmonised in the European Union, but <a href=\"https://www.copyrightexceptions.eu/\">this resource</a> by the <a href=\"https://communia-association.org/\">Communia Association for the Public Domain</a>, <a href=\"http://openfuture.eu/\">Open Future</a> and <a href=\"https://digrep.bg/en/\">Digital Republic</a> can help you find more information.</p>\r\n"

You can find more information about this system <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/out-of-commerce-works-working-group#faqs\">on this page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alternatively, consider relying on the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012L0028\">orphan works exception</a>. This exception to copyright requires conducting a diligent search before you can rely on it to make the work available online. It is worth noting, however, that the experience of many cultural heritage institutions when relying on this exception has been rather unfruitful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Chatbots are virtual assistants which can have digital conversations with users, providing them with the information and services of interest during their online visit. Cultural heritage institutions can use chatbots to interact with their visitors across their various platforms, from their collections websites to social media accounts (for example, the organisation’s Facebook profile).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform offers built-in support for multilingual conversations in all EU languages and machine translation of object metadata.&nbsp;You can see an example&nbsp;of how the chatbot supports discovery of&nbsp;Europeana collections with the <a href=\"https://culturebot.eu/\">standalone chatbot</a> (in English, Dutch, Spanish, Italian and Polish). Institutions interested in sharing data with Europeana can use the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">chatbot on Europeana Pro</a> to find out which aggregator will be the best choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Benefits of chatbots from the platform</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Offer cultural heritage institutions a free, easy to use and modern tool for audience engagement&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Provide 24-hour support and guidance to online visitors</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Enhance the overall user experience of cultural heritage platforms, with artificial intelligence technologies ensuring visitors receive a near real-time and highly relevant response to their questions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Support all EU languages, helping cultural heritage institutions to lower the communication barrier by giving assistance in the user’s own language and raise awareness of and increase engagement with their collections among local communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Technical information</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The bot uses the open-source chatbot Rasa framework and open-source engine Dgraph for Knowledge Graph. The chatbot tool also complies with the Europeana Data Model as the bot harvests EDM data via the Europeana API. Moreover, the Natural Language Processing bot component uses the Search API to improve its results. The developed source code is licensed by EUPL v1.1.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><b>Use the Culture Chatbot</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in using the platform,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://info@jhn.ngo\">contact</a> the project partners or visit the <a href=\"https://culturebot.eu/\">Chatbot website</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Dashboard is an online tool that allows users to share 3D models and their associated metadata for review and publication on the Europeana collections website. This tool was developed under the Europeana Generic Services project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/share3d\">Share3D</a>.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About the tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>3D content has a relatively low representation in cultural heritage collections, but demand for it is continuously growing. The Dashboard tool addresses this challenge by supporting institutions and individuals who want to create and publish 3D content in Europeana. It\_offers an efficient process to create metadata for models in line with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. The enriched metadata records can then be submitted from the Dashboard to Europeana via <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/carare\">CARARE</a>’s aggregation service without any additional work on the side of the cultural institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool has been designed with cultural heritage institutions who are uploading 3D models in <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/\">Sketchfab</a> and want to share them in Europeana in mind, but is also useful for creatives, educators, researchers and tourism professionals who want to publish their 3D models and use them for their creative projects. For more information regarding the possible use per sector, take a look at the project <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/case-studies/\">case studies</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Benefits of the tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Supports the discoverability and reusability of 3D content through a rich metadata repository, helping cultural heritage institutions to share their digital collections more widely.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Ensures that the metadata of 3D content complies with the policies and standards developed by Europeana to ensure and preserve the quality of the metadata.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Encourages experts and non-experts in 3D modelling to discover Europeana as a source of high-quality cultural records and be inspired to explore it further.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use the Dashboard</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dashboard.share3d.eu/login.php\">Sign up</a> to the tool and start sharing your content. Find more information on the\_ <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/\">Share3D</a> website, or <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/support/contact/\">get in contact</a> with the project partners.</p>\r\n"

        title: MotionNotes
        intro: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MotionNotes is a web-based, real-time multimodal video annotator designed to assist the creative and exploratory processes of dance professionals. This standalone tool was developed by NOVA University of Lisbon under the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/culturemoves\">CultureMoves</a> Europeana Generic Service project and further enhanced under the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE</a> Europeana Generic Service project.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About the tool\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MotionNotes is a real-time, multimodal video annotator based on keyboard, touch and voice inputs. It was designed to assist the creative and exploratory processes of both professional and amateur users who work with dance choreography and art performances.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool allows users to record videos and take notes over the video at the same time, as well as make annotations including drawings, text, voice, marks and web URL links to edit and enrich video performances.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool also supports 3D annotations. Users can upload their 3D models to MotionNotes and have them available while creating new annotations. Each user has their collection of 3D models available in his account. Users can look at the model, rotate it, and zoom it in/out. Users can annotate any part of the video with 3D models. The tool will then save the timestamp and position in which the 3D model was added. Musical instruments can be added as 3D annotations and provide important information. The 3D object annotations can be used as historical and cultural references. Geographical mapping is possible through the use of 3D object annotations.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the tool uses AI to automatically enable specific human movement detection in a video (e.g., arms open) and to estimate human pose in the video. This enables users to add dynamic annotations in MotionNotes, i.e. annotations can follow a human body part.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Benefits of the tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Allows users to annotate dance performances in real time, supporting the practice of dance professionals and enthusiasts</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Encourages and enhances the use of dance related content for the promotion of local and regional territories, potentially strengthening community ties and attracting tourism.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Thanks its AI-powered annotations of human motion, MotionNotes is also relevant to performing arts, sports, education, journalism and tourism.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technical information\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool follows responsive design principles and can be used across all major operating systems, browsers and devices (including smartphones and tablets).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The videos are WebM files (open, royalty-free, media file format). Annotations and metadata are stored in an open video-specific JSON format.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For human pose estimation, the tool makes use of the <a href=\"https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose\">OpenPose algorithm</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MotionNotes videos and annotations can be shared over the web using an oEmbed.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Use MotionNotes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To use the MotionNotes tool, <a href=\"https://motion-notes.di.fct.unl.pt/\">register and log in</a> on the website. You can also find out more through the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poN5mvzbchM\">online tutorial</a>, or by <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/about/\">contacting </a>the project partners.</p>\r\n"

We want to invite the best ideas to take the stage, and open up our platforms to new voices and subjects around the following themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explore&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to help people explore cultural heritage online and discover Europe’s rich heritage, cultural heritage institutions work tirelessly to structure, enrich and link their data to make digital cultural heritage more findable, accessible and interoperable. The use of automated approaches like AI assisted&nbsp; enrichments of data offers opportunities&nbsp;for new ways of interaction. The emergence of new types of data, such as 3D also pushes us to rethink and upgrade our current process and workflows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this conference theme, we are interested in interventions around:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Processes and workflows which facilitate the digitisation, creation,&nbsp;enrichment and management of data (including 3D)&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Standards and protocols which support the creation, sharing and reuse of Linked Data</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">New automated approaches towards the enrichment of content and metadata including machine learning, computer vision&nbsp; and natural language processing</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Engage&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage enriches lives. Access to cultural heritage in all its richness helps us learn about who we are, where we’ve come from and what we can become. The ways cultural heritage institutions provide access to cultural heritage data, and are set up to preserve, curate and deliver that data, is increasingly determining the relevance of the cultural heritage sector. Is developing decentralised models a way to make the cultural heritage sector stronger and more prominent in society? How can technology facilitate the participation of diverse audiences and communities? What advancements can be used to create a&nbsp; space for others to share their own pieces of cultural heritage with the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this conference theme we are interested in receiving proposals related to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Models of developments and&nbsp; collaboration between cultural heritage professionals which support better sharing of, and access to,cultural heritage data as well as increasing its impact</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Developments around user interactions and applications which support new ways to search, browse and interact with cultural heritage data (for example, through immersive experiences)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Projects and tools which facilitate the participation of audiences in the curation, enrichment, reuse of digital cultural heritage&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Activities related to open access, public domain, and Creative Commons, making collections more accessible</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Experience</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital cultural heritage is no longer limited to 2D content, a link to a webpage and a couple of metadata fields. The diversity of data (from transcriptions and annotations, to 3D models) and the increased number of available technologies coupled with high-quality digitisation and AI have transformed the experience we can offer to audiences. We have gone beyond the paradigm of search and browse, and can now look to build rich, interactive and immersive experiences which let people explore, engage and experience the past as never before seen possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this theme we are looking forward to hear about inspiring presentations about:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Usage of cultural heritage data (image, text, video, audio and 3D) to build user interaction and experience&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Collaboration between cultural heritage institutions and creative industries&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">New types of interactions supporting users in their interaction with cultural heritage (e.g AI chatbot, assist tools)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Workshops or Round table discussions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Workshops are often held in smaller groups, where participants are asked to do assignments together. The best way to support smaller groups is to have a facilitator for each group to guide them through the exercise(s). Tip: make sure you have a programme that works both online as in-person. You can have smaller groups working online together and in the room, both with their own facilitator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Roundtable discussions are better suited if you want to give everyone the option to speak up. These can take place by dividing the participants into smaller groups. A moderator for each group is advisable during the event, as just putting people into a group or breakout room will not necessarily spark a conversation. Ensure that participants know what they should discuss, for example by sharing (or sending a link to) a slidedeck, document, or survey. Make sure that you’ve thought about the way the results of the discussions are captured before you ask people to go into groups/breakout rooms. Presenting outcomes of each group might sound like a good idea, but there may be better, faster and more insightful ways of giving feedback. For example: a survey within each group and/or a survey when everyone is back from their discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Roundtables can have many variations. ‘Magic roundtables’ are where people determine the topics first and divide how much time they’ll spend on each topic before actually starting the discussion. This variation needs a (self appointed) time keeper.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Panel Discussions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A moderated panel discussion is best suited for situations where only a small number of people will be talking most of the time and a large audience is listening. The audience can raise their hand (or virtual hand) to ask a question live or questions can be asked through Q&amp;A and/or chat functionality. The moderator will have access to the people online and in the room and is then responsible for bringing these questions to the panel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Presentations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Presentations might not sound like a very interactive format, but when done in a different way, they can encourage participation. We have had good experiences based on “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQWvc6qhTds\">flipping the classroom</a>”, where a presentation is pre-recorded and the time (that would normally be used for the presentation) is used for interaction. The presenter can either be online or present at the event. Chat functionality can also be used for the online audience to interact with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tools for interaction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below is a list of digital tools that can be used for interaction with participants. Do you have your own favorite tool? Let us know. We love to get to know new tools. We will also need to evaluate whether it will be practical and possible to use the tool for Europeana 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Polling and quizzes: Mentimeter and Kahoot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Polling and quizzes are ideal ways of interacting with larger audiences online as well as in person. The questions can quickly be answered and answers can be shared instantly. Examples of polling and quiz tools that we have good experiences with are <a href=\"https://www.mentimeter.com/\">Mentimeter</a> and <a href=\"https://kahoot.com/\">Kahoot</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Surveys (ZOOM or Google Forms)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A survey will be added to Zoom so people online have the opportunity to feedback right after each session. Europeana will also survey all event attendees after the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Brainstorming</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Brainstorming with a group can easily be done online. Tools like <a href=\"https://jamboard.google.com/\">Jamboard</a> and <a href=\"https://trello.com/\">Trello</a> make it possible to quickly get people to add their thoughts on a canvas while the people in the room use post-its. Want a more structured approach? Then look into online mindmapping tools, like <a href=\"https://miro.com/mind-map-software/\">Miro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mindmeister.com/\">MindMeister</a>.</p>\r\n"

Not only is the sector facing a host of practical everyday impacts from the COVID-19 crisis, it also has to find ways to maximise and amplify its role in enabling Europe's recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crisis has underlined the importance of digital access for cultural heritage institutions as well as the role and power of cultural heritage in society. Faced with the immediate impacts of the pandemic, many heritage institutions and organisations across Europe rose to the challenge, rapidly responding by shifting their physical services to digital and staying connected to their audiences through digital culture channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In turn, the public responded with an explosion of homemade cultural phenomena online, based on art and history and facilitated through digital access. This, often reciprocal, engagement supports much of the existing evidence for the powerful socio-economic role that digital cultural heritage plays, in addition to the more traditional role of museums, archives and libraries for both local residents and tourists. This was further evidenced in the classroom, where the availability of, and access to, digital heritage enabled online learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may say that we saw a glimpse of what Europe looks like when it is powered by culture - supporting a resilient, growing economy, increased employment, improved well-being and a sense of European identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts were made possible by building on the foundations of digital transformation that had been laid over the past decade. As the ‘new normal’ evolves, it is clear that creating a strong digital foundation for all cultural heritage institutions is more important than ever, and that it is absolutely vital to the future of the sector and the recovery and future of Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It is critical that this increased relevance of the cultural heritage sector - as set out in the <em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europe-day-manifesto-cultural-heritage-a-powerful-catalyst-for-the-future-of-europe\">European Heritage Alliance Manifesto</a></em> -&nbsp; is acknowledged in the new Recommendation, and further development of the digital transformation supported to maximise its impact.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n"

Indeed in some areas, resultant activity goes beyond what was originally foreseen, for example in the use of digital material in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking to the future we need to also acknowledge that some areas that the current Recommendation sought to address have not yet been adequately met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, at this point, the European copyright landscape remains unharmonised. However, proper implementation of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.130.01.0092.01.ENG\"><em>Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</em></a> should correct this situation, addressing remaining challenges and meeting the goals on the availability of public domain works. We are hopeful that countries will contribute to harmonisation throughout the Directive’s transposition period ending June 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other areas still require ongoing focus and effort. Key issues include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Digitisation targets have not been met consistently across Member States. One consequence of this is an imbalance in the representativeness of the Europeana collections, with only a limited amount of objects accessible from some countries and not all citizens able to find their region or country adequately represented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Only 10-20% of the estimated heritage holdings have in fact been digitised (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">ENUMERATE</a>). As a result, only a fraction are available through the Europeana collections. This is insufficient for the creation of a strong digital public space.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A future Recommendation can and should recognise the outstanding issues in today’s digitisation and digital preservation landscape, as it focuses on shaping that landscape for today and for the future.</p>\r\n"

The speed at which digital technology has evolved over this period must teach us that structural frameworks that support an evolving response are essential, if the results of future efforts are to have longevity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, we also now understand that the opportunities provided by digital technologies for cultural heritage must be viewed in the context of the wider socio-economic challenges that society faces, including promoting critical engagement that fosters inclusivity, equality, diversity and understanding. Cultural heritage can provide historical context to such debates. Addressing global issues such as climate change cannot be seen as belonging to separate realms, but rather as key areas of research, education and knowledge-sharing shared across many sectors. Democratising access to cultural heritage means doing so in a traceable and unbiased manner&nbsp; that recognises and is able to address the growing threats of fake news, and the challenges of algorithmic bias.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Addressing digital in a coherent way in this changed and complex landscape is a challenge shared across society and sectors. This is evidenced in the European Commission’s focus on supporting Europe’s ‘digital transformation’, as seen in its Digital Agenda and now its vision for a future Europe based on the twin pillars of a green and digital transition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What digital transformation means and requires necessarily varies from sector to sector and their respective challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In the context of this paper, we can understand digital transformation as the act of adopting digital technology or digital thinking to significantly transform an organisation’s operation, or the reframing of the organisation to be inherently digital in its purpose, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As stated in the <em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a></em>, for the cultural heritage sector digital transformation is therefore not just about technology and assets or how cultural heritage institutions operate - it is about how they think and about people and skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consequently, key areas such as digitisation, digital preservation and digital access must be addressed in their wider context and not in isolation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, digitisation of cultural heritage assets is a complex process that spans all areas of operation, from collections management to logistics, from human resources management to marketing and communications, and also requires the digitisation of institutional processes and workflows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A coherent approach requires a fundamental understanding of the relationship we want to have with our audiences, of digital skills, and the ability to evaluate choices, including which platforms and information channels to use. It requires a new open culture of working and collaborating.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we consider that the immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis required staff in many institutions to take on - at speed -&nbsp; digital responsibilities that they had <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/fileadmin/Dateien/public/NEMO_documents/NEMO_COVID19_Report_12.05.2020.pdf\">never been trained for</a>, we see the emerging need for cultural heritage institutions to be able to develop and build on that capacity. And we must acknowledge that not all institutions have been able to respond in the same way. The digital divide sits not only between large and small institutions but also within institutions and between European Member States.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, if Europe’s broader ambitions are to be met, it also means developing policy that promotes a more equitable and democratic digital environment, where basic liberties and rights are protected online, where sovereignty of data is protected, where strong public institutions function in the public interest, and where people have a say in how their digital environment functions and are able to participate more fully in its <a href=\"http://shared-digital.eu/\">creation and use</a>.</p>\r\n"

The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">strategy for the further development of the Europeana </a>Initiative is supported and executed by the three main partners in the Initiative, and backed by its network of thousands of cultural heritage professionals - a community of practice which provides a strong foundation for digital cultural heritage in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The role of Member States has been critical to shaping and incentivising the implementation of the existing Recommendation. The importance of Member States in this capacity should be central to any future Recommendation, as should support for strong national infrastructures to reach cultural heritage institutions. Applying an inclusive understanding of infrastructure that goes beyond technical elements to include approaches such as adopting common standards, will be key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this context, the Europeana Foundation, Network Association and Aggregators’ Forum, collectively representing the Europeana Initiative, strongly support policy development that promotes structural and sustainable solutions in the following areas:</p>\r\n"

Maintaining a coherent and consistent approach to such an initiative will, in turn, require a sustained and adequate level of funding at EU and Member State level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past decade, public-private partnerships in digitisation have yet to produce viable business models to create consistent support, so cultural heritage digitisation remains a public sector endeavour. Unfortunately, the availability of EU funding for the digitisation of cultural heritage assets has decreased significantly in recent years and in many cases the gap in financial support has not been picked up by Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The focus of funding for existing digitisation efforts has often been on specific short-term projects. The result is that digital repositories collapse altogether as technology becomes obsolete and servers die, while expertise evaporates post-project as technical support ceases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The sector needs strategic long-term support that includes sustainable funding structures that safeguard the sovereignty of our data and the public values that underpin our efforts.

        intro: "<p>This partnership, established in 2015, focuses on integrating digital cultural heritage data from Europeana into CLARIN’s research infrastructure for use by scholars, students and all those who are interested in language resources. CLARIN and Europeana also work together to promote Europeana’s mission and resources to the academic community through a number of outreach activities.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/\">CLARIN</a> is the European Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technology. It is composed of 21 national consortium members and has been a Europeana Research partner since 2015.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first years of the partnership were spent on setting up a stable process to evaluate, select and ingest digital cultural heritage from Europeana. Since 2019, CLARIN has structurally harvested\_ Europeana resources into the <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/?1\">Virtual Language Observatory (VLO)</a> allowing researchers interested in language resources to reuse them with the variety of tools available on the <a href=\"https://switchboard.clarin.eu/\">Language Resource Switchboard</a>. 275,000 Europeana records are now available on CLARIN’s VLO, making Europeana the content provider with the highest number of items in terms of individual records to this platform.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022 this partnership resulted into the publication of Jupyter notebooks for Europeana newspaper full-text with natural language processing (NLP) tools on the\_<a href=\"https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/training-material/duVII1\" target=\"_blank\">SSH | Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Europeana Newspapers full text resources\_now\_stand as a\_<a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/search?2&amp;fqType=collection:or&amp;fq=collection:Europeana+newspapers+full-text\" target=\"_blank\">resource family</a>\_on the VLO, where they\_have been incorporated in a custom metadata aggregation with multiple levels of granularity.\_On this basis, the VLO offers methods of search, filter and access tailored to\_audiences with a\_specific interest in language resources and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CLARIN and Europeana Research co-organise a number of outreach activities (workshops, presentations), including at the <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/event/2022/clarin-annual-conference-2022\">CLARIN Annual Conference</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Newspapers are very abundant everyday objects, yet their significance is unbounded. For one, they are highly valued by researchers. Their contents can be as complex and multifaceted as our daily lives that they try to cover. From lead articles to (personal) ads and obituaries, photographs and cartoons, opinion and satire, weather and financial trends; there has always been diversity in information as well as presentation. To fully capture these contents and make them digitally available in a structured way still involves many difficult technical challenges. But the growing amount of historical newspapers being digitised also opens up new ways to study the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Europeana Newspapers and The European Library (TEL) launched one of the first transnational digitised historical newspaper collections that included a full-text search of over millions of pages. Quickly this caught the attention of researchers who wanted to apply digital methods like text analysis and statistical data mining to do comparative studies. Soon enough, technical limitations became obvious: the bad quality of the OCRed text, multilingual metadata that was not interlinked - leading to new research in computer science, some of which is covered here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This EuropeanaTech Insight Issue provides a selection from the kaleidoscope of technical topics and research questions currently revolving around digitised historical newspapers. There are articles describing the development of newspaper portals that meet the needs of the digital scholarly community, articles highlighting the possibilities for machine learning but also those showing the complexities of mapping newspaper metadata, and articles discussing the potential opportunities and methodological challenges of digitised newspapers for the digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this compilation of perspectives we aim to give a broad overview of the various areas of current digitised newspaper research. We hope this will stimulate your interest in these topics and contribute to more engagement with digitised newspapers across the EuropeanaTech community and the various research domains.</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Newspaper Navigator'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July 2019, Benjamin Lee submitted a concept paper to the open call for the Library of Congress Innovator in Residence Program. Lee proposed a two-phase project to apply machine learning techniques to <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Chronicling America</a>, a database of digitized historic newspapers maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/\" target=\"_blank\">National Digital Newspaper Program</a>, a partnership between the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The two proposed phases of the project consisted of:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Extracting visual content, including photographs, illustrations, comics, editorial cartoons, maps, headlines, and advertisements from the 16+ million digitized pages in Chronicling America.</li>\r\n    <li>Building an exploratory search interface to enable the American public to navigate the extracted visual content.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past 15 months, this project has evolved into <em>Newspaper Navigator.</em> The first phase resulted in the <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset</a>, which we released in April 2020. The second phase resulted in the <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Newspaper Navigator </em>search application</a>, which we launched in September 2020. In this article, we will provide a technical and organizational overview of <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> and situate the project within a <a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/work/?st=gallery\" target=\"_blank\">rich body</a> of work being done to enable computational access to digital collections at the Library of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Organizational Context</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>LC Labs, under the Library of Congress’s Digital Strategy Directorate, is the home of the Innovator in Residence program that supports Lee’s work. From an institutional perspective, <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> is one of many collaborative efforts to research and test potential approaches and methods in support of the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/digital-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">Library of Congress Digital Strategy</a>. The Digital Strategy lays out a 5 year vision for realizing a digitally enabled Library of Congress that is connected to all Americans, aligned with the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/strategic-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Library’s Strategic Plan</a>. The Digital Strategy promises to throw open the treasure chest, connect, and invest in the Library’s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LC Labs created an annual Innovator in Residence Program in 2017 to host experts from a variety of disciplines to creatively reimagine or reuse the Library’s digital collections in a project that engages the American public. As a research and development-focused residency, the program gives Innovators an opportunity to produce experiments that showcase current and future possibilities. Just as importantly, it creates a low-risk environment for Library staff to gather information about developing and supporting new modes of service, including possible challenges and their solutions. The program also reflects the Library’s commitment to transparent, open-source, and free-to-reuse experimentation and documentation where appropriate. All of the code for running the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> pipeline and creating the application can be found in the Library’s <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> and can be repurposed for other datasets of digitized newspapers or otherwise visually-diverse digital collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\" target=\"_blank\">user interface</a> demonstrates creative reimagining, reuse and transparent experimentation, and innovative approaches to digital discovery. A user of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> UI can visually browse over 1.5 million photographs from the Library’s historic newspapers using the affordance of visual similarity search and on-the-fly training. The interface and additional ML-derived metadata support serendipitous browsing, through which a user can fluidly refine their focus based on results and, at any point during the investigation, jump to the fuller context of a particular image within Chronicling America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Technical Overview</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, the LC Labs team launched the <a href=\"http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/#/\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Words</a> crowdsourcing experiment with Information Technology Specialist Tong Wang during a collaborative staff innovator detail. The goal was to engage the American public through the rich visual content in WW1-era pages in Chronicling America and learn about user interests and workflow capacities that could inform future crowdsourcing efforts. Volunteers were asked to draw bounding boxes around photographs, illustrations, comics, editorial cartoons, and maps, as well as transcribe the corresponding captions. To construct the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset, Lee saw an opportunity to use the <a href=\"http://beyondwords.labs.loc.gov/#/data\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Words data</a> as a source of training data for a machine learning model to learn how to detect visual content on a newspaper page. More specifically, Lee fine-tuned a Faster-RCNN object detection model from <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2\" target=\"_blank\">Detectron2’s</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md\" target=\"_blank\">Model Zoo</a> that had been pre-trained on the <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\" target=\"_blank\">Common Objects in Context</a> (COCO) dataset using the Beyond Words bounding box annotations, as well as additional annotations of headlines and advertisements. This finetuning required approximately 19 hours on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the development of <em>Newspaper Navigator</em>, collaborating with the staff of the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP) was essential, from understanding the technical aspects of computing against Chronicling America at scale to refining the search interface to best support user needs. Furthermore, <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> relied on Chronicling America’s structured data, standardized batch indexing, and <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/\" target=\"_blank\">API</a> in order to run the pipeline and serve the photographs in the search application. Perhaps most significantly, <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> benefits from the decades-long genealogy of hard work at the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize and make available a diverse range of American newspapers of historic significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the visual content recognition model finetuned, Lee then ran the full <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> pipeline, as shown in Figure 1. The pipeline consisted of the following steps for each Chronicling America page:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Pulling down a high-resolution image of the page, as well as the corresponding METS/ALTO OCR, using the <a href=\"https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/#bulk-data\" target=\"_blank\">bulk data API</a> for Chronicling America.</li>\r\n    <li>Running the visual content recognition model on the page.</li>\r\n    <li>Cropping and saving the identified visual content in an S3 bucket.</li>\r\n    <li>Extracting the OCR falling within each bounding box as textual metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>Generating ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 embeddings for the extracted visual content (except headlines).</li>\r\n    <li>Saving the metadata in JSON format to an S3 bucket.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> pipeline processed 16,368,041 out of the 16,368,424 Chronicling America pages available at the time of running the pipeline (99.998%). The pipeline required 19 days of runtime on two Amazon AWS g4dn.12xlarge instances, for a total of 96 CPU cores and 8 NVIDIA T4 GPUs. The resulting <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset indexing mirrors the Chronicling America batch structure for ingesting pages, meaning that computing against the dataset should be intuitive for those familiar with the Chronicling America bulk data.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Ben figure1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1. The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> pipeline.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The resulting <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset is entirely in the public domain and can be found at: <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/\">https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/</a>. Researchers can directly compute against the dataset using HTTPS or S3 requests. While the Library of Congress is responsible for storing the dataset, advanced computing has been configured as a “requestor pays” model with S3, meaning that researchers are responsible for covering the cost of data transfer and computing instances. The Library is testing this capability for the first time with this project, as a lead in to the <a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/cchc/\" target=\"_blank\">Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud project </a>currently investigating possible service models for access to collections in a distributing computing, or “cloud,” environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As another mode of access, the dataset has been made accessible in the form of hundreds of pre-packaged datasets according to visual content year and type. To learn more about the construction of the dataset from a technical perspective, please reference the technical whitepaper, “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01583\" target=\"_blank\">The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> Dataset: Extracting and Analyzing Visual Content from 16 Million Historic Newspaper Pages in Chronicling America</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coinciding with the public launch of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset, LC Labs and Lee hosted a <a href=\"https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2020/05/innovator-ben-lee-and-lc-labs-host-data-jam-with-100-million-historic-newspaper-images/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual data jam</a>, during which 135 participants learned about the dataset and explored it. Participants’ creations ranged from visualizations of thousands of photographs to Jupyter notebooks for processing the pre-packaged datasets to collages of illustrations. The data jam was recorded and is available on the <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-9253\" target=\"_blank\">Library’s website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second phase of <em>Newspaper Navigator</em>, Lee built a search <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\" target=\"_blank\">user interface</a> for 1.56 million photos from 1900 to 1963 in the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset. In addition to supporting keyword search over the photographs’ captions extracted from the METS/ALTO OCR, the search interface empowers visitors to the site to train AI navigators to retrieve visually similar content on the fly, as shown in Figure 2. In particular, visitors can select positive and negative examples, train an AI navigator, consult the returned results, select or deselect positive and negative examples again, and iteratively train the AI navigator to return better results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI navigators are powered by the 512-dimensional ResNet-18 embeddings that were pre-computed during the construction of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset. With each training request, the search app trains a linear model using scikit-learn on the selected positive and negative examples, as well as a thousand negative examples randomly drawn from the unlabeled pool of examples. Lee wrote the application in Python, Flask, scikit-learn, HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript, and the application is fully containerized with Docker. For more information, see the code for the <a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator\" target=\"_blank\">search application</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Ben figure_2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2. Training an AI navigator to retrieve photographs of sailboats in the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset.</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Access to Data </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\" target=\"_blank\">search application</a> and <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a> provided the additional opportunity to test technical solutions for providing access at scale to the Library’s free to use content. At roughly 10 TB, the dataset is one of the largest single datasets the Library has ever made available online for public use. Although a version of the dataset is available through direct download through HTTPS and S3 requests, the memory, tools, and computing requirements to download, store, and use a dataset of this size are not widely available on personal computers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given these barriers, Lee and LC Labs worked with the Library of Congress Information Technology Design and Development staff to deploy two additional options for access. First, Lee re-processed the dataset and implemented structured URLs so that images with over 90% confidence score could be downloaded along with corresponding metadata (in JSON and CSV format) by type (photographs, advertisements, etc.) and year just by manipulating the URL. The file names are structured as prepackaged/[year]_[visual content type]. For example, to download all of the photos from the year 1905 in JPEG format, a user would construct the url path https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/prepackaged/1905_photos.zip. To download the relevant metadata, one would manipulate the url to https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/prepackaged/1905_photos.json or .csv to retrieve the JSON or CSV files containing “1905.” Lee and the LC Labs team were able to test this access method during an online data jam in April 2020. During the event, users of varying technical backgrounds were able to use the structured URLs to download, browse, and create with the data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full 10TB dataset is publicly available in an AWS S3 bucket as an additional access option. With the affordances of the cloud environment and AWS’s “requestor pays” fee structure, users can compute against the dataset without needing to bring it in to their local environment if this method is preferable. This method of access is novel at the Library of Congress and will be explored further with a cohort of researchers over the next two years during the Computing Cultural Heritage in the Cloud (CCHC) project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. As with all LC Labs projects, the results and lessons from CCHC will be shared widely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Explore, Refine, and Document the Machine Learning</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> <a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\" target=\"_blank\">search application</a> represents the first machine learning application deployed for use by the public by the Library. To successfully launch the search app, Lee and LC Labs again collaborated with colleagues in the Library’s software development and devops organizations to implement a workflow of containerizing the application within Docker, pushing the container to Amazon’s Elastic Container Service, and hosting the application using AWS Fargate. This route toward production eliminated any need to configure or scale virtual machines; it proved to withstand the spike in traffic that accompanied the application’s launch. The containerized search application code can be found at the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator\" target=\"_blank\">repository</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in this paper, the importance of the Beyond Words crowdsourcing experiment as the training data for the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> algorithm was highlighted. Lee’s approach to this project was also in dialogue with a series of reports commissioned by LC Labs to consider the implications of adopting machine learning methods for enhancing access to or processing its collections. Both Ryan Cordell’s report “<a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/static/labs/work/reports/Cordell-LOC-ML-report.pdf?loclr=blogsig\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning + Libraries: A Report on the State of the Field</a>” and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln AIDA collaboration’s report “<a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/static/labs/work/experiments/final-report-revised_june-2020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Libraries, Intelligent Data Analytics, and Augmented Description: A Demonstration Project</a>” recommended that the Library continues to investigate the impact of machine learning on cultural heritage materials through scoped, demonstrative technical pilots and research collaborations that transparently surface and articulate challenges for consideration before operalization across the organization. The demonstration projects carried out by the <a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/work/experiments/exploring-ml/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Aida team</a> constitute the first examples of such lightweight pilots. Operating on a longer timeline and larger scale, the approaches and outcomes of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> project build on these methodologies and recommendations. In addition to making all the code for the project publicly available, Lee thoroughly documented his process through <a href=\"http://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/?s=newspaper+navigator\" target=\"_blank\">white papers and blog posts</a>. Furthermore, he published a <a href=\"https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:32415/\" target=\"_blank\">data archaeology</a> that traces the implications and limitations of using machine learning for search and discoverability with cultural heritage data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Newspaper Navigator</em> invites historians, genealogists, educators, students, and curious members of the American public and world to discover a visual history of the United States of America via the rich images preserved within the digitized newspaper pages in Chronicling America. It is our hope that this project also empowers its users by exposing how machine learning works and inspires other projects at the intersection of machine learning and digitized newspapers to be committed to thorough documentation, transparency, and honesty about the technology’s limitations, despite its many promising applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Resources</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> search interface (<a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search\">https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/search</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset (<a href=\"https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/\">https://news-navigator.labs.loc.gov/</a>)</li>\r\n    <li><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#1a1a1a\">A technical whitepaper (</span><a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340531.3412767\" target=\"_blank\">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.<wbr />1145/3340531.3412767</a><span style=\"color:#1a1a1a\">) describing the creation of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> dataset, which appeared at CIKM 2020</span></font></li>\r\n    <li>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> data archaeology (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/k9gt-6685\">http://dx.doi.org/10.17613/k9gt-6685</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>A recording (<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-9253\">https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-9253</a>) of the <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> data jam</li>\r\n    <li>The <em>Newspaper Navigator</em> GitHub repository (<a href=\"https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator\">https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/newspaper-navigator</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>LC Labs reports page (<a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/work/reports/\">https://labs.loc.gov/work/reports/</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Mapping digitised newspaper metadata'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>From 2017 to 2019, a group of researchers from six nations and eleven institutions, funded by the Transatlantic Partnership for Social Sciences and Humanities 2016 <a href=\"https://diggingintodata.org\" target=\"_blank\">Digging into Data Challenge</a>, came together to form <i>Oceanic Exchanges</i>, a project to trace global information networks and examine patterns of information flow across national and linguistic boundaries through the computational analysis of digitised historical newspaper repositories. The project was divided into a dual layer structure, composed of both project-based and national teams. This structure allowed flexibility in the distribution of labour and resources while bringing together a range of expertise—disciplinary and linguistic—across institutions. Among these project teams was the Ontology team, led by M. H. Beals of Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, which catalogued the data and metadata available across these collections, undertook detailed interviews with data providers and libraries, and developed a robust taxonomy for discussing the digitised newspaper as a research object in its own right. Key among the results of this collaboration was the <a href=\"http://www.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11560110\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata</i></a>, a 180-page report that is fully open access and brings together, for the first time, fully comparable histories and detailed descriptions of the contents of ten large-scale newspapers datasets from around the world: the British Library 19th Century Newspapers, Chronicling America, Delpher, Europeana, Hemeroteca Nacional Digital de México, Papers Past, Suomen Kansalliskirjaston digitoidut sanomalehdet, the Times Digital Archive, Trove and ZEFYS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <i>Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata </i>arose pragmatically out of the need for the data from different datasets to be transformed into a single unitary standard that could be put into project workflows across <i>Oceanic Exchanges</i>. Although the basic bibliographical and content fields of a database could be quickly identified, a deeper understanding of the meaning of the metadata—and therefore its full potential for digital research—was difficult to obtain. The nineteenth-century newspaper was a messy object, filled with an ever-changing mix of material in an innumerable number of amorphous layouts; digitised newspapers are no different. Each database contains a theoretically standardised collection of data, metadata, and images; however, the precise nature and nuance of the data is often occluded by the automatic processes that encoded it. Moreover, although there are key projects that have made it possible to bring together different collections, such as Europeana and impresso, no true universal standard has been implemented to facilitate cross-database analysis, encouraging digital research to remain largely within existing institutional or commercial silos. To overcome this, researchers must solve several technical and philosophical challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, each database uses different language to describe physical objects (for example a newspaper issue, edition or volume), layout terminology (article or advertisement, title or heading), and more abstract concepts (genre, document type). Moreover, each database organises these terms into different hierarchies of classification. Layers of nested items, containers, and technical metadata unique to different standards (and often unique to specific repositories) raise challenging questions about what data matters and what data can be dismissed as too technical to be of interest to the digital humanities researcher. Finally, although there is some truth to the claim that “everyone uses METS/ALTO”, or something very similar, when encoding digitised newspapers, this surface level consistency lulls us into a false sense of security. We are rarely comparing apples to apples—sometimes we are not even comparing fruit to fruit. However, it was not the aim of the <i>Atlas</i> to provide a single “better” standard for digitised newspaper data, a catalogue of what <i>should be</i> across all collections. Instead, our aim was to provide the practical means for comparing and contrasting the data in these collections in a way that makes use of the rich variety of machine-readable and narrative context at our disposal, and allows for new and unexpected connections and mappings to be made in the future. In order to achieve this, the Ontology team pursued two goals: to fully map the metadata—field for field—across these ten collections, and to provide narrative documentation to situate that mapping within the historical and technical context out of which it arose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Mapping Metadata Across Digitised Newspaper Collections</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we first began mapping the JSON, XML and directory structures of the collections, our plan was to create an ontology and publish it in Web Ontology Language (OWL), a semantic web language that facilitates the machine-readable representation of relationships between things and groups of things. This, we hoped, would assist users in searching across collections by automating some of the process of identifying similar metadata fields. In order to devise the best way of categorising the fields, we attempted to map the metadata into four broad categories: metadata about the physical object, metadata about the digital object, metadata pertaining to both, and text metadata. We added each collection to a visualisation using draw.io (figure 1). Document Type Definitions (DTDs) were particularly useful, as was the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/D5.3_Final_release_ENMAP_1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana ENMAP profile</a>—not only for understanding the Europeana metadata but also to help infer the parameters of fields in other collections. A closer look at the metadata of our ten collections, however, showed that the standards and documentation were rarely implemented the same way. Rather than entirely unique approaches, what we found were very subtle variations between collections, from basic bibliographic information like publisher, title or date—which might be in a standardised form or taken from the printed object—to more complex content issues such as article genres (whether distinguishing an article from an advertisement or an image, or different types of article) and authorship (which we thought might vary depending on the pen name as printed, a pseudonym used by many people for a specific column, or a named author, but ultimately was a very rare field in any collection).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Emily images2.jpg\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 1. Map of all metadata fields from our collections, each one represented by a different colour with connecting lines showing the internal hierarchy of each, broken down by metadata of physical object, digital object, metadata pertaining to both, and text data.</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In creating our <a href=\"https://figshare.com/articles/Full_Map_of_Digitised_Newspaper_Metadata/11560110\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a>, which is freely available to download and contains over 3300 lines representing all possible fields in the ten collections we worked with, we also found that we were replicating this input inconsistency within our team. Our team consisted of fourteen researchers in six countries, each entering the fields, indicating their relationships to each other, and providing a definition drawn either from the documentation or from inference based on the standards, our conversations with archivists, and other grey literature such as reports or conference proceedings. Different team members interpreted this task differently and inputted starkly different levels of detail into the definitions. Ultimately, we needed to employ a stronger editorial oversight than would be possible for metadata entry for a collection with millions of newspaper pages digitised over many years by many different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our dataset includes a unique identifier for every possible metadata field in an XML or JSON file as well as for each layer of the directory structure when these structures served as metadata fields, such as Chronicling America and Papers Past. Based on the existing hierarchy of that metadata and our own historical understanding of, and research into, the history of the newspaper, we devised categories and sub-categories to which the most significant metadata fields are assigned; not all containers have been given a category as we focused on what would be most useful to researchers, beginning with those fields that contained content. These categories are fuzzier than an OWL ontology and take into account subtle variations rather than attempting to provide a primarily machine-readable categorisation. We then give the collection name, the XPath, and information about the format and content type. Example content and multiple-choice values are supplied where relevant and identifiable, and a definition is given. Field and element types are identified, and then, based on the identifier, each field is placed in relation to the other fields within the data file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Creating an Atlas of Metadata Maps </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, what we have created is not primarily a machine-readable hierarchy, though we have also developed a prototype SKOS dataset of the categories so that users might be able to get a sense of how the metadata relates to the structure of the physical newspaper. Instead, we primarily focused on creating user-friendly documentation that can be consulted by researchers inside and outside of the academy in order to find out what data there is within collections and therefore which research questions they might be able to ask of that data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <i>Atlas of Digitised Newspapers and Metadata</i> aims to provide this vital context to researchers within a single, dynamic document. It begins with an introduction and our methodology. This is followed by the heart of the report: the histories of each of the ten databases we worked with, based on interviews, documentation and close collaboration, and a glossary that offers a guide to the metadata fields—our metadata ‘maps’. These database histories list the libraries consulted as well as the microfilming projects, digitisation projects and preservation processes that fed into the online collections, in order to illuminate the shape of a digitised collection and the decision-making processes behind it. This is followed by a description of the composition of the digitised collection itself, the data quality, metadata schema, backend structure and user interface, as well as rights and usage. The aim is for researchers to gain a greater understanding of the ideological underpinnings of the collections, as well as their funding and access conditions, becoming aware not only of what is present but also what might be absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our metadata maps are based on the categories our team devised, drawing on expertise in literature, history, periodicals, and data and library science. For each category (such as publication title or issue date), we provide language variants, a technical definition, and usage notes that explain the historical development of the term where relevant, and/or the way that different database providers might understand the term. We also provide examples drawn from scholarly literature and contemporary accounts, to show how the newspaper terminology is understood more broadly, and where there might be ambiguity or variation. Category notes are given to explain how the term is specifically used within the metadata, and individual collection notes discuss the idiosyncrasies of specific collections that users might want to be aware of, such as connections and dependencies with other fields. Finally, the full XPaths for the relevant fields in each collection are included. The structure of each map in the <i>Atlas</i> is designed to provide researchers from different backgrounds with a reference guide that contains the information they might need to make decisions about what fields are relevant to their work and what it will be possible for them to find, bringing together historical context, technical understanding of metadata and file structures, and specific file paths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Looking Towards Future Newspaper Digitisation and Research </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the development of the <i>Atlas</i> as a narrative resource, and in the hosting of several post-launch workshops with librarians, academics and independent researchers, the Ontology team discovered many examples of best practice, missed opportunities, and tantalising possibilities for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important lesson learned was the absolutely necessity for clear, detailed and accessible documentation. In order to create comparable histories and content descriptions of these collections, we needed to bring together a wider range of material including official external-facing documentation—such as that provided by Europeana (data) and Trove (API)—as well as unofficial guides by advanced users, internal (or ad hoc) documentation provide to data entry providers, lengthy interviews with curatorial staff and significant material from academic and industry conferences. This latter material—often speculative or preliminary—was the main source of information about the development of digitisation projects, as legacy documentation on earlier data entry or selection rationales rarely survived into the most recent official documentation. Even so, the Ontology team had to rely at least in part on inference and reverse-engineering of data entry protocols in order create like-for-like documentation throughout—representing an unnecessary, significant and (given the fallibility of human memory and the frequency of staff turnover) irrevocable loss of vital contextual information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to the use of the <i>Atlas</i> as a user guide and research tool, our workshops made it clear that it currently provides two layers of practical use. On one level, it provides prospective users of these collections—whether through the raw data or the web interfaces—an overview of the possibilities and problematics of these collections. While many users found the level of detail overwhelming, and perhaps not immediately useful to their personal inquiries, the general understanding they gleaned from the very need to document the complex nuances of this field better prepared them to approach these collections with a critical eye. On a more detailed level, it brought to the fore the degree of ambiguity and inconsistency between collections, raising questions of which fields it was possible—in terms of information but also labour costs—to include in various collections and how additional contextual metadata might someday be roundtripped from users back into the collections themselves. Only by laying these out in a complete and detailed manner are we able to accurately judge the extent which have, can or should engage with certain layers of metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the formal project draws to a close this autumn, with a number of library and user workshops planned for 2020-21, the <i>Oceanic Exchanges</i> team members looks forward to working with additional collection holders to build upon the work represented within the <i>Atlas</i>, either through its direct expansion to include new databases or by linking to additional projects that digital newspaper collections and therefore create a central repository for legacy and dynamic documentation, external metadata and derived datasets.

                subtitle: 'Patrick Dinger, Lisa Landes, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek'
                anchortitle: 'The German Newspaper Portal: A National Aggregator for Digitised Historical Newspapers'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical newspapers constitute an important source of scientific research in different disciplines – especially in Germany where the newspaper sector was and is particularly diverse and extensive. In recent years, there has been a coordinated approach to digitise many of those newspapers thanks to a funding initiative by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). As a part of this funding initiative the German Digital Library (Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek, DDB) is currently developing a national newspaper portal that aims to combine all available digitised newspapers in one platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The German Newspaper Portal - A “Sub-Portal” of the German Digital Library</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work on the German Newspaper Portal (Deutsches Zeitungsportal) began in January 2019. Project partners are the German National Library, the Berlin State Library, the Saxon State and University Library Dresden and FIZ Karlsruhe - Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure. The aim is to launch a first version of the newspaper portal in March 2021. The most important feature will be a full-text search but there will also be search entry points via calendar, place of publication and newspaper title. An integrated viewer will be used so users can access all content directly in the portal. Rounding off the list of features are stable URLs for each newspaper issue so they can be quoted and linked to reliably.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Lisa image1_200.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>The landing page of the German Newspaper portal (draft)</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany is a federal state, which is particularly relevant when it comes to culture and cultural heritage. In contrast to other national libraries, the German National Library does not possess extensive holdings of historical newspapers. Instead, this content is found in many different libraries and archives. What the German National Library does possess, however, is experience with building an infrastructure for the nation-wide aggregation of cultural heritage content. Together with 13 partners (among them the project partners of the newspaper portal) it has been developing and running the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">German Digital Library</a> for more than a decade and the national newspaper portal will be developed as a “sub-portal” of the German Digital Library. This offers many advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Infrastructure can be reused and workflows can be adapted from existing solutions</li>\r\n    <li>Many institutions who will provide content to the newspaper portal have long been content providers of the German Digital Library so workflows and contracts are already in place</li>\r\n    <li>Most importantly: long-term availability. Steady funding for the German Digital Library has been guaranteed since 2018 and as a sub-portal the newspaper portal will also profit from this.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The Portal and It‘s Users - User Studies and User Feedback Shape the Development of the Newspaper Portal</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Scientific Community</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, the initial impulse - and funding - to develop a national newspaper portal was given by the scholarly community, especially the (Digital) Humanities. Since students and scientists will be one of the main user groups of the newspaper portal, their needs and expectations were a central driving force: the four core features described above and thus the main work programme of the first phase of the project, were the result of a workshop in 2014 where scientists from various fields discussed the major requirements for a national newspaper portal. Since work on the newspaper portal began in January 2019 a scientific advisory board made up of 14 international experts in the fields of newspaper research and Digital Humanities has supported the project partners with their expertise and feedback. In the summer of 2019 there was another two-day workshop where the advisory board reaffirmed and expanded on the requirements, by highlighting, for example, the need for a feature that allows the compilation and downloading of individually compiled corpora. Further feedback from the scientific community is being gathered by participating in relevant working groups and presenting the project at scientific conferences like the annual conference on Digital Humanities in the German speaking countries (DHd).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>General Users</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the scientific community will not be the only user group interested in a national newspaper portal. Due to the all-encompassing content typically found in newspapers - from political news, to articles on cultural events; from notifications of births, marriages and deaths to information about sports events; from advertisements to classified ads - there will be a lot to interest a more general kind of user as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about this kind of users we conducted two user studies early on in the project. In March/April 2019 there was an online survey (quantitative user study) which was followed in May 2019 by a usability test (qualitative user study).</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Lisa image4_200.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Goals and aims of the user study</i></center>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Lisa image3_200.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>This screenshot shows an alphabetical list of the newspapers sorted by location (draft)</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Online Survey</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The online survey consisted of 23 questions on subjects like: Who are the users of a national newspaper portal? What kind of content are they looking for? Which features do they consider especially important? It was distributed in March and April 2019 via the websites of the project partners and 30 other relevant channels (blog posts, social media accounts, newsletters, mailing lists). 2,422 completed surveys were received and analysed. Some of the main findings are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Among participants there were more men (61%) than women (37%), the majority were from a higher age bracket (more than 60% were over 50 years old). Ca. 75% had a university degree.</li>\r\n    <li>A third of the users would use the portal for personal research (main interests are anything concerning genealogy/local history and specific historical events), another third for job-related research (main interest are newspapers as primary source material) and the final third for both kinds of research.</li>\r\n    <li>Full-text search, filter and browsing functionalities are regarded as the most important features.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Usability Tests</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2019 we conducted usability tests based on the then-available click dummy of the newspaper portal. 15 test subjects (5 students, 5 persons form an interested public, 5 persons without any special interest or relevant know-how) had 60 minutes to interact with the click dummy during which they were questioned about their usuals methods of research and given (simulated) research tasks. Some of the results of the online survey could be confirmed by the usability test such as the interest in newspapers as primary source material and the need for easy to use browsing functionalities. Some further results are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Most users used Google or university catalogues as entry points for their research</li>\r\n    <li>A substantial amount of searches follow no specific reason, they result from a general curiosity, often triggered by images or randomly acquired information</li>\r\n    <li>Information related to locations (of specific events, of places of publication) was of a high interest to users</li>\r\n    <li>Technical language in the user interface is prone to be misunderstood and acts as a barrier to good usability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Interaction with both user groups - scientific community and general users - has brought us many insights about their requirements which we take into account as far as possible while implementing the newspaper portal. Some points, for example getting rid of technical jargon, will be dealt with in the first project phase, others, like the feature for personal corpora, will be addressed in the second phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>One Portal - Lots of (different) Metadata</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balancing out the needs of scientific and general users is just one part of the challenge in building a national newspaper portal. Another challenge lies in the homogenisation of the metadata that has to be imported. As mentioned above, the newspapers that will make up the portal come from many different institutions, the so-called “data partners” (mostly libraries and archives), but their metadata must all fit, or be made to fit, the same backend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, two important pillars of standardisation have long been in place in Germany: the German Union Catalogue of Serials (<a href=\"https://zdb-katalog.de/index.xhtml\" target=\"_blank\">Zeitschriftendatenbank</a>, ZDB) and the <a href=\"https://www.dfg.de/formulare/12_151/\" target=\"_blank\">Practical Guidelines on Digitisation</a> published by the German Research Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The German Union Catalogue of Serials is one of the world’s biggest databases for periodicals, more than 4,200 libraries in Germany and Austria enter records about the journals and newspapers in their holdings into the database. As it is run by the German National Library and the Berlin State Library, two of the partners building the national newspaper portal, the ZDB is closely connected with the newspaper portal and it plays a key role in the metadata structure of the German Newspaper Portal. Using the ZDB’s persistent identifiers we extract some standardised metadata fields directly from the ZDB database such as the title, place of publication and periods of publication. At the moment this is handled using a data dump but we aim to employ a SRU interface in the future. Besides the ZDB-extracted standardised title information, we use METS/MODS records from the data partners which must comply with the DFG guidelines. However, although the metadata provided by the libraries roughly adheres to these guidelines, the devil is in the details: What do you do, for example, if there are newspapers where a date of publication (which is needed to integrate newspapers into the calendar feature) is missing? Some newspapers lack information about the title in the data for individual issues, the way supplements are assigned to newspapers is handled differently, the list goes on. To deal with these kinds of problems one of the first steps of our data team was to develop and publish a <a href=\"https://wiki.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/display/DFD/Anwendungsprofile+und+Best+Practice+Guides\" target=\"_blank\">METS/MODS application profile</a> for newspapers and to build a validating software that checks all incoming metadata and automatically generates reports about different categories of issues detected in the metadata. Now, all data partners who supply data (via OAI-PMH Harvesting) receive such a report that gives clear information, if/how their data has to be corrected. Some corrections need to be done by the data providers, some can be taken care of by the data team at the German Digital Library. After the necessary improvements have been made the data is enriched with the information from the ZDB and delivered via our ingest tool “DDBdash” to FIZ Karlsruhe where it is transformed into the different formats necessary for the newspaper portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, despite the available tools and guidelines, working with metadata from a lot of different sources still requires a lot of manual work owing to the various interpretations of such guidelines - it remains one of the biggest challenges in building a national newspaper portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Lisa image2_200.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>&nbsp;Schematic Workflow of the necessary steps to make the metadata ready for ingest into the newspaper portal</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The German Newspaper Portal as an Aggregator for Europeana</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the content from many different libraries has been incorporated into the German Newspaper Portal, however, it has been normalised and standardised and is, thus, in principle also ready for delivery to Europeana. Europeana has launched its own thematic newspaper collection, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/de/collections/topic/18-newspapers\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Newspapers in 2019 </a>(following a long and complex migration from the service earlier provided by the discontinued TEL - The Europeana Library). Initially, the first Europe-wide digitised historical newspaper collection with full-text was established in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Newspapers project</a>, for which the Berlin State Library acted as coordinator and has since been responsible for the curation of the thematic newspaper collection in Europeana, putting us in an ideal position for collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, while Europeana has launched its newspaper collection with the content from TEL, it has not yet built all necessary software components to fully integrate full-text content with the Europeana platform and additional work still needs to be done to re-enable full-text search for the newspapers in Europeana. While this and other required features are added and the newspaper collection stabilized, there is currently no ingestion workflow in place for newspapers with full-text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it is not currently possible for us to deliver our German newspaper collection to Europeana. To integrate the collection of German newspapers, which will soon be available, there are things to be done: First and foremost, METIS, Europeana’s ingest tool, needs to be further developed and adapted for full-text objects. Since the German Digital Library was involved in earlier stages of the METIS development, this will be an opportunity for further collaboration on the ingest infrastructure. Secondly, the Europeana Infrastructure must be ready for the new full-text content with regard to the adaptation of its search, faceting and presentation functionalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Things To Come</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment our focus is on launching the newspaper portal by March 2021, capping off two years of intensive work. However, the idea was always that a second project phase would be necessary to fully develop a national newspaper portal. Therefore, we submitted our application for two more years of funding to the German Research Foundation in June. If our application is approved, the years 2021-2022 will see the development of advanced features. Besides the possibility for users to compile their personal research corpora mentioned above, we plan to upgrade the portal to enable functions based on article separated data, there will be new interfaces to forward and download the content and we will look at suitable IIIF functionalities, the improvement of existing OCR-files and NER enrichments. And - last but not least - we hope the second project phase will see a successful data delivery from the German Newspaper Portal to Europeana Newspapers, so that the fruit of long years of newspaper digitisation efforts in Germany can also be enjoyed by an international public.</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'The impresso system architecture in a nutshell'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decades-long efforts of libraries and transnational bodies to digitize historical newspapers holdings has yielded large-scale, machine readable collections of digitized newspapers at regional, national and international levels [1,2]. If the value of historical newspapers as sources for research in both academic and non-academic contexts was recognized long before, this “digital turn” has contributed to a new momentum on several fronts, from automatic content processing to exploration interfaces and critical framework for digital newspaper scholarship [3]. Beside the multiplication of individual works, hackathons and evaluation campaigns, several large consortia projects proposing to apply computational methods to digitized newspapers at scale have recently emerged (e.g. <a href=\"https://oceanicexchanges.org/\">Oceanic Exchanges</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newseye.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">NewsEye</a>, <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/living-machines\" target=\"_blank\">Living with Machines</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among these initiatives, the project impresso - <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">Media Monitoring of the Past</a> tackles the challenge of enabling critical text mining of large-scale newspaper archives and has notably developed a novel newspaper exploration user interface. More specifically, impresso is an interdisciplinary research project in which a team of computational linguists, designers and historians collaborate on the semantic indexing of a multilingual corpus of Swiss and Luxembourgish digitized newspapers. The primary goals of the project are to improve text mining tools for historical text, to enrich historical newspapers with automatically generated data, and to integrate such data into historical research workflows by means of a newly-developed user interface. The <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/#/\" target=\"_blank\">impresso app</a> is a full-fledged, in production newspaper interface with powerful search, filter and discovery functionalities based on semantic enrichments together with experimental contrastive views.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Maud 01_app_homepage.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><em>Image 1: Home page of the impresso newspaper application.</em></center>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to situate the impresso app within the landscape of newspaper interfaces, we can recapitulate different newspaper interface generations identified by [4], based on the survey of 24 interfaces and the analysis of ca. 140 features: the first generation focuses primarily on making content available online, the second on advanced user interaction with the content, the third on automated enrichment, and the fourth on personalization and increased transparency. Fourth-generation interfaces are under development in research projects and the impresso one belongs to this group. Taking a closer look now, the impresso interface leverages a broad range of automatically generated semantic enrichments and allow manifold combinations of the following features: creation and comparison of user-generated collections (cf. screenshot 4 below); keyword suggestions (cf. screenshot 2 below); content filters based on topic models, named entities and text reuse (cf. screenshot 3); article recommendations; exploratory interfaces for text reuse clusters, n-grams and topics; image similarity search (cf. screenshot 5); visualisations of gaps, biases in the corpus and quality scores for OCR and entities. With co-design and experimentation among our core working principles, the interface was inspired by user feedback collected during multiple workshops, and motivated by the overarching goal to seamlessly shift between close and distant reading perspectives during the exploration of a large newspaper corpus. For further information on the project and the interface functionalities we refer the reader to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njluhEd3pg\" target=\"_blank\">impresso clip</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Dfj49XWu8&amp;list=PLB45F159nVx9CwVvXx1vYEBN--BWHurnn\" target=\"_blank\">application guided tour</a>. A more complete overview will be published in [5].</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Maud 02_kw_suggestion.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><em>&nbsp;Image 2: Screenshot of keyword suggestion based on word embeddings, here for the word \"éducation\". Semantically-related words are suggested (pédagogie) but also OCR mistakes (éducatiou, véducation, éducaiion) (done in Oct. 2020).</em></center>\r\n\r\n<center></center>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Maud 03_topic_filtering.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><em>Image 3: Screenshot of search filtering based on topics.

The impresso app targets first and foremost digital scholars and provides tools for the mediation with computationally enriched historical sources. In this sense, the overall purpose is less to enable the discovery of statistically relevant patterns, but rather to facilitate iterative processes characterised by searching, collecting, comparing and discovering which yield insights into historical sources and thereby inform further exploration. The impresso app should be seen as a research prototype, built in the context of a research endeavour and not as an infrastructure project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, building such an application requires the design and implementation of a solid system architecture. With designers, developers and computer scientists, the impresso team was well prepared for this, but had to face several challenges. Although technical considerations and operations compose the foundations of many cultural heritage-related projects and greatly contribute to shaping their outcomes, they are rarely under the spotlight. With this blog post we wish to do justice to these undertakings, and propose to briefly present the challenges we faced, the solutions we adopted, and the lessons we have learned while designing and implementing the impresso application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A complex construction site</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of the impresso app was informed by an array of needs, constraints and activities stemming from different groups of actors, and often looked like a lively but also complex construction site. We consider the entirety of the impresso application, including backend (data storage, pre-processing and processing), middle-layer (API) and frontend. In the following we outline the main centres of influence which shaped this endeavor, whose elements might sometimes overlap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Data (or what are we working with) corresponds to original data or derivative data. Original data is provided by libraries and archives and consists in our case of three types of objects: image scans, optical character recognition (OCR) and optical layout recognition (OLR) outputs, and metadata. Derivative data is the output of various processes applied to original data and corresponds to normalized original data and semantic enrichments of various kinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These data feature characteristics which often translate into needs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Original data is <b>dispersed</b> on various institutions’ premises, which entails the need to physically acquire and store it (in order to process it), or to have a way to query it, typically via an API. In terms of system architecture and software design, this impacts the initial setup, with the need for storage facilities and/or integration of decentralized data access points, as well as the maintenance, especially with data updates in a distributed context (e.g. change of the IIIF URL scheme by a library).</li>\r\n    <li>Original data have <b>different legal statements</b>, which impacts which and how different parts of the corpus can be used and shared. Beyond the administrative work of copyright clearance, this implies the definition of a data access policy as well as the implementation and management of user login reflecting different data access levels.</li>\r\n    <li>Original data comes in<b> a variety of legacy formats</b>, which entails the need to normalize items (images, OCR outputs, metadata) towards a common format efficient for storage but mostly easy to manipulate and ‘compute on’ in distributed processing environments.</li>\r\n    <li>Original data is often <b>noisy</b>, with respect to both its contents (imperfect OCR) and shape (missing, corrupted or inconsistent collection parts). This requires the development of robust text processing tools, as well as thoughtful and numerous data sanity checks.</li>\r\n    <li>Original and derivative data correspond to <b>huge volumes</b>, with e.g. 70TB for the whole impresso original data, and more than 3TB of compressed textual data (stripped from unneeded information). Beyond storage, such volumes require distributed computing capacities (for processing) as well as hardware and software settings ensuring a good responsiveness.</li>\r\n    <li>Original data can <b>grow</b>, when e.g. a new collection is planned for ingestion, which entails the need for scaling up capacities.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2. Actors/Stakeholders</b> (or who interact with the interface and/or data) are diverse and this entails the consideration of various types of needs or interests. Actors include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Scholars, and particularly historians, who compose impresso app’s primary user group. Among many needs related to historical research (which were addressed throughout the project), one point which impacted most infrastructure and processes is the need for transparency, especially concerning the gaps in the newspaper corpus. Besides paying special attention to the treatment of corpus ‘holes’ and inconsistencies, transparency also demands the ability to use versioning to indicate which version of a) the data and b) the platform was used at a given point in time.</li>\r\n    <li>Libraries and data providers in general compose another group, interested in probing new ways to enhance their holdings, in testing their data access points (mainly IIIF et metadata APIs), and in benefiting from – and eventually recover – tools and semantic enrichments. In concrete terms, these interests translate into integration of external services, code and architecture documentation as comprehensive as possible, and derivative data serialisation and packaging.</li>\r\n    <li>Data scientists and NLP researchers, who are mainly after programmatic access to data, which requires a secured and documented API.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides continuous dialogue, the presence of various actors often requires different recipes to answer the same need, e.g. access to enrichments via, schematically, a user interface for scholars, an API for data miners, and dumps for libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>3. Activities</b> (or what do we do with the interface and/or data). Abstracting away from objects at hand and actors, another perspective which helped formulating requirements corresponds to activities. Without going in too much details, we identified:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data-related activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>search, access and navigate;</li>\r\n    <li>research and study;</li>\r\n    <li>transform, enrich, curate;</li>\r\n    <li>cite.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>System-related activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>store;</li>\r\n    <li>compute;</li>\r\n    <li>deliver;</li>\r\n    <li>visualise.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, data, actors and activities contribute a diverse set of requirements and compose the variegated landscape we evolved in while building the impresso app. If none of the questions, needs or requirements, taken in isolation, correspond to an insurmountable challenge, we believe that their combination introduces a substantial complexity. Challenges include conflicting requirements, with e.g. the need for both transparency and robustness, and conflicting “timing”, with the need to develop while having the interface already used in production. Beyond this brief overview, the definition of these “centres of influence”, the categorisation of needs and their mapping to concrete requirements deserve further work which is beyond the scope of this post. It is now time to dig into more concrete aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The impresso system architecture</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this section we “dissect” the impresso app along three axes: data, system architecture, and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Data </b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>As per storage, working copies of original data (images and OCR outputs) are stored on a centralized file storage service (NAS), with redundancy and regular snapshots and secured access reserved to project collaborators.</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright and reuse status of data is managed at two levels. First, via a set of data sharing agreements between content providers and impresso partners (EPFL, C2DH, UZH). Second, users have to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to gain full access to the impresso collection. Impresso newspapers are either in the public domain and can therefore be used without restrictions (and accessed without login), or are still under copyright and can only be used for personal and academic use (login required). Rights are specified at a year level by data providers, and encoded at the article level in the impresso app. User NDA is accessible on the home page, and the <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/terms-of-use\" target=\"_blank\">terms of use</a> documented in the app's FAQ.</li>\r\n    <li>Original newspapers data come in a wide variety of OCR formats: 1) the Olive XML format (proprietary); 2) three different flavours of METS/ALTO; 3) an ALTO-only format; 4) the XML-based TETML format, output by the PDFlib TET (<a href=\"https://www.pdflib.com/products/tet/overview/\" target=\"_blank\">Text and Image Extraction Toolkit</a>) which is used to extract contents from materials delivered in PDF format. These heterogeneous legacy formats are reduced to a “common denominator”, namely a JSON-based schema, developed by the impresso project and openly released (see Impresso <a href=\"https://github.com/impresso/impresso-schemas\" target=\"_blank\">JSON schemas</a>). Such a schema was designed to respond to the need for a simple, uniform, storage-efficient and processing-friendly format for the further manipulation, processing and enrichment of newspaper data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>System Architecture </b></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><b>Text data</b> are stored on a cloud-based object storage run by an academic network, accessible via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Storage Service</a> (S3) protocol, which is particularly suitable when distributed processes need read/write access to data. This S3-based storage is used both for the canonical data and for intermediate data that are the result of automatic processing.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Image data</b> are served by image servers which implements the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/\" target=\"_blank\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF) protocol. They are hosted either at the libraries’ premises or on a project’s image server. At the time of writing, the over 54.3 million page images that are searchable via the impresso app are spread over four different IIIF-compliant image servers.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Indexing</b> of newspaper data (text, images and metadata) is powered by <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Solr</a>, an open source indexing and search platform. We ingest into Solr both the canonical (textual) data as well as the output of enrichments (topic modelling, named entity recognition and linking, text reuse detection, etc.). The impresso Solr instance contains several indexes (Solr collections) whose elements relate to each other, mainly on the basis of content item IDs (the basic unit of work, either article if OLR was performed, or page otherwise). A Solr plugin was developed to enable efficient numerical vector comparison.</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, a <b>MySQL database</b> is used to store:\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>metadata that are not indexed for faceted/full-text search (e.g. descriptive metadata about newspapers, issues and pages);</li>\r\n        <li>user-related data such as login credentials, user-defined collections, etc.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Processes, or Data transformations. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What lies behind the impresso app interface is a complex flow of processes that manipulate, transform, enrich and finally deliver impresso’s newspaper data to the frontend. These processes—most of the times transparent to end users—profoundly shape the data that can be searched and explored via the application:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><b>Ingestion</b> is the process that consists in reading original data from the NAS storage and ingesting them into different parts of the backend, depending on their type. Text (OCR) is converted into impresso’s JSON canonical format defined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/impresso/impresso-schemas\" target=\"_blank\">JSON schemas</a>, and subsequently stored on S3. At this step each content item receives a unique identifier. Images are either accessed directly via content providers’ IIIF endpoints, or converted to JPEG2000 and ingested into the project’s image server.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Rebuild</b> corresponds to the process of converting text-based data into different shapes, suitable for specific processes. These rebuilt data are transient as they can be regenerated programmatically at any time, and should be thought of as intermediate data that fulfill a specific purpose and whose shape is dependent on the process or tool that is supposed to act on them. For instance, as part of the ingestion process, canonical data are rebuilt into a JSON format that is optimized for ingestion into Solr.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Data sanity check</b> is meant to verify and guarantee the integrity of ingested data by checking e.g. the uniqueness of canonical identifiers used to identify and refer to newspapers data at different levels of granularity (issue, page, content item), or the fact that a page belongs to an issue (no orphaned items).</li>\r\n    <li><b>NLP enrichments</b>: original and unstructured newspapers data are enriched through the application of a series of NLP and computer vision techniques which add various semantic annotation layers. These enrichments are: language identification, OCR quality assessment, word embeddings, part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation for topic modelling, extraction and linking of named entities, text reuse detection, image visual signatures. Since understanding the basics of each enrichment is essential for end users to be able to fully understand how to use the impresso app for their research, a wide array of pedagogic materials was created to this end [6,7], as well as extensive documentation in the application itself (<a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/\" target=\"_blank\">i-buttons and FAQs</a>).</li>\r\n    <li><b>Middle layer API</b>: It is a software component sitting between the frontend (user interface) and backend API that delivers JSON data to the front-end. It fetches data from different backend components (Solr, MySQL, image servers) and combines them. It also does some intermediate caching in order to speed up performances and enhance the application’s responsiveness. It manages (via processing queues) asynchronous operations that are triggered by user actions (e.g. the creation of user collections) and stores the results of these operations to the backend.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All code is (being) released under the AGPL 3.0 license and can be found on impresso’s <a href=\"https://github.com/impresso\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub organization page</a>. Code libraries, processes and architecture will be documented in the “impresso cookbook” (in preparation). Derivative data are (being) released as described in [8].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Open challenges</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as the system architecture is concerned, there remain two main open challenges that will need to be addressed by future research. The first one has to do with <b>dynamic data</b>, i.e. those enrichments such as topic modelling or text reuse that create “entities” that can be referenced via the impresso app. Topic modelling produces topics, each provided with a URI (e.g. <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/topics/tm-fr-all-v2.0_tp22_fr\" target=\"_blank\">https://impresso-project.ch/app/topics/tm-fr-all-v2.0_tp22_fr</a>) and a dedicated topic page; similarly, text reuse yields clusters such as <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/text-reuse-clusters/card?sq=&amp;clusterId=tr-nobp-all-v01-c111669150764\" target=\"_blank\">https://impresso-project.ch/app/text-reuse-clusters/card?sq=&amp;clusterId=tr-nobp-all-v01-c111669150764</a>. The problem is that these entities and their identifiers will disappear the next time the NLP processing of the corpus is executed (which happens every time new data are added to the corpus). Currently, the application does not support the co-existence of multiple versions of topic modelling or text reuse outputs, as this would have a substantial impact on the backend storage. Another possibility, which to date remains unexplored, is trying to align with one another successive versions of the same enrichment in order to support some kind of redirection mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second open challenge lies in supporting <b>incremental updates</b> to the corpus. Currently, adding new or updated data triggers a complete reingestion and reprocessing of the entire corpus. This situation is relatively frequent as new material is acquired, and content providers may provide updated versions of already delivered content. However, given the multiple backends where data are stored and indexed, as well as the chain of NLP processing that is performed on top, supporting such incremental updates is far from being a trivial task from a system architecture point of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>References</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hildelies Balk and Conteh Aly. 2011. “IMPACT: Centre of Competence in Text Digitisation.” In Proceedings of the 2011 Workshop on Historical Document Imaging and Processing, 55–160.

                subtitle: 'Jana Keck, Univ of Stuttgart (Institute of Literary Studies); German Historical Institute Washington DC; Moritz Knabben, Univ of Stuttgart (Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems); Sebastian Pado, Univ of Stuttgart (Institute for NLP)'

                templates: body
                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, two developments have come together: on the technical level, there have been innovations in applying <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-13-ocr\" target=\"_blank\">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) to historical texts at scale. At the political and scholarly level, we are seeing an increase in regional and national measures to preserve cultural heritage and to make it accessible to the public. Together, both developments have enabled the mass digitization of historical newspaper collections. For scholars, these digitization efforts enhance opportunities to study newspapers as primary texts for the analysis of historical events, figures, or concepts and to combine quantitative and qualitative methods under the umbrella of Digital Humanities (Sá Pereira 2019), bringing together humanities areas such as literary studies and cultural history and computer science disciplines like visualization and natural language processing (NLP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though creating big data for cultural heritage sounds promising, it triggers computational challenges, since NLP models are predominantly developed and tested on contemporary English-language datasets. Thus, when using methods for data extraction, linking or exploration for digitized historical datasets, several obstacles have to be considered such as noisy OCR, diachronic language change or inhomogeneous metadata schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article discusses some methodological challenges and opportunities of historical newspaper research on the example of characterizing the reception and impact of 19th-century German-speaking writers using a German-language newspaper corpus based on Europeana. The study is part of the international research project Oceanic Exchanges: Tracing Global Information Networks in Historical Newspaper Repositories, 1840-1914 (<a href=\"https://oceanicexchanges.org\" target=\"_blank\">OcEx</a>) funded by the DFG, which studies structural, textual, and conceptual network systems of digitized historical newspaper collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Case Study: Tracing German-Speaking Writers in 19th-Century German-Language Newspapers</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Research Goal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary authors such as Teju Cole or Stephen King are not only public figures due to their best-selling books, but they also write for newspapers and magazines on personal, social or political topics or raise their voices via social media platforms. As it turns out, this is not a modern development: Already in the 19th century, Mark Twain took on different roles, as a celebrated author of fictional and non-fiction texts, as a travel reporter and as a newspaper publisher and editor. Was he a special case, or was this true for popular authors at large? Our research goal is to develop a method for studying 19th-century authors not from the point of view of their writing, but from the point of view of their reception in the public eye: which authors can be detected in newspapers? How often and in what contexts are they mentioned?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with this research goal, we base our investigation on a list of 19th-century authors from <a href=\"http://www.deutsche-biographie.de\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Biographie</a>. In contrast to shortlists of “canonical” famous literary writers, the Deutsche Biographie list offers an inclusive and heterogenous picture covering over 19,000 literary, political, religious and scientific 19th-century writers, both highbrow and lowbrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Processing historical Newspapers</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use issues of a set of 110 German-language Europeana newspapers, predominantly from Germany and Austria. This covers the years 1840 to 1913, corresponding to around 2.7 million newspaper pages with almost 6.3 billion tokens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1 outlines a processing pipeline appropriate for investigating person-centric research questions such as author reception on such a corpus. Starting from the Europeana newspaper archive, we first determine relevant pages. Then we recognize all mentions of our set of relevant names using named entity recognition (<a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/named-entity-recognition-for-digitised-newspapers/\" target=\"_blank\">NER</a>) models. These mentions are further enriched with information -- in our case, with sentiment data, to characterize the type of reception the authors receive -- and statistical analysis can be carried out, ranging from simple ones like counts to sophisticated ones like, e.g., the analysis of the temporal development of person-sentiment correlations across newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Jana Picture1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Fig. 1: Natural Language Processing pipeline for person-centric analyses.</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first challenge of this processing schema is that most available NLP methods are developed for contemporary texts and the models do not take into account diachronic changes. Fortunately, this phenomenon is relatively limited when it comes to proper names (modulo changes in orthography), however, both the contextual features used for NER and lexicon-based sentiment analysis arguably require adaptation. The situation is further compounded by a second serious challenge, namely errors introduced by the OCR methods that are applied to historical newspaper texts at a large scale. The quality varies across pages due to the different physical conditions of the documents and digitization methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding NER, we use the system developed by Riedl and Padó (2018). This system is optimized for dealing with historical German texts. It uses subword embeddings, i.e. represents units below the word level, which makes it somewhat robust regarding both OCR errors and diachronic changes since the context words do not have to appear in exactly the same form as in contemporary texts; instead, partial overlap is often enough. In addition, the model is developed using transfer learning: it is first trained on comparatively large amounts of current data with NER annotation and then adapted to 19th century German by continued training on smaller historical corpora with NER labeling (Neudecker 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for sentiment analysis, we use a dictionary-driven approach based on the sentiment lexicon developed by Waltinger (2010). This lexicon partially includes probabilities for word-sentiment pairs and we use only such pairs for our predictions where the probability is non-zero and there are no polarities with a high probability. This encourages, even though the lexicon was developed on contemporary text, a high-precision analysis with few false positives. We expect that due to the large amount of newspaper data that we are dealing with, even a focus on high precision will leave us with a sufficient number of occurrences of the sentiment-bearing words together with proper names of interest. Another advantage of a dictionary-based approach is that the contextual keywords allow for an immediate manual inspection, in contrast to classifier-based approaches (see also below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concretely, we count a mention of a proper name as positive or negative if the name occurs <i>in the same sentence</i> as a positive or negative sentiment marker, respectively. This choice of the sentence level as context is debatable: It is possible that proper names are wrongly counted as, for instance, positive even though the sentiment marker occurs in a different part of the sentence. Conversely, sentiment markers that occur in sentences which contain only pronouns or definite descriptions referring to persons are lost. However, in our experience, in the absence of reliable deeper analysis methods for historical texts such as coreference resolution, the sentence level is a reasonable compromise for the attribution of sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Results</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interactive data exploration starts with investigating names which have the most occurrences in the time frame 1840-1914. As Table 1 illustrates, there is one name who dominates the picture as regards both positive and negative sentiment counts. It is not one of the usual suspects, not a canonical author like Schiller or Goethe, but a certain Rudolf Mosse.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<table

counts.</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Mosse is an interesting example not only because the set time frame covers his lifetime (1843-1920), but above all because he was an important figure in the development of the German printing landscape in the 19th century. He was a pioneer in newspaper marketing and the publishing business, being one of the first people to push for advertising in papers, new fonts and layouts (Kraus 1999). His publishing house founded more than 130 papers such as the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> (since 1871), the <i>Berliner Morgen-Zeitung</i> (1889) and the <i>Berliner Volks-Zeitung</i> (1904). Before his success as publisher, he was working for several daily, satirical and literary journals such as, for instance, Die Gartenlaube, which was the first successful mass-circulation German magazine and a forerunner of all modern magazines reaching subscribers as far as the German colonies in Africa and German-speaking groups in the Americas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These activities show that he influenced the German printing sphere behind the scenes, but how come that Mosse turns up as the most frequent author? He is listed in the Deutsche Biographie as such, but most of the occurrences in our newspaper corpus stem from his role as publisher through which he is listed on tens of thousands of title pages (see red boxes in Figures 3+4); he did continue to work as a journalist and writer, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Keck_Figure_2changed.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Fig. 3: Kladderadatsch, Bonn, 01/16/1876</i></center>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Keck_Figure_3changed.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Fig.4: page 8 of Fig. 4 (all red boxes say \"Rudolf Mosse\")</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Can sentiment analysis provide us with further insights regarding Mosse? In our study, the classification into positive and negative instances turned out to be less useful than we had hoped, not least due to ambiguity: For example, the German word “Druck” is listed as a negative cue due to its sense of “(under) pressure”, while occurrences in newspapers often use its neutral sense of printing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, sentiment analysis turned out to be valuable as a way to identify relevant (since potentially evaluative) textual contexts in which Mosse's name occurs. In this way, it essentially serves as a rung on a “scalable reading” (Mueller 2013) ladder. For example, this type of analysis has enabled us to categorize Mosse’s different professions, revealing that he also occurred as a public person due to his success as businessman, writer, and philanthropist and as an advocate for liberal conservatism and Jewish matters. Due to the abovementioned OCR problems, it is crucial to retain links to the online archive in the metadata so that close reading can proceed on the digital facsimile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Friedrich von Schiller has by far not as many hits as Mosse, in his case the classification into positive/negative served as a useful approach to differentiate between texts about his works and his persona. Negative instances such as <i>“Drama,” “Tragödie,” “Trauer,” “Trauerspiel,” “düsteren,” “Schrecken,” “Blut,” “Räuber,” “Gefahr,” or “Eifersucht” </i> were useful to find passages about his works as well as their performances and reception. <i>“Parasit,”</i> for instance, is categorized as negative and guides us to an advertisement of an English translation of Schiller’s play <a href=\"http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=dea&amp;datum=18511027&amp;seite=8\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Der Parasit und Neffe als Onkel</i></a>. The positive sentiments such as <i>“Romantik,” “lieb,” “schönen,” “hochgestellte,” “Ruhm,” “Wiederkehr,” “Recht,” “Bildung,” “Kraft,” “Dichtkunst,” “Verehrung,” “berühmt,” “bekannt,” “Größe,” “poetisch,” </i> on the other hand, lead us to texts, which report on Schiller’s talent and his success such as the article in the <a href=\"http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?aid=kro&amp;datum=18591116&amp;seite=1\" target=\"_blank\">Kronstädter Zeitung</a> which describes the proceedings of a Schiller festival in Hermannstadt to praise the writer‘s <i>Dichtkunst </i> and his contribution to nationalistic poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mosse and the Schiller case studies open up several structural and methodological, but also theoretical questions as to the setup of our list: who is categorized as a writer in the list? Even though literary canonical writers can be identified in our dataset, these are not the writers who appear most often and continuous in the newspapers. For scholars in the humanities, this approach offers new empirical ways to address questions as to the notion and concept, but also as to the profession and reception of writers in the long 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increasing availability of large amounts of digitized historical newspapers from libraries and archives opens the door to exciting new research opportunities. At the same time, digitization introduces its own set of new problems. In our case study, we have identified noisy OCR and diachronic language change as two major problems for linguistic preprocessing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One problem that we did not touch on in this article is the standardization of metadata across repositories (Beals &amp; Bell 2020), which raises issues for more detailed analyses, e.g. in terms of newspaper sections or publication types. Another problem is the use of keyword-based search to find relevant text passages. Not only is it often difficult to express information needs in the humanities as simple keyword queries, but even in our study, where we are specifically interested in person names, OCR errors presumably make us miss many author occurrences. Techniques like entity linking can offer a way to move beyond keyword search but need to be adapted to the specific domain (De Wilde 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In sum, there is still substantial need for methodological innovations, acted upon by international collaborative research projects like Oceanic Exchanges, impresso and NewsEYE that are developing ways to combine quantitative and qualitative methods. In any case, researchers working with digitized newspapers need to critically reflect upon their methods and make these steps transparent in order to assess the reproducibility and the presence of bias in the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oceanic Exchanges (OcEx) is funded through the Transatlantic Partnership for Social Sciences and Humanities 2016 Digging Into Data Challenge.

                body: "<p><b>Introduction</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never before have historical newspapers from the 19th and 20th century been so accessible. Regional and national libraries such as the <a href=\"https://www.onb.ac.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian National Library</a> (ONB), the <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a> (BNF) or the <a href=\"https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Finland</a>, to name only a few, have engaged heavily in newspaper digitisation, and with the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/de/collections/topic/18-newspapers\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Newspapers thematic collection</a>, there is now also a pan-European newspaper portal available that includes free digitized newspapers from 20 countries (including those above), dating from 1618 to 1996. This process of digitization has also shaped the practice of historians. New, digital methods have found their way into their daily practice and they essentially use them in four different areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 1: The digital practice for historians</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, text pre-processing as well as syntactic word representations, i.e. n-grams, lemmatization, word embeddings, or topic modelling, are becoming more and more important when working with digital newspapers, be it for the structuring (corpus building) or the analysis of historical data (network analysis, pattern or trend analysis, discourse analysis) (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08067.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kowsari et al., 2019</a>). Some historians need to create collections for further qualitative analysis (e.g. <a href=\"https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/528/\" target=\"_blank\">Gabrielatos, 2007</a>), some use text mining methods to identify linguistic patterns (e.g. <a href=\"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2461/paper_4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Marjanen et al., 2019</a>), others study geographically distributed phenomena (e.g. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-69839-5_34\" target=\"_blank\">Borruso, 2008</a>) and others again use digital tools to support their qualitative research questions (Brait/Oberbichler/Pfanzelter, 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following sections outline the historians' experiences from the<a href=\"https://www.newseye.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> NewsEye</a> project in preparing, organising and evaluating historical newspapers and some lessons they have learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Source preparation (digitisation)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source preparation containing all steps of digitisation is one of the starting points for Digital Humanities (DH) scholars when working with large amounts of historical documents. Some corpora already exist in digitised form, but one of the main problems researchers face when using this material is poor OCR quality. This long known problem also concerning digital newspapers affects the research process from the beginning to the end. However, bad OCR does not necessarily have to be accepted as an unchangeable fact. A number of tools exist that allow researchers to manually re-OCR documents. Transkribus, which recently won the EU Horizon Impact Award, is well suited for this task. Within the NewsEye project, a dataset of some 1.5 million pages from the participating national libraries of Austria, France and Finland was re-OCR’ed by the Transkribus team at the University of Innsbruck, using a specifically trained model that had been improved by computer scientists of the project at the University of Rostock. This led to strong improvements in OCR quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 2: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Transkribus </i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the upload to Transkribus can be time-consuming, the platform is an option available for researchers working outside large projects such as NewsEye or without access to large-scale computing infrastructure. Exploratory research by the NewsEye DH-team showed that even the standard OCR tool implemented in Transkribus (using Layout Recognition and then Abbyy FineReader) can greatly improve the quality of the recognized text for both the Gothic and normal typefaces in historical newspapers (figure 3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 3: Improved OCR with Transkribus Standard OCR (Abbyy FineReader) next to the original scan and it’s transcript offered by ANNO)</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>A second approach that the NewsEye team is currently digging into is OCR post-correction. Computer scientists from the Universities of La Rochelle and Helsinki are researching automated tools and methods that do away with the time-consuming re-OCR process. The results so far are quite promising and definitely show the way for further research (<a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1051/\" target=\"_blank\">Hämäläinen and Hengchen, 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4008952\" target=\"_blank\">Vinh-Nam et al., 2020</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Searching, structuring, cleaning, categorising, organising and reducing digital newspaper collections</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most humanities scholars, keywords are still key in order to find specific newspaper articles, to limit collections to a topic of interest, or to structure both articles and collections. At the same time, keyword searching goes hand in hand with some serious weaknesses (<a href=\"http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/~presnejl/2010Perform/Keywords.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bair and Carlson, 2008</a>). Even when taking the above-mentioned issues into account, many search requests are difficult to define conceptually and hard, if not impossible, to trace by a simple keyword search alone. Additionally, when building topic-specific corpora using queries, there is always a compromise between precision and recall, between creating a corpus that contains only relevant texts but not all relevant texts and, on the other hand, creating a corpus that contains all available relevant texts, but at the expense of including irrelevant texts (<a href=\"http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/~presnejl/2010Perform/Keywords.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Gabrielatos, 2007</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.fr/books?id=cN4qDgAAQBAJ&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions\" target=\"_blank\">Chowdhury, 2010</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most newspaper interfaces allow advanced keyword searches with a range of search options, but they do not support finding similar or equally relevant keywords and they do not allow tracking changing word usage or spelling mistakes. With the <a href=\"https://platform.newseye.eu/users/sign_in\" target=\"_blank\">NewsEye Platform</a> (<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3383583.3398627\" target=\"_blank\">Jean-Caurant and Doucet, 2020</a>), a prototypical interface for digitized newspapers, the partners from the Universities of La Rochelle and Helsinki created possibilities to support keyword searching with the help of word embeddings (so does the <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/\" target=\"_blank\">Impresso interface Media Monitoring of the Past</a>). Word embeddings are based on the distribution of a particular word in a collection of texts and can be used to detect words that have similar aggregate distributions in large-scale corpora (see <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01615440.2020.1760157?needAccess=true\" target=\"_blank\">Wevers and Koolen, 2020</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_4.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 4: Keywords suggestion in the NewsEye platform for the keyword “rückwanderer” in German </i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to the organisation and reduction of digital newspaper collections as well as the export of datasets, many existing interfaces do not support this research step that is, however, necessary for any qualitative approach generally used by historians. Interfaces like Impresso's <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/app/\" target=\"_blank\">Media Monitoring of the Past</a> or the NewsEye platform have a strong focus on dataset or sub-corpus building supported by methods like multilingual <a href=\"http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ferro/CLEF-WN-Drafts/CLEF2020/paper_171.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Named Entity Recognition and Linking</a> or <a href=\"https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01943841/document\" target=\"_blank\">Event Detection</a>. Searches can be added to datasets and (re-)organized, scaled down and enlarged as well as exported to the private workspace. In addition, in the NewsEye platform, the borders of the automatically separated articles can also be adjusted manually if necessary, thus overcoming still ongoing issues with article separation and layout recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N85F1JXdfS4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center>NewsEye screencast on “How to create and manage datasets using the NewsEye platform”</center>\r\n\r\n<p>NLP methods can also support the classification of relevant and non-relevant articles within a collection by taking the context of keywords into account. Using an approach combining Latent Topic modeling (LDA) and the Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD) method, a collection on return migration including ambiguous keywords such as “Heimkehr” (returning home) or “Rückwanderung” (return migration) was automatically grouped into topic-relevant and topic-irrelevant articles (see <a href=\"https://github.com/NewsEye/NLP-Notebooks-Newspaper-Collections/blob/master/news_article_similarity_notebook.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter Notebook</a>):</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_5.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 5: Articles automatically grouped into relevant and non-relevant articles (number 3 for relevant and number 0 for non-relevant articles).</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, also text mining methods are promising for the structuring of text. For example, text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of given categories based on the research topic. This automated classification (see <a href=\"https://github.com/NewsEye/NLP-Notebooks-Newspaper-Collections/blob/master/Text_classification_of_newspaper_clippings_notebook.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter Notebook</a>) of text into predefined categories is an important method for managing and processing a large number of newspaper clippings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_6.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 6: Visualization of the distribution of the predefined categories in newspaper clippings of selected Austrian newspapers on “emigration”</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Evaluation of linguistic patterns </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One clear trend in studying digitized historical sources is a renewed interest in language as an indicator of historical change. Machine-readability has led to searchability, but also allows for counting words, their co-occurrences, and comparing sub-corpora by analysing their word frequencies. Researchers use language data in newspapers as an entry point to studying historical processes that the newspapers reported on, but quite a few historians are also interested in studying the discourse in its own right, that is language itself. Understanding term frequencies and patterns in linguistic change are important in both cases, but especially for latter studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way digital newspaper collections are available affects how researchers can assess term frequencies. With data dumps of full texts, the possibilities to quantitatively analyze and visualize frequency related issues are almost endless, but demand a lot of know-how. Interfaces that we know of provide varying possibilities for researchers to evaluate changes in term frequencies. First occurrences, periods of rapid increase or breaks in occurrences of words are difficult not to notice. But, reasons for changes in frequencies vary, and making sense of them often require possibilities to explore the frequencies from different perspectives (<a href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02480654v4\" target=\"_blank\">Pfanzelter et al., 2020</a>). Most typically, it is necessary to compare absolute frequencies for different words and newspaper titles which is doable in some interfaces. However, the possibility to normalize frequencies (term frequency per the amount of terms in the corpus), is usually not given. For instance, comparing the occurrences of politically laden words in two newspapers is not very informative unless we can relate them to how many tokens the newspapers published all in all, because only this shows the relevancy of term usage in one particular medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an easy solution to this: providing the user the possibility of downloading absolute term frequencies as well as the number of all tokens in a search per year. This does not require a lot of effort from the side of the interface provider, but most importantly it does not clutter the interface for the majority of users who are not interested in frequencies. The frequencies themselves are then best analyzed using spreadsheets or scripting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/sarahchart.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 7: Relative annual frequencies of the lemmas “modersmål” and “äidinkieli” in Swedish-language and Finnish-language newspapers published in Finland. The comparison does not have to be readily available, but the possibility of downloading frequencies allows such a plot.</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Term frequencies, absolute or relative, are very basic information when it comes to analysing masses of texts. This makes it incomprehensible why reliable and usable ways to explore frequencies in digital newspapers collections are not readily available. In many cases, more advanced methods are put into place before simple frequency tools. This is problematic because more elaborate methods, such as those relying on topic models or word embeddings, are always related to frequencies. To understand more complicated methods, we need to understand changes in frequencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Qualitative content and discourse analysis</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newly developed approaches can support historians in many research steps. This does not end when it comes to qualitative evaluation of newspaper reporting. Annotation is fundamental for content or discourse analysis. Recently developed interfaces for historical newspapers, such as Impresso's Media Monitoring of the Past or the NewsEye platform, show how enriched data and new methods could ultimately improve access to historical (newspaper) collections. But they do not offer any methods or functions to enable semi-automated annotation of the collections created. What they do offer, however, is a variety of download options to facilitate further processing. Qualitative analysis softwares such as <a href=\"https://www.maxqda.de/software-inhaltsanalyse?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsv7BRCmARIsANu-CQf_Rn3LMxf4SAvgZLFY8DfCf05-lG8KM3DW0l5esQTyO5Tv79N42tkaAsNNEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">MAXQDA</a>, <a href=\"https://atlasti.com/de/\" target=\"_blank\">ATLAS.ti</a>, or <a href=\"https://catma.de/\" target=\"_blank\">CATMA</a> allow the import of such collections. Besides the versatility and flexibility, the strengths of these qualitative software products lie in their applicability for various methodological approaches and procedures, such as data connection, structuring and data output or the representation of conceptual contexts, for example in the form of semantic structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Newspapers/Sarah Fig_8.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 8: Semi-automated annotation in the qualitative analysis platform ATLAS.ti</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For historians, (semi-)automated methods will only have a significant impact and be relied upon if sound qualitative or discourse research is doable. Until then, the debates about whether “digital history” is merely an auxiliary science or will fundamentally change the discipline itself are bound to continue (<a href=\"https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/2011_3_1_patel.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Patel, 2011</a>, <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/geschichte-digital-historische-welten-neu-vermessen/oclc/951142081&amp;referer=brief_results\" target=\"_blank\">Koller, 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.14765/zzf.dok-1345\" target=\"_blank\">Burkhardt, 2020</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter if digital methods are applied for quantitative or qualitative evaluations, the tools as well as the outcomes should be critically tested and reflected. Digital source and tool criticism – the reflection on the impact of digitization and tools on the knowledge production – therefore has to become an integrative practice for digital historians (<a href=\"https://diglib.uibk.ac.at/ulbtirolfodok/download/pdf/866898?originalFilename=true\" target=\"_blank\">Pfanzelter, 2015</a>). Although users often find it difficult to understand how tools or methods work exactly, they should be (made) aware of how the tools interact with their research data in order to be able to rely on the results. Interfaces provided by libraries or archives, which are not tailored to the needs of historians, make source, tool and corpus criticism often difficult, which is why it is important to increase cooperation between different disciplines and institutions. The advantages of multidisciplinarity can clearly be seen in one of the prototypes of the NewsEye project, the platform, which gives a glimpse into different handlings of historical source material by historians, linguists, computer scientists, librarians and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Acknowledgment</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work has been supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant 770299 (NewsEye).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>References</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sheila Bair and Sharon Carlson, “Where Keywords Fail: Using Metadata to Facilitate Digital Humanities Scholarship,” Journal of Library Metadata 8, no. 3 (October 8, 2008): 249–62, https://doi.org/10.1080/19386380802398503.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emanuela Boros et al., “Robust Named Entity Recognition and Linking on Historical Multilingual Documents” (Working Notes of CLEF 2020 - Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, Thessaloniki, 2020).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giuseppe Borruso, “Geographical Analysis of Foreign Immigration and Spatial Patterns in Urban Areas: Density Estimation and Spatial Segregation,” in Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2008, ed.

                body: "<p>In October 2019, policymakers, cultural heritage institutions, members of the ‘<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana</a>’ expert group and experts in multilingualism from European Union member states participated in an event titled ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/next-steps-for-multilingualism-in-digital-cultural-heritage\" target=\"_blank\">Multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage - needs, expectations and ways forward</a>’. This meeting was hosted in Espoo, Finland, by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture under the auspices of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Over two days, participants discussed how the CH sector can use advances in digital technology to make heritage material more accessible across the EU. For Europeana, which gathers collections from all 27 EU countries and in 38 languages, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-re-working-to-make-sure-culture-is-for-everyone-in-any-language\" target=\"_blank\">finding solutions to run a better, more multilingual service</a> is paramount, and the meeting was a milestone in the definition of Europeana's <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-multilingual-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">multilingual strategy</a>. But multilingualism is relevant for the entire cultural heritage sector, not just Europeana. The variety of views expressed during the meeting represented these different perspectives, as well as the voice of experts in technology that can be used to fill the existing gaps, now or in the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/tag/finnish-presidency\" target=\"_blank\">presentations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/albums/72157711667364238\" target=\"_blank\">images</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/372582901/dd1e668bc0\">video</a> for the meeting are available online. A summary of the points discussed in the various presentations, panels and group working sessions can also be found <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/next-steps-for-multilingualism-in-digital-cultural-heritage\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and a full report is available <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/benefits-challenges-and-solutions-for-multilingual-digital-cultural-heritage\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Today, we are glad to present a EuropeanaTech Insight issue that focuses on three contributions, which represents the diversity of topics discussed. First, Juliane Stiller, information specialist and co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.you-we-digital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">You, We &amp; Digital</a>, gives a general introduction to the problem space and the possible solutions for multilingualism in digital Cultural Heritage. Tom Vanallemeersch, language technology expert at <a href=\"http://www.crosslang.com/en\" target=\"_blank\">CrossLang</a>, then writes about the technical challenges and solutions of automated translation. Finally, Antoine Isaac, Dasha Moskalenko and Hugo Manguinhas from Europeana Foundation present three case studies on how multilingual issues can be solved at Europeana, using appropriate design choices combined with knowledge graph and translation technologies.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>When looking for digital cultural heritage in Europeana, you want to find all relevant books, paintings, photos, or other cultural heritage objects that match your search. You might not care much about the language in which the objects you desire are described, as long as the object satisfies your needs. Providing you with this kind of experience, where you always get relevant results to your inquiry independent of the language you speak or the language the objects are described in, is not trivial. This is particularly true for the cultural heritage domain because multilingualism is still one of the major challenges for digital cultural heritage. Not only do we need to deal with evolving languages over time but also with retrieving information stored in cultural heritage artefacts across multiple languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridging these language gaps is essential for searching digital cultural heritage and presenting it in a comprehensible way. One of the goals during the “<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/multilingualism-in-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage</a>” meeting that took place under the Finish presidency in November 2019 in Espoo, Finland, was to understand the opportunities and benefits of multilingualism for digital cultural heritage. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-re-working-to-make-sure-culture-is-for-everyone-in-any-language\" target=\"_blank\">The benefits of multilingualism in cultural heritage are obvious</a>, including increased usage and exposure of cultural heritage objects as well as fostering and understanding different cultures. Nonetheless, implementing this multilingual access to digital cultural heritage is still challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advancing multilingualism is not only a matter of providing translation but requires a deep understanding of multilingual aspects and how they impact different components of a digital library or an information system that offers access to cultural heritage. This includes the user interface, search, browse and engagement. Multilingualism penetrates each layer of an information system for cultural heritage. On one side is the cultural heritage object that carries language information in the form of text or audio. On the other side are the users who want to access cultural heritage in their preferred language. Providing a user-friendly interface in the preferred language of the user is one challenging problem where one needs to decide what is the most reliable indicator for automatically setting the preferred language, for example the IP-address, the browser language or the system language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multilingual user experience is determined by the different functionalities that the systems provide, such as searching, browsing and engaging with the cultural heritage content. Retrieval of and access to digital cultural heritage objects is a genuine challenge that is aggravated by the nature of digital cultural heritage: not only can the cultural heritage object have multiple languages, but so can the metadata, such as titles and descriptions which are mostly in the language of the owning institution. The language gaps that need to be bridged lay between the user and the object, and the object and its describing metadata. If you want to dive deeper into this matter, refer to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/best-practices-for-multilingual-access\" target=\"_blank\">White Paper on Best Practices for Multilingual Access</a>, which aggregates resources and strategies for realizing multilingual access to cultural heritage content in digital libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To retrieve cultural heritage information in Europeana, one can search items with the provided search box. Search poses the challenge that the query language needs to be aligned with the content in the system. Overcoming this potential mismatch between the language of a query and the language of the content is a technical problem that is tackled by research in the area of multilingual information access (MLIA). To illustrate the complexity of the problem, think about the different language versions of the famous da Vinci painting Mona Lisa that is named differently in different languages. Typing any of these different language versions into the search box in Europeana yields different result sets. Typing “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=mona%20lisa\" target=\"_blank\">Mona Lisa</a>”, as the painting is known in German and English, yields almost 200 results. In French, the painting is known as “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=La%20Joconde\" target=\"_blank\">La Joconde</a>” and in Italian it is either “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=monna%20lisa\" target=\"_blank\">Monna Lisa</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=la%20gioconda\" target=\"_blank\">La Gioconda</a>”; all of these queries retrieve different results sets. Ideally, each query retrieves the same set of results. But this is a hard task to do and the approach for bridging the language gap is either to translate the content or translate the query.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/Picture 1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Searching for different language variants of Mona Lisa in Europeana yields different results sets or varying sizes. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>, 2020</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although automatic translation recently became more and more powerful, it is in need of high quality training data as well as context to produce satisfactory results. The Europeana use case operates under difficult conditions as content is described in over 50 languages. Being able to translate between each language pair is almost impossible due to the sheer amount of language pairs. The problem is further exacerbated by missing training data for small languages, metadata heterogeneity and sparsity, as well as historical language information which is inherent for digital cultural heritage. The good news is that translation does not need to be perfect if used for retrieval only. For example, search results can still be relevant across languages if translations used for retrieval lack fluency. But if translations are shown to users to help them make sense of the search results they see then good translations are needed as to not negatively impact the user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at queries that users send to the Europeana search engine, we find many queries in different languages. A query such as “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?view=grid&amp;query=%22Alphonse%20Mucha%22\" target=\"_blank\">alphonse mucha</a>” suggests that the user is interested in the painter and his life and works but it does not give away the language the user expects to receive results in. A user querying <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?view=grid&amp;query=%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8A%D1%80&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">театър</a> (English: theatre) might be interested in seeing Russian results but the intent of the query is not very clear as it is short, provides no context and the term is very broad. It is also not unusual to find queries with terms in several languages such as “<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?view=grid&amp;query=berlin%20berliner%20mauer%20or%20wall&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">berlin berliner mauer or wall</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, Europeana queries are characterized by a huge long tail which means that most of the queries only appear once and some queries appear very often. For example, check out some of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/2016-top-20-searches-on-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">the most searched queries in 2016</a>. Furthermore, queries can be ambiguous in language as terms such as “culture”, “administration”, or “madonna”, occur in more than one language. Semantically ambiguous queries such as “barber” (composer or hairdresser) are another category of challenging queries that need to be addressed. Matters are made worse when thinking about terms such as “Inde” which means India in French and poison in Lithuanian. Mixing these meanings can result in very poor user experiences and should be avoided. Europeana addresses some of these challenges by using entity pages and optimizes for the large set of queries that ask for entities such as “paris” or “mozart”. One example is the entity page of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/person/146741-leonardo-da-vinci\" target=\"_blank\">Leonardo da Vinci </a>that links all works and content related to the painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/Picture 2.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Long tail of Europeana queries: many queries occur only once. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>, 2020</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For effectively bridging the language gap, one can further use controlled vocabularies - an approach Europeana has been using for a long time. To see the currently supported vocabularies that are used to enrich metadata refer to this document that lists <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1BoDNolkcp_qfvVShdOZyGcf61XslcwKF2MdGcjgYs20/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana dereferenceable vocabularies</a>. This so-called enrichment process adds language versions of a term found in the vocabularies to the metadata of the Europeana object. Next to entities, such as persons and location, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana enriches metadata </a>with vocabularies for concepts to offer users keywords in their preferred languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/Picture 3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Enrichment of an agent label. In this example: Johannes Vermeer and the different language variants of this named entity. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a>, 2020</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To summarize, the challenges of enabling multilingualism in digital cultural heritage are immense and very diverse. There are solutions that work particularly well for this domain but all solutions become less suitable once they have to be scaled to a large number of language pairs as found in Europeana.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The digital cultural heritage sector touches upon scenarios where multilingualism plays a crucial role, in order to cater for the information needs of citizens and organisations throughout the European Union. One such scenario consists of searching through large digital inventories of metadata describing cultural objects. Imagine metadata providing a description of a Greek painting depicting a dish. A French food historian looking for paintings on the Europeana website may likely provide search terms like <i>peinture</i> (“painting”), <i>plat</i> (“dish”) and <i>poisson</i> (“fish”) and retrieve a list of paintings with a French description and possibly a French title. However, without the necessary multilingual support, the below Greek still-life with fish painted by twentieth-century artist Nikolaos Magiasis may remain out of reach. Another search scenario consists of diving into the very contents of artworks themselves, for instance historical documents. Uncountable are those who have never reached the desks of translators, leading valuable knowledge to be shielded from researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/tom1.jpeg\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/90402/SK_A_1529\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Still life with fish, Rijksmuseum,1652. In Greek: Νεκρή φύση με ψάρια</i></a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Public Domain</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to unlocking vast quantities of textual data consists of automating the translation process using a <i>machine translation</i> (MT) system, even though the output of the latter may not be ideal in all cases. In this era of constantly increasing digitisation, it is essential to be transparent about the possibilities of MT towards users and to raise awareness about MT among organisations. This was one of the conclusions of the Europeana meeting <i>Multilingualism in digital cultural heritage - Needs, expectations and ways forward</i>, which took place on 24 and 25 October 2019 in Espoo, Finland and included a presentation by CrossLang on the challenges for MT in the domain of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The field of MT has been around since the very advent of the first computers, but systems which have the capacity to approach human translator performance have only started to see the light in recent years, thanks to the sophisticated math of neural networks. These complex computing systems, inspired by the human brain, have led to impressive progress in many applications of Artificial Intelligence (such as <i>deep fakes </i>and speech recognition). However, a huge caveat lies hidden in the abovementioned word “capacity”. Powerful machines require loads of energy to run. Similarly, an MT system needs to be fed with many translation examples, i.e. texts paired with their translation, in order to be able to “learn” how to translate new texts from one language into another. Moreover, these examples, which compose the training data of the system, should not only consist of “generic” sentences, but also of sentences from the specific domain for which the MT system is built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital cultural heritage sector no doubt presents one of the most complex scenarios for MT. Metadata related to objects of art, as well as art-related books and other types of documents, have a very heterogeneous content and are less repetitive than texts in the “classical” domains in which MT operates. An example of such a domain consists of the administrative and legal texts that form the backbone of the European Commission’s eTranslation system. Moreover, cultural heritage texts are typically available in only one language. Therefore, translation examples are scarce. An aggravating factor for MT is that metadata tends to consist of small pieces of text (imagine the book title Bass, pike, perch &amp; others as a metadata record), while MT systems have a strong appetite for longer sentences in their training data: in the sentences <i>I prefer to pan-fry sea bass in order to improve the taste, The pike found extensive use in these armies</i>, and <i>The bird was chained to the perch in the garden,</i> the words surrounding <i>bass, pike and perch</i> help to capture their meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/tom3.jpg\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><em>Cover of</em> Bass, pike, perch and other game fishes of America<em>, by James A. Henshall features several ambiguous title words</em>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/en/item/08711/item_34329\">Harvard University</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Public Domain</a>, 1903</center>\r\n\r\n<p>To further complicate things, digital cultural information may not only come to us as heterogeneous textual content (possibly in older language variants), but also in various data formats that have to undergo careful processing before MT can be applied at all. This is for instance the case for scanned books, photographs with text, and recorded speeches. Given these challenges, you may get the impression that, at this point in time, multilingual cultural information for all to enjoy is still far away. While the low-hanging fruit is indeed not abundant, some recent strategies in neural MT can exploit the data we have in astute ways. Let us have a look at some of the strategies that focus on the textual content. These strategies are currently of such importance that the eTranslation developers have asked the Commission’s Multilingualism team (DG CNECT) and CrossLang to organise workshops on them, moderated by top-level researchers from academia and industry (Facebook AI Research).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A first strategy we will highlight consists of <i>domain adaptation</i>. We provide an MT system with a large number of generic sentences and their translation (such translations are available for many languages through assiduous collection efforts in the last decades), and, once the system becomes good at translating generic text, we specialise it by feeding it translations in a specific domain. If we have only a few domain-specific translation examples to “tweak” the system, we can cook up many more examples using a simple technique called <i>backtranslation</i>. Imagine we want to translate from English into German. If we have art-related German books or websites, we translate them using a generic German to English system and add the resulting English-German translation examples to the MT training data. This way, our system learns to translate from “moderate” or “bad” English (i.e. an automatic translation) to good German (written by a human being), in addition to learning from the original “good” translation examples. While it is counterintuitive, even imperfect examples can be useful for learning!</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/tom2.jpg\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Physiologie du goût<i>, a work on gastronomy that has been translated into various languages, cover image National Library of France, <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/page/NoC-OKLR/1.0/?language=nl\" target=\"_blank\">no known copyright</a>- <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;query=Physiologie%20du%20go%C3%BBt%20&amp;reusability=restricted&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">See more on Europeana </a></i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>In case of languages ranking low in terms of number of speakers, such as Icelandic, the scarcity of translations, especially domain-specific ones, is even more pressing. In this scenario, we could go for a <i>multilingual</i> MT strategy. It consists of adding translation examples involving more than two languages to the proverbial blender, for instance, translations from English into German, Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic. By adding language codes (like <i>IS</i> and <i>NO</i>) to translation examples, training a system from them, and adding the code IS when translating new sentences (the system needs to know into which language we want to translate), we will obtain a better translation quality in Icelandic than in case we only trained on examples in English-Icelandic ! When learning to translate into Icelandic, the system actually learns from the other languages, which also belong to the Germanic family (at this point, we should remark that neural MT systems typically translate pieces of words rather than complete words, and some of these word pieces are shared among languages).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More experimental strategies are <i>unsupervised</i> and <i>document-level</i> translation. They are far from an acquired taste. In case of <i>unsupervised</i> MT, the blender contains texts which are not each other’s translation (for instance, English and French texts in the same domain), and yet what comes out looks like a rudimentary translation system. Without going into the minor details, the idea is to identify similar words and sentences in both languages, as shown in the below figure (step B) and learning to translate in two directions (step D). We could even apply this strategy to language variants. For instance, a system may learn to translate from old English into modern English using texts from both variants. In case of <i>document-level</i> MT, we look at the whole document when translating a sentence, in order to capture its full context. In case of metadata records, the document would be the set of all records related to an object of art (for instance, an object with the words <i>Bass, pike, perch &amp; others </i>in one record may have a subject record that includes <i>Bass fishing</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/tomchart.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Unsupervised machine translation, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07755.pdf</a>. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">arXiv license</a>, August 2018</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, many brand-new recipes are available from the rapidly evolving field of neural MT. They allow to tackle the scarcity of domain-specific translations available for the languages under scrutiny, especially for languages which rank lower in terms of number of speakers. These recipes have already proven useful in research experiments and in “classical” MT scenarios involving repetitive texts. Trying them out on cultural-heritage texts will lead to interesting dishes and, hopefully, delightful tastings for European citizens and organisations.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: 'Antoine Isaac, Dasha Moskalenko, Hugo Manguinhas; Europeana Foundation'
                anchortitle: 'Tackling Europeana’s multilingual challenges'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>For several years, the Europeana.eu portal has offered the option to translate elements of its user interface into the languages of the European Union. Part of the content, for instance, some virtual exhibitions, have also been manually translated. Finally, readers familiar with metadata issues are aware of how Europeana and its partners perform manual and automatic metadata enrichment to relate objects to multilingual (linked data) vocabularies, harnessing the versatility of the Europeana Data Model and paving the way for more multilingual search and display based on that enriched metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, Europeana has articulated a general approach to tackling multilingual issues, across the various services it offers. At the Finnish Presidency event on Multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage, Europeana presented ideas that informed the new DSI-4 multilingual strategy. We also presented three case studies on key aspects of the strategy: user experience and design, using a knowledge graph to enhance multilingualism of the metadata, and exploiting automatic translation services like EU’s eTranslation for search within full-text content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>UX Design and user testing</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first case study was about user experience (UX) and testing. Results from a user survey indicate that around half of Europeana.eu’s visitors already activate the existing language-related features in the user interface (language selector, object language filter in facets). A vast majority is ready to use other languages than their own (four languages on average) during search, in order to find what they are looking for. The same proportion is eager to consume search results in even more languages than the ones they use for querying the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Future UX designs need to serve these users willing to cross language barriers. In this light, we have presented design options for the search page, which reflect the detection of the language of queries, the firing of translated queries against Europeana’s database, and the intelligible display of results that could be in the language of the original query or result from translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/VesselUI.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 1. Proposal to show available languages for search results in Europeana. Different language results are visible in the bottom corners of the search result thumbnails. 2020 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA </a></i></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have also begun to investigate ways to enhance multilinguality of item pages, proposing new features that would allow users to shift between the various languages that Europeana’s database may provide for a given item’s metadata and to activate automatic translation when the metadata is not available in the user’s language of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translation of object metadata using the Knowledge Graph</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second case study looked under the hood of the metadata infrastructure that Europeana has already been working on to enable such multilingual end-user scenarios. The first principle here is to back the object metadata that Europeana aggregates with its partners (e.g., on the type, subject or creators of objects) with a multilingual knowledge graph. Since 2014, Europeana has encouraged its data providers to contribute links to their own vocabularies and publish them as Linked Open Data, or directly use available reference vocabularies to describe their content. This is notably the case in Europeana’s licensing framework, which enforces the selection of rights statements for objects among the multilingual set of statements provided by Creative Commons and RightsStatements.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a long-term effort though, which requires everyone in Europeana's ecosystem to improve the way they manage and enrich their data – a key aspect of a never-ending digital transformation. To complement it, Europeana has begun to assemble a specific semantic vocabulary of core places, concepts and subjects, the Europeana Entity Collection. This “in-house” knowledge graph is used to support enhanced searching and browsing, by providing data to create multilingual \"entity pages'' (for example for Pablo Picasso) and by enriching existing object metadata. Built on top of resources from DBpedia, Wikidata, Geonames, the Entity Collection also links to elements from other controlled vocabularies available as linked data, including Getty’s Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), OCLC’s Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), the thesaurus from the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO). This enables connecting it to even more objects from Europeana’s providers. The Entity Collection has a higher language coverage than most typical cultural heritage vocabularies: for example, its subjects have labels in 13.1 languages on average. This in turn allows us to provide many objects with more labels: for example, more than 12 million objects are assigned extra topic labels in 17 languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Entity Collection provides a spine to harmonize vocabularies from the many data providers into a single point of reference and build a more homogeneous and multilingual user experience. This work is still in progress, however: we will work to increase the coverage of the Entity Collection, both in terms of resources and languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Combining the metadata knowledge graph with automatic translation</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the knowledge graph approach promises relatively high-quality multilingual metadata, we are aware that it will not be enough: there will always be gaps to fill, especially in terms of language coverage. To palliate these issues, our multilingual strategy foresees that Europeana will employ automatic translation as a complement. For example, for the display of metadata in a given language, we foresee that the system will first attempt to retrieve the metadata in that language from the original metadata completed with the knowledge graph. Should this fail, the system will then rely on automatic translation from the English version of its metadata, where this version will have been pre-computed and stored in our system:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/DisplayProcess.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 2. Proposed process for multilingual display of object metadata 2020 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA </a></i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s multilingual strategy also envisions the use of English as a pivot language in search. The idea is to detect a query’s language, use the Entity Collection and automatic translation to augment the search string with more languages, and then perform the augmented query against Europeana’s index, which will have been augmented too, thanks to the knowledge graph and automatic translation. This process, shown below, will give more opportunities to match the original query with relevant objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/SearchProcess.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 3. Proposed process for multilingual search based on metadata 2020 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA </a></i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar flow is conceived for search over full-text content (for instance, newspapers or transcriptions of documents). The additional steps here are about building on a multilingual fulltext index: identifying the source language of text objects, translating the full-text to English and indexing it in both English and source language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana still needs to validate many building blocks for these processes. Especially, much remains to be done for experimenting with and ensuring the quality of automatic steps, such as enrichment, language detection and translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Content translation and search</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our third case study was, as a matter of fact, a preliminary evaluation of automatic translation. More precisely, we tested query and content translation for multilingual search over full-text documents. We selected 18,257 transcriptions (in 17 languages) of World War I objects from Transcribathons hosted by the Enrich Europeana project. We have used the CEF eTranslation automatic translation service, which managed to provide translations in English for all required languages. We loaded the resulting data in a search index and assessed the resulting cross-lingual search prototype with a sample of 69 user queries from the Europeana 1914-1918 thematic collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, cross-lingual results based on English translations of queries and documents add many more results to these obtained with queries and documents in original languages – several hundreds new results in some cases. The question is whether quantity comes at the price of quality. We conducted a first evaluation comparing results with or without automatic translation: it showed that using automatic translation leads to incomplete coverage: extrapolating the evaluation results, we expect that using translation would bring 67% of the records in other languages that are likely to be correct. More worrying, a second manual evaluation hints that in the current experimental setup, 51% of the results are likely to be noisy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More evaluation was needed, though, as a meaningful comparison between original results and these using translation was possible only for five languages. Hence, we manually assessed the quality of automatic translations for queries. Our first finding is that the translation system mostly struggled to handle the queries that should be left untouched, notably the ones for named entities (persons, places…), including some lesser-known WWI soldiers. A second lesson learnt (or more precisely, confirmed) is that Europeana has to handle a big and long tail of queries, which is a great challenge for query translation. That tail is blurry, too: in some cases, there are typos in the query term or the information need behind a query is not obvious. Another hurdle is wrong language assumption: as our above mentioned user survey indicates, users may query in a language that is not the one we would expect based on the language version of the portal that they use. The case of the query “avion”, found on the Italian version of the portal, is a great example of such issues: has someone used the Italian portal for searching in French for documents about planes, or were they interested instead in the French town spelled Avion in French and in Italian?</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/Multilingualism/Z0068188.jpg\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Figure 4.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They used to say that history is written by the victors, but, in this new era of digital publishing and propagation, we’re creating our own records of our own lives, in an unprecedented way. We’re more visible to each other than we’ve ever been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s only in the last couple of decades that humans have managed to assemble millions of things in one place. Sure, some of the largest cultural institutions in the world hold millions of things on their shelves or millions of specimens in their vaults, but recently we’ve seen a new proliferation of massive collections of online content on the web. Europeana is one of these new places. Instagram is another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary digital platforms like Instagram have a curious advantage, because there, our history is born digital and born in the instant. Exploration often happens socially, and not through experts. Perhaps this makes it easier to see ourselves reflected, instead of as Other. We rely on social description and interconnection, instead of a solo professional’s description of something. This is a massive change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Literacy remains a huge challenge, and that’s when our experts return. There’s so much to consume we need guidance. There’s a new cultural role called Influencer. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomward/2017/12/12/how-to-become-an-influencer-10-tips-for-success\">Forbes Magazine</a> tells us that to become an influencer, you need to find your niche - do something unique, create great content, engage with your audience, and look at the data to see if it’s working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s exciting is that influence - whoever is causing it - can spread as fast as lightning. Look at #metoo. Look at how that is actively distancing itself from history. Look at how our many histories are being seen. It’s unprecedented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The machines might notice a blip in traffic, but they can’t interpret the signal like we can. As Lewis Lapham wrote, ‘Computers scan everything but hear nothing.’ The challenge for cultural heritage workers is to transform from gatekeepers to both influencers and gatherers of more histories. The gates are already open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

Selected public galleries may be featured on the Europeana website and promoted by Europeana’s Collections Engagement team.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Licensing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Blogs, exhibitions and galleries can feature digital objects with any licence or rights statement from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We encourage authors to use openly licensed content where possible.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">All contributed texts are published under a CC BY-SA licence by default. All authors are credited in blogs and exhibitions. Gallery creators are noted where space allows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To allow promotion of the editorial on social media, we require at least one openly licensed image or permission from the rights holder.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In-copyright material from outside the Europeana website can only be used if specific permission has been obtained by the author from the copyright holder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Specific attention should be paid to objects with a ‘non-derivative’ licence, as these cannot be cropped or changed, e.g. in feature or hero images.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Guidance for writing for exhibitions / blogs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Style and tone of voice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana’s editorial is aimed at culture lovers across the world. The personality we convey is intelligent, welcoming and inspiring. Our editorial should not read like an academic journal or a legal document. We want to see the humanity in it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want our editorial to be easily understood by a range of readers all around the world. So we prefer simple writing and simple punctuation. Think one idea per paragraph. Avoid complicated structures that require complex punctuation. Read it out loud and make sure there are places to breathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Think about your story</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Before you begin, think about the story you want to tell.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What is the reader going to learn from this exhibition or blog?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Then break it down into smaller sections.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What does each exhibition chapter or section of a blog reveal? How does it relate to the others?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">And think about how the sections relate to each other. Remember that people don’t always explore an exhibition in the order it’s written. And people might share their favourite bit of your blog on social media - each section needs to work by itself, while being part of the whole story.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Be an expert</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You’re contributing to Europeana because you have specialist knowledge. We’d love you to&nbsp; give us something that Wikipedia or a quick Google search doesn’t provide. Give us a new perspective - something we don’t know - and link your text closely to the digital collections, using a range of sources from different organisations / countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please explain - or better still avoid - any jargon so that your text is accessible to a wide range of readers. Don’t forget many are reading in a second language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Useful tips</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use conversational tone and accessible language (no jargon)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Focus on one story (do not include off-topic information)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You can add images or embed video or audio (where embedding is allowed)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use subheadings, white space and images, other media or pull quotes to break up longer sections of text</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Make sure the title / subtitle / introduction is&nbsp; SEO-friendly&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We use British English spellings, the Oxford English Dictionary and the European Commission’s English Style Guide</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support from Europeana</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your contributions to Europeana editorial are hugely valuable and we are very happy to support you in developing them from the ideas stage through to publication. We will work with you to ensure your texts fit our editorial style and our platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please remember that what has worked on another platform or in another format may not transfer automatically to Europeana’s style and requirements. So please assess and edit your exhibition or blog in light of these guidelines. If you have questions or difficulties, please get in touch at&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu.\">editorial@europeana.eu.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana''s Carbon Footprint'
        intro: "<p>During Europeana's hack week 2018, one of the teams set a goal to calculate the carbon footprint of our digital services.\_ This page shares the results of this research.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the hack week Europeana staff is allowed to work on any topic of their choice related somehow to the organization for one week, to stimulate creativity and come up with new ideas and ways of working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the carbon footprint project is to calculate the carbon footprint of all Europeana’s online services.The idea behind it is to start with identifying the environmental impact of Europeana as an organization and draw up recommendations on how to improve this. Europeana should not only try to “transform the world with culture”, but also be aware of any potentially negative impact of their actions and strive to mitigate those.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Executive summary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We estimated that the carbon footprint of Europeana’s online services is around 113.700 kg of CO2e per year. This was calculated by estimating average power consumption of dedicated production, non-production and shared servers, multiplying by the amount of servers, and again multiplying by carbon footprint per kWh for the country in which the server is located. In comparison the carbon footprint of all foreign travel of Europeana employees in the last year is around 37.800 CO2e which is only ⅓ of the online services footprint. The travel footprint was calculated by entering all 178 flights, 46 (of the 61 in total) train trips and 1 car trip in an online carbon footprint calculator. We found that airplane travel is responsible for almost 98% of the foreign travel footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why Europeana’s online services carbon footprint is so high is that we recently changed to a new data ingestion system and both new and old systems are running. We expect that the footprint of the online services will decrease with 43% when the servers of the old system are decommissioned. A further reduction could be made by keeping a closer eye on old and unused servers or containers, by urging hosting providers to switch to electricity from renewable energy sources, and by using more virtual servers instead of physical servers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foreign travel footprint can be reduced by taking the train instead of an airplane when travelling to nearby destinations such as London, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BLXUsOJuplH_9qFbAIsMeai7ECwAi9PhoBCIZe_Ivdw/edit?usp=sharing\">Read the research report</a>\_or check out a presentation of the highlights below.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ8xgo4vY6PGRVokkYOMpqNaSce0jfUgGU5hKWMr7erxhzrXwOfuK0wcUVpLeuIfUcuUpNYw89qsVir/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"480\"></iframe></div>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This week will see the final round of negotiations about the EU copyright reform that has been in the making since 2016. During a series of meetings in Strasbourg the negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission will try to find compromises on the last controversial elements of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market directive. Before being put to a final vote of the European Parliament. Failure to do any of these steps will set the efforts to modernise the EU copyright rules back by a number of years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A lot is at stake for cultural heritage institutions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage compromises have been found for most provisions in the proposed directive. The remaining controversies center on the those parts of the directive that are intended to change the balance between the creative sector on the one hand and online intermediaries on the other. Both Article 13 (that would changes the rules for online platforms that provide access to user uploaded content) and Article 11 (that would change the rules for search engines and news aggregators that link to news articles). Over the past few days a number of important stakeholders from the publishing, music and film industries, who had so far been supportive of Article 13, have come out against Article 13() and have called for the entire directive to be scrapped. <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2019/02/08/time-stop-hijacking-copyright-bolster-economic-interests-specific-sectors/\">This has increased the chances that this weeks final negotiations do not result in a compromise and that the EU copyright rules will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this situation there is a lot at stake for Europe's cultural heritage institutions, would directly benefit from the uncontroversial provisions of the directive as it stands. A number of measures that if adopted would enable cultural heritage institutions to better serve the millions of citizens, researchers and educators who make use of their services. These include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Articles 3 and 3a which for the first time reflect the data economy we live in, introducing copyright exceptions for text and data mining which forms the basis of AI.</li>\r\n    <li>Article 5 which allows digital preservation of in-copyright works including the use of digital preservation networks within a member state, but also cross border.</li>\r\n    <li>Article 5a that would ensure that digital reproductions of public domain artworks will remain for the public to use and re-use</li>\r\n    <li>And Articles 7-9 which create mechanisms that would enable cultural heritage institutions to make available online or out of commerce but in copyright works from their collections.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, these articles represent a massive step forward towards a copyright framework that promotes access to culture, research and education and should not be jeopardised by political disagreements over other elements of the proposal. Europe's cultural heritage institutions have been working asking for legal solutions to mass digitisation that will help us to close<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\"> the 20th century black hole </a>for more than a decade. The parts of the proposal that have already been agreed by the co-legislators would go a long way towards achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of what happens to Articles 11 and 13 in Trilogue, policy makers must not ignore the important progress that has been made elsewhere in the Directive to ensure that copyright law in 2019 is fit for purpose and supports access to culture, research and education. In the case that no agreement can be reached on these controversial articles, we urge the Council, Parliament and the European Commission to let the rest of the Directive progress to adoption unhindered.</p>\r\n"

Her observation was that enormous databases that employ standard search do not offer users anything of value. She argued that search based heritage databases do not take into consideration the value of the content itself, the context of said content and its relationship with different collections and thereby diminish the value of heritage collections</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/121761098\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/121761098\">George Oates, EuropeanaTech 2015 Conference</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at an empty search box knowing that tens of millions of items reside behind it is intimidating but also exciting. The potential for discovery is endless yet, where does one start? There’s the rub. If and when the user does decide to dive in to explore but do not start finding what they’re looking for after a few minutes they become frustrated and leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Oates remarked in 2015, “humans like to look, we don’t like to search”. She references personal experiences exploring Paris, a city that enables people to enjoyably browse and discover the city's beauty not strenuously search. As a solution she pondered, “is there a way that you can represent your whole dataset that isn’t just a random sample of rows but is actually designed to give the person who wants to work with your data, a taste of it before they download 7GB of RDF?”. She’s not asking for detailed curation that segments a collection down to its barebones, but a large scale method for presenting large collections in a browseable, engaging and intuitive manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just several years prior in 2013, <a href=\"http://mtchl.net/bio/\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Mitchell Whitelaw </a>at the ICA Congress in Brisbane Australia made the case for a concept he called “generous interfaces”. “Generous interfaces offer rich, browsable views; provide evocative samples of primary content; and support an understanding of context and relationships”. It’s a term and practice that is becoming increasingly popular in the heritage sector and Whitelaw was invited to present his work via videolink at EuropeanaTech 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xDOfOHXkZgqkkOD6RJ1qo5YWpgmAY_4rr2_zXaA39J8/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">His presentation</a> seemed like a response to Oates’s pondering. Diving into the world of generous interfaces, Whitelaw made a clear case and provided numerous examples showcasing how generous interfaces work and their added value for institutes and collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this issue of EuropeanaTech Insight we dedicate three articles to generous interfaces and several institutes putting them into practice. The authors discuss their reasonings as to why they’re using them and the impact they’re having on their users and collections. As heritage databases continue to grow and become more connected through Linked Data and the semantic web it’s imperative that we present heritage material in a way that benefits the users and not subject them to “stingy” interfaces as Whitelaw calls them. We hope this issue of Insight will inspired others to adopt these practices and change the way users discover heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, these are just a few examples of institutes putting generous interfaces into practice. If you or your institute are working on similar projects, please get in touch, we’d love to share your work and your experiences with the rest of the EuropeanaTech community and continue to learn from one another.</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Cultural visualisation and the value of simplicity'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>Visualising cultural data can be really powerful. Data visualisation (using visual representations/mappings of data to show patterns, trends and anomalies) can support analysis of digitised collections for research and administration, support communication and display, and also exploration. Visualisations as exploratory interfaces can show and reveal; their aesthetic power offers a rich browsing experience; they can enhance contextual detail, showing connections across datasets; and can offer multiple views through interactivity. As digitisation levels across the cultural heritage sector continue to grow, visualisation can be a valuable tool to help make sense of increasingly large and interconnected datasets. A growing number of cultural visualisation examples now stretch across a spectrum of designs (<a href=\"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/wp/wp-content/uploads/tvcg2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Windhager et al., 2018</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a powerful, meaningful cultural visualisation does not necessarily have to rely on complex graphics. My colleagues at Royal College of Art, London and I work on timeline visualisation of cultural datasets (<a href=\"https://ewic.bcs.org/upload/pdf/ewic_eva16_museums_paper1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kräutli &amp; Boyd Davis, 2013; Boyd Davis &amp; Kräutli, 2015; Boyd Davis, Vane &amp; Kräutli, 2016</a>) and we have created designs with a number of different institutional collections (see Figures 1-4). Through working closely with curators, historians, and also casual users, the value of simple/minimal design is a point that has come up repeatedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/olivia1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Top Left: <a href=\"https://www.oliviavane.co.uk//research/TextViz1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Visualisation of Medical Officer of Health Reports</a>, Wellcome Library.

Photos credit, Olivia Vane</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The virtue of simplicity has been noted before. <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000136/000136.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fred Gibbs and Trevor Owens argue </a>that insufficient usability is an issue with many digital humanities tools; a simple and clear interface promotes ease-of-use and transparency. Complexity, in contrast, can increase skepticism. I have encountered similar sentiments in evaluations of my own designs for digital tools. A historian commented to me, while discussing a prototype in development: “I really like the simplicity of your visualisation actually. You haven’t tried to be flashy and sparkly; it’s just ‘this is the information’”. Creating an unobtrusive representation that still assists users sounds like a good thing, but apparently simple designs can conceal tricky intellectual and technical questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Challenges creating simple visualisations </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Timeline visualisation, for instance, is often assumed to be easy and straightforward but, in practice, issues can quickly surface. It is common for date information in digitised collections to be imprecise and/or uncertain (<a href=\"https://ewic.bcs.org/upload/pdf/ewic_ev13_s4paper1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Kräutli &amp; Boyd Davis, 2013</a>). Items can have dates like ‘created before 1870s’ or ‘late 19th–early 20th century’. How do you plot such an item, and possibly many other items with similarly uncertain dates, on a timeline in such a way that is legible and useful, but also does not mislead?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Items can also have multiple dates attached to them. Even if just considering a ‘production’ date (rather than period of use, date of acquisition etc.) the situation is complicated; I have encountered records for objects that are replicas of an earlier original, and photographs with different dates for when the photograph was taken and when the print made. Records for historical buildings can have tens of dates attached for renovations, amendments and rebuilding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategies to deal with these kinds of issues when creating a visualisation will depend on the make-up of the specific dataset and your visualisation design goals. Making prototypes with real data in dialogue with stakeholders/collection experts can progress the design process by both, helping to expose issues and as a way to explore ideas and possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a visualisation project with the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City for example, I was working with collection data where many of the older objects had date information with wide time spans. I developed a strategy for mapping the images in an irregular collage-like way (which I have written more about <a href=\"https://labs.cooperhewitt.org/2017/exploring-the-cooper-hewitt-collection-with-timelines-and-tags-guest-post-by-olivia-vane/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). The result (see Figure 5) has a minimal aesthetic, and encourages users to make visual connections and observe trends over time rather than count frequencies or read off precise dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/olivia5.png\" />\r\n<p>Figure 2: Olivia Vane. 2017. Prototype visualising items tagged ‘coffee and tea drinking’ in the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum collection horizontally by date. The visualisation shows designs in the collection stretching from 1700 to the present with a great diversity of forms and styles, elaborate and minimal.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>In a different project<a href=\"https://www.oliviavane.co.uk//research/Faces_of_Sweden.html\" target=\"_blank\"> visualising historical portraits in Swedish Open Cultural Heritage data</a>, similarly many of the dataset items had wide time spans. I was interested in supporting comparison of portraits from different times, while keeping the images large enough to make out. Through trialling various ideas by prototyping, I set on a different approach using sampling (see <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Faces-of-Sweden\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for more detail). This approach visualises example images from a period, and images from different periods can be viewed simultaneously on dual timelines (see Figure 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"403\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/310118598\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/310118598\">Faces of Sweden</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user28752326\">Olivia Vane</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kind of questions that arise when creating cultural visualisations, even with simple graphics, can be very subtle, for example inclusion/exclusion of data. In the same project, the interface design proved productive for exploring changing historical costume through time. The clothes worn by the person depicted in a portrait, though, are not always from the time the picture was produced. For example, this dataset included a number of 19th-century prints depicting earlier historical figures (see Figure 7). Should these be included or excluded? Working closely with collection experts can help navigate these sorts of questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/olivia7.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: Lithographs in the Nordic Museum collection, 1850-60, depicting earlier historical figures. (Example record <a href=\"https://digitaltmuseum.se/011023774681/litografi\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>)</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Simplicity in design can also be an issue for collaboration. <a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~stjaenicke/balancing.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stefan Jänicke</a> has described a balancing act in collaborative research projects:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center>“When an approach is too complex – which counts as a strong argument for a publication in a visualization realm – it might get ... [non-useful] for humanities scholars due to problems of comprehension. On the other hand, if a clean, easily comprehensible visualization is valuable for a humanities scholar, the missing novelty most likely impedes a computer science publication.” (p.1)</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have experienced this first-hand. Submitting a visualisation technique for historical data to a computer-science-domain visualisation conference, one reviewer commented: “the technique is simple and elegant, but that also raises questions as to the significance of the contribution and whether it is even a ‘visualization’ at all”. This issue points to the value of individuals who cross disciplinary boundaries, but also to new difficulties they may encounter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Conclusion </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simple visuals in cultural visualisation are valuable for ease-of-use, comprehension and transparency/trust in tools. In practice, though, their design can involve practical and intellectual challenges. Prototyping, while working closely with stakeholders and end-users, is a productive way to foreground the issues and questions in a project and, so, develop productive designs.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: 'Mari Wigham, The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision'
                anchortitle: 'Escaping the Lobby'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>Thanks to the push to digitise archives and make them searchable online, millions of archive items that previously languished on a shelf have become easily accessible. However, access via search has its limitations. In his discussion of <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000205/000205.html\" target=\"_blank\">Generous Interfaces for Digital Cultural Collections, Mitchell Whitelaw </a>drew a striking analogy:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><em>“Imagine yourself outside an art gallery in a far-off city, with a collection you don’t know well. You enter the building to find a small, drab lobby with an attendant at a desk. The attendant asks you to enter your query on a small slip of paper. Not knowing the collection, and not seeking anything in particular, you write down something arbitrary, and pass it over. The attendant disappears for a moment before returning with a line of artworks sitting on trolleys. These are paraded, ten at a time, through the lobby. You can submit another query at any time, calling forth more trolleys, but there seems to be no way to explore the gallery beyond this small lobby.”</em></center>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not only visitors who are new to the collection who find themselves stuck, frustrated, in the drab lobby. Think of the archive manager preparing a pitch to their funders, who needs numbers on how many books and newspapers their archive contains and how the amount of content has grown over the past five years. Or perhaps a project manager estimating the cost to digitise their old video content. Or a scholar analysing the shift in language use in debates on migration. The information they need to properly answer the question is contained in the archive, but obtaining this information via search is typically a long, labour-intensive process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the root of this problem is the same as that described by Whitelaw, namely that search is too limiting, the solution is quite different. Whereas a generous interface for a visitor focuses on presenting the archive items in an innovative, explorative manner, a generous interface for answering these sorts of questions about the archive requires deeper access to the underlying (meta)data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the<a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl\" target=\"_blank\"> Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, as part of the <a href=\"https://clariah.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">CLARIAH</a> project, we have been working on a new type of data access that provides insights into an archive by enabling flexible aggregations of the metadata. We identified three types of tasks that are not sufficiently supported by existing interfaces - overview, investigation and analysis. In our example, the archive manager wants an overview - general statistics about the archive. The project manager needs to do investigation - she needs statistics for a specific section of the archive, to find out how many hours of material on video carriers have not yet been digitised. Finally, the scholar wants to conduct an analysis - for a particular section of the archive, he wants to detect patterns in the metadata, in this case the change in words used to describe migrants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these tasks boils down to the same essence; a combination of a query with an aggregation of the value of a given metadata field. The query selects the section of the archive that is of interest while the aggregation calculates the desired data. For the example of the project leader, she will search for all items on a video carrier that do not have a corresponding digital carrier and will calculate the sum of the duration of each carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, this type of generous access to the data was limited to expert programmers working for the archive in question. They could pull whatever information they needed from the database. Our approach helps users of all skill levels obtain exactly the data they need, and processing it to get the answers they want. For example by plotting a graph, creating a word cloud or performing further analysis of the data. We use <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, open-source software that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, visualisations and text. Jupyter Notebooks provide access to a wide range of available functions created by diverse programming communities, such as <a href=\"https://plot.ly/\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly</a> and <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MatPlotLib</a> to plot graphs and <a href=\"https://www.nltk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NLTK</a> for language processing. Users with advanced programming skills can also write their own functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have created pre-prepared notebooks that only need to be run to produce a standard set of statistics and visualisations for the Sound and Vision archive. Users can specify their own queries and aggregations by simply changing values in the functions. Metadata can also be retrieved and analysed using third party functions, such as language processing to detect frequently used words. For people who are not at all comfortable with editing values in code or have no time to familiarise themselves with the code layout, we have used <a href=\"https://dash.plot.ly/\" target=\"_blank\">Dash</a> to create a simple user interface, allowing them to specify their query and aggregation based on simple dropdowns and other controls, giving them freedom and flexibility without requiring technical know-how.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/mari1.png\" />\r\n<p>Figure 1</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently investigating whether such an interface could be offered as part of our <a href=\"http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Media Suite</a> portal for researchers. In this way, the same underlying infrastructure is used to support users with a whole range of technical skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/mari2.png\" />\r\n<p>Figure 2: Top Left: Example of a Jupyter Notebook. Top Right: Distribution of items over genres in the Sound and Vision archive. Bottom Left: Availability of speech recognition transcripts (ASR) in the Sound and Vision archive. Bottom Right: Results of matching YouTube clips taken from a current affairs programme (coloured sections) to all editions of that programme (grey lines) in a given month</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>If such access can be provided using generic approaches and existing software, why is an archive involved in developing this technology? The answer is that archival knowledge is as essential throughout this process as programming knowledge. Selecting the right metadata fields requires knowledge of the meaning of those fields, of how they are filled by the archive, and how that has changed over time. For example, Sound and Vision mostly registers genre information at the level of a television or radio series, not for individual programmes. Defining which part of the archive you need to query can also sometimes require archive knowledge; for example, to correctly estimate the progress of digitisation at Sound and Vision, you would need to exclude the part of the collection that contains physical objects that cannot be digitised. Finally, correct interpretation of the results relies heavily on archival knowledge. A naive observer of the graph of items in the Sound and Vision archive over time would conclude that media production in the Netherlands has exploded in recent decades, whereas the reality is that direct access to the digital output of the broadcasters has made it possible to archive far more of the produced material than previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/mari6.PNG\" />\r\n<p>Figure 3</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Archival experts and programmers worked together to embed this archival knowledge in all the components of our data access. From ensuring that the basic functions included information on metadata completeness, to selecting the correct fields for the pre-prepared visualisations, to creating a metadata dictionary to assist users, and, finally, adding contextual descriptions to the notebooks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data access via Jupyter notebooks has already been used for answering internal Sound and Vision questions, to provide<a href=\"http://mediasuitedata.clariah.nl/\" target=\"_blank\"> overviews of the collections</a> available in the Media Suite and to support Clariah scholars in their research projects, for example, in matching YouTube clips to the television programmes they were taken from. The next challenge is to discover how we can enable wider use of this data access, by sharing notebooks on a Jupyter Hub, and integrating it into the Media Suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further details, see a selection of visualisations available on the <a href=\"https://archiefstats.beeldengeluid.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Sound and Vision data website</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dcicblog.umd.edu/cas/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2018/12/13.Wigham.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> we presented at the Computational Archival Science workshop. This approach is applicable to any archive whose database technology is capable of specifying aggregations and queries, and who is in the position to create an API to make these available to users. It allows archive users to escape from the lobby, and discover the answers they are looking for in the wealth of metadata in the archive.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: 'David Haskiya, Riksantikvarieämbetet'
                anchortitle: 'An Evaluation of Generous Interfaces'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><bold><strong>What are they and why an evaluation? </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term generous interfaces was coined <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/9/1/000205/000205.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2015</a>. It denotes a design philosophy for digital heritage collections that emphasises the following principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Show first, don’t ask (provide rich overviews without search)</li>\r\n    <li>Provide samples and clues (using collection content)</li>\r\n    <li>Show relationships (between collection features)</li>\r\n    <li>Provide rich primary content (deliver on the promise)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In this, it contrasts with more conventional search-oriented interfaces. While a small number of institutionally developed and maintained generous interfaces exist the majority are demonstrators or prototypes only. So, why hasn’t there been greater adoption? This was basically the question behind the evaluation. Some other questions we wanted to try to answer were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Do their target users actually like them?</li>\r\n    <li>Are they difficult to design, build and maintain?</li>\r\n    <li>What do they require in terms of skills, time, money, and data? If they are well-liked by users, how can we accelerate their adoption by GLAMs?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>How?</strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We followed the Design Think approach and more specifically based our method on the Google Design Sprint. The approach and method emphasises quick full iterations (see figure x below) performed by a cross-disciplinary team. In our case we need to adapt and simplify the designs sprint so that it could be carried out in 3 rather than 5 days. To compensate, we did a lot of user testing in between sprints (and of course a lot of software development).</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p>“I hear and I forget,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see and I learn,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do and I remember.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xunzi</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/david1.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/\">Design Thinking 101 - Norman Nielsen Group</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went through four such design sprints to create our colours and tags-based exploration interface. A fifth sprint was dedicated towards a retrospective (looking back on what we learned as a team) and a futurespective (what we thought could be interesting ways to follow-up our work).</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/david2.png\" />\r\n<p>Figure 2: One of dozens of early sketches from the first design sprint</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>What?</strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to learn from others, we performed user tests and heuristic evaluations of three collections exploration interfaces developed by others. The three were Art Palette, Barnes Collections, and COINS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We developed/had developed four generous interfaces prototypes and performed user tests and heuristic evaluations of them. Two were based on existing frameworks, the <a href=\"https://vikusviewer.fh-potsdam.de/\" target=\"_blank\">VIKUS Viewer</a> and the <a href=\"https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/ddb/\" target=\"_blank\">German Digital Library Visualized </a>and two were developed from scratch. The prototypes we developed are (in order of development):</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>An <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion\" target=\"_blank\">unnamed exploration application</a> based on colours and tags and featuring content related to costume, accessories, and textiles</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Kringla-Visualized\" target=\"_blank\">Kringla Visualized</a>, a visualization of the content in Swedish Open Cultural Heritage</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Faces-of-Sweden\" target=\"_blank\">Faces of Sweden</a>, a timeline based exploration and comparison experience</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/VIKUS-Viewer-Nationalmuseum\" target=\"_blank\">VIKUS Nationalmuseum</a>, an interactive timeline of paintings At the time of writing two of these (1 and 4) have been through both user testing and heuristic review.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The source code for all four is open and available on GitHub.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/david3.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: What you find when you browse for dancers, based on what Google Vision sees as dancers, in the unnamed colours- and tags prototype.</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/david4.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figured 4: We found that designing for juxtaposition, here Swedish 1940-50s fashion photography and Japanese prints featuring flowering trees, is a good way to enable serendipitous discoveries</center>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/GI/david5.png\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5: In the Faces of Sweden timeline-centric exploration interface the user can juxtapose and compare the paintings from different time-slices and visually identify differences in painting style and dress.</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Main Findings</strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were we able to answer the questions that we set out to answer? We think so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Do their intended users actually like them? </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of our user tests confirm that users matching the behaviour of the inspiration seeking digital flaneur do indeed enjoy generous interfaces, find them inspirational and conducive to serendipitous discoveries. It should be noted though that with the flaneur the generous interfaces come with a steeper learning curve compared to search-oriented interfaces. The reason simply being that they tend to be more unconventional. A contributing factor to the steeper learning curve is also that many generous interfaces are prototype in nature and often have a number of usability issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Are they difficult to design, build and maintain? What do they require in terms of skills, time, money, and data?</strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already have a delivery mechanism for your digital collection (API or data dumps) then building a generous online collections experience is most certainly feasible to do in 6-12 months of iterative development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest challenge is not technical but to systematically learn your intended users needs and match them with whole or curated parts of your collection. You will need a cross-disciplinary team that, besides software/web developers, includes UX design and collections specialists and has the trust of an internal sponsor/champion who knows not to micro-manage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will likely also find that you will need to complement or wrangle your existing metadata e.g. add more folksonomic style tags, extract colours, or normalise dates. The typical metadata created during cataloguing, aiming primarily to make internal collections more efficient, is often not wellsuited to support the curiosity-driven exploration of the flaneur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Why hasn’t there been greater adoption? </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s no “one size fits all”-way to design a generous interface - at the heart of the very concept is that they should be intimately connected to the very nature of the collection they’re exploring. This means that creating generous interfaces is more bespoke than search. . Bespoke development requires money, or an in-house design and development team and that is something that most cultural organisations don’t have. Or rather, they prioritise elsewhere and frequently decide to live with the search interface for their collections that comes with the off-the-shelf collection management system they have purchased</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, a generous interface is to many cultural organisations, perhaps most, a luxury they feel they cannot afford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>How can we speed up their adoption by GLAMs? </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The existing open source generous interface libraries and frameworks allow for rapid prototyping but require significant work to become fully production ready. In particular they lack support for mobile devices and have other usability issues. Even so, they can lower costs and speed up adoption. Conceivably, generous interface component widgets could also be offered as software services that once configured can be embedded on any website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to speed up adoption is to convince vendors to bundle configurable and skinnable generous interfaces as part of their collection management systems. Or at least add generous interface style aspects to their search-oriented interfaces. The latter is also increasingly common, many search-oriented collection interfaces today offer complementary browse-oriented entrance points to the collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Spin-off findings</strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When developing our “colours and tags”-prototype we included collections data from multiple museums. These museums used different keywords for their tags making it difficult to base the exploration on them. Also, the keywords were institutional in style and not as folksonomic as we predicted our selected users to prefer. So we decided, since we were already using Google Vision to extract colours, to also use it to create tags across the collections images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This taught us that for non-specialist audiences computer vision created tags is a viable option to increase discoverability. The very imprecision of some of the tags created actually helped support serendipitous discoveries: “That’s actually not an embroidery but I really like it!”. There’s great potential in this that could and should be explored for its own sake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><bold><strong>Who/acknowledgments </strong></bold></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation was carried out by the Swedish National Heritage Board, Nordiska museet, Nationalmuseum, Malmö museer, and the Swedish Museums of World Cultures with Martin Törnros/Interaktiva rum as supporting freelancer. Olivia Vane and Delorean were contracted to develop one generous interface each.</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Collaboration and Annotation: Pelagios, Recogito and Multispectral Imaging of Cultural Heritage Objects'
                templates: body
                body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.lazarusprojectimaging.com/.\" target=\"_blank\">The Lazarus Project</a> is a multispectral imaging collaboration, now based out of the University of Rochester. We employ state-of-the-art imaging technology to digitally recover faded, burned or otherwise damaged documents. Our multispectral camera system, designed by Ken Boydston at Megavision, consists of a 50 megapixel monochrome sensor, an apochromatic quartz lens, a dual filter wheel that separates fluorescent from reflected light, a multispectral transmissive light source that shines through the parchment, and a series of 16 highly specialized low-heat LED lights.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/D1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: Electromagnetic spectrum. Diagram obtained from Dr. Roger Easton with gratitude</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The manuscript or cultural heritage object under consideration is photographed under discrete wavelengths of light. Each of these wavelengths has the potential to reveal different aspects of the object: the longer infrared wavelengths penetrate most deeply into the substrate, revealing ink and pigments in areas that have been darkened, overwritten, or charred, while the shorter ultraviolet bands induce fluorescence that may render faint or faded text legible once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/D2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: Multispectral imaging system. Diagram obtained from Dr. Roger Easton with gratitude</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The captured images are then digitally ‘stacked’ and subjected to statistical processing using software that is primarily used for analyzing aerial and satellite imagery. This workflow enables the recovery of text and images which may be fully invisible due to damage, deliberate erasure, or simple age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the large-scale interdisciplinary nature of many imaging projects poses unique challenges. Firstly, when we create an image of an object, we often collaborate with imaging scientists, image processors, and scholars around the world. Those processing the images need to effectively share their results, while the scholars tasked with deciphering the recovered texts must be able to communicate (for example) which portions of the object have been rendered legible and which are in need of further processing. We therefore require a single platform that enables individuals at multiple institutions to see and work on an image. Workarounds such as emailing individual images back and forth or sharing them via services like Google Drive or Dropbox have proven cumbersome and inefficient for the needs of our projects—a truly collaborative environment requires shared access. Secondly, as they begin to translate, transcribe, and generally study the recovered digital object, how might they annotate it? Due to the nature of our work, the text of many of the objects we recover have never before been transcribed. Many, too, have unusual shapes or layouts—e.g., maps, globes, cave paintings—which do not lend themselves well to typical word processors or to other annotation software. We are thus in need of a way to make notes directly on the recovered digital objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pelagios, and particularly their <a href=\"http://, https://recogito.pelagios.org\" target=\"_blank\">Recogito site</a>, solves both of these problems for Lazarus. There, images can be can be hosted, shared, and annotated: scholars can identify areas of the object which may need further processing, image processors can share techniques and strategies that have proven useful (or not), and transcriptions can be made directly on the images themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Recogito’s privacy control settings are invaluable for collaborative recovery projects. Many of these involve proprietary or sensitive objects, and are sometimes carried out under non-disclosure agreements. Pelagios allows users to upload an image which can then be viewed either solely by the uploader or by a select group of other users who have been granted access. This enables the creation of separate working groups within larger projects, wherein each user has access only to those images which pertain directly to his or her work. The utility and interactivity of Pelagios created an ideal platform for our multispectral imaging team to use when collaborating with scholars, museums and imaging scientists around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noted above scholars’ need to transcribe, translate and annotate the newly-recovered project, and the particular difficulties posed by objects with unconventional shapes or layouts. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, the Lazarus Project travelled to the Biblioteca Capitolare in Vercelli, Italy to image (among other items) the <a href=\"http://www.lazarusprojectimaging.com/previous-projects/vercelli-book-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Vercelli Mappa Mundi</a>. Helen Davies, a Lazarus Project graduate student and co-author of the present article, has since processed these images and recovered nearly the entire thirteenth-century mappa mundi. Transcription of this object had been attempted only once before, by Carlo Capello in 1975 [1]. By that date, however, the map had already suffered significant damage, leaving a void in the transcriptions waiting to be filled by multispectral imaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/D3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: A section of The Vercelli Map (Archivio Capitolare di Vercelli Rotoli figurati, 6 [Mappamondo]) as it appears under natural light before multispectral imaging</center>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/D4.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 4: A section of The Vercelli Map after multispectral imaging</center>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of her PhD dissertation, Davies must now transcribe and translate all of the recovered inscriptions on the map. The aim will be to compare each of her transcriptions to Capello’s. In the form of Recogito, Pelagios offers a tool with which to tie all of this information together and connect it directly to the object in question. The annotation capabilities of the platform allow Davies to transcribe a portion of the map and then fill in a note below which may include, e.g., Capello’s transcription, translations of the Latin text, and other relevant notes. Additionally, Recogito’s map functions allow the user to geolocate a historic place on the medieval map with the contemporary place on a digital, satellite map. Given the unusual geographic orientation of medieval maps, the author looks forward to viewing the final comparison between historic and contemporary understandings of place and spatial orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/D5.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5: Screenshot of the author translating a section of text on the Vercelli Map using the Recogito platform</center>\r\n\r\n<p>As the above examples illuminate, Pelagios provides a platform which solves several central issues of both collaboration and annotation which digital humanists face when working with recovered images and digital surrogates of medieval manuscripts and other objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] Carlo F.

                title: 'What are urban gazetteers and why do we need them?'
                subtitle: 'Valeria Vitale; Institute of Classical Studies, University of London; Susanna de Beer, University of Leiden'
                anchortitle: 'What are urban gazetteers and why do we need them?'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>Gazetteers are becoming a prominent tool in the digital humanities. Providing stable identifiers (URIs) for places, they enable aggregation of data coming from different digital resources (such as archives and libraries). But they are also a research tool of their own, since they help us to define and analyse our geographical knowledge of both present and past, to uncover and take into account biases, and to interrogate ourselves on the nature of what we call “a place”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minting, and making available online, unique identifiers for places, gazetteers play a crucial role in the Linked Open Data panorama, by virtue of allowing disambiguation and facilitating analysis of spatial information. Therefore, it’s not surprising that the number of gazetteers, specific to a particular area or period of time grows daily. Gazetteers enable more effective annotation of digital documents, cataloguing of digital resources, and overall analysis of historical geographies. There is <a href=\"https://pleiades.stoa.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a gazetteer for the ancient world</a>, <a href=\"https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/\" target=\"_blank\">one for historical China</a>, <a href=\"https://althurayya.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">one for medieval Islam</a>, one just focusing <a href=\"http://www.cyprusgazetteer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">on the island of Cyprus</a>, and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more scholars and GLAM specialists have used gazetteers, however, the more they have realised that they are often not granular enough for what they want to do. To the ears of a museum professional or archaeologist, hearing that an artefact was found “in Rome” is of use only in the most generic sense. Even smaller places, such as Pompeii or Venice, which have received a lot of academic attention, would benefit greatly from more precise place references within them. In other words, the community which has developed around gazetteers has realised that URIs are needed not only for the city but also for units within it, such as buildings, monuments, squares and other spaces. What is needed is, in our words, an urban gazetteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban gazetteers would be useful for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Consolidating names: historical buildings have been named in different ways, depending on the time period or the groups of users. A gazetteer will be able to associate the variant names to the same entity, helping researchers identify more obscure references. Think, for example, of the many names the buildings in Pompeii have collected through years of excavations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/Beer1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>[Figure 1: The so-called Temple of Apollo in Pompeii. The place has collected a long list of names since its uncovering, including: Temple of Mercury and Maya, Temple of Ceres and Venus, Temple of Bacchus, and House of the Dwarves.

Using intra-city references, scholars and GLAM professionals are able to establish and discover more informative relationships, and highlight the high degree of closeness between, for example, all the inscriptions that have been found in a particular theatre or all the paintings that used to be in the same private collection.</li>\r\n    <li>Preserving the geometry of disappeared buildings: gazetteers can easily store geometries (i.e. the perimeter of a palace or temple) as locations. This information can be used, for example, to analyse and compare the evolution of a particular building or to preserve historical information about buildings that do not exist anymore in their materiality but have been documented. Some of the archaeological remains in the ancient city of Berenike in Libya (in the vicinity of modern Benghazi) are today hardly visible anymore, but the information about their shape and location has been <a href=\"https://www.slsgazetteer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">preserved in the Heritage Gazetteer </a>of Libya.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/beer3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: Perimeter of Roman buildings in the Libyan city of Benghazi, now barely visible, traced on Open Street Map according to archaeological sources.</center>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Facilitating the aggregation of digital resources created in different disciplinary fields: there are a number of digital projects that have been exploring particular aspects of historical cities like Rome or Istanbul, but they seldom communicate with each other. Each digital project remains an isolated data silo, losing the opportunity for a truly enriching dialogue between resources, especially when produced by different areas of study or practice. The availability of specific URIs for building and urban spaces will encourage academics and cultural heritage specialists to move towards a Linked Open Data approach and promote reuse of existing data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides their practical application and their usefulness in bringing together digital resources, urban gazetteers also open up the debate to stimulating questions about the nature of buildings and other urban locations as “places”. Such interesting discussions, however, often present challenges in digital projects and, in particular, in the way we model the data. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How do we represent the different strata of a building in and over different time periods?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/beer4.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 4: Church of San Lorenzo in Miranda, Rome, quite explicitly incorporates a more ancient building, the Roman temple of Antonino and Faustina. Photo by J. Benoist, published on Wikipedia.</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How do we represent locations whose coordinates are either unknown (i.e. places that we knew existed in the past but we are unable to pinpoint on a map) or non-existent (i.e. places that are mentioned in fictional accounts), but which are, nonetheless, part of the history and perception of the city?</li>\r\n    <li>How do we deal with buildings made with recycled materials, like churches built with the spolia of temples?</li>\r\n    <li>How do we deal with places that have changed location?</li>\r\n    <li>What role does the function of a building play in its identity?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>None of these questions have an easy answer and this may be one of the reasons why, in spite of the growing interest around them, there seems to be little to no examples of actual urban gazetteers (with the notable exception of <a href=\"https://mapoflondon.uvic.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">MoEML</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/beer5.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 5: Detail of the Agas map of London, one of the main sources of the MoEML gazetteer of Early Modern London.</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with a little helpful push from Pelagios (in the form of a small grant), we decided to form a working group of interested people to start tackling this topic. Our goal in creating this community, composed of a mixed group of developers and users of gazetteers, was to make this a collaborative effort from the beginning in order to establish some common working guidelines for anyone working in this field. In addition, we have attempted to strike a balance between those who would like the gazetteers to be as lightweight as possible–basically providing nothing more than a URI to enable connections between external resources–and others who tend to regard gazetteers as the fully-fledged outcome of research–where each entry includes information about the history and evolution of the place, and tries to capture urban places’ fluid identities. In other words, we realised that an urban gazetteer has to harmonise two different elements; to identify and define places within a city and to provide URIs that other digital resources can use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not think that a small group of people should come up with definitive answers and prescriptive guidelines, so we tried instead to involve as many people as possible in the debate in order to identify recurring questions and to gather possible answers. To keep track of our discussion, we started compiling a sort of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_8ybnSZiud6zPb2oCfXiNPqpa0gjK4jm5E1DuJxPMFw/edit\" target=\"_blank\">checklist</a> of things to consider when starting to develop an urban gazetteer. Our checklist involves asking what is the purpose of your endeavour and who are your ideal users. These very fundamental questions that may change the way you design your gazetteer and its features—location(s), attributes, and chronological indicators, for instance. Another key preliminary question is what to include in the gazetteer. The issue is not trivial, as there are almost no precedents to refer to and the level of granularity required can be very different from one project to another. Cities are complex, as complex as miniature worlds and trying to model them systematically and diachronically can feel like a never-ending task. Starting from a subset of the city, either as an area, a time period or a thematic group, could be a more reasonable approach as long as the authors declare their biases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As happens with other gazetteers, it is very likely that different projects will look at different aspects of the same city. For this reason, it is important that we seek to remain as interoperable as possible. Before starting a new gazetteer, we believe it is best practice to survey what has already been done and when possible, try to build on top of it. For instance, for the major changes in the “lifetime” of a building you may decide to model them as “stages” of the same building or to give each an individual URI and then use relationships to link them all. You can decide that the changes in use also deserve to be recorded or you can focus solely on structural modifications. As for all data models, the key is in finding a balance between richness of information and usability. In this phase we are still building an interested community that wants to share their experience and help us create a catalogue of examples and possible approaches. Our next step is to come up with a simple format, bearing in mind the work currently carried out by the <a href=\"http://whgazetteer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">World Historical Gazetteer</a> and aiming at full compatibility with their more general model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there is still a lot of work to do! If you want to make references to buildings in the text you are encoding, if you want to enhance the granularity of the metadata in your digital archive, or if you are just passionate about urban history and the multiple lives of buildings, feel free to go through our document and add your comments and questions. If you have seen a great urban gazetteer let us know how it tackled some of the most recurring issues. Join us in the venture of designing urban gazetteers as useful tools to help establish, represent and query relationships between pieces of cultural heritage, but also as a means to research, model, preserve and compare our knowledge about historical buildings and other urban elements.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'Using Recogito in the (Ottoman history) classroom'
                subtitle: 'Antonis Hadjikyriacou; Boğaziçi University'
                anchortitle: 'Using Recogito in the (Ottoman history) classroom'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>This piece discusses the implications of using Recogito as an educational and research tool for history students, with particular reference to the field of Ottoman studies. Having encountered and used Recogito in the context of my own research, I decided to employ it in my teaching. The first experimental application of Recogito was in the context of the postgraduate ‘Spatial history’ seminar during the spring semester of 2018 at the Department of History at Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey. The seminar addressed a combination of methodological and conceptual issues in thinking about and integrating the role of space in historical analysis and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course introduced Recogito to the students, and part of the assignment was to use the tool in order to map spatial relationships in different kinds of Ottoman historical texts. Students selected a particular Ottoman text that was rich in toponymic data, the visualisation of which through Recogito would reveal patterns and spatial relationships that would otherwise be impossible to discern. The sources used for these student projects included: Ottoman travelogues and contemporary histories; records of the assets of the pious endowments (vakıfs) belonging to the founder of a powerful family of Ottoman statesmen (Köprülü Mehmet pasha); and readers’ letters to Kadınlar Dünaysı (Womens’ world), one of the first Ottoman women’s magazines. In each of these cases, student projects examined the economic, social, political, cultural, or intellectual aspects of their primary sources in relation to space, and what the spatial distribution of different issues revealed with reference to their topic. A major challenge the students encountered was the limited degree of representation of Ottoman toponyms within Recogito’s existing gazetteers. In order deal with this problem, I had submitted a Pelagios Commons Resource Development Grant application, proposing the use of Recogito to test its usability in extracting toponyms from Ottoman historical sources as a stepping stone towards an Ottoman Gazetteer. The project would select a toponym-rich Ottoman text, identify the toponyms which are already part of the gazetteers Recogito uses (Pleiades, part of GeoNames, Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire, etc.), and then compile a list of the missing toponyms for which coordinates and other gazetteer data will be added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source we selected was from the so-called ‘Registers of Important Affairs’ (mühimme defterleri). The particular kind of source provides summaries of imperial orders dispatched from Istanbul to the provinces and contain a wealth of toponymic data, covering the whole empire. Within a vast selection of register volumes, we decided to use register number 12, covering the years between 1570-72. The register was published in transcription and facsimile over three volumes by the Ottoman Archives, and available to download in PDF format. Our choice was made according to the following criteria: that this was a period of rapid and important change at the geopolitical level, with wars on different fronts and imperial orders dispatched to meet those challenges. Furthermore, it was during this period that the limits of the empire’s expansion were set and its borders consolidated. Such a source therefore allows us to identify the locations with which the imperial centre was corresponding at a critical juncture in its history. Thus, as both a quantitative (i.e., the number of toponyms contained) and qualitative dataset, the particular source represents an ideal pilot study for shedding light on the internal and external networks that Istanbul had with other places. The register contains more than 900 pages and 1,283 orders. With the initial upload of the text to Recogito, the index was removed in order to avoid duplicates. Each of the team members was allocated a section of the transcribed text with the task of annotating and georeferencing each place name that they encountered.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/had1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: The Recogito map of the identified toponyms in the Important Affairs Register No. 12</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this project was under way, I was asked by my department to teach a six-week-long second-year undergraduate historical methods course. The new course I designed was called “Research methods in history: an introduction to digital humanities and spatial history”, and its purpose was to familiarise students with the tools and concepts of spatial history. Following some introductory classes on digital humanities, spatial history, and gazetteers, the course took the form of a hands-on collective annotation session using different texts each week. Three texts were selected for this purpose: Jules Vernes’ Around the World in Eighty Days; Ibn Khaldun’s Mukaddema; and one volume of the Ottoman Important Affairs Registers. During these sessions students learned how to: choose between different gazetteers when annotating a toponym; correctly identify a toponym that appears in different parts of the word according to context of the source; consider time as a factor in annotating and identifying a toponym; and deal with the linguistic and transcription challenges of such a source. Most importantly, students learned how to manually search for an Ottoman toponym through internet and bibliographical sources, and identifying it with their present-day variants. Particularly so in the context of the troubled history of the post-Ottoman lands whereby toponyms are ethnically and linguistically cleansed, this was a lesson not only in gazetteer-compiling or spatial history methods, but also the problems and challenges in verifying or improving the reliability of historical data.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/had2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: Map of castles and fortresses mentioned in the Important Affairs Register No. 12</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The course was taught twice to two different groups of students, and the results were particularly encouraging. Students were excited and intrigued by the prospect of incorporating technological tools in the classroom, and many of them quickly realised that the tasks involved were much more complicated and challenging than they originally expected. Student feedback emphasised how learning to use Recogito allowed them to better the implications of space in historical analysis, as well as the precision and accuracy required in building a foundational resource such as a gazetteer. Overall, students learned that there is not always a right or wrong answer, but one that depends on particular parameters, contexts, and choices one has to make, and being conscious and explicit about them is the basis of any data compilation exercise.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Roman Empire Vector Map gives people a chance to explore the ancient Mediterranean world as it was during the Roman Empire. They can see much of the road network, discover original place names, and much more   with the comfort similar to Google Maps. (For the prototype, see <a href=\"https://labs.maptiler.com/roman-empire/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) A collaborative project of Klokan Technologies and Lund University, supported by a small Pelagios grant, the Roman Empire Vector Map is based on historical data collected by the Pelagios community and the <a href=\"https://dare.ht.lu.se\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire </a>(DARE) project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project uses the vector tile technology developed for modern maps visible at https://maptiler.com/maps and applies it to historical geospatial data. Klokan Technologies, which has open-sourced the technology on GitHub, has been working with cultural heritage institutions for years in the effort to build open and easy-to-use mapping resources such as: <a href=\"https://oldmapsonline.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OldMapsOnline</a>, a gateway into historical map collections around the world; <a href=\"http://https://iiifhosting.com/,\" target=\"_blank\">IIIF Hosting</a> which enables lightning fast hosting of large images; and <a href=\"https://georeferencer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Georeferencer</a>, a crowdsourcing online tool which turns scanned paper maps into map overlays.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/Klokan1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Fig 1: <a href=\"https://labs.maptiler.com/roman-empire/\" target=\"_blank\">The Roman Empire Vector Map</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Vector tiles for historical data </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main advantage of vector tiles over traditional maps is the ability to personalize and adjust the appearance of the map. Vector maps can quickly change the whole design, highlight selected features, switch the displayed language of the labels, and give each user a more appealing look and feel when moving around the map, based on the context in which the map appears, or the personal profile and preferences of the user (such as places of personal interest, preferred language, etc.). A minimal amount of vector data is transferred to the client (usually a web browser or a mobile app) to enable such changes to be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essential advantage of vector tiles for historical data is the ability to display or remove selected features on the map depending on the chosen time period. Essentially, vector tiles allow the display of changes in time without the need to reload the data or an entire website. As a result, it scales well for big data —with billions of features — and can work with detailed maps covering massive areas (including the whole Earth).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vector tiles are a natural evolution from the traditional raster maps, where the map tiles divide the geographic regions to small tiles. More technical information about map tiles can be found <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the prototype map for the Roman Empire was to create and test a digital model which was both open-source and flexible enough for reuse by researchers, teachers or general enthusiasts wishing to display historical data.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/Klokan2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: The same technology used by the <a href=\"https://timemachineatlas.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">TimeMachine.eu project</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Generating vector tiles from GIS&nbsp;data </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historical geospatial data are usually edited using desktop GIS software or web tools. In the Roman Empire Vector Map project, all the source data have an open license. All vector layers have been converted to the GeoJSON format of the WGS84 coordinate system. They can be explored <a href=\"https://github.com/maptiler/roman-empire\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> in the “data” directory. The input layers for the map includes a subset of attributes for places, roads, fortifications and provinces — with low, medium and high details for different zoom levels. Among the input files are also the icons that represents these various types of place or objects in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vector generating process can be easily done using <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/\" target=\"_blank\">MapTiler Desktop software</a>. Input files are data in GeoJSON or other vector formats, and the output tiles are in MBTiles format—technically a SQLite database. MapTiler Desktop offers the ability to: merge multiple sources; edit various attributes; set zoom levels for each attribute; and change the order of attributes in the final map. Since it runs in a graphical user interface, it is more accessible to a broad audience. There is also a command-line version of the software for automation and integration into a workflow called <a href=\"http://https://www.maptiler.com/engine/\" target=\"_blank\">MapTiler Engine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vector tiles can also be generated using other software, including open-source tools like mapnik-vector-tile via tilelive, tippecanoe or others. However, these tools have a steeper learning curve, usually demand a longer generating period, and do not come with a graphical user interface and installer for Windows or Mac.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/Klokan3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Fig 3: MapTiler Desktop with The Roman Empire Vector Map data</center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Map styling and publishing </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the map is presented to end-users, it is necessary to define a map style. This is a file which says how each element should be represented on the final map, e.g., what colour should be used for painting a road, what symbol should be used for fortification, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are specialized map hosting services where you can upload your data in MBTiles format and style them within a graphical user interface. One of them is <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">MapTiler Cloud</a>. Since it runs from a cached global infrastructure, it has a low load latency. Styling is done with a graphical style editing tool, where each map element can be designed in an on-the-fly preview mode. It is also possible to upload a style in a JSON format and make further changes in the graphical editor. Apart from displaying the map in the browser or mobile apps, it provides a map service for use in desktop GIS software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative is to host the MBTiles file on any web hosting or cloud service. If there is a need for raster tiles and map services, one can use tools like <a href=\"https://openmaptiles.org/docs/host/tileserver-gl/\" target=\"_blank\">TileServer GL </a>developed by Klokan Technologies and released as open-source. Together with the data, it is necessary to prepare a config file in JSON format. This can be done using any text editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From an end-user perspective, changes on the vector map can be made based on a time period to be selected from the drop-down menu. For example, the Roman Empire Vector Map contains place name labels in Latin, Greek and modern names in language predominantly spoken in the specific area, the selection of which is made by the end user using the drop-down menu. Currently, this menu offers five time periods plus an “All Time Periods” option. In the future we may replace the drop-down menu with timeline functionality, such as can already be seen in use in our new TimeMachine Atlas project, where the end-user can move forward or back in time and see the map dynamically change accordingly. On the time axis, one can also watch the exact year, stop the time flow, or move to a selected year.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/Klokan4.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 4: Edit Style tool available in <a href=\"https://www.maptiler.com/maps/\" target=\"_blank\">MapTiler Cloud</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project demonstrates many advantages of the vector tiles technology and its flexibility to work with historical data.

                body: "<p>In 1577, King Philip II of Spain, decreed an ordinance to collect a variety of economic, social and political information about the Spanish realm through a 50-chapter questionnaire. This included the territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, part of what is today Mexico and Central America. While the questionnaire sent to every town and village aimed to gather data which would be useful to the crown – including, but not limited to, exploitable resources such as minerals, plants and products as well as information on the history and organisation of indigenous society. This endeavour resulted in the compilation of the now surviving 168 reports, a corpus of 2.8 million words written in Spanish, peppered with around 69 different indigenous languages [1]. – it also aimed to collect scientific measurements and geographic information in the form of maps. Questions 10, 42, and 47 requested the creation of some form of plan or painting, showing a variety of geographic information such as streets, towns and villages, ports, coasts, islands, or anything relevant to the local geographies. While the orchestrator of the questionnaire, the chronicler cosmographer of the Indies Juan López de Velasco expected to receive maps created in the western tradition, what he got back instead was a completely unexpected new form of hybrid cartographic representation: the pinturas (paintings, also referred to as ‘maps’) of what would be called the Relaciones Geográficas de la Nueva España (hereafter RGs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these paintings offers a unique reflection on sixteenth-century settlements in Mexico. Composed within a complex interwoven ideology including indigenous and European techniques, these paintings convey social and cultural ideas, representing space and place in numerous ways, many of which may be unfamiliar to the modern eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/mnf1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Fig. 1 The map of Cempoala. Relaciones Geográficas de México y Guatemala, 1577-1585. Joaquín García Icazbalceta Manuscript Collection, University of Texas.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Our project ‘<a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/digging-ecm\" target=\"_blank\">Digging into Early Colonial Mexico: A large-scale computational analysis of sixteenth-century historical sources</a>’ (DECM) is developing novel methods and tools for mining data from both textual and pictorial historical records. Through a combination of techniques using Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning, the project aims to create news ways of answering vital research questions which would previously have required a lifetime of investigation. We are experimenting with NLP annotation models to enable the automatic extraction of information by topic, as well as the automated recognition of proper names including toponyms, institutions and people’s names, among others. We are also in the process of creating the first digital 16th century gazetteer of New Spain through the semi-automated extraction and disambiguation of place-names from a number of historical secondary and primary sources. We have also created a full historical dataset in GIS of relevant geographic data such as territorial divisions during the 16th century including provinces, dioceses, etc. This will soon facilitate all sorts of spatial analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the pinturas, we are also aiming to use annotation and image processing techniques in combination with machine learning. These present a set of fascinating challenges, and using Recogito is one of the approaches we aim to use to address these. The pintura of Cempoala (Fig. 1), for example, combines both European and indigenous techniques, featuring both glosses (text) of place-names written in Spanish, as well as glyphs in the indigenous tradition. These might also tell the reader the toponym of the settlement (through its glyph), provided they have an understanding of the indigenous writing and histories present on the map. Nor is this interplay of European and indigenous styles unique to the Cempoala map – indeed, it features on the majority of maps created for the RGs, but also on other maps produced from the sixteenth-century onwards, including cadastral maps produced to substantiate indigenous land claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Place-names and spatial organisation are not the only pieces of information contained within these paintings. There is a great variety across the corpus of 78 RG paintings alone. Historical information is embedded within many of the pinturas, either through genealogical histories depicted in a style similar to that of indigenous Codices (such as the pre-Hispanic Codex Zouche Nutall or the colonial Codex Mendoza), the depiction of rulers, or within the place-name glyphs themselves. These are just a few examples of the kinds of information present in these paintings, and, despite a great deal of research, there is still much to learn from these unique resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is undeniable that the paintings of the RGs contain a great variety of both textual and pictographic information, which offer invaluable insight into the historical and geographical contexts in which these pinturas were produced. Recogito offers the opportunity to analyse this wealth of information in a new and innovative way. We have recently begun the process of annotating some of the RG maps using Recogito, which we hope will enable us to not only identify and extract information depicted on these, but also interact with this information in a way which would not be possible without computational methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/mnf3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Fig. 2 Close-up view of some of the Cempoala map annotations, including place-names (e.g. Tlacopa) and names of people (e.g. Don Francisco). Created using <a href=\"https://recogito.pelagios.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Recogito</a></center>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the features which will be particularly interesting for this process will be Recogito’s Map View, which will allow us, using our own or other gazetteers, to geographically locate (where identifiable) the sixteenth-century places depicted on the RG maps. For example, this has the potential to highlight the alternate ways in which space is represented on the paintings. Distances between settlements, for example, are often depicted in ways that may be unfamiliar to the modern reader. Barbara Mundy, a leading art historian who has been at the forefront of research into the maps of the RGs in recent years, employed the term ‘communicentric projection’ to describe how these maps often arrange settlements on the map based upon the significance of the role of the community, rather than solely their geographic, physical location [2].</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/mnf2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Fig. 3 Recogito’s Map View used to locate ‘Cempoala’, modern name: Zempoala</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, one of the inevitable issues of investigating historic geographies is the fact that many place-names have evolved and, in many cases, completely changed over time. Identification of place-names is an ongoing challenge within the DECM project, and if you would like to read a little more about how we are addressing these issues using computational techniques, click <a href=\"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/digging-ecm/2018/06/location-location-location/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annotating the RG maps using Recogito offers a prime opportunity to test the capability of these kinds of tools in handling rich, and varied, historical source material. Adopting Recogito for the analysis of these maps will, we hope, offer new insights into perceptions of space and place across sixteenth-century Mexico from both an indigenous and European perspective, as well as demonstrating the value of computational approaches more broadly as a tool for historical enquiry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>References </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] Harvey, H.R.

                templates: body
                body: "<p>With the integration of computational methods in humanities research, come computational evaluation methods. The language technology community has a longstanding tradition of corpus-based evaluations [1] as well as data annotation practices [2]. In interdisciplinary digital humanities research projects, we are starting to integrate some of these evaluation methods using Recogito. This piece will explain why we chose Recogito and how we are stretching its use to fit our needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Humanities Cluster’s Digital Humanities Lab, we are working on advancing humanities research through digital methods with a specific focus on automatic text analysis. In two projects, we currently use Recogito to manually annotate texts which then compare to our automated methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>EviDENce: Ego Documents Events modelliNg - how individuals recall mass violence </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the EviDENce project, we work with historians and eScience engineers to investigate how the perception of the concept of ‘violence’ changes over time through eyewitness reports and ego-documents (ego documents are texts in which the personal life and experiences of the author play an important and central role such as diaries, autobiographies and memoirs). In the first year of the project, we focused on transcribed WWII eyewitness interviews and we investigated how suitable state-of-the-art language technology pipelines are for the purposes of extracting relevant information from these interview texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One glitch is that in our project, we are interested in events, places, people, time and emotions, and only the first three are available as entity types in Recogito. We found a way around this by labelling time and emotions using the ‘tag’ option in Recogito, which provides us with a way to annotate items outside the predefined categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/verp1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: Screen shot of EviDENCe annotation in Recogito</center>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparing our manual Recogito annotations to automatic annotations by Frog [3] and the NewsReader pipeline [4], we found that off-the-shelf named entity recognisers have difficulties with domain-specific terms as well as the granularity of places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to compare a manual annotation to an automatic annotation side-by-side helped us bridge the gap between what historians deem relevant in texts and what our current state-of-the-art tools can recognise explicit [5].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we had good experiences with a flexible reuse of Recogito, we also decided to use it in a different project: the Historical Recipe Web in which we automatically extract recipes from historical newspapers to gain insights into trends in food culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Historical Recipe Web </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were looking for a quick way to annotate a set of newspaper recipes with “ingredients”, “potential ingredients”, and “quantities” to evaluate an automatic recipe analyser on. The “potential ingredients” category denotes strings that most likely denote an ingredient but are not correctly recognised by the OCR software. We included this category to be able to evaluate the impact of OCR errors in our experiments. Figure 2 illustrates an example annotation. The newspaper scan on the left shows that the page is folded and some words are difficult to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/verp2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: Example of a newspaper recipe scan, its resulting OCR’ed text, marked up using Recogito with ingredients that our approach should be able to recognise (blue), potential ingredients (pink) and quantities (green) as well as the recipe’s English translation. Source: NRC Handelsblad 24 April 1988, page 20, https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=KBNRC01: 000029338:mpeg21:a0179</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, ‘ingredient’, ‘quantity’, and ‘potential ingredient’ are not standard Recogito categories, but by ‘using’ the Person tag (blue) for ingredients, the Event tag (pink) for potential ingredients, and the Location tag (green) for quantities, we could find a reasonable work-around. In a short timeframe we were thus able to annotate 100 articles against which we could evaluate our system. Among these were 6 articles that were annotated by all three annotators, which enabled us to evaluate the inter-annotator-agreement. The evaluation was not done within Recogito itself, but via a CSV export from Reogito which we subsequently ran through additional Python scripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Conclusion </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Annotating evaluation datasets is usually a time-consuming task, and one that can take up even more time when not using an optimal tool. Whilst there are many tools around that provide myriad options, we believe that projects are best served by an intuitive tool that does not require complex configurations and installation processes. For our digital humanities projects, we ‘extended annotation beyond Recogito’s core entity types because the platform was so easy and attractive to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EviDENCe is funded by the CLARIAH- CORE project financed by NWO: http://www.clariah.nl.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The starting point for the <a href=\"http://commons.pelagios.org/2019/02/final-report-for-ottoman-recogito-ottorec/\" target=\"_blank\">Ottoman Recogito (OttRec)</a> was an inquiry into the applicability of Recogito for the purposes of building a digital Ottoman gazetteer with the use of Ottoman sources. Having considered many sources from different periods, we decided to use the so-called ‘Registers of Important Affairs’ (mühimme defterleri), which contain imperial orders dispatched from the capital (Istanbul) to the provinces. There is a total of 419 volumes covering the years 1553–1915. Some of these volumes are available in transcription and in digital format, and we chose to work on volume no.12. This volume covers the years 1570-1572, and contains 1,283 orders. Our selection of this volume was determined by both qualitative and quantitative criteria. This was a period of rapid and important changes at the geopolitical level. It was during this time that the limits of the empire’s expansion were gradually being consolidated. Quantitatively, this meant that the particular volume had a large number of toponyms, which would make it ideal to start collecting Ottoman place names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was 10,812 annotations: 8,213 place names and 2,347 people. Of the 8,213 annotated places, we identified 647 unique toponyms, while another 390 remain unidentified. The next step is to identify the toponyms that were not on the existing gazeteers that Recogito uses. The top-five most frequently-encountered toponyms are: Istanbul (1,335), Cyprus (330), Damascus (159), Baghdad (135) and Rhodes (114) (Figure 1). Since this was the period of the Cyprus expedition, these results were neither unexpected nor a coincidence. Rather than being the statistical and visual representation of our specific source, we tend to interpret these outcomes as a locus for apprehending the history of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. This source thus allows us to identify the locations with which the imperial center was corresponding at a critical juncture in its history. In this sense, Recogito helped us trace both proxies of war-making and various semantic connotations employed by the center to define its domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/hns1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1: &nbsp;The Recogito map of the toponyms in the existed Recogito gazetteers</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with our objective, Recogito’s user-friendly interface, which did not necessitate specialized knowledge, operationalized the team work in a short period of time. Accordingly, we were able to confirm the usefulness of Recogito, in terms of teaching, learning, and interpreting the history of the Ottoman Empire, a vast geography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having completed the annotation process, we reviewed the whole document and checked the accuracy of our annotations. Having detected a high degree of inaccuracy in the richest Ottoman gazetteer that exists in print form, the review process and accuracy control were extremely significant. Identifying the locations of toponymic homonyms (i.e., place names that share the same name but are located in different places) was one of the main problems that we faced during the project. We dealt with this issue by paying attention to the context of each order, as, for example, the clear indications of “to whom” or “for what” the administrative centre addressed the concerned order. During this process, the idea of tagging other spatial entities that are not necessarily toponyms emerged, such as mines, religious foundations, nomadic communities, or rivers. This allowed us to determine the accurate locations of many identical place names, and greatly facilitated the compilation of the gazetteer. Meanwhile, the idea of tagging thematic spatial entities brought a more comprehensive perspective to the project and we expanded the usage of the “Tag” function to the whole document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Tag” function of Recogito provided us with the opportunity to geo-locate these entities, and, in some cases, to relate communities and social attributes to places or regions. Examples of such spatial entities were: bridges, caravanserais; marketplaces; mines; mountains; nomadic communities; pious foundations (vakıfs); prisons; ports; rebellious communities/rebellions; religious schools; shrines; temples; tribes. So far, we have obtained the most profound visual results of tagging by annotating the fortresses and the ports mentioned in the register.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/hns2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2: Map of fortresses mentioned in the Register of Important Affairs no.12</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Ottoman mühimme register of 1570-1572, we have detected and geo-located 101 fortresses so far (Figure 2). A second map was produced by identifying the places of 29 ports cited in the register (Figure 3). Additionally, we have prepared a database from the pieces of information indicated in the register regarding the physical conditions, usages or managements of the tagged physical entities which has enabled us to come up with a more comprehensive illustrative framework of the 16th-century Ottoman space. These figures are not comprehensive, as tagging was a procedure we initiated at a late stage of double-checking the results, and did not have the time to go back to the beginning before the completion of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/pelagios/hns3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3: Map of ports mentioned in the Register of Important Affairs no.12</center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be that as it may, ports and fortresses correspond to, and should be interpreted in accordance with, the contemporary economic, political, and social contexts of the regions or localities where they are situated. Consequently, both of these entities might be perceived as reciprocally formed by geo-politics and geo-economics. When we look at the maps of frequently mentioned fortresses and ports in the 16th-century register, the first thing that attracts our attention is the peripheral and strategic dispersion of the entities on the maps. While the time when the register was compiled coincides with the Ottoman-Venetian War for Cyprus and the Battle of Lepanto, it reveals “what” and “where” the capital considered as important in military and fiscal terms. Considering that the notion of “border” had a different meaning in the context of early modern empires, these relatively peripheral entities also illustrate the perspective of the center regarding the peripheral limits of the empire. These maps not only show us the strategic edges and bases within the empire, but also the martial and economic contact zones with contiguous political entities such as Venice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recogito has allowed us to refine, better organize, collaboratively process, and be more productive in our study of space as a dimension of history, while using mapping as a methodological tool. More importantly, it has contributed to the contextualization of our source in a more comprehensive way where semantic annotations and geo-referencing may enable us to produce new historical inquiries where space and spatiality stand as crucial components of historical research.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Documentation of updates to the Data Exchange Agreement'
        intro: "<p>In the following, we provide a high-level summary of the differences between the original version of the DEA and the updated version of the DEA.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Changes to the considerations and definitions (Article 1)</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We are now referring to the counter-party as 'Data Partner' instead of 'Data Provider'. This change has been made throughout the document and is intended to align the terminology used in the DEA with the terminology in use elsewhere.</li>\r\n    <li>We have removed the consideration that 'Europeana has no intention to include any data in its database other than such metadata and previews'. This consideration was not reflective of the operational reality of Europeana anymore. Europeana currently uses Public Domain and openly licensed Content obtained from its Data Partners in a number of products such as exhibitions and on social media (see also 'New Article 5' below which introduces a new article 5 that deals with the 'Use of Digital Objects' by Europeana).</li>\r\n    <li>We have removed the definition of the now defunct Council of Content Providers and Aggregators and added a definition of the Europeana Network Association as the ENA takes over the dispute resolution role formerly assigned to the CCPA in article 9.6.</li>\r\n    <li>We have replaced the definition of ‘Preview’ with a new definition of ‘Thumbnail’. This new definition more precisely reflects the operational reality of Europeana. Europeana does in fact only store static images that serve as visual representations of a Digital Object, Europeana has never stored audio-visual representations of Content. We have replaced all references to Previews with references to Thumbnails throughout the document.</li>\r\n    <li>We have added a new definition of ‘Digital Object’ that is identical to the existing definition in the Europeana Glossary. This better aligns the DEA with other policies and technical documents in use by Europeana. Within the DEA the new definition is used in the new article 5 on 'Use of Digital Objects'.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Changes to Article 2</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have removed the reference to the now-defunct CCPA from 2.4</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Changes to Article 3</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have removed the requirement ‘hen making available Metadata or any parts thereof under the terms of the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication, Europeana will provide a link to the Europeana Data Use Guidelines with the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication'. From 3.3. Creative Commons has removed the technical functionality to provide such links in the deeds and as a result Europeana cannot meet this requirement anymore. Europeana will continue to promote the values contained in the Europeana Data Use Guidelines via other means.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Changes to Article 4</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have removed article 4.3 which gave Data Partners the ability to ‘indicate[s] to Europeana in writing that it does not allow Europeana to [publish the URL pointing to the previews]’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is due to the fact that in the past Data Partners have not made use of this provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Changes to Article 5 (old)</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have moved the contents of the Article (‘Term’) to the end of article 7 ('Termination').</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>New Article 5</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have added a new Article 5 which clarifies how Europeana uses Digital Objects.</li>\r\n    <li>Article 5.1 describes the existing practice in which Europeana displays Digital Objects in the Europeana context via links when it is provided with direct links to Digital Objects as part of the Metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>Article 5.2 clarifies that Europeana does not store Digital Objects for this purpose.</li>\r\n    <li>Article 5.3 clarifies that Europeana can make use of Digital Objects under the terms of the associated rights statements.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Article 6</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No substantive changes have been made to Article 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Article 7</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The provisions formerly contained in Article 5 ('Term') have been added as 7.5 and 7.6.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Article 8</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have added a termination clause that allows Europeana to assign the rights obtained under the DEA to a new operator should a new operator for the Europeana DSI be appointed. This addition ensures that the Europeana service can be transferred to a new operator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Article 9</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We have replaced the reference to the defunct CCPA in the paragraph dealing with dispute resolution with a reference to the Europeana Network Association.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        title: 'Europeana STEM Challenge FAQ'
        intro: "<p>The Europeana #STEM Challenge is now closed for applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We answer your most frequently asked questions about the Europeana Challenges.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Application tips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>This is a short application form - answer your questions precisely.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Consider your audience and make sure your project is SMART (specific/measurable/achievable/realistic/timely).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Think carefully about the supporting material you want to upload and how long it might take you to develop the material you need to show us. Make it concise, high quality and visually engaging.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Why does Europeana run challenges?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that the content in\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Collections</a>\_can be used for social, economic and educational impact. Through the\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/take-the-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana\_Challenges</a>,\_we invite creative professionals to show us how they can reuse digital cultural data on a specific topic. Then, we fund the best project ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are the challenges themed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set a challenge theme to attract proposals that will use the best of Europeana Collections in a really creative and imaginative way. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the competition reflects the needs of educators for more STEM (science/tech/engineering/math) content and aspires to combine the richness of digital cultural data with the power of modern, visual storytelling to create engaging learning experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who can apply?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome applications from individuals or teams from across the world interested in developing educational videos on STEM topics with Europeana’s openly licensed content. Applicants may be individuals or legal entities and must be over 18 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do I have to do to apply?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>Provide a short summary of your video project proposal.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Share with us a maximum of three links to Europeana content\_you would use.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Show us your previous work by sharing Youtube or Vimeo links (not mandatory but highly recommended).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Apply via our <a href=\"/page/europeana-stem-challenge-submission-page\">submission page.</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>What type of project is eligible?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your project proposal must meet our challenge theme and criteria as shown in the challenge <a href=\"/page/europeana-stem-challenge-terms-and-conditions\">terms and conditions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What content can I use?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must use openly licensed content (i.e. Public Domain Mark, CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA). We can not fund proposals that do not respect the relevant <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">rights statements.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend using the ‘Can I use it?’ filter when searching on \_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> to find the material you can use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do you mean by 'openly licensed' content?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all of the content on Europeana Collections is available to be reused. Freely reusable content with attribution is available under the licences CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, and the Public Domain Mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications must be submitted via the <a href=\"/page/europeana-stem-challenge-submission-page\">online form</a>. Once you submit your application, you cannot edit your proposal, so please ensure you work on it carefully before submitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What language can I write my proposal in?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text of your online application must be in English. The videos (both the pilot video and the final video project) should be either in English or have subtitles in English (if the creator’s native language is not English).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What supporting attachments should I submit and how many can I add?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants should provide references to the Europeana content that will be used in the video - up to five sample records or links to a maximum of three datasets or content queries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also highly recommend submitting a maximum of three links to your previous video work. Unfortunately, we can’t accept attachments to your application by email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I have to deliver within the timeframe set by Europeana? What happens if there are problems?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In your project planning, you should take into account the timeframe for delivery set by Europeana and, of course, thoroughly scope any potential problems and plan additional contingency time. You can deliver early but not late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can Europeana give me advice on my proposal?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a small team and, out of fairness to all applicants, we can’t review or comment on your application or project idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who assesses the applications?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the Europeana Foundation team will check your proposal against the challenge criteria and create a list of applications for assessment by an external <a href=\"/page/europeana-stem-challenge-jury\">jury pane</a>l of educational experts. Find out more about the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNjO-537RSdNLQIk_y1A7E96SbrmLauI4R5RxgnGXcU/edit#\">assessment criteria</a>. The panel will then conduct online interviews with the shortlisted proposals and select the winning proposal(s). Please do not approach any panel members for support as this will lead to your disqualification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who owns the intellectual property?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You own the intellectual property in whatever you develop. However, the videos must be published under the CC-BY-SA licence and credit Europeana by using the ‘Made with Europeana’ logo in the video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens if my application is unsuccessful?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will inform unsuccessful applicants by the date shown in the <a href=\"/page/europeana-stem-challenge-terms-and-conditions\">terms and conditions</a>. Please note that the challenge is extremely competitive; for this reason, we won’t be able to provide personal and qualitative feedback to the individual applicants. It is not possible to appeal the final decision of the jury panel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens if I am selected?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To receive the funding, the winner will be required to sign a subcontract with the Europeana Foundation. A staged payment schedule and delivery points will be agreed between the Europeana Foundation and the winning applicant(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will the awarded funding be a net amount?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, the granted funding is a gross amount and will not cover any taxes. The Europeana Foundation is VAT exempt and the winner(s) is responsible for any VAT or other tax declarations and payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will you have more challenges?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we host one or two challenges each year. We also work in partnership with others to provide opportunities for the creative reuse of digital cultural heritage content in other ways. Sign up to our newsletter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\">follow us</a> on Twitter and keep an eye on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/creative-industries\">website</a> to find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

Generations of Europeans have this year been getting hands-on with history, making it more accessible for us all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 1914-1918 Centenary Tour (led by the Europeana Foundation and Facts &amp; Files) promoted the value of digital cultural heritage to European citizens. Generations of people came together to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/transcribathons-in-education-and-research-digital-lessons-from-the-past\">digitally transcribe</a> more than 2,800 handwritten documents - letters, postcards and diaries - from the First World War period. Once made digital, these transcribed documents can be easily translated, making them available to a much wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘You are gold diggers, bringing memories to the surface’. Taja Vovk van Gaal, Creative Director House Of European History, addressing transcribathon participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tour finished with an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/more-than-a-buzzword-why-transcribathon-exemplifies-the-need-for-digital-transformation-and-just-what-that-means\">event </a>in collaboration with the House of European History in Brussels in November. Here, previous transcribathon winners from all around Europe competed in a final transcribathon. There were two round table discussions with renowned digital humanities experts on the value of the unique corpus of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>. And European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel, spoke about the importance of commemoration and cultural heritage to the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economies.</p>\r\n"

One key activity of the EAF was the development of an aggregator accreditation scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=national-workshop\">national workshops</a> brought cultural heritage institutions, aggregating partners and the Europeana Foundation together to address the challenges and benefits of publishing cultural heritage online, using the Europeana Publishing Framework to demonstrate how collection quality influences potential uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metis, our new internal data publishing system, replaced UIM as the aggregation system for the Europeana Core Service. Transparent management of data workflows, modular architecture and an improved user experience are already improving the efficiency of ingesting data. In parallel, we continued work on new metadata harvesting channels, experimenting with Linked Open Data, Schema.org and IIIF content and metadata discovery patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In very close collaboration with aggregator partners, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> (EPF) was revised to include a proposal for a metadata component, and data quality was improved by moving content up the tiers of the EPF and reducing the number of non-compliant records by 3 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improvements to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> focused on full-text content for Europeana Newspapers, and thanks to the RightsStatements.org Consortium, rights statements were added in <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/en/documentation/translations.html\">four more languages</a>.</p>\r\n"

In 2018, we introduced a new-style item page, and improvements to the ‘entities’ concept released in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/improving-discoverability-with-new-entities-in-europeana-collections\">Entity pages</a> on Europeana Collections are entry points to content by a specific person, or on a certain topic. They provide context by combining information from Wikipedia with metadata relating to a person or topic. When connected to an entity, an item gains the multilingual search terms associated with that entity, so it will turn up in searches performed in different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new item page design makes sharing, downloading and crediting simpler, while ‘next’ and ‘previous’ item options take clicks out of browsing search results. Connectivity with other parts of the site is made clear - over 25% of items are now connected to a blog post, gallery, exhibition or entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new thematic collection, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/newspapers\">Europeana Newspapers</a>, gathers 4,129,989 million newspapers from 23 countries spanning four centuries. More than 800,000 of the newspapers are available in searchable full-text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, these developments take us closer to our goal of increasing visitor numbers, repeat visits and session length through more engaging experiences and in-depth browsing.</p>\r\n"

Now in its third year, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/research-grants-programme-2018-call-for-submissions-open\">Europeana Research Grants Programme</a> awards funding to scholars to mine and map Europeana Collections to uncover new patterns and generate new insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Projects funded under the second Europeana Research Grants programme concluded in 2018. Europeana Collections material was used to study <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/medieval-manuscript-databases-krista-murchison-europeana-research-grants-winner\">manuscripts from medieval England </a>containing French literature, to look at visual representations of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/visual-representations-of-roma-in-19th-and-20th-centuries-caterina-preda-europeana-research-grants-winner\">the Roma in Romania</a>, and to connect a citation index of literature on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-the-venice-scholar-matteo-romanello-europeana-research-grant-winner\">history of Venice</a> with related digital objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the third Europeana Research Grants Programme, early-career scholars were invited to propose projects connected to the theme of the First World War. We received high-quality responses from all over Europe. Professor Lorna Hughes, Chair of the Europeana Research Advisory Board, presented the recipients of the 2018 Europeana Research Grants with their awards at the House of European History in Brussels in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-winners-of-the-europeana-research-grants-programme-2018\">three winning projects</a>, which will run throughout 2019, will map soldiers’ itineraries using their personal diaries, create a dynamic visualisation of wartime postcards, and research the use of wartime content in professional storytelling.</p>\r\n"

Material from Europeana Collections provides multiple perspectives on historical, political, economic, cultural and human developments across Europe and beyond. Europeana Education aims to enrich digital learning materials with this diverse cultural data and inspire learners of all ages. Throughout 2018, our portfolio of digital learning resources has continued to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the first Europeana Education Massive Open Online Course, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-europeana-education-mooc-giving-teachers-confidence-to-use-digital-cultural-heritage\">‘Europeana in your classroom</a>’, created with European Schoolnet and designed to give teachers the confidence to use digital cultural heritage, had over 2,000 registrations from 59 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-enters-the-world-of-teacher-training\">Teacher Training Kit</a> was created with partner Euroclio, along with over 50 learning scenarios from the Europeana Teacher Developer Group. And a series of campaigns, webinars and workshops introduced eTwinning’s vast international teacher network to Europeana’s educational resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaborations with ministries of education were further nurtured, and more than 500 educators provided very positive and valuable feedback in a robust series of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/we-asked-educators-how-they-want-to-use-digital-cultural-data-and-this-is-what-they-told-us\">interviews and surveys</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open Education Consortium awarded Europeana an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-wins-global-education-award-for-work-to-open-up-digital-cultural-heritage\">Open Education Award for Excellence</a> as ‘an exemplary initiative promoting free and open access to cultural heritage collections. A project showcasing humanity’s patrimony freely, openly and without any restrictions’.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Women''s Season'
        intro: "<p>Women's Season was\_part of Commissioner Gabriel’s\_<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/women-ict\">strategy</a>\_to empower women and increase their participation in the digital economy. Women’s Season will culminate in March 2019 (with International Women’s Day celebrations on 8 March) and will highlight the achievements of both modern and historical women. Find out more, and how you can participate.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h2>Season Activities</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a>, we highlighted the lives and achievements of historical European women in blogs, galleries, and an\_exhibition), including guest contributions from Europeana’s network of cultural heritage partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Pioneers:Trailblazing women in the arts, sciences and society</li>\r\n    <li>Blogs\r\n    <ul>\n<li>\r\n        <div><a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/03/elsa-schiaparelli-declaring-feminine-willpower-through-fashion/\">Elsa Schiaparelli: Declaring Feminine Willpower through Fashion</a></div>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n        <div><a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/03/carving-a-place-for-women-on-statues/\">Carving a place for women on statues</a></div>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n    </ul>\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Europeana Pro</div>\r\n\r\n<p>On\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Pro</a>, we ran\_a \_series of profiles and interviews with leading women in the digital and GLAM sectors, highlighting their work and achievements. The series is entitled\_<em>Women in Culture and Technology</em>\_and featured interviews with women from across sectors and across the world - including, tech expert and founder of DigiPippi (an organisation which bridges the gender gap in technology) Eva Fog and renowned multi-disciplinary artist Nora Al-Badri.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A series of inspiration, innovation, and insight</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By going behind-the-scenes and showing women in action - be it as a work-from-home digital writer and activist, a politician, artist, or a tech entrepreneur - professional women will be given a platform to share their experiences, insights, challenges and hopes for the future of technology and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst bridging gender gaps may not seem as momentous as the challenges faced by our professional foremothers (see our digital exhibition\_<em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a>\_</em>for a deeper look at this topic), the recent European Commission study \_<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/increase-gender-gap-digital-sector-study-women-digital-age\">‘Women in the Digital Age’</a>\_reported a growing gap in gender parity in digital sectors of education, career and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study highlights the continued need to publicise the contribution of women - and particularly those who inhabit spaces that are historically male-dominated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Gabriel said: ‘How much better would Europe be if girls and women felt empowered to dream big and aim high across professional fields from art to science? Having role models will help them build these dreams. The online exhibition I launch today in cooperation with Europeana is about pioneering women from our history whose stories are vastly different, but have one thing in common: these fearless women changed the world with their passion and hard work. Today we need to empower and inspire girls and women everywhere in Europe to innovate, discover and create especially in the digital sector. And all of us, we have a role to play.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Lily Knibbeler, Director General of the National Library of the Netherlands said: ‘Culture is all about diversity, which means that the full richness of our culture can only be embodied by full diversity in our workforce.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Jill Cousins, Director and CEO Hunt Museum said: ‘Women are often not invited to the table - \_I don’t think it is deliberate – but in the same way that humans tend to flock to their own tribe, if there are no women at the original table they are less likely to get invited to the future one. It will require a deliberate action to change this.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Building upon the interest and results of the previous colouring books created by Europeana, we decided to create the 4th edition with the theme Women in History. The book featuring 19 openly licensed images from 6 cultural institutions across Europe presented women in various places in times, from the first medieval depiction of a female dentist to suffrage posters. The book was promoted during <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/02/colorourcollections-our-new-colouring-blog-about-women-in-history/\">#ColorOurCollection</a> Campaign, an annual, weeklong colouring event organized by libraries and other cultural institutions worldwide, promoting creativity around openly licensed content available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the colouring session was held on the 8th of March during the International Women’s Day event at <a href=\"https://atria.nl/\">Atria, Institute for Gender Equality and Women's History</a> in Amsterdam. There, Europeana team had a chance to present the book and our activities related to the Women’s History Month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can still download the colouring book <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/vhh0yc0zmei35un/WomenInHistory_Colouring%20Book.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

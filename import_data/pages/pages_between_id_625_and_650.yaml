        title: Planning
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Apart from very practical planning (logistics, testing scripts, etc.), you need to begin with asking yourself if you’re asking the right questions? Have the right measurements been defined to ask them? Those questions need to be based on the desired impact, outcomes (and possibly outputs) defined/hypothesised in the preceding phase.\_<br>\r\n\_ \_* The Value Lenses can provide you with leads to which research questions to ask: Which metrics could conceivably demonstrate Legacy value? Or Learning? Or Community? What questions need we ask ourselves, our stakeholders and our users to acquire those metrics and so demonstrate that we have provided value?<br>\r\n\_ \_* There may be standard indicators that you can draw on. As an example the Net Promoter Score is a very common indicator used to measure satisfaction of a service or product among its users. Since it’s so commonly used there are also rules of thumb on what scores could be considered “Excellent” or “World Class”[1].<br>\r\n\_ \_* Ask yourself if there is baseline data already that you can use? Without a baseline you cannot prove change. If you don’t have a baseline do you need to establish one as part of your data collection phase.<br>\r\n\_ \_ \_ * Baselines are absolutely necessary for long-term outcomes that may take many months, even years to measure.\_<br>\r\n\_ \_ \_ * Institutional memory is an aspect here - the first time you do a data collection and analysis it may seem difficult. The 10th time you do it it will be utterly routine and you will also benefit from a long timeline of data allowing you to demonstrate change over time.<br>\r\n\_ \_ \_ * Using existing data is conservation of effort: Don’t waste resoures duplicating what has already been done!<br>\r\n\_ \_* When collecting data be clear whether data will be fit to measure outputs or outcomes (or even ultimate impact).\_<br>\r\n\_ \_ \_ * Consideration: Output tends to be much easier to measure than outcome so beware of falling into the trap of measuring what’s easy!<br>\r\n\_ \_* Impact, and even some outcomes, are often not evident other than in the \_long-term. They can’t be truly and confidently be measured during a development phase or soon after a product/service launch.\_<br>\r\n\_ \_ \_ * Consideration: You may and should be able to do a diagnostic data collection based on a prototype or minimum viable product[2] already during the development. The evaluation of that diagnostic could and should influence the way in which you design and deliver the product or service.<br>\r\nConsiderations<br>\r\n* What other types of data are there than user data that you should collect? Data on economic, operational, and data quality outcomes could be other examples. \_The data you collect will of course need to vary with what outcomes and impacts you have defined in the Design Phase! If you’re assessing e.g. a cultural heritage incubator you will need to collect different data to if you’re assessing a migration crowdsourcing site.<br>\r\n* At a larger organisation that can afford specialised teams the data collection and analysis phase may be performed by a team of specialists or a team led by specialists - this would entail phase hand-overs. In a smaller organization the entire impact assessment may be done by the same 2-4 people.<br>\r\n\_ \_* Hand-overs are always weak points in a process. Data loss and misunderstandings may occur. One way to reduce this risk is to have at least one, but ideally more, persons involved in all phases of the impact assessment. Good documentation is another and often neglected one.</p>\r\n"

The stakeholders who worked with you in phase 1, may not be the best people to identify the metrics/questions for the data collection and analysis phase. At a larger organisation that can afford specialised teams the data collection and analysis phase may be performed by a team of specialists or a team led by specialists - this would entail phase hand-overs. In a smaller organization the entire impact assessment may be done by the same 2-4 people.\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Hand-overs are always weak points in a process. Data loss and misunderstandings may occur. One way to reduce this risk is to have at least one, but ideally more, persons involved in all phases of the impact assessment.&nbsp;</li>\r\n        <li>Good documentation is another and often neglected one.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li><strong>Collaboration is key. </strong>You do not need to undertake this exercise all by yourself. Collaboration between organisations working on the same goals allows for learning from each other’s approaches and can save on costs of developing measurement tools.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

This is especially important if a lot of time has passed in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Keep the focus on change</strong> - Outcomes not outputs. Some things may be easy to measure (outputs) but tell us little about the change for our stakeholders. Begin by reminding your team what to focus on: measuring outcomes for impact.</li>\r\n    <li>Keep the focus on all the impact you make. It is tempting to focus on collecting data on the positive changes while ignoring the unintended consequences (negative or positive) of your work.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Start diving into literature and research. Look at how your change pathway is already supported or contradicted by existing evidence. You can think of literature, case studies, or similar work that other organisations have done. This will help you to further focus on what still needs to be measured, design the appropriate research questions and determine the priorities in which data to collect and assess.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Avoid cherry picking!</strong> Avoid the tendency to pick only literature and existing evidence that supports your work to avoid a distorted picture of reality. Try to be as balanced as possible in picking your sources.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine which indicators you will use to measure your outcomes. Prioritize those outcomes that are most important to you and that you want to start measuring data on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Use standard indicators.</strong> There may be standard indicators that you can draw on. As an example the Net Promoter Score is a very common indicator used to measure satisfaction of a service or product among its users. Since it’s so commonly used there are also rules of thumb on what scores could be considered “Excellent” or “World Class”.</li>\r\n    <li><em>For example;</em> Link to: GRI, sinzer standards, SDGs,&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine your key research questions based on your set of indicators and the purpose of your measurement</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The Value Lenses can provide you with leads to which research questions to ask: Which metrics could conceivably demonstrate Legacy value? Or Learning? Or Community? What questions should we ask ourselves, our stakeholders and our users to acquire those metrics and so demonstrate that we have provided value?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

Can I apply?</strong><br>\r\nIf funded, your project\_must be carried on at an\_institution.\_However, we accept submissions also from applicants who are independent scholars at the time of submitting their project proposals.The projects can include collaboration with non-affiliated researchers, or can use the expertise of third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I use other sources than\_the Europeana Collections?</strong><br>\r\nYes. However, content from Europeana Collections must be a central component\_in your project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does the grant cover costs of technical support, buying digital tools for research?</strong><br>\r\nYes, these are eligible costs and can be covered within the grant amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I work with third parties subcontractors for my research project?</strong><br>\r\nYes, but the Europeana Foundation will not be responsible for subcontracts with third parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I want to carry on a long-term project (i.e. it will not be finished by 30 June 2019). Can I apply for a research grant? </strong><br>\r\nYes. The projects funded by the Europeana Foundation can be part of projects broader in scope, but the results outlined in the grant project proposals must be reported and delivered by 30 June 2019.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I was awarded with a\_Europeana research grant\_in the past. Can I apply again?</strong><br>\r\nYes, if you submit a project different than the one already funded by the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I apply for the grant with a project that isn’t a research project (for instance, an art\_project)?</strong><br>\r\nNo. Please explore our other <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation\">funding opportunities</a> on our re-user services pages.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana is 10 years old this year and we'll be celebrating our anniversary throughout December. Alongside a variety of surprises we’ve got planned, we’d love your help to celebrate our joint achievements over the last decade at our AGM on Wednesday 5 December.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On an otherwise ordinary autumn Thursday in 2008 (20 November to be precise), Europeana was launched. At that moment, the beta prototype gave access to 4.5 million digital objects from over 1,000 contributing organisations, including regional and world-famous national libraries, galleries and museum collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10 years on, and with over 58 million objects from over 3,700 institutions, we can now look back and enjoy the fruits of our labours. There are many impressive milestones along this timeline and we are calling out to all our Network Association members to recall, and share, their own favourite Europeana moment.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the AGM in Vienna on Wednesday 5 December, 10 network members will have the opportunity to share their favourite moment, collection, idea, conversation or event that is part of the story of the first ten years of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be big or small, something that you played a part in or saw others do. What is most important is that in some way it represents to you how together we’ve been transforming the world with culture since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to have a chance to present at the AGM please <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/a81f98c6f0c240b3881c5a17fd3bdd0a\">send your favourite moment</a> in no more than 250 words by 23:59, Thursday 1 November and we will let all winning entrants\_know by 12\_November. We will reimburse all the winners for the cost of their AGM ticket. If you don’t have your ticket yet, we do urge you to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/myevent?eid=46751676523\">book as soon as possible</a> because capacity is limited and we expect this event to sell out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to reading your memories.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The digital world has helped - and will continue to help - us deepen our understanding of works of art and to share this knowledge with an increasingly broad audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some 20 years ago, most museums hesitated to share images online, under the impression that visitors would eschew their physical collections in favour of digital reproductions. The opposite has proved to be the case. In fact, the more we offer open access to high-quality images, provide lively storytelling and share recent research, the more relevant our collections become.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, our primary obligation is still to the collection, to the physical object. In that sense, not much has changed. What we see now though is ever-more sophisticated technology that we can harness to enhance and deepen the knowledge that we share with our visitors - all without disturbing the actual physical object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We now have more platforms than ever to reach an (inter)national audience. Websites have become more than lightboxes as they allow us to harness video and other media to tell stories. Augmented and virtual reality will increasingly make it possible to enjoy high-quality reproductions of works of art for those who cannot come to a museum in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How inspiring would it be to be able to walk around the city of Delft in Vermeer’s day? Virtual reality could show us. This is the kind of technology that I’m excited to see transform our interactions with art and culture in the very near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>‘The future is already here - it's just not very evenly distributed,’ science fiction writer William Gibson famously declared. But this is even more true about the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world we live in, the very shape of our present, is the profound result of our history and culture in all of its variety, the good as well as the bad. Yet very few of us have had access to the full array of human expression across time and space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural artifacts that are the incarnations of this past, the repository of our feelings and ideas, have thankfully been preserved in individual museums, libraries, and archives. But they are indeed unevenly distributed, out of the reach of most of humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana changed all of this. It brought thousands of collections together and provided them freely to all. This potent original idea, made real, became an inspiration to all of us, and helped to launch similar initiatives around the world, such as the Digital Public Library of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Access at scale was only the start, however. It is in the daily, less visible interactions with digital cultural heritage that the impact has been, and will continue to be, deeply felt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A walking tour of a town enhanced by augmented reality images and sounds from the past. &nbsp;A young artist finding inspiration from museum pieces suggested by artificial intelligence silently scanning Europeana’s vast collection. A researcher discovering how cities develop over time through the digital synthesis of hundreds of maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tally of these impressions and insights will always be greater than any quantitative measures of Europeana. It is nothing less than new culture being born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Europeana wouldn’t be where it is today without so many people and we’d like to send a heartfelt thanks to every single person who has contributed, however large or small. We know that many people have done some extraordinary things for Europeana in the last 10 years and sometimes don’t always get the recognition they deserve. We’d like to recognise three unsung heroes at our AGM and we need your help to do this.<br><br>\r\nWe’re looking for you to nominate your unsung heroes who have gone above and beyond expectations, in the cause of Europeana and digital transformation of cultural heritage. Please enter the name of the person you nominate (and why) into <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/a4ea011051c244f3b00fa622137b625f\">this short form</a>, by 1st November and we will pick the top three.<br><br>\r\nWe will thank the winners and present them with a small gift at the AGM as our way of saying thank you.</p>\r\n"

In the future it is beloved, one of the EU’s most important initiatives!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She told me of Europeana in schools, homes and communities. Europeana in every country and every language. Europeana as a community, a celebration of the human spirit, a tool for reflection, cultural cohesion and positive change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as I listened in wonder, it struck me that Europeana’s mission, to transform the world with culture, had miraculously come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘But how did we do it?’ I stammered. ‘What did we do to make this dream a reality?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She didn’t know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked everyone in the bar. Everyone knew Europeana and our shared cultural heritage were beloved, cherished, but not how they got that way, or what decisions helped along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt dizzy as I said my goodbyes and walked into the cool night air. We know the future can be beautiful, but how to make it so? Will it be a technology? An insight? Funding and leadership? A new relationship between institutions and the people they are bound to serve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s hard to say for sure. But as I think of the time travellers I met last night and the 25 years I’ve spent working on digital transformation in the cultural sector, I’m pretty sure of this: the future we want — engaged citizens in a healthy and resilient Europe — will only come true if we have the imagination and courage to rethink old assumptions, lift our vision, and make the world anew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

It’s been apparent over the past 10 years of Europeana’s existence that those making great leaps in technical innovation within cultural heritage are part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeanatech\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech community</a>. At each of our conferences (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-2011\">2011</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-2015\" target=\"_blank\">2015</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a>) we have seen these advancements first hand and clearly noticed how heritage and research institutions have reaped the benefits of our collective knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut where are we going next? That was certainly the question during EuropeanaTech 2018. With its wide-ranging expertise, impressive geographic breadth and connectiveness, the EuropeanaTech community is in the perfect position to champion the growth and progress of the cultural heritage sector but some form of steering and overview of core focus areas are necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAware of this in 2017, the Europeana Foundation Governing Board assigned a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-europeana-innovation-task-force\" target=\"_blank\">Task Force</a> to develop an agenda and implementation plan that can position the innovation of the cultural heritage sector as a priority within European cultural policies and research and innovation programmes. This resulted in the newly published </span><span class=\"c3\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Innovation_Agenda/Europeana%20Innovation%20Agenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Innovation Agenda</a></span><span> a report that </span><span class=\"c3\">identifies thirteen topics that constitute the most urgent challenges and opportunities across the European cultural landscape. The Agenda highlights that while there is a strong feeling of urgency in the sector to keep up with the fast-paced digital transformation, innovation cannot be limited to technological demands within the cultural heritage institutions. Broader societal and economic challenges also require immediate and concerted actions.</span><span> Participants at EuropeanaTech 2018 were asked to provide their insights as was the the Network Assocation at large via an online survey. If you're curious about these inputs you can read them all <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Innovation_Agenda/Europeana%20Innovation%20Agenda_community%20input.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span>EuropeanaTech is one of the communities of focus in this report, as it continues to innovate not just technically but structurally, socially, economically and educationally and </span><span class=\"c3\">with this edition of EuropeanaTech Insight, we’ve selected several presentations from the EuropeanaTech 2018 conference that we felt fell within the ethos of these thirteen topics. We then invited these presenters to share an overview, update and insights on their work. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\">We’re just scratching the surface of the abundance of work being done by the EuropeanaTech community but even these few bits and pieces illustrate what a bright future there is for digital cultural heritage. </span></p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Data quality and retrieval; Infrastructures for secure, trustable and shareable content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the creation of digital heritage collections began with the acquisition in image mode, several decades later to search in the content of some of these images still belongs to a more or less distant future. This apparent paradox originates in two facts: digital libraries (DLs) first focused on applying OCR to their printed materials, which renders major services in terms of information retrieval; Searching in large collections of images remains a challenge, despite the efforts of both the scientific community and GAFAs to address the underlying challenges [1]. However, the needs are very real, if one believes user surveys [2] or statistical studies of user behavior. But DLs iconographic collections are generally inadequate, given the broad spectrum of areas of knowledge and time periods surveyed by users. However, DLs are rich in many other iconographic sources. But organized in data silos that are not interoperable, most often lacking the descriptors required for image search, and exposed through text-oriented GIs. While the querying of iconographic content poses specific challenges [3], answers to various use cases, targets different knowledge domains, and finally calls for specific human-machine interactions [4], [5]. This work presents a proposal for a pragmatic solution to these two challenges, the creation of an encyclopedic heritage image database (which has never been done in DLs, to our knowledge, even if the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek offers an image-based similarity search) and its querying modalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extract and aggregate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First, before we look in the images, we must find out where they are located, i.e. we have to data mine the digital repositories. Besides, a multicollection approach requires to take into account the variability of the data available, due both to the nature of the documentary silos and to the history of the digitization policies. Our database aggregates 600k illustrations of theGallica collections of images and prints related to the First World War. The data extracted from 475k pages thanks to the Gallica APIs and to SRU, OAI-PMH and IIIF protocols are stored in a XML database (basex.org). The images collection presents particulars challenges: MD suffering from incompleteness and inconsistency; missing MD at image level like genre (picture, engraving, drawing) or color mode; portfolios exposing specific difficulties: cover and blank or text pages must be excluded, multi-illustrations pages cropped, captions extracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/1.PNG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure&nbsp;1 : Example of portfolio (https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8432784m, many of illustrations, one bibliographical record)</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>For printed collections, we can leverage the OCR resources to identify illustrations a well as the text surrounding them. In the case of the daily press, the illustrations are characterized by a wide variety of genres (from maps to comic strips) and a large volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/2.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure&nbsp;2 : OCR can identify illustrations in printed materials</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 600k raw illustrations extracted, we now must filter the noisy ones, particularly the false detected illustrations from OCR of printed documents but also the blank pages and covers of portfolios. The images collection presents a low noise rate (≈5%) but it affects the quality perceived by users. For newspapers, noise varies from 10% (operator-controlled OCR) to 80% (raw OCR). Using MD and heuristics (illustration size and position, width/height ratio), this noise can be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/3.PNG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 3: Illustrations data mining on raw OCR newspapers outputs a lot of noise…</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that this first step alone (the whole process is schematized below) is worth it: even without semantic indexing of image content, it gives dedicated access to those valuable resources</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/4.PNG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 4: The extraction worflow</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transform and Enrich</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step consists of transforming, enriching and aligning the MD obtained during the previous step. First, illustrations without any text descriptor are filtered and their enlarged bounding box is processed with Google Cloud Vision OCR. Attempts are also made to link the illustrations to the BnF Linked Data service, data.bnf.fr.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Classifying Image Genres</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The illustration genres are not always characterized in the catalogs (and obviously, this MD is not available for printed materials). To overcome this lack, a deep learning approach for image genres classification is implemented. We retrained the last layer of a convolutional neural network model (CNN, here Inception-v3 [6]), following a “transfer learning” method [7]. Our model has been trained on a twelve “heritage” genres ground truth (GT) of 12k illustrations produced first by bootstrapping from catalog MD and then by manual selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/5.PNG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure&nbsp;5 : The twelve categories of the training dataset</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Once trained, the model is evaluated: accuracy and recall are 90%. These results are considered to be good regarding the diversity of the training dataset (see [8] for results on a similar scenario), and performances are better with less generic models (separately trained on the images collection, recall rises up to 95%). Most confusions occur between engraving/photo, line-based content (drawing, map, text) and illustrated ads, common in serials (in the newspapers set, ≈30% of the illustrations are ads), which must be recognized to be filtered or used for scientific aims [9]. But the neural network outputs poor results because these ads can be of any graphical genre (advertisement is a type of communication, not a graphical form). A mixed approach (text+image) should preferably be used. This model is also used to filter the unwanted illustrations that have been missed by the previous heuristic filtering step (§1), thanks to 4 noise classes (text, ornament, blank and cover pages). Recall/precision for these noise classes are highly dependent of the difficulty of the task: 98% for the images collection, 85% for the newspapers. Using neural networks for illustration genres classification brings to light interesting phenomena. Thus, their ability to generalize is expressed e.g. in hybrid documents, both cartographic and illustrative, a variation that wasn’t present in the “maps” learning corpus.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/jean6.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure&nbsp;6: Documents classified as “map”</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the wide documentary coverage of the collection, even over a short period of time, documentary genres that were not foreseen in the training base may appear. Consequently, a new training class must be build and the whole model needs to be retrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/7.PNG\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure&nbsp;7: The new “charts” class: technical drawing, stock exchange charts…</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<h4>Extracting Content from Images</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>IBM Visual Recognition and Google Cloud Vision APIs have been used to analyze the illustrations and extract “concepts” [10] (objects, persons, colors, etc.). An evaluation is carried out on Person detection. A 4k GT is created and another evaluation is conducted on the “soldier” concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/8.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 8: Samples of results for Person recognition</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The “person” concept has a modest recall of 55% but benefits from excellent accuracy of 98%. A decrease is observed for the more specialized “soldier” class (R=50%; A=80%). However, these results are to be compared with the relative silence of keyword searches: “soldier” does not exist as a concept in the bibliographic metadata and it would be necessary to write a complex keyword query like “soldier OR military officer OR gunner OR…” to obtain a 21% recall, to be compared to the 50% obtained by using the visual MD only and the 70% in the hybrid scenario (visual+text descriptors), which shows the obvious interest in offering users cross-modal search [11].</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/9.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 9: Soldier detection: recall for the different search modalities</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Negative effects of deep learning sometimes occur: generalization may produce anachronisms (a 1930 motorized scooter is classified as a Segway); complex or under-segmented documents are indexed with useless generic classes (we have to keep in mind that machine learning techniques remain dependent on the modalities over which the training corpus has been created).</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/jean10.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 10: Classification (from left to right): “frame”, “printed document”, “newspaper”</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The Watson API also performs face detection (R=43%/A=99.9%). On the same GT, a basic ResNet network gives a recall of 58% if one compromises on accuracy (92%): deep learning frameworks offers more flexibility than APIs</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/11.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 11: Face detection results on engravings and drawings (OpenCV, ResNet model, “Single Shot Multibox Detector” method)</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The enrichment indexing pipeline turns out to be complex to design and to implement. It takes into account the fact that certain genres do not need visual indexation (maps); that both text and image can be source of indexing; that this indexation may help to “unfilter” illustrations; that it may be replayed on a regular basis (using different APIs or in-house models); that new kind of content may require to retrain the model(s) and/or redesign the workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/12.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 12: The enrichment worflow</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<h3>Loading and interacting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The BaseX database is requested through REST queries. An images mosaic is fed on the fly by the Gallica IIIF server. A rudimentary faceted browsing functionality prefigures what a more ambitious user/system interaction could be2. Encyclopedic queries leverage the textual descriptors (metadata and OCR). While a “Georges Clemenceau” query in Gallica images collection only returns 140 results, the same query gives more than 900 illustrations with a broader spectrum of genres. The “drawing” facet (thanks to the neural network classification) can then be applied to find Clemenceau caricatures in dailies.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/13.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 13: Caricatures of George Clemenceau: keyword search + genre classification</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The conceptual classes extracted by the visual indexing overcome the silence related to the textual descriptors but also circumvent the difficulties associated with multilingual corpora, the lexical evolution or the fact that keyword-based retrieval can generate some noise. E.g, a query on “airplane” will output a lot of noise (aerial pictures, aviator portraits, etc.) whereas the “airplane” concept will do the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/14.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 14: Querying on “airplane” concept</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, applying the “person” facet will help to quickly find aviators near their machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/15.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 15: Querying on “airplane” + “person” concepts</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the joint use of metadata and conceptual classes allows the formulation of cross-modal (or hybrid) queries: searching for visuals relating to the urban destruction following the battle of Verdun can rely on classes “street” or “ruin” and “Verdun” keyword.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/Jean/16.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 16: Cross-modal query</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The PoC source code and the database1 are available for the academic and digital humanities communities, which investigates more and more heritage contents for visual studies [12]. Moving towards sustainability for the illustrations MD would benefit to their reuse by information systems (like catalogs) as well as by in-house applications or end users. It should be noted that the development of this demonstrator was made possible by the availability of APIs, and in particular IIIF. Besides, the IIIF Presentation API provides an elegant way to describe those illustrations in a near future, using a W3C Open Annotation attached to Canvas in the IIIF manifest. All iconographic resources can then be operated by machine, for GLAM-specific projects, data harvesting and aggregation [13] or to the benefit of hacker/makers and social networks users. Nevertheless, the status and the management of these “new” metadata are still open questions: They are computer-generated (while catalog records are human creation) and susceptible to regular replay (AI is evolving at a frenetic pace); They can be massive (one catalog record for a newspaper title/millions of atomic data for its illustrations dataset); An interoperability standard for expressing them is missing (e.g. IBM and Google use different classification taxonomies). At the same time, the maturity of modern AI techniques in image processing encourages their integration into the standard DLs toolbox. Their results, even imperfect, help to make visible and searchable large quantities of illustrations. But the industrialization of an enrichment workflow will have to cope with various challenges, mainly related to the diversity of the digital collections: neither illustration detection in documents nor deep learning for classification can generalize well on such a large spectrum of materials. Anyway, we can imagine that the conjunction of this abundance and a favorable technical context will open a new field of investigation for digital humanist researchers in the short term and will offer image retrieval services for all categories of users.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/yTJB2Ud9RYHlaR\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/hybrid-image-retrieval-in-digital-libraries-by-jeanphilippe-moreux-europeanatech-conference-2018\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hybrid Image Retrieval in Digital Libraries by Jean-Philippe Moreux &amp; Guillaume Chiron - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018\">Hybrid Image Retrieval in Digital Libraries by Jean-Philippe Moreux &amp; Guillaume Chiron - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong></div>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Datta R., Joshi D., Li, J., Wang J., “Image Retrieval: Ideas, Influences, and Trends of the New Age”, ACM Transactions on Computing Surveys, 2008.

                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Infrastructure for sustainable collaboration; New routes to funding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A growing body of open source software (OSS) supports cultural and scientific heritage organizations, and while some initiatives have been successful at creating sustainable programs, others have struggled to determine what strategies will work once grant funding ends or other major pivots are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, to deepen the cultural and scientific heritage field’s understanding of sustainability and encourage OSS programs to share and learn from each other, <a href=\"https://www.lyrasis.org\" target=\"_blank\">LYRASIS</a> convened a national meeting of OSS stakeholders with support from the<a href=\"https://www.imls.gov/\" target=\"_blank\"> Institute of Museum and Library Services </a>(IMLS). The “<a href=\"http://lyrasisnow.org/tag/it-takes-a-village/\" target=\"_blank\">It Takes a Village: Open Source Software Sustainability Models</a>” forum was held on October 4-5, 2017. The goal of the project and forum was to develop a guidebook for new and existing OSS initiatives to strengthen planning, promotion, and assessment of sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with an advisory group, ITAV project co-directors Laurie Gemmill Arp, LYRASIS Director of Collections Services and Community Supported Software, and Megan Forbes, CollectionSpace Program Manager, invited individuals representing 27 OSS initiatives to the forum for a total of 49 participants. Diverse perspectives were sought by including a mix of program, governance, community (users), and technical leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ITAV team assumed that while there is no single approach to sustainability, there may be common threads among programs that would lead to mutual needs and strategies for meeting those needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the forum, background information was collected from the invited OSS programs to provide context for discussions. Information was collected in such areas as mission and purpose of the OSS, date of first and most recent releases, size and make-up of the user community, size of the development community, development management processes, governance structure, and current sources of financial support. In addition to providing a means for sharing information among participants, the background survey responses inspired directions and themes for the forum discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the forum and survey were combined with other resources and shaped into a Sustainability Guidebook published in February 2018. Freely available via a CC license, the Guidebook creates a framework for evaluating sustainability using a combination of lifecycle phases and sustainability facets. The lifecycle phases, which are repeated for and revolve around each facet, include: Getting Started; Growing; and Stable, but not Static. There are many elements that go into OSS sustainability, but during discussions, most participants coalesced around four main facets: Governance, Technology, Resources, and Community Engagement. For each phase in each facet, the Guidebook identifies goals, characteristics and common roadblocks; provides guidance for moving programs to the next phase; and highlights case studies and additional resources to help programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The effects of the project and framework can be seen in short, intermediate, and long-term impacts. We were gratified to see short term impact immediately. One of the benefits of the project was bringing together people representing different programs and perspectives for sharing, networking, and potential collaborations. Many of the forum participants found meeting others at different phases in their programs extremely valuable. Some participants already knew each other but appreciated the opportunity to focus on OSS sustainability in a concentrated way without the distractions or conflicting priorities of a larger conference. 100% of forum participants indicated that discussions at the forum would be considered in their program’s plans for the future. Specific feedback included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>“This has helped us assess where we are and how best to move forward…We have all been a little siloed in our approaches, thinking we were the only ones in a space, and so (it) will be good for others to see that there is experience to tap into and build on.”&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>“I could hardly believe that I was in a room with so many people who were working (on) or who had solved the challenge with sustaining open source software, some of them several times. It was like discovering a previously unknown discipline or profession of practitioners who were focused and experienced at solving the exact challenges we face and lose sleep over.”</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The intermediate and long-term impact comes from the framework itself. By providing tools for programs to identify the current lifecycle phase of each facet of their work and then focus on the details of specific facets, programs will be better able to identify strategies for moving forward, perform self-evaluations of sustainability, and establish connections within and outside of their community to enable resource sharing and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have had feedback from many project participants that they are sharing the Guidebook with their communities and finding it valuable:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\"The ITAV Guidebook is an invaluable tool for institutions understanding Open Source Software Development and the stages of growth and development their project and community will go through. It has been very useful and highly informative to the community, institutions and leaders of SimplyE in their planning efforts.\"&nbsp;– James English, SimplyE</li>\r\n    <li>“The VIVO project has been exploring ways to engage our governance group members in operational tasks for VIVO, and the ITAV guidebook came along at exactly the right time for our project. It’s reassuring to see that our project is undergoing a transition that seems typical for other OSS communities and I know we’ll benefit from the collective wisdom and best practices provided by the guidebook.”- Julia Trimmer, VIVO</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The beginnings of the long-term impact are already visible in the eight months since the Guidebook was published. During that time, multiple programs that did not participate in the forum have approached us about the framework and how to implement it with their programs. The team has worked to identify additional needs within the field for processes and tools that can be adapted to support a programs ongoing and continuous focus on sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/ITAV_SustainabilityGraphicimg.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another long-term impact will be seen outside the realm of OSS. While created to evaluate OSS programs, it has become clear through discussions and presentations that the model can be used as a more general sustainability evaluation tool. All programs and projects have sustainability needs; all need to make decisions about their future around governance, community engagement, and human, financial, and technology resources. The ITAV model has proven applicable and useful for strategizing and framing discussions around other (non-OSS) collaborative initiatives led by LYRASIS, such as the <a href=\"http://orcid-us.org\" target=\"_blank\">ORCID US Community</a>. The framework could also be beneficial for granting agencies, both in the evaluation of program sustainability plans and as a planning resource for grantees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project and resulting Guidebook were intended to serve as a practical source to help OSS programs serving cultural and scientific heritage organizations plan for long term sustainability, ensuring that commitment and resources will be available at levels sufficient for the software to remain viable and effective for as long as it is needed. We have been gratified to hear that it is serving those needs and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/gyOxmVTRt5Rbcc\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/it-takes-a-village-oss-models-of-sustainability-themes-future-directions-by-laurie-arp-europeanatech-conference-2018\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"It Takes a Village: OSS Models of Sustainability - Themes &amp; Future Directions by Laurie Arp - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018\">It Takes a Village: OSS Models of Sustainability - Themes &amp; Future Directions by Laurie Arp - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong></div>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guidebook, along with more information about advisory group members and participating programs, is available at <a href=\"http://www.lyrasis.org/itav\" target=\"_blank\">www.lyrasis.org/itav</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Opening up and reaching out; Infrastructures for secure, trustable and shareable content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, has been around since 2001 as the only non profit in the top 10 of most visited websites in the world. For many, it is a first stop to find information online. Less people know that Wikipedia is part of a larger ecosystem of over a dozen interoperable <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Complete_list_of_Wikimedia_projects\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia projects</a>, including <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiktionary\" target=\"_blank\">Wiktionary</a> (a free dictionary), <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikivoyage\" target=\"_blank\">Wikivoyage</a> (a free travel guide), <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikisource\" target=\"_blank\">Wikisource</a> (a platform for digitized source materials), and the underlying open source wiki software MediaWiki. All these projects share a common vision: Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/Wikimedia_logo_family_complete-2013.svg.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: The ecosystem of Wikimedia projects. CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported, via Wikimedia Commons</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikimedia projects are community- and volunteer-driven, they are non-profit (funded by small donations from individual donors around the world and free of advertisements), they are editable by anyone, and they collect and distribute information that may be freely re-used, also for commercial purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the perspective of cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons </a>and <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Wikidata</a> are probably among the most impactful Wikimedia platforms. Wikimedia Commons was launched in 2004 and serves as Wikimedia's repository of media files. These more than 50 million files - mainly images, but also an increasing number of videos, audio files, digitized publications and 3D files - illustrate Wikipedia articles and other Wikimedia projects, and are re-used by many external platforms and applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/fashion-commons-screenshot.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2: A small selection of media files on Wikimedia Commons, uploaded as part of Europeana Fashion.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikidata, Wikimedia's youngest sister project, was founded in 2012 and provides a generalized knowledge base of free, multilingual linked and structured data that is integrated in platforms as diverse as Wikimedia itself, OpenStreetMap, Mac iOS, VIAF, and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/viaf-screenshot.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 3: VIAF, the Virtual International Authority File's <a href=\"https://viaf.org/viaf/44296277/\" target=\"_blank\">entry on French art historian and curator Françoise Cachin</a>, with links to external databases, including Wikidata.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the mid-2000s, heritage institutions around the world have worked together with Wikimedia communities to share their knowledge and collections. Such <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM\" target=\"_blank\">GLAM-Wiki collaborations</a> are inspired by the very closely aligned missions of the Wikimedia movement and cultural institutions: both want to share knowledge about our common culture and history as broadly as possible. Wikimedia projects allow cultural institutions to reach very broad audiences, to be present where people actually look for information, and to host digital representations of their collections on platforms that are commons-based and have proven to be quite persistent. But most importantly, Wikimedia projects engage heritage collections with very active, passionate communities of culture-loving volunteers who provide a lot of added value and give new life to heritage in the broadest sense. Over the years, many cultural institutions have developed GLAM-Wiki projects with Wikimedia communities on Wikipedia, have made their digitized collections available via Wikimedia Commons and used Wikidata to support their own Linked Open Data projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like numerous other organizations, Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/working-with-wikimedia\" target=\"_blank\">actively engages with Wikimedia</a> and has embedded these activities in its organization through a dedicated staff member (generally called a 'Wikimedian in Residence'). <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/liam-wyatt\" target=\"_blank\">Liam Wyatt</a>, Europeana's Wikimedia coordinator, has initiated and mentored diverse active collaborations between Europeana and the Wikimedia communities, including campaigns and collaborations around Europeana Fashion, World War I, the Europeana Art History Challenge, and its migration vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short video explaining the Europeana Art History Challenge (2016) held on Wikidata and other Wikimedia projects. CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past years, the cultural sector has been increasingly dedicating efforts to Linked Open Data. It is a recurring theme in many collaboration projects and at conferences, including <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech 2018</a>. Public data providers now take concrete steps to build bridges between silos of digital data, and the heritage sector increasingly dedicates itself to building the integrated library, archive, and museum of humanity together. Publicly funded aggregation platforms like Europeana and civil society initiatives like the Wikimedia movement play a pivotal role here as mutually reinforcing data hubs. In this landscape, Wikidata offers a generic, multilingual and networked knowledge base. It interlinks vocabularies that are widely used in the heritage sector. Concepts on Wikidata (people, places, subjects…) are extensively mapped to widely used databases like VIAF, to authorities managed by national libraries and the heritage sector at large, to the Getty Institute's heritage vocabularies and, interestingly, also to more informal online knowledge platforms such as Quora and MusicBrainz. This makes Wikidata a powerful tool for disambiguation of concepts and as connective tissue for the Linked Open Data web. Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/get-your-vocabularies-in-wikidata\" target=\"_blank\">recommends its data providers to link to Wikidata as well</a>; mapping institutions' vocabularies with Wikidata makes correct integration of their data in Europeana easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/instruments-screenshot.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 4: A small selection of musical instruments on Wikidata, shown in Spanish, linked to the Hornbostel-Sachs classification and MIMO vocabulary for musical instruments. Link to query</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017-19, Wikimedia Commons will <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data\" target=\"_blank\">be converted to structured data</a>. Until present, files on Commons were only described in plain text (Wikitext), but starting from early 2019, Wikimedia Commons will be enhanced with metadata from Wikidata. This integration opens many perspectives for supporting cultural heritage institutions and aggregators like Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/Full_page_mockup_of_camel_file_page.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 5: Design mockup of structured data from Wikidata integrated in Wikimedia Commons, November 2018. Pam Drouin (WMF), CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, structured data makes the media files on Wikimedia Commons fully machine-readable and 'linked', so that they become morebetter discoverable and re-usable, also in complex external applications and in search engines. Importantly, integration with Wikidata also brings advanced multilinguality to Wikimedia Commons. Each concept ('item') on Wikidata has 'labels' in many languages; the Wikimedia volunteer communities proactively translate these labels. By tagging media files with these multilingual concepts, they become discoverable in many more languages than was possible with the originally provided metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/sandra/crotos-screenshot.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 5: A selection of artworks included in the Europeana Art History Challenge, with Wikidata descriptions and titles shown in Swedish.

                subtitle: 'Kerstin Wendt, Kitodo'
                anchortitle: Kitodo
                templates: body
                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Digitisation and digital durability, Infrastructure for sustainable collaboration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kitodo.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Kitodo</a> is an open source software suite to support the digitisation of cultural assets for Libraries, Archives, Museums and Documentation centers of all sizes. The <a href=\"http://https://github.com/Kitodo\" target=\"_blank\">Kitodo software</a> covers a broad range of aspects in the digitisation process - from the production of scans and metadata to a flexible presentation on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/kitodo1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Kitodo tools and its main Features</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the workflow tool ‘Kitodo.Production’ you will define a project in general - connected with the setup of a workflow with an individual list of workflow steps according to your Institutional needs. In the user administration area, every user will be connected with their specific projects and task in the workflow. A workflow management and role concept helps you to manage many projects simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core of Kitodo.Production is the highly configurable metadata editor. With this tool, we assign libraries the appropriate structure types to the different parts of a book – for example, Title page, Table of contents and chapters/articles with important metadata e.g. a Title. The job in the environment of Kitodo. Production is completed with the export of METS/MODS files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitodo.Production is programmed as a web application in Java and can be used as a conventional web application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitodo. Presentation is built as an extension in TYPO3 combined with a solr Index. The plugin concept for typical elements like hitlist, table of contents, metadata listing leads to an easy integration in the general website template of your institution. It’s comfortable to manage all configuration tasks in/by a graphical user interface. Finally it’s quite easy to provide other portals by the integrated OAI interface with METS files.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vision of our community - regarding collaboration with service providers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vision for our open source community - based on a management perspective and our IT-strategy:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see digitisation as a task on the agenda in our institutions, that will run for long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to build knowledge within our institution – to anticipate and solve issues on our own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to learn together and support each other. We need sustainable infrastructure – realised within a realistic budget over the years. We would manage the whole digitisation process ourselves and would like to avoid any vendor lock-in. Software is developed along the needs of our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see a variety of IT-topics in all institutions – and the small IT-teams to address them. From the beginning we had an explicit goal, to attract and integrate service providers to our Kitodo community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our way to integrating service providers we lost one of our providers, – we didn’t arrive at a common understanding regarding the planning of the software development. Today we have two companies that have joined the Kitodo community with a strong commitment to open source principles, and to contribute in support and software development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smaller institutions will be able to build a stable digitisation infrastructure with open source tools – with different support levels from full service including hosting to restricted support budgets. At best, all of our activities in the Kitodo community lead to a mixture of independence and support – may be starting with support in installation issues as leading to increasing independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5DtbjkGS2Mg\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Story of our community and Governance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Goobi”-Project – the parent version of Kitodo.Production - started in 2004 as a third party funding project at the Göttingen State and University Library. Other libraries involved in a growing number of digitisation projects adopted this open source approach, Collaborations were started around some common issues and the association was founded in 2012 to organize software development and to enhance the network of experienced professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The association board consists of 5 members – elected every two years in the general meeting. We ask the companies to suggest of their team members to join our board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2017 the library of the Technical University in Berlin dedicated a member of staff part time with the responsibly of a Kitodo association office. Our colleague takes care of important tasks such as coordination of general Kitodo requests, Website Care and supporting the board as well as managing special projects e.g. workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/kitodo2.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We prefer a Release Management independently from a company. Release Management – paid by the association and appointed to an institution every 2 years at the general meeting. And the core statement in our <a href=\"http://https://www.kitodo.org/fileadmin/groups/kitodo/Dokumente/Kitodo_Developer_Guidelines_2017-06.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">developer guidelines</a> is \"All development projects should be publicly documented and must be communicated to a release manager.“</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Activities in the Kitodo community - and an ambitious software project</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to typical mailing within our association board we brainstormed how best to support institutions who have decided to adopt Kitodo and have enough IT-Staff to get started on their own. The Kitodo association office has a list of experienced and committed institutions to get in contact and receive technical advice and where possible on-site practical assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore we regularly offer a detailed technical introduction, this is a 2 day workshop called \"Kitodo for newbies“. The targeted audience are System Administrators and System Librarians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Kitodo-Exchange\" is a new format and it covers the practice and needs of the Kitodo users. We are organizing mutual visits with different institutions to discuss practical subjects in the management of digitisation projects with Kitodo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After more than 13 years, the maintenance and the enhancement of Kitodo.Production got more complicated, so we were very happy about a successful application for third party funding in 2016. The most important goal is the split of the software in a small kernel und a reasonable module architecture with documented interfaces. Kitodo needs a modern and above all a user friendly design that is based on current frontend framework. To enhance the existing role concept the integration of the framework ‘<a href=\"http://https://spring.io/projects/spring-security\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Security</a>’ module architecture will provide extended possibilities to design customized roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One team on the project – experienced in usability research – prepared a comprehensive evaluation including video recording of users doing their everyday tasks. We didn‘t confine our evaluation to Kitodo but went also to institutions where other products are used. The results lead to detailed epics connected to 3 different personas with different tasks in a typical digitisation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will find again a close collaboration with the companies organized in our association – both companies participate by public tenders and will be part of the project until the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Kitodo – key to digital objects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In our library (State and University Library Hamburg) Kitodo is the solid base to bring all our unique cultural heritage to the web. There are no scaling license fees to consider when new ideas arise. Kitodo enables us to manage a lot of projects at the same time and to support smaller institutions in Hamburg like special archives in their digitisation ambitions as we did this summer with several collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/Kh8mXUlnlBt69N\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/kitodo-open-source-community-and-service-providers-hand-in-hand-by-kerstin-wendt-europeanatech-conference-2018\" title=\"Kitodo - open source community and service providers hand in hand by Kerstin Wendt - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018\" target=\"_blank\">Kitodo - open source community and service providers hand in hand by Kerstin Wendt - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong> </div></center>\r\n"

                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Economic benefits of cultural heritage; Social impact of cultural heritage projects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you get people interested in and engaging with digitized cultural heritage content? More specifically, how do you engage the creative community? These question posed by the EU to the cultural heritage sector during FP7 led to a slew of digital-leaning, app-focused projects that believed in the power of innovative digital mobile technologies, big data and interactive platforms. The lense looked towards disruptive tech of the late aughts as being the golden goose for cultural heritage to connect with the silicon valley-esqe creative minds. Projects like Europeana Creative, Apps4Europe and Europeana Space all took great steps to engage the creative sector in Europe through digital technologies. These projects provided invaluable insights into what creatives need from heritage institutes in terms of access. But as far as long-standing viable outputs go, the new products these projects hoped to coach and bring to market rarely left the pilot / prototype stage. Why? Because creating something like a tech start-up is hard. Dedicating focus on innovative digital technologies as the mediator for cultural heritage’s connection with the creative sector is a costly, time-consuming and overall resource-heavy with a payoff that, while when successful: huge; can result in a stockpile of prototypes and alphas with no user base and no hope to revive these obsolescence tools barring an influx of new funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision’s RE:VIVE initiative, a low-tech approach to the creative re-use of digitized cultural heritage materials that uses the varied aspects of electronic music - Europe’s largest and most vibrant creative industry - to bring new perspectives to heritage, generate revenue and encourage new audiences to engage with heritage the way they want to.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/lakker.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Lakker - Struggle &amp; Emerge LP cover (Flooding of Wieringermeer 1945) Image via Rijkswaterstaat</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>RE:VIVE’s goal is to bring together the worlds of electronic music and cultural heritage through the co-production and facilitation of new artistic works that make direct re-use of digitized cultural heritage materials. This includes work such as new records, film scores, live performances and workshops. The initiative puts heritage front and center. The content and context are the core source of inspiration as well being the building blocks out of which the new works are composed. RE:VIVE invites the artists to embrace the collection, to connect with it on a deeper level and manipulate it through their own personal, national and creative lenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initiative’s approach to engaging the creative sector, fostering the re-use of digitized cultural heritage material and raising the profile of digital collections is low-tech through and through. RE:VIVE makes extensive use of readily available innovations and platforms. The innovation comes from the artist’s creativity. And in order to not obfuscate that innovation, RE:VIVE taps into existing familiar channels to deliver the new works. The new music is released and presented in the most traditional and common of methods: physically (vinyl), digitally (YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Spotify etc.) and performatively. Furthermore, the consumption of music can be passive or intently active. From background music to deep-listening, it is up to the listener to decide how much attention they give to the music and the context behind said music. RE:VIVE capitalizes on that user-choice and welcomes it. If a listener is intrigued to find out more about the music and all the context that surrounds it, we make that information available not just on our own platforms, but on music platforms where listeners already go to learn more about their favorite records or artists. But, if someone only listens and never dives deeper, we can take solace knowing that they’re consuming re-used cultural heritage, whether or not they’re aware of it. Using these methods allows RE:VIVE to get straight to the audience and operate on a shoestring budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDnMDVxhCrU\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>But RE:VIVE is not alone in these endeavours. Instead of dedicating resources towards becoming an event promoter, music publisher or record label, RE:VIVE serves as the intermediary. We bring together the archive and the artist and the artist and the publisher. It’s the publisher or promoter that brings the artist to the audiences. By the rules of the transitive property, the archive is also brought to the audiences. Since RE:VIVE can be involved in all the steps, we’re able to ensure that the archival re-use aspect of the projects remains intact. What’s crucial to note though is that the buy-in and commitment from all involved partners is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Releases of new works aside, RE:VIVE also uses low-tech solutions to answer the question of “how to get creatives engaging with heritage materials?”. RE:VIVE curates “sample packs” a collection of openly licensed archival audiovisual material related to certain theme(s) that we make available for electronic music producers. In the electronic music community, sample packs are commonly large sets of downloadable digital files that come pre-packaged, immediately giving an artist a wealth of material to search for inspiration. Following suit, RE:VIVE simply uses WeTransfer as a way for artists to access the material via the RE:VIVE website. It not only is easy and cheap, but it also allows for large amounts of heritage material to reach the creative re-user. To date using this method RE:VIVE as been able to deliver over 500.000 digitized heritage items to users around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RE:VIVE builds on the tireless efforts of open culture advocates, digitization specialists and the countless institutes that make their collections available online both locally and through Europeana. Taking this crucial work, RE:VIVE translates heritage for the creative community. The initiative uses platforms and methods familiar to the end-user because that’s what end-users want and need. Vernacular, branding, partnerships and visibility are all imperative and low-tech. Partnering and working with the creative sector or capitalizing on the added value that artistic interpretation can can provide with helping understand identity and a feeling of “Europeanness” does not need to be expensive, it needs to be human. Communities are built on communication and trust, and once one door opens, it’s only a matter of time before more doors open to new audiences and new users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital exhibitions have their place in the cultural heritage sector, as do apps and interactive platforms. These tools allow for beautiful interfaces and in-depth contextualization. They can gather millions of unique views and raise the profile of any heritage institute. But such breakthroughs are the minority. They’re also expensive, take a considerable amount of time, coordination and require regular technical upkeep to avoid opalescence. The investment and payoff can be overwhelmingly successful or crushingly disappointing because the hardest part of these projects is simply getting audiences to this specific platform. And in terms of the long-term success and sustainability, those initial traffic numbers will inform future activities and inspire further work. If an app falls flat in its first 3 months of deployment any, work that comes after will require more budget which is not always available for heritage institutes. Due to the lack of dedicated personnel and a need to continue developing, platforms fall into desolation, barely hanging on in the digital world. In tech, “vintage” is not cool (hardware excluded). No one revisits a 10-year-old app. Music is timeless. Like the art on the walls of museums or records in vaults, it’s these human works that will live on.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Addressing Societal Challenges; Data quality and retrieval</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.victoria.ac.nz/wtapress\" target=\"_blank\">Wai-te-ata Press </a>is a letterpress printery&nbsp;established in 1962 at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;teaching and research on the history and practice of media technologies, we produce fine press handmade books and experiment with analogue printing of 3-D printed types. We also undertake digital humanities projects working with NZ cultural heritage data. Our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/wai-te-ata-press/qilin\" target=\"_blank\">Qilin</a>&nbsp;project&nbsp;demonstrates the challenges we face and some solutions we have developed for Chinese Optical Character Recognition [OCR], harnessing the innovation potential of next generation engineers and&nbsp;computer scientists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.victoria.ac.nz/wtapress/engagement/chinese-scholars-studio\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese type restoration and scholars’ studio project</a> started in 2016 with the acceptance of <a href=\"https://thespinoff.co.nz/partner/objectspace/16-09-2018/the-single-object-a-metric-tonne-of-chinese-new-zealand-history/\" target=\"_blank\">one tonne of Chinese&nbsp;full-form character lead type</a> that had been in storage in a farmer's field south of Auckland. This type, ordered from Hong Kong, arrived new in Wellington in 1952. It was used to print the <em>New Zealand Chinese Growers Monthly Journal,</em> the organ of the Dominion Federation of New Zealand Chinese&nbsp;Commercial Growers. This journal continued for two decades, linked market gardeners around the country, published&nbsp;local and international news, featured articles on the civic careers of influential growers, and included Cantonese language lessons. At any one time, every Chinese household was said to be reading one of its 700 monthly copies. The journal was digitised by the <a href=\"https://nzchinesejournals.org.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">Auckland City Libraries</a> in collaboration with the Alexander Turnbull Library, funded by the Chinese Poll Tax Heritage Trust and made publicly available. In 2017, those assets were transferred to the National Library of New Zealand for inclusion in their <a href=\"https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/\" target=\"_blank\">PapersPast</a> digital collections. However, since the format did not conform to the existing PapersPast standards there were questions around when this important cultural collection would again see the light of digital day. Challenge number one, therefore, had to do with how to machine read the Chinese types in a journal that mixed both Chinese and Latin letterforms in a complex layout grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenge two was whether we could address the OCR problem by leveraging the existence of the original types which arrived in a disordered state and with characters that over time and frequent use had become worn and illegible. Could we combine the type identification required for sorting, cleaning and cataloguing the collection with parsing the journal's digital images so we would know how many of each character we had and therefore how to design type cases to house them? We had already started to image each of the estimated 300,000 individual type sorts using a high power microscope that also enabled us to assess the condition of the types, but the scale of the operation was proving daunting. Because&nbsp;we wanted to be able to restore and reuse the collection to tell new or little-known stories of Chinese New Zealanders, the types had to be carefully organised for use. The pages for each month's issue were set vertically for Chinese and horizontally for Latin in neat rows with spacing (leading) between the lines, furniture filling out the empty spaces, and all locked into open metal frames called chases so the type didn’t move or fall out. The completed formes were sent to the printer and used to print the journal. These formes were then returned, and the individual characters or sorts replaced (distributed or diss-ed) in the correct type tray, back in the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: From type catalogue</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin2.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2: to metal types set up for last issue of journal</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin3.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 3: to printed newspaper scans</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>To help us solve&nbsp;our interlocked challenges, we proposed the Qilin project as part of Victoria University of Wellington's School of Engineering and Computer Science <a href=\"https://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/Courses/ENGR301_2018T1/Project-07\" target=\"_blank\">third year client-facing programme</a>.&nbsp;We tasked the student team to help by analysing images of the newspaper and needed to devise a pipeline that built in industry capability and international&nbsp;digital cultural heritage standards and protocols. Behind the scenes, we negotiated access to the digital images and permission from the copyright holders, our friends the Growers. Next up was storage options. We had only&nbsp;60GB of data, but we wanted the students to think about cloud storage provision and what that meant for cultural data, sensitive or otherwise. Since we were working simultaneously on another Māori cultural data project, we were acutely aware of issues of data sovereignty. Our first choice was a NZ-based cloud provider but only one currently exists and the timing and scale of the project precluded using it. We then&nbsp;investigated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/cloudstor\" target=\"_blank\">CloudStor</a>, an Australian service, that we could access through our university's <a href=\"https://reannz.co.nz\" target=\"_blank\">REANNZ</a> [Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network] subscription. When the uni&nbsp;severed its&nbsp;connection with REANNZ, the challenge became, where to next? We could have delivered the image files to the students to host locally, but we wanted to future engineer the project and ensure that the students learnt how to call out to a third-party provider and create code that could be resilient in the event of future repository&nbsp;shifts. We finally put the imagery in <a href=\"https://figshare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Figshare</a>&nbsp;- an online digital repository for researchers - in a private collection, in which&nbsp;each issue is a&nbsp;figshare&nbsp;fileset, a set of high res TIFFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the entire publication there were over 2,800 pages delivered in 2,800&nbsp;high resolution scans. This is a large amount of data to process as each page takes a reasonable computer around 7 minutes to process an entire page. Since processing all 2,800 pages sequentially would take about two weeks, we decided to build a system that could process the pages in parallel. After trialing a number of parallel processing options including <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Hadoop</a>, we ended up using <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/cluster-overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Spark</a> which is a framework for processing Big Data. Spark uses a cluster with worker nodes where we could set each worker to process one issue and return the results. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Azure's HDInsight </a>provides Spark in&nbsp;the cloud: we used the free student allocation of NZ$300/month. With 6 students, we could cycle through our allocation, experimenting with ease, and not be constrained by issues of funding or timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To process a page of the newspaper there are a number of steps required; finding the characters printed by the type, turning the characters into a machine-readable format and counting the frequency of each occurrence of character. The first step, layout analysis, was not trivial. The layout of the newspaper changed considerably between pages and issues. There is Chinese text in ads throughout the newspaper which were printed using blocks rather than type; often sections used hybrid scripts and bilingual text. Moreover, character definition varied according to the amount of wear of each character as well as the amount of printing ink applied, thus changing the density of image&nbsp;blackness on the page. We originally tried some prebuilt solutions such as <a href=\"https://opensource.google.com/projects/tesseract\" target=\"_blank\">Google Tesseract</a> layout analysis and <a href=\"https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy\" target=\"_blank\">OCRopus</a>. However, these had very poor accuracy. The approach we finally settled on was using a deep convolutional neural network [CNN] based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43022\" target=\"_blank\">GoogLeNet&nbsp;</a>architecture. It was trained to classify the section our samples were from.&nbsp;We could then run a whole page of the newspaper through the network and use Class Activation Mapping [CAM] to find out where the different sections were in the page of the newspaper.&nbsp;These were combined with colour-coded images that differentiated headings from subheadings from body text. Since different type sizes and sometimes even fonts were used for different sections, this was an important stage in the workflow. However, while it could recognize the different sizes of characters well, it was not as adept at recognising the characters that are in a different font. This ended up not being that much of an issue given the masking causes the outlier characters to become unrecognizable, meaning the OCR solution would not recognise these as characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin4.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 4: Layout challenge</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin5.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 5: Layout analysis</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin6.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 6: Class Activation Mapping</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin61.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 7: combined Prediction Maps for one page</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>For the OCR component we ended up using Google's Tesseract. We attempted to create our own OCR solution that would work better specifically for the Chinese language. However, we were only able to achieve 50% accuracy across 13,000 different characters using training data from unicode fonts via the type catalogue used to order the original metal types. Potentially, we could have achieved higher accuracy scores by reducing the number of characters selected from the newspaper. However, given Tesseract delivered very approximately 80% to 90% accuracy on sections from the newspaper, it was unlikely we could have obtained any&nbsp;better accuracy scores. We generated frequency tables copied from the cluster, for Body, Subheading and Headline. Throughout the process, the outputs were tested by our human expert, Ya-Wen Ho, and refinements were continually iterated for printed type to unicode translation accuracy as well as usability of the tables for our cataloguing and design challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin62.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 8: OCR results</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin7.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 9: Unicode frequency tables</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the eight-month project, the students really helped us to understand the complexity of the challenge we gave them. As an example, we shared scans of the catalogue from the Hong Kong typefoundry. These were the clearest printed images of the physical&nbsp;types we had and furnished&nbsp;a training data set to intermediate between the types and the printed newspaper. The catalogue also provided a key learning experience on how to undertake image rectification and image splitting. The team's code used knowledge of the fixed page format then ran Tesseract OCR on the characters to obtain the&nbsp;unicode values that were critical to distinguishing type frequency in the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge for the team's character checker was&nbsp;the existence of multiple variants of a character.&nbsp;The Taiwanese Ministry of Education dictionary of variant forms documents the character for 眾&nbsp;zhong [a crowd] as historically having 40 variant forms. How could we know if these&nbsp;unicode glyphs existed in our type collection? We turned to the <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch18.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">conceptual model </a>developed by the Unicode Consortium for variant unification of Han ideographic characters.&nbsp;It expresses written elements in terms of three primary attributes: semantic&nbsp;(meaning, function), abstract shape (general form), and actual shape (instantiated, typeface&nbsp;form).&nbsp;As such, it provides a triangulated variable system that could, in future, assist in character disambiguation, particularly for worn types with their inherent legibility problems. This 3D model also returns us to the three-dimensionality of our physical types and where we began this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin8.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 10: Character checker</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin9.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 11: and 3D conceptual model for variant forms</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to having many better ideas of the complexity that exists in our work, the students have prototyped an infrastructure for us to scale out, enabling us to begin action research into Big Data analytic approaches.&nbsp;They have helped us resolve a specific problem, but the trajectory of their solution means transferability to other&nbsp;cultural data contexts and across multiple non-Latin languages. If it also helps rendering an important&nbsp;heritage resource once again available to the public, then we will have achieved one of our public engagement and impact objectives. In the meantime, the project has made us all even more aware of the fragility of our digital resources and the need to prevent them from becoming casualties in the dark archive of the cultural imperium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team's project, Qilin, is online, public&nbsp;and open source: 100% student-led team work.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/qlin/qilin10.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 12: Qilin wrestled</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Wai-te-ata Press wishes to thank the Dominion Federation of New Zealand Chinese Commercial Growers, Auckland City Libraries and the National Library of New Zealand and Alexander&nbsp;Turnbull Libraries.

                subtitle: 'Paul Clough, Information School, University of Sheffield; Peak Indicators, Chesterfield'
                anchortitle: 'Evaluating search in digital cultural heritage'
                templates: body
                body: "<h2>Innovation Agenda Topic: Understanding Users &amp; Content, Digging into data</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluation of search systems has been an active area of interest for decades; however, much of the focus has typically been around assessing system performance based on the quality of search results. Given how information access systems to digital cultural heritage increasingly provide features that allow users to explore and discover content beyond simple search modes, in practice we need to think outside the search box when it comes to evaluating performance and success. This article describes perspectives for evaluating information access to digital cultural heritage within two example systems: PATHS and Europeana. I conclude by suggesting a more holistic view of search evaluation using a broader framework of systems success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evaluation of search in general</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the most common approach to evaluating search is system-oriented where the focus has been to assess algorithmic performance, such as retrieval effectiveness or efficiency. Evaluation is typically performed in batch mode and offline using pre-existing benchmarks, such as Information Retrieval test collections. However, user- or human-oriented approaches are increasingly being used, taking into account the characteristics of users, their contexts and situations, and their interactions with a search system. All of these factors may affect users’ search behaviours and influence their notions of perceived system or search task success. Various methods can be used to evaluate search with people (typically surrogate real end users, such as student volunteers), often following existing HCI approaches, such as task-based comparative evaluation in a usability lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in contrast to offline evaluation methods and lab-based user studies, there has also been increased activity around methods for online evaluation. This approach utilises a fully-functioning system in an operational setting, where traces of user-system interactions from real users undertaking real tasks are analysed and used to infer behaviours, such as success. Such methods are powerful, but require an operational system with sufficient numbers of users. In practice, multiple evaluation methods and activities will take place throughout system development (formative), once an operational system is built (summative) and as the system operates (online).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A challenge for search provision in digital cultural heritage is that systems are often feature-rich to support user engagement and serve a plethora of information needs and search behaviours. This means going beyond simply evaluating the relevance of search results to assessing additional components, such as visualisations and recommendations, and going beyond the system to understanding users’ contexts and needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evaluation of search in PATHS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The PATHS (Personalised Access To cultural Heritage Spaces) project is the first example I consider where the focus of evaluation activities went beyond the search box. PATHS was funded under the European Commission’s FP7 programme and developed methods to support search and discovery in large and heterogeneous cultural heritage collections. The prototype system provided users with various features, such as links to related items, item-level recommendations, a thesaurus based on a data-driven subject hierarchy and collection overview visualisations, to support the user. A summary of PATHS can be found in this EuropeanaTech Insight article.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/paul1.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 1. Summary of evaluation activities in the PATHS project.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to evaluation the retrieval system was just one component of many and Fig. 1 summarises evaluation activities carried out during the project. System design followed a classic user-centred approach to develop requirements and inform the design of prototypes. Each system component was developed independently by different research groups and subsequently integrated into an operational system. Components were evaluated using an appropriate discipline-specific methodology, e.g., recommendation functionality evaluated using techniques from the field of recommender systems. The components were then integrated into a working prototype by software engineers making use of evaluation methods, such as unit testing. The user interface was also developed separately through iterative development of low- and high-fidelity prototypes and testing using lab-based methods. Finally, the integrated prototypes were evaluated using task-based evaluations in both controlled lab-based settings and more naturalistic field trials. Results and user feedback informed future development. More details about evaluating PATHS can be found in (Clough, 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Evaluation of search in Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The second example I consider where search evaluation focused outside the search box is Europeana, specifically work undertaken in the Digital Services Infrastructure, DSI-2 project and improving search for Europeana Collections. Various forms of testing have been carried out within Europeana since 2011, including evaluation of: (i) the user experience; (ii) usability of the user interface; (iii) quality of content and metadata; and (iv) search quality. Juliane Stiller and Vivien provide a comprehensive summary of evaluation activities undertaken over the past decade in their TPDL’17 paper. In the DSI-2 project we developed a framework in which to evaluate search quality (shown in Fig. 2).</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/paul2.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 2. Summary of proposed Europeana search quality framework within DSI-2.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation framework included suggestions for evaluation methods, data collection methods, suitable evaluation criteria and measures, and best practice guidance. Multiple approaches are required to evaluate Europeana and its components during various stages of the development lifecycle: (i) firstly, understanding the user and search context (the information use environment); (ii) secondly, the development of components and subsequent integration into the operational Europeana system; and (iii) the post-implementation stage of monitoring and improving search (e.g., relevance ranking tuning). The focus on users and the wider context of information use (e.g., typical search tasks) was important for evaluation in the design of appropriate evaluation instruments in subsequent stages. For example, understanding and categorising users’ search tasks informed the design of task-based evaluations (see our TPDL’17 paper describing who uses Europeana and why); analysis of search logs provided suitable queries for test collection design. More details of the work can be found in D6.3 the search improvement plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>General framework for search success</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous examples of search evaluation have gone beyond focusing on the search box and taking into account users and context of information use. In practice, understanding system success and coordinating evaluation activities and aggregating their findings can be difficult due to diversity of methods used and multiple stakeholders. A more holistic view of search evaluation needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech Insight/Images/ITF/paul3.png\" /></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<center>Figure 3. Search evaluation within a framework for evaluating information systems success.</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Fig. 3 shows one possible framework based on the ‘classic’ view of information systems success as proposed by William DeLone &amp; Ephraim McLean. In this view success of the system centres on user satisfaction (6) which in turn will drive system use (5) or intention to use the system (4). User satisfaction with the system will be based on data/information quality (1), system quality (2) and the quality of the provided service (3). The benefits of using the system and users’ satisfaction will result in improved task performance, engagement with the system, learning etc. Parts of the framework in Fig. 3 clearly interrelate and impact on success. Having a broader view beyond the search box and sharing our experiences with evaluation helps us to think outside the search box.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/6dxgLlWYL4WzhO\" width=\"595\" height=\"485\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"> <strong> <a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/evaluating-search-in-digital-cultural-heritage-thinking-outside-the-search-box-by-paul-clough-europeanatech-conference-2018\" title=\"Evaluating Search in Digital Cultural Heritage: Thinking Outside the (Search) Box by Paul Clough - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018\" target=\"_blank\">Evaluating Search in Digital Cultural Heritage: Thinking Outside the (Search) Box by Paul Clough - EuropeanaTech Conference 2018</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong> </div></center>\r\n\r\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Work undertaken within the PATHS and Europeana DSI-2 projects involving many individuals.

This is partly why we don’t think the appreciation for culture needs any further justification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing about digital culture is that it's an incredible way to enhance our capacity to generate content. You can compress in the space of a laptop what previously was a recording studio. The consequence is that the production of content has become so easy and so affordable, that basically everybody does it, the sharp separation between authorship and audience is blurred. And we are just starting to appreciate the consequence of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future is not just about more content, but about new types of content and expression. I can take a good photo with my cell phone, but what’s more exciting is seeing what a certain type of people, using their cell phones in a certain type of moment, in a certain circumstance, collectively produce. And this is interesting from the cultural point of view, because the production of meaning is becoming less individualised and more collective. So we are entering a new phase, in which we have to rethink most of the categories through which we have evaluated the meaning and the importance of content creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move into the next phase of the digital transformation of society, we need to acknowledge that culture plays a much bigger role in the things we deem important than is often thought. If we can show - and we can - that people who have a higher level of cultural participation do more of the things that policymakers want citizens to do - like recycling - then we can connect cultural heritage to the established policy agenda, and secure our place in the digital transformation of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

Despite the incredible human potential in the web, we see that knowledge is locked down more and more each day. Our human, political (and even commercial) interactions are becoming more acrimonious, strained and manipulated. To make sense of this world, we need to look to our past, and Europeana has been a leader in enabling this kind of powerful, delightful and essential inquiry. Our cultural artifacts and artistic works give us context for the modern era - they bear witness, offer criticism, disarm with satire, and speak truth to power. They are much more than art. They show who we were as a society and who we aspire to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given this vital importance, in an era that is so deeply in need of the context, criticism and truth that culture can reveal, we need those works to be accessible. The tools to provide access to culture have never been more powerful or affordable, and each day they are getting better. The only things we lack are the will to use them and the means to implement them for the public good. Working in collaboration, we can realise this ambitious goal, as we have done together many times before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And so again, to our past we look to find our future: together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The world race for artificial intelligence goes in parallel with a global competition to capture big data fluxes. The rationale is simple. In the new artificial intelligence paradigm, algorithms can be transparently published and shared as common goods. The real value lies in the data to train them. In this gold rush for training data, the largest companies in the US and in Asia enjoy a dominant position as they mediate and therefore capture a massive daily flow of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Europe has an asset that may change the rules of the game: kilometres of archive and library shelves, immense collections from museums and other cultural heritage sources and a solidly established know-how for interpreting and analysing them. These records, being mapped by Europeana, are not just important for preserving heritage of the past, they document billions of pieces of information about our world today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe is about to become the leader in the extraction and modelling of this ‘Big Data of the Past’, transforming it into a source of new knowledge. This will impact not only education, creative industries, policymaking and environmental modelling but will also permit the emergence of a new kind of Artificial Intelligence with wider temporal horizons. This future AI, not focused on the pulsations of the present, but trained on millennia of multilingual historical records could lead to a powerful new understanding of our world and its long-term patterns. It will act as a simulation engine for possible futures, thus offering a unique advantage to research institutions, decision-makers and businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AI race is not lost. It has just begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Like society as a whole, the Bibliothèque nationale de France has, over the last several years, undergone a transformation linked to both the development of digital technology and the emergence of new practices and a new culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries are, by nature, familiar with those methodologies. Their missions, their action modes and their vocabulary were already that of digital technology before that technology had become omnipresent. They have always been in the business of organising knowledge and, to that end, using the notion of files, referencing and cataloguing to create close proximity between two artificially distinguished worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, future changes will be major ones. The change in scale, from the point of view of data and resources as well as the point of view of collaborative perspectives, makes us look beyond standard institutional stakeholders. The change of attitude of the audience, now more volatile and eager to explore, reuse, make and share its own content, leads us to conceive new services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with a mass of information, the development of digital media and a prospective vision too often based on a marketing approach, libraries must also affirm and cultivate their differences. In a globalised and increasingly collaborative knowledge economy, they must of course innovate, and be absolutely up-to-date with regard to providing the best innovative tools. However, they must also assert their roots in a centuries-old policy of collecting and preserving cultural heritage, hold high their sense of responsibility in data production, and stand for what they are - key stakeholders in producing and disseminating knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years from now, libraries will be transformed and offer new services and will thus become even more powerful and reassuring in a complex democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Over the past decade, the Wikimedia community has been a devoted partner to cultural institutions, enabling their digital collections to reach billions of people through Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia. Now, we have an even more significant opportunity in Wikidata - a sort of ‘Wikipedia of data’ that can bridge curatorial contexts, lexicons and languages. Weaving a connective web of linked open data across digital siloes, we can help individual institutions, and platforms like Europeana, to collaborate on building the integrated library, archive and museum of humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s already an audacious goal to connect the world’s institutional collections. But connecting alone isn’t enough: it merely replicates pre-digital knowledge structures, without interrogating what is missing. That is why I believe we must explore what it means to integrate digital culture with social action - intentionally expanding the cultural record. The Wikimedia movement is an ally to anyone seeking to close these knowledge gaps, and we are inspired by the powerful examples of collaboration that we already see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see this in our community’s work with professional ethnographers to document folk traditions of the Carpathian Mountains, or their joint campaign with Europeana to curate and enrich collections to mark the centenary of World War One. We see it in our Argentinian community’s collaboration with Parque De La Memoria to document the 30,000 people illegally detained or disappeared during the nation’s rule by military junta. We see it in our Indian communities’ work with libraries and universities to digitise works in Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and other widely-spoken but digitally underrepresented languages. We see it in our Brazilian community’s effort to digitally reconstruct the tragically lost Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the future of digital culture: individuals, institutions and open knowledge advocates working together to build an inclusive, resilient digital commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-years\"><img alt=\"Discover more perspectives on the future of digital culture from our ten cultural innovators\" src=\"/files/Images/Ten perspectives - tenth anniversary/10perspectives_banner_blog.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n"

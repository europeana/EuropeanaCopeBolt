        title: 'Thematic Collections'
        intro: "<p>Thematic\_collections take\_audiences deep\_into Europeana Collections by presenting some of the\_best material on a set topic in an easy-to-explore showcase.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>These inspiring thematic collections bring unique and trustworthy resources from the whole\_range of cultural heritage institutions\_into one place. Instead of doing their own searching, audiences can simply browse and follow their own instinct and interest. And because these resources are often available for reuse, people\_can share and create new things with them too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's thematic collections are curated, selected and developed by cultural heritage partners throughout Europe. As well as the search and browse opportunities that you find on Europeana Collections, partners provide subject-specific editorial to bring the collection to life and to get audiences even more deeply involved. Developing a thematic collection is a great opportunity for partners who wish to use\_the Europeana platform to its fullest to\_reach wider audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By segmenting our collections thematically, we make it easier for people to find what they're interested in and give them a better experience in the process. It also means we can reach out to specific communities and ask them to get involved - for example by\_improving\_our data with\_annotations, corrections, and contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Art\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Art is a thematic collection that brings together artworks from institutions across Europe, including paintings, drawings, and prints. It is supported by an external <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-art-history-advisory-board\" target=\"_blank\">Advisory Board</a>. Europeana Art features a variety of regularly updated editorial content, including blog posts, online exhibitions, and highlighted collections. Europeana Art editorial activity is focussed around thematic campaigns (‘seasons’) which promote high-quality art from partners across Europe. The purpose of seasons is to encourage partner collaboration and inspire audience engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Fashion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Fashion showcases hundreds of thousands of records from\_40 institutions across Europe, including historical dresses, accessories and catwalk photographs. It is managed by the <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion Heritage Association</a>. It features curated editorial content through blog posts, online exhibitions and highlighted content. Its dedicated landing page design focuses on promoting editorial content and encouraging audiences\_to browse content (with less focus on searching). Specific fashion-related facets (such as designer, item type, technique) help people\_filter their searches to find specific content. A date filter allows people to narrow searches to find content relating to time periods.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Music</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Music is a thematic collection of more than 250,000 music-related resources\_from around Europe, including music recordings, pieces of sheet music, musical instruments and more. Europeana Music features curated editorial content through blog posts, online exhibitions, and content highlights. Managed initially by the <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Sounds</a> consortium, editorial plans for Europeana Music are arranged in a calendar and rotated by member organizations on a monthly basis. Under the banner of Europeana Sounds, the\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/radio.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Radio</a> project was developed\_giving people a way to discover and listen to the music from Europeana Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Photography\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Photography thematic collection, with\_over 1 million objects, opens up Europe’s rich photographic heritage to offer a curated and engaging experience for both professional users and the general public. Curated by the\_<a href=\"http://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a>,\_it offers data providers the opportunity for their cultural collections to be more visible, seen in context with collections of other data providers and in exhibitions, blogs, and other editorial outputs. This collection’s exclusivity and versatility represent and showcase many well-known photographic gems, as well as lesser-known or previously undisclosed collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana 1914-1918</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918\_is a thematic collection of stories, films and historical material about the First World War from across Europe. It brings together content and resources from three major European projects, each dealing with different types of First World War material. The result is an archive that allows the national collections of libraries to sit beside personal stories and treasures and important film archives. Since 2011, Europeana 1914-1918 has worked with partners in 22 countries to hold family history roadshows to which\_the public bring their documents, artifacts, and stories from the First World War to be can be scanned or photographed and added to the archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Migration\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The\_Europeana Migration\_collection brings together digital collections dedicated to the theme of migration to, from and within Europe, sourced from both cultural heritage institutions and the public. The collection will grow in size and scope throughout 2018 as new content is added from collection events, online submissions, the collections of dedicated migration museums, and both existing and new Europeana data partners.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Online Exhibitions'
        intro: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Exhibitions</a>\_is a place for you,\_our partner, to tell vivid stories about your collections and to curate your own narrative!</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Collections</a> we provided you with the space to showcase your content. Now, we are providing you with a space to share your knowledge. This is your chance to bring the highlights of your collection to life by adding interesting information and creating stories that can be viewed in a new, visually appealing format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have an idea for an online exhibition? Get in touch with our Exhibitions Coordinator:\_<a href=\"mailto:maggy.szynkielewska@europeana.eu\">maggy.szynkielewska@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment we are focusing on exhibitions related to one of these thematic collections:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Art (e.g.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style\">Art Nouveau - Universal Style</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Fashion (e.g.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/past-to-present\">Past to Present - Fashion Reinterpretations</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Music (e.g.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/recording-and-playing-machines\">Recording and Playing Machines</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Photography (e.g.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/industrial-photography-in-the-machine-age\">Industrial Photography in the Machine Age</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>World War I (e.g.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/sausages-and-cigars-for-christmas\">Sausages and Cigars for Christmas</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Please note: Exhibitions connected with the thematic collections will have our priority. However, if you feel you have a story worth sharing, which goes beyond an existing thematic collection or crosses over between thematic collections, we are also keen to explore this with you. Either way, Maggy would like to speak to you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Selecting your items</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think quality not quantity. Be selective - a single exhibition should have 10-20 images. Each image has to be at least 1200px wide.\_You can also embed audio and video materials, but currently there is no display for text files. 80% of your items must be available via Europeana Collections or will be shortly.\_Please make sure that the materials you want to\_use are copyright free (PD, CC0) or licensed in a way that allows us to include them in the exhibition (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">Creative Commons licenses</a>: CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA). In case they are not, you need to acquire in time copyright holder’s permission to use those materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Writing the text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your exhibition text should be light, engaging and informative. The best size of the exhibition is between 1.000 and 3.000 words. Don’t forget that your exhibition will be viewed by a general audience as well as those with deeper understanding of the subject. Please make sure your story can stand alone as an engaging narrative, independent of the visual items.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What will Europeana do?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>We will provide support and guidance in the process of publishing.</li>\r\n    <li>We will promote your exhibition through our appropriate channels (social media, newsletter, etc).</li>\r\n    <li>We will provide you with statistics about the traffic on your exhibition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Europeana won't be responsible for proofreading or editing your text. Although, we reserve the right to make editorial changes before publishing your exhibition. If your exhibition does not meet our Exhibitions requirements, we may ask to change it and therefore postpone previously agreed launch dates.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'New data partner'
        intro: "<p>Welcome to Europeana! As a new data partner, who has never published in Europeana before, you will have plenty of questions. Don’t worry. You can find all the answers you need below.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>After you have decided to benefit from publishing data in Europeana Collections, the next step is understanding the basics of how to publish in Europeana, and then how we go about building Europeana Collections. Let’s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Europeana? And what isn’t it?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is the platform for the digital cultural heritage of Europe. Europeana is neither a library nor a digitisation centre. We work with you after your collections have been digitised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Does Europeana house content?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The database behind Europeana Collections doesn’t contain the cultural heritage content, i.e. the digital objects from your collections. Europeana publishes the metadata, which are the machine-readable descriptions of the cultural heritage objects that you have digitized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you continue your journey, please answer the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is your collection digitized, do you have e.g. scans or digital photographs of your collection items?</li>\r\n    <li>Is the description of your collection digitized, do you have data about your collection items digitally available?</li>\r\n    <li>Is the quality and scope of your digital collection suitable for publication in Europeana Collections? - On <a href=\"/page/what-kind-of-content-is-europeana-looking-for\">this page</a> you find help to answer these three questions, or take a look at our <a href=\"/post/europeana-content-strategy\">content strategy</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Is your digital collection accessible online? Can you give access or export the digital descriptions of your collection items in a standardized way?\_</li>\r\n    <li>Is your metadata describing your digital objects available without restrictions for reuse? On <a href=\"/page/creative-commons-zero-public-domain-dedication\">this page</a> you find more about what this means, and <a href=\"/page/the-data-exchange-agreement\">here</a> you can find out how we agree on the use of your metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>Do you know the copyright status of the digital object and if and how you are authorized to share an object by the rights holder? On <a href=\"/page/selecting-a-rights-statement\">this page</a> you’ll find out what you need to know to select a rights statement for your digital objects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If the answer to the above questions is ‘yes’, you’re ready to continue your journey.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who do you deal with next?\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a small team based in The Hague, it would be impossible for us to interact directly with all 3,500 institutions at every stage. That’s why we’ve set up a network of partner aggregators. It’s the aggregators who do the data harvesting from cultural heritage organizations. They also help to model the data, expand the network of organizations, help out with copyright queries and much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We work with three types of aggregator:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>National aggregator, whose scope is defined by a specific country or region and whose contributors are situated within that country or region;</li>\r\n    <li>Domain aggregator, whose scope is defined by a particular industry sector (such as museums, archives or libraries) and whose contributors are located in more than one country;\_</li>\r\n    <li>Thematic aggregator, whose scope is defined by a particular topic or theme (such as fashion or food and drink) and whose contributors are located in more than one country.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We will shortly provide a list of all aggregators with their main contacts on this page. For the time being, please contact us via email, so we can help you to find the most suitable publication route for your digital collections.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Reasons to share your data on Europeana Collections'
        intro: "<p>By contributing your data to Europeana Collections, we can help you to reach a wider audience. Together, we can transform the world with culture and make our shared heritage more accessible to everyone.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In terms of data quality, the more you give, the more you get. The benefits of publishing data in Europeana Collections may include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Join a unique digital resource where thousands of cultural institutions – from regional archives to national museums – share their own collections.</li>\r\n    <li>Showcase your own collections in blogs, galleries, online exhibitions and campaigns and benefit from Europeana's active follower base on social media to reach millions of citizens across Europe.</li>\r\n    <li>Reach new audiences and make your collections available for reuse within research, education and the creative industries.</li>\r\n    <li>Make your data compliant with the Europeana Data Model, which has become an international standard for cultural heritage institutions such as EDM is in use at the Digital Public Library of America and the German Digital Library.</li>\r\n    <li>Make your collections more accessible and usable by applying the <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/\">internationally interoperable rights statements</a> that we’ve worked on with our global partners.</li>\r\n    <li>Make your data available through the Europeana API. It can then be viewed, shared and used in more ways, reaching a much larger audience.</li>\r\n    <li>Communicate with like-minded industry professionals of the Europeana Network Association to solve common issues.</li>\r\n    <li>Make the most out of your data by working with experts on data modelling, copyright and licensing.</li>\r\n    <li>Benefit from Europeana’s active role in raising international standards on content-sharing.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Success stories</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We publish more than 53 million data from over 3,500 museums, galleries, libraries, and archives across Europe. Many data providers are enjoying a rewarding experience, as a result of their active participation. For example, a landscape by Zolo Palugyay was showcased throughout Europeana’s many channels. 'It is perhaps one of the most visible artworks from our collection online,’ said Michal Čudrnák, head of digital collections at the Slovak National Gallery</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Júlia Katona, from the Schola Graphidis Art Collection in Budapest, saw the opportunity in contributing data. 'The content of the whole Art Nouveau season looks great and very rich,'\_she said. 'I am happy to be part of it with our collection.'\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nHere are a couple of more detailed case studies, from both small and large partners.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Skoklosters - from three small museums to millions of views</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is arguably even more important for smaller museums that don’t already have an international reputation and audience. The example of the <a href=\"http://lsh.se/en\">Livrustkammaren och Skoklosters slott med Stiftelsen Hallwylska museet</a> in Sweden shows how we can benefit smaller institutions with a more modest budget. About 300,000 people combined visit these three museums each year. But since their data is published online, their collections are shared all over the world and received millions of views in total.<br><a href=\"/post/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">Our paper</a> investigates how they have achieved this. It also includes an interview with museum chief Karin Nilsson.<br>\r\n‘We wanted the collection to be as open as possible,” she said. “This felt like the right thing to do. With this in mind we picked the licences that best fitted with our mission.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rijksmuseum - ambitious and game-changing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Making the public domain collection of this Dutch museum available online without restrictions was <a href=\"/post/democratising-the-rijksmuseum\">no easy feat</a>. Now, however, anyone can view, download, copy, remix, print, and use over 150,000 high resolution images for any purpose they can think of. The Rijksmuseum’s material is now reaching a greater audience and is widely used in all kinds of online platforms such as Wikimedia Commons, Kennisnet and Artstor.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ‘<a href=\"/post/the-problem-of-the-yellow-milkmaid\">The Case of the Yellow Milkmaid</a>’, you can find out why the museum chose to publish high-resolution images of its most famous originals with open metadata. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get started</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributing your content to Europeana Collections gives you the opportunity to think about how you want people to view, share and use your material. \_And we’ll support you every step of the way.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are new to Europeana and want to explore how to publish your collections, you can start your journey right now.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you already have material in Europeana Collections then now is the time to explore what else you can do.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are plenty of good outcomes waiting on the other side.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Aggregation class - handled through ore:Aggregation - refers to ‘the set of related resources in the Europeana system about one particular provided object from one provider. These are either created by the provider or generated from the metadata by the Europeana system’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This class acts as the One Ring in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings\">The Lord of the Rings</a> novels, since it has the responsibility of ruling several elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aggregation class is responsible for linking <strong>edm:ProvidedCHO</strong> with its related <strong>edm:WebResource(s</strong>) and its <strong>edm:isShownAt</strong> - the data provider’s website. Most of the time, that’s the institution in charge of the item, and consequently the producer of this data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also holds wider information, such as the licence applied to the record, or the name of its provider and data provider. Such data is critical for consistent Europeana search results when it comes to institutions’ findability and visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Part 1 - Content strategy, or how to use isShownAt / isShowBy / object</em><br />\r\nPreparing data for publishing EDM records is not always straightforward. One has first to understand the celestial mechanics of Linked Open Data through the RDF standard, and then it is necessary to map the available data to the relevant EDM field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working on this day in, day out, has made us aware that some of the most important fields are sometimes unclear in what they refer to. So, here is a summary of the three elements linking to the actual media, embedded into the <strong>ore:Aggregation</strong> class:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:isShownAt</strong> refers to <em>the web view of the record in full information context</em>, on the original institution's website</li>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:isShownBy</strong> refers to <em>the main representation of the record</em> (if present, this will be used to generate our thumbnail)</li>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:object</strong> refers to <em>the thumbnail image of the record</em> (min 0.1 megapixel in size; this may be the same URL as edm:isShownBy)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You must use either <strong>edm:isShownAt</strong> or <strong>edm:isShownBy</strong>. The use of <strong>edm:isShownBy</strong> is preferred, as it would ensure a direct representation of the record in Europeana Collections. The resource in <strong>edm:object</strong> is displayed in our search results list/grid, as a thumbnail for a specific record. Then, once on the Europeana individual record page, the user will see the resource in <strong>edm:isShownBy</strong> and will be pointed to the <strong>edm:isShownAt</strong> resource if they click on the ‘View at’ link (top right side).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>Part 2 - Institutions’ visibility, or demystifying the Provider, Intermediate Provider &amp; Data Provider roles</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWe, at Europeana, love to classify things. It is not only a compulsive behaviour, but it helps us to ensure we can provide the most filterable search results for our users. Therefore, three categories were created in order to define our partners:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:DataProvider </strong>(mandatory) refers to <em>the institution in charge of the cultural object and which has created the related data</em>;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:IntermediateProvider</strong> is t<em>he intermediate organization that selects, collates, or curates data from a data provider, and which then passes the data to an aggregator</em> from which Europeana harvests;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>edm:Provider</strong> (mandatory) is <em>the organization providing data directly </em>to Europeana;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Example: In the case of the data provider Zuidwestbrabants Museum, which delivers data through Erfgoedplus.be to LoCloud, the properties would look like this:<br />\r\n&nbsp; &lt;<strong>edm:dataProvider</strong>&gt;<em>Zuidwestbrabants Museum</em>&lt;/<strong>edm:dataProvider</strong>&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &lt;<strong>edm:intermediateProvider</strong>&gt;<em>Erfgoedplus.be</em>&lt;/<strong>edm:intermediateProvider</strong>&gt;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &lt;<strong>edm:provider</strong>&gt;<em>LoCloud</em>&lt;/<strong>edm:provider</strong>&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accross a dataset these labels need to be <em><strong>identical </strong></em>(no variant spellings for the same institution) to ensure the consistency of the information displayed and queryable through our search engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In this lesson we cover some of the best practice for mapping data into EDM we've acquired over years. We will give practical examples in order to highlight issues our users face when browsing content from Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Part 1 - dc:language, or xml:lang, or maybe both ?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe <strong>dc:language</strong> is only used once, in <strong>edm:ProvidedCHO</strong>, to specify the language that can be applied to the core content of this object. It is only mandatory for textual resources, as we need this information to disambiguate millions of text objects in our search results. Almost <em>any field populated with literals</em> can be embedded with <em>a language attribute </em><strong>xml:lang</strong>, in order to specify the language of the provided metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example:<br />\r\nA French book has been described using both English and French metadata: It will have to be described with &lt;<strong>dc:language</strong>&gt;fr&lt;<strong>/dc:language</strong>&gt;, as the text was written in French (and because it is obviously a textual resource).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be embedded with several dc:subject fields relating to the domains treated in this book; and each occurrence of this field could be disambiguated using a relevant xml:lang attribute, such as<br />\r\n&lt;<strong>dc:subject</strong>&nbsp; <em><strong>xml:lang=\"fr\"</strong></em>&gt;Patisserie&lt;/<strong>dc:subject</strong>&gt;<br />\r\n&lt;<strong>dc:subject&nbsp; <em>xml:lang=\"en\"</em></strong>&gt;Pastry&lt;/<strong>dc:subject</strong>&gt;<br />\r\n&lt;<strong>dc:subject&nbsp; <em>xml:lang=\"fr</em></strong>\"&gt;Recette&lt;/<strong>dc:subject</strong>&gt;<br />\r\n&lt;<strong>dc:subject&nbsp;</strong> <strong><em>xml:lang=\"en\"</em></strong>&gt;Recipe&lt;/<strong>dc:subject</strong>&gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This gives us a reliable multilingual approach.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Part 2 - The curse of the unique title or why you should not have 234,673 items labelled as ‘Photograph’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When people are looking for specific records, or at least have an idea of what they are looking for, they rely on metadata that’s of a decent quality. They shouldn’t have to browse endless lists of results, just because the title of all these records is the same. This explains why, when submitting records for publishing in Europeana, we ask for <strong>mandatory metadata elements</strong> such as a <em>title </em>or a <em>description</em>, and at least one classifier element related to the <em>historical/geographical/typology information</em> from this object.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In 2011, a group of library professionals gathered to discuss how the Europeana Data Model fit library data needs. The group wanted to understand how a mapping of traditional library metadata records correlated to the three principle EDM structures (<strong>edm:ProvidedCHO</strong>, <strong>edm:WebResource</strong>, <strong>ore:Aggregation</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since EDM is an RDF-based model, the records had to be viewed as being made up of a set of separate statements which could then be redistributed across the EDM classes. In order to support this process, a model was created defining which EDM classes would be used in the library context, the relations between them, and the EDM properties chosen to describe these relations. Europeana is currently implementing only a subset of the EDM properties defined in the main EDM specification. In this course, we’ll focus mainly on the Europeana Data Model for <em>monographs</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the traditional library world, the description of objects (books, journals etc.) is record-based. Such a record, which can be seen as a closed box, is a defined set of description elements that can include information about:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The real world object or item, - the book on a shelf</li>\r\n    <li>The bibliographic object - the edition representing the entirety of all identical copies of a publication</li>\r\n    <li>The digital representation of the real world object - a digital copy of the book</li>\r\n    <li>The record itself - information about when the record was created and by whom.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to this closed box model, the Europeana Data Model is a statement-based model - the description of library objects covers separate entities and their relationships on different abstract levels. In this world we therefore differentiate between:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The description of the information - the entirety of all identical copies of a book - and the information carrier - the book on the shelf.</li>\r\n    <li>The description of the real world object - the book - and its digital representation - a digital copy of this book.</li>\r\n    <li>The description of the object described - the book - and the object describing it - the metadata.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And we interlink these entities and express these links with RDF statements.<br />\r\nMapping a traditional metadata record to EDM therefore means that the closed box has to be opened, the record will be taken apart and the different entities described in one record will be identified as EDM classes and related to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more details please read the deliverable of the <a href=\"/page/europeana-libraries-edm\">Europeana Libraries project</a>.</p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<p>The following is a quick recap on the core classes of EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>edm:ProvidedCHO</strong> is the cultural heritage object which has given rise to and is the subject of the package of data that has been submitted to Europeana. Its properties are those of the original cultural heritage object. Strictly speaking, the edm:ProvidedCHO is the resource in Europeana that relate to the original cultural heritage object not its digital representation, for example attributes of the Mona Lisa, not the digitised image of the paintining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDM defines <strong>edm:Web Resource</strong> as ‘information resources that have at least one web representation and at least a URI.’ In this model, the edm:WebResource is a digital representation of an item (e.g. of a printed resource or a born-digital resource). All information about a representation – whether it is born-digital or digitized – has to be provided using&nbsp; an instance of the class edm:WebResource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>ore:Aggregation</strong> serves to group together all important elements of cultural heritage objects contributed by the content providers. Aggregations are used in EDM to represent the complex constructs that are provided by contributors. In compliance with EDM, the fundamental relationships between edm:WebResource and edm:ProvidedCHO are realized by using the ore:Aggregation class. This is the place where the metadata relating to this whole object will be recorded</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned throughout this course, all the classes and properties, the data types that can be used as values and the obligation level of each property are described extensively in the EDM Mapping Guidelines. These guidelines are to be found on the <a href=\"/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model Documentation</a> page and should serve as guidance for providers wanting to map their data to EDM. Those interested can find there an example of original data, the same data converted to EDM and diagrams showing the distribution of the properties amongst the classes. The mapping guidelines should be consulted frequently as the full set of EDM classes and properties are being implemented incrementally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we'll present a mind map of actual MARC21 fields that could be assigned to respective EDM fields and classes. Following that we have a practical example from the National Library of Serbia of creating EDM from their MARC21 records. At the end of the section, we'll take to a more visual trip to see how an object from a library shelf becomes a presence in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note, that the examples presented here are to serve as guidance and support, and might not always match your data manipulation needs.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Europeana’s strongest asset is the Network which supports and contributes to it. The collaboration and cooperation between the Network, the transfer of data, adherence to policies and continued progress has allowed Europeana to come to fruition and continue to change the world with cultural heritage. Over the past few years Europeana has combined efforts with similar international efforts like <a href=\"https://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">DPLA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DigitalNZ</a> and <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Trove</a> but few of these combined efforts have directly related to technical infrastructure development. That’s why EuropeanaTech is so excited about joining the<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\" target=\"_blank\"> International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF), a technical framework that in the past several years has propelled the interoperability and presentation of high quality images to a new level of collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, EuropeanaTech has launched <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/iiif\" target=\"_blank\">a Task Force </a>to assess the needs and requirements of the Tech community to propel a community driven movement towards universal adoption and implementation of IIIF and its subsequent open source software. In the meantime, with this special issue of EuropeanaTech Insight, we invited several institutions familiar with IIIF to share their experiences discovering, adopting and deploying IIIF, expressing both struggles, of which there are few, and successes, of which there are many!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that hearing from your fellow EuropeanaTech community members will entice you and inspire you and your institute to investigate IIIF further so that the Europeana Network’s image sharing and presentation can grow to a singular, interoperable web, benefitting every institute, their users and anyone interested in celebrating heritage imagery.</p>\r\n"

                subtitle: 'John B. Howard, University College Dublin'
                anchortitle: 'Article 1'
                templates: body
                body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/library/\" target=\"_blank\">Library at University College Dublin</a> <http: library=\"\" www.ucd.ie=\"\"> has, for more than a decade, been creating digital content that is disseminated via <a href=\"https://digital.ucd.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">UCD Digital Library</a> <https: digital.ucd.ie=\"\">. Since the majority of digital file assets consist of images—high-resolution TIFF images with lossless JPEG2000 and lower-resolution static JPEG derivatives—the emergence of the International Image Interoperability Framework immediately attracted our attention. It offered a common-sense approach to image interoperability that proposes to address technical and usability challenges that inhibit both service development and scholarly interaction with digital content.</https:></http:></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UCD faced challenges typical with providers of digitised books, maps, and other cultural heritage information: use of older technologies for dissemination of deep-zooming images (djatoka, whose OpenURL-based approach to interoperability lost lustre with the domination of approaches based on REST); challenges in delivering paged documents, including page turning and document navigation functionality, as well as associating OCR content with page images; a large-scale transcription project based on bespoke technologies; and more. IIIF and its growing community of developers promised solutions for all of these issues, and as they have been delivered over the past five years, we’ve adopted them: IIIF Image API (<a href=\"https://github.com/loris-imageserver\" target=\"_blank\">Loris</a>), IIIF Presentation, and IIIF Search; IIIF authentication is next on the development roadmap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/ucd-iiif-search-uv-screenshot-1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1. IIIF search via UniversalViewer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploiting the potential for interoperability offered by IIIF is where we have set our sights for current and future development. In 2016, we seized an opportunity to work with Nuno Freire and Pierre Edouard-Barrault at Europeana to work on a case study of reporting our IIIF content to Europeana. The project was experimental (also involving the National Library of Wales), evaluating approaches and testing ideas. But it also has succeeded in a practical sense, delivering new content from UCD and its partner organisations in Ireland to Europeana. It has catalysed other improvements as well—including creation of a microservice to deliver EDM metadata via IIIF manifests, and the upgrading of local sitemaps to use components of the <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/rs/toc\" target=\"_blank\">ResourceSync</a> <http: rs=\"\" toc=\"\" www.openarchives.org=\"\"> framework. (We’ll next be testing with Europeana an approach to reporting video content via sitemaps and the EDM microservice.)</http:></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/ucd-europeana-screenshot-1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2. UCD content in Europeana via IIIF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending interoperability more aggressively to end-users is UCD Library’s next major objective. UCD Library supports a major document transcription project in collaboration with Fiontar at <a href=\"https://www.dcu.ie/fiontar_scoilnagaeilge/gaeilge/index.shtml\">Dublin City University</a> <https: fiontar_scoilnagaeilge=\"\" gaeilge=\"\" index.shtml=\"\" www.dcu.ie=\"\">, hosted at <a href=\"http://duchas.ie\" target=\"_blank\">http://duchas.ie</a>. Underway for several years, it uses bespoke technologies for engaging end-users in document transcription, and has been extraordinarily successful in the degree of public engagement it has fostered. </https:></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/ucd-duchas-screenshot-1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 3. Screenshot from duchas.ie transcription site</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we look towards the future, we see IIIF as a foundational technology in such projects exposing our content to scholarly communities and the public at large. The integrated annotation capabilities of the <a href=\"http://projectmirador.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mirador</a> image viewer will be invaluable in enabling annotation of more than 70,000 images from the <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/folklore/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Irish National Folklore Collection</a>, due to come online in 2017. And as IIIF client capability becomes increasingly integrated with tools such as <a href=\"http://scribeproject.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Scribe</a>, <a href=\"http://fromthepage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FromThePage</a>, or Europeana’s transcription tools, we see vast potential for additional transcription projects that focus on structured textual documents, whether printed or manuscript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IIIF does not come without its challenges. For library staff accustomed to working with the ubiquitous standards of the Library community, there is a learning curve that is partly specific to IIIF, but which more generally has to do with re-orienting one’s thinking to web standards, rather than library standards for interoperability. Data representation with JSON/JSON-LD is one dimension of this; understanding Web Annotations is another, which is crucial to understanding the general direction of web-based document transcription and annotation; and there are the complexities of web messaging and notifications that the IIIF community continues to grapple with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges also extend to how new technologies that are driven by IIIF and web standards integrate with infrastructures based on older library practices. In UCD’s case, we digitise printed documents and capture OCR’d text in METS/ALTO format, indexed by Solr. Integrating the technologies supporting this approach with IIIF Search was a straightforward exercise. But what are the implications of deploying an or Web Annotations-compliant annotation store for data management and information retrieval, and especially for maintaining a coherent user experience? How do we make the old and the new work together harmoniously and sensibly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/ucd-sys-arch-speculative-1.png\" style=\"width: 1235px; height: 877px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 4. Imagining an evolved systems architecture at UCD Digital Library</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years ago, when we became aware of the concept of the International Image Interoperability Framework through Tom Cramer’s presentation at the <a href=\"https://www.cni.org/topics/information-access-retrieval/international-image-interoperability-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Coalition for Networked information</a><https: information-access-retrieval=\"\" international-image-interoperability-framework=\"\" topics=\"\" www.cni.org=\"\">, we knew it had potential to be transformative. But as we look at our own work during the past two years and the development agenda for the near term, we at UCD can say that we simply did not anticipate the degree to which it would shape our overall agenda. As our technical infrastructure develops, we see it opening new doors not only to interoperability, but also to broader engagement with UCD’s academic community, its heritage repositories, our growing range of partners in the Irish cultural heritage community, and the public at large.</https:></p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<p>Although the IIIF-standard has been around for some time, it took us until April 2016 to realise the full potential it offers cultural heritage institutions and end-users. In 2016 during the museum’s 150-year-anniversary, Nationalmuseum was facing the problem that we wanted to provide access to some of our high resolutions images but did not have the possibility to largely invest into infrastructure. During a presentation at <a href=\"http://mw2016.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/iiif-unshackle-your-images/\" target=\"_blank\">Museums and the Web </a>we realised that IIIF was the most logical option as it would be the fastest to implement and by far the most future-proof solution to our problem. The IIIF image API in combination with a IIIF image server makes it possible to deliver, embed and request images breathtakingly fast in any desired size simply by embedding the image´s <a href=\"http://nationalmuseumse.iiifhosting.com/iiif/8302acd765abfde266dd71e661c48948f1d654373101e893d1580e827d261b60/\" target=\"_blank\">URI</a> into the desired website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/screen-shot-2017-02-21-at-13.02.14.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Example of Nationalmuseum content with IIIF zoom</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the long run, this means that we will no longer need to keep derivatives of any images accessible on a IIIF server but would just embed the same URI with different size specifications into different websites, blogs, Social Media applications etc. There is no more need to download and upload images into different CMSs for different use cases, and no need for endless copies in different systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we needed a small derivative of this image we would simply alter the URI, with no need to host or upload a different image somewhere else. It is even possible to cropor turn the image if necessary for any desired presentation. These possibilities are a great chance for us when planning the relaunch of our general website as well as our collections online presentation in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, with a suite of open source viewers accessible, a lot of additional functionalities come along with having images on a IIIF server without having to understand any of the underlying features or technologies at all. With our primary aim to “have a set of high-resolution images accessible in a user-friendly way in 2016”, we were facing two simple tasks: uploading the images in question to a IIIF hosting service and implementing the relevant URIs to the images as well as a IIIF image viewer into our online database. As there were just 3,000 images, we uploaded them manually and fed the URIs back into the database by a simple import script. The supplier of our online collection implemented <a href=\"https://openseadragon.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenSeaDragon</a> at a reasonable cost into the existing website without changing any of the existing design or functionality. Thus, whenever a IIIF URI is available for the object in question, additional functionalities will appear, and when there is no IIIF URI, the service will just look as it used to. or example, compare the portrait of <a href=\"http://collection.nationalmuseum.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=181923&amp;viewType=detailView\" target=\"_blank\">Karen Margrethe Borch</a> with the <em><a href=\"http://collection.nationalmuseum.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=122454&amp;viewType=detailView\" target=\"_blank\">Portrait of a lady with a dog</a></em>. Those images with a IIIF URI now offer deep zoom and full screen view for our users, who “love IIIF without knowing what it is”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/screen-shot-2017-02-21-at-13.04.03.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2: example of OpenSeaDragon image reference strip</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We did not upload all our images to the IIIF hosting service due to the fact that we did not acquire enough hosting space from the beginning. Therefore, we are eager to try Europeana’s IIIF hosting server when it comes up. As we have our images in a cloud based DAMS, we do not use the IIIF server as an additional backup, and only uploaded jpgs to the hosting service, excluding tiffs. Nevertheless, we are planning to upload at least one image from any collection object to a IIIF server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment our usage of IIIF is reduced to the OpenSeadragon implementation in the online database, but we will explore all possibilities for both embedding IIIF into the new website, Social Media portals and online catalogues when relaunching the website and the online database. Another step will be to try to make use of the presentation API so that we can deliver metadata along with the images. Additionally the image presentation capabilities are much richer for end-users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation API delivers the necessary information to understand what the image represents, which means that it makes it possible to show relations between different images, making it easy to compare images (e.g. X-ray or infrared images of the same object) or to group images that belong together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently there has been a new development that allows us to replace the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">edm:IsShownBy</a> links for our objects in Europeana that have a IIIF URI available. The working group behind the MINT ingestion service worked on a transformation of the LIDO to EDM mapping which allows the delivery of IIIF links as part of our metadata delivery process. Doing so, the hosted image with all zoom functionalities will even be available from Europeana’s portal and will let users explore all astonishing details of paintings in the Nationalmuseum’s collection.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Over the last 3 years IIIF has been working to establish its position as the go-to solution for online Image content delivery within the Libraries, Archives and Museums sector, achieving remarkable results. IIIF accomplished standardising the performance optimisation of tiling image servers, thus improving the performance of accessing large high resolution images. IIIF is currently supported by the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/\" target=\"_blank\">Image AP</a>I (serving image content), the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/\" target=\"_blank\">Presentation API</a> (presenting the resource to the human reader), the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/search/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Search API</a> (enabling search over the resource) and the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/auth/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Authentication API</a> (enabling the possibility of access restrictions). An extension to this successful track record is the development of a new framework that will be able to serve Audio and Video content, the IIIF A/V API.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVUyhcVO060\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>IIIF A/V API has been in the make since April 2016, when the first A/V Working Group meeting took place at the British Library. The result was an extensive functionalities “<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwvqlxIQqUgmGfiUlB5FPMA80gG9Ww-_sd1FQCT14F4/edit#heading=h.eqhxhumqze71\" target=\"_blank\">wishlist</a>”, crafted by domain experts who came up with numerous use cases that the new framework is expected to cover. In the meetings that followed (New York, the Hague) the A/V working group grew bigger, specifications became clearer and use cases became more concrete. Fast forward to today and IIIF A/V has a long list of “<a href=\"https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-av/issues?page=1&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen\" target=\"_blank\">Issues</a>” on its GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/IIIF/iiif-av\" target=\"_blank\">page</a> promising a great future for the adopters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where exactly are we now? We need to understand the difficulty in the challenges that IIIF A/V has to face and why it can’t unroll in the same way the Image API did. Providing access to bitstreams of audio and video content adds a temporal dimension to that of the height and width but more importantly encoding, bandwidth and performance issues come forward triggering a lot of discussion: -One of the first important decisions is the point of processing and choosing where to let the processing weight lie. “Would it be more beneficial to allow most of the transformations to happen in the computing power expense of the client or the server? Should only one be chosen, and which one would that be. If not what should be done and where?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Can URL based standardisation be achieved in the same way as in Image API when we want to access A/V content?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>”Should the audio and video channels be supported by the same API?” Questions like that keep coming up, perplexing a much anticipated topic that continues to gain attention. Tom Crane explores the topic strongly in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X7b7zQGDsiEvAfvb1WboDXe360mz7Zmm0o0LT43nozk/edit\" target=\"_blank\">this document</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2017, IIIF issued a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/azaroth42/2d6204e5c6932a4da56efba38c5be86d\" target=\"_blank\">Charter</a> for IIIF A/V API clearly defining its scope and a timeline until the end of 2018. At that point the IIIF A/V API is expected to be ready. There’s also a <a href=\"http://ronallo.com/blog/choosing-a-path-forward-for-iiif-audio-and-video/\" target=\"_blank\">wonderful blog</a> from Jason Ronallo in which he indepthly describes several of the some of the challenges IIIF A/V faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_Insight/Issue6/themsi1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Mock up of IIIF A/V presentation API</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many questions regarding the future and feasibility of IIIF A/V remain to be answered. By involving many experts from the audiovisual sector and following the core strengths of IIIF’s development thus far a positive result is expected but costs and resources will remain a high concern for institutions already struggling with digitisation and presentation of their audiovisual content. Ideally, IIIF A/V would depreciate these costs and institute a formula that smaller institutions can follow. This all remains to be seen as IIIF A/V team grapples with the conundrums of the presentation of audiovisual material.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Get your vocabularies in Wikidata...'
        intro: "<p>In the case study, Get your vocabularies in Wikidata...so Europeana and others can get them, we are describing the practical steps envisioned, based on recent experimentation done by Sandra Fauconnier consisting of aligning the MIMO vocabulary with Wikidata.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana offers a trusted online repository of cultural heritage objects. In order to achieve its mission it is crucial for the metadata described in Europeana to be semantically rich and multilingual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enriching the metadata with Linked Open Vocabularies has allowed us to improve our metadata. We perform automatic metadata enrichment using external value vocabularies and datasets such as <a href=\"http://http://geonames.org\">GeoNames</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org\">DBpedia</a> and exploit the semantic relations and translations offered by those vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When selecting which vocabularies we use for our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\">automatic enrichment</a>, we seek to apply some criteria, especially for minimising our semantic commitment and abstracting from the needs of specific domains or (sub)-communities. Europeana will therefore select large, rather generic and multilingual data sources. And we will favour data sources that are well-connected such as 'pivot vocabularies' where equivalent elements in other vocabularies are indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">Wikidata</a>, as mentioned in the recommendation 7 of the 2015 Europeana-Wikimedia Task Force report, fulfils many of our criteria Europeana for data sources selection. The coverage of Wikidata and Europeana in terms of entities and languages are indeed very much aligned<a href=\"#_ftn1\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[1]</a>. In addition, Wikidata bring together crowdsourced resources and authoritative datasets (such as <a href=\"https://viaf.org/\">VIAF</a>) and so guarantees a good balance between the authority and the quality we are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides our \"centralized\" enrichment, Europeana would also benefit from more “local” semantic resources used by our data partners and which are often the results of tremendous data curation efforts. Europeana has started to leverage some of these reference authorities or vocabularies<a href=\"#_ftn2\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[2]</a>. However this results in a rather cluttered 'semantic layer' where semantic with different scope and grain can co-exist without being aligned. Our position is that using Wikidata could bring a solution to better handle domain specific vocabularies, as it allows manual upload and alignment of semantic entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our proposal is basically to use Wikidata as a pivot to access links to more specialised vocabularies<a href=\"#_ftn3\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[3]</a>. The practical approach for a data provider would consist in several steps resulting in the alignment of their source vocabulary with Wikidata. This would benefit:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>The GLAM community, which could leverage the power of Wikidata to share their local resources and then have them reused in a wider web context.</li>\r\n    <li>Wikidata as it would enrich its existing knowledge base.</li>\r\n    <li>Third parties like Europeana as it would enable one to access more specialised knowledge via Wikidata.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We have described below the practical steps envisioned, based on a recent experimentation done by <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Spinster\">Sandra Fauconnier </a>consisting in aligning the MIMO vocabulary with Wikidata. The MIMO vocabulary was chosen as a use case as it has been used in a previous Europeana related projects<a href=\"#_ftn4\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[4]</a> for describing musical instruments and is one of the vocabularies Europeana “dereference”, i.e., fetch from the concepts URIs all the multilingual and semantic data attached to them. The MIMO vocabulary is a multilingual<a href=\"#_ftn5\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[5]</a> controlled <a href=\"http://www.mimo-db.eu/InstrumentsKeywords/\">vocabulary of musical instruments</a> built to ensure consistency of classification for the musical instruments. It is a result of an alignment of a vernacular classification with the professional <a href=\"http://www.mimo-international.com/documents/Hornbostel%2520Sachs.pdf\">“Hornbostel-Sachs” classification</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Steps in Contributing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Preparing the import</strong> </em>The first step consists in importing the source vocabulary in the Mix'n'match tool. Depending on the structure of the source vocabulary, some preparatory work might be required as the <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/\">Mix'n’match</a> tool does not currently handle hierarchies. Typically a vocabulary described in SKOS will present a hierarchy of concepts. In this case the vocabulary structure will have to be flattened, and the hierarchical structure added back in Wikidata later, when refining the Wikidata entities. Simple tools such as <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">Open Refine</a> or Excel can be used to support these data cleaning activities. When the source file is ready, it can be imported into Mix'n’match via the <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/import.php\">import tool</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMO vocabulary is available as a <a href=\"https://github.com/philharmoniedeparis/mimo/blob/master/our-data/03_skos/keywords_skos.xml\">SKOS/ RDF XML file</a>. It is highly structured as each musical instruments family and musical instruments are described in a hierarchy of concepts. The vocabulary hierarchy was therefore flattened and all the translations and aliases were concatenated into strings so that they would then fit into the Mix'n’match descriptions using Open Refine. The XML was converted into a Excel spreadsheet for import. Note that in some other cases more data cleaning might be required such as removing extra white spaces, duplicates, normalising some terms etc. In total 2.471 terms were imported into Mix'n’match. Note that some hints of the hierarchy (mention of the broader concept) were added in the description of the terms on Mix’n'match, in order to facilitate the manual verification of the automatic alignment (see later step).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Other preparation work </strong></em>Importing the source vocabulary in Mix’n Match will allow the alignment with existing Wikidata entities. In order to capture the link between a Wikidata entity and the source vocabulary entity, i.e, the alignment and describing at the same time the type of link; a new Wikidata property needs to be created. This property will contain a string or a URI representing the identifier used in an external system: <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3763\">https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P3763</a> - MIMO Instrument ID in the case of MIMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Aligning Wikidata and the source vocabulary</strong> </em>Once the vocabulary has been imported the alignment work can start. Mix'n’match will automatically match terms from the source vocabulary to Wikidata and these matches must be checked manually. Other correspondences (not detected by Mix'n'match) will need to be created manually by directly entering the identifier of a Wikidata entity equivalent for a MIMO concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/bassoon_Wikidata.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/Mix_n_match1.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An example of manual match done by entering the Wikidata id of an entity equivalent to the MIMO concept. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More details on how to use Mix‘n’match are available at the Mix’n’Match user manual. In the case of MIMO<a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/#/catalog/391\">142 alignments were created automatically.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/Mix_n_match_2.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An example of automatic match to be confirmed in Mix'n'match. Note that next to the labels in languages available for the MIMO concept being examined, a clarification note has been added to indicate the broader class of instrument. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Refining the Wikidata entries</em></strong> Once the alignment has been performed, one may want to refine the existing Wikidata entries directly. For instance, we mentioned earlier that Mix'n’match doesn’t support hierarchies yet.The hierarchical relationships such as broader or narrower terms can be added manually on the Wikidata entries themselves at this stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MIMO keywords vocabulary are organised by a higher-level classification coming from the professional “HornbostelSachs” classification. The more specialized terms provided by the classification are not included in the import but could be then manually added to the Wikidata entry</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Creating a new Wikidata entry</em></strong> When a Wikidata entry doesn’t exist for a given concept in the source vocabulary, the solution will be to create it by directly editing Wikidata. If required properties (e.g. domain specific properties <a href=\"#_ftn7\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[6]</a>) are not available, the data partner will be able to propose new ones in the Wikidata ontology <a href=\"#_ftn7\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[7]</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We now need your help to complete the remaining alignment. You can directly contribute at <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/#/catalog/391\">https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/#/catalog/391</a>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Outcomes and Next Steps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The increased reliance of Europeana services on semantically rich and multilingual metadata illustrates the need for rich and open resources such as Wikidata. We also believe Wikidata also offers a perfect platform to increase the engagement of the GLAM community and the further research community and support the sharing of more resources. We would like to build and gather more resources (cases, manuals, workflows, etc) to convince and train our partners to align their vocabularies with Wikidata. We welcome any support for this idea !</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1] </a>Wikimedia developments task force recommendations at http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/wikimedia</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2] </a>http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/europeana-semantic-enrichment</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3] </a>Before importing any data to Wikidata, data providers would need to check their data is suitable for Wikidata: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_Import_Hub</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\">[4] </a>MIMO (http://www.mimo-international.com/MIMO/) and Europeana Sounds (http://www.europeanasounds.eu/)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn5\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\">[5] </a>English is the pivot language, and translations in seven other languages have been added.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn6\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" name=\"_ftn6\" title=\"\">[6] </a>For more example see the suggestions for CreativeWork at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal/Creative_work#toctitle</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn7\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref7\" name=\"_ftn7\" title=\"\">[7] </a>Before being created new Wikidata properties have to be proposed and discussed at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Representing performing arts metadata in EDM'
        intro: null
        body: "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/\"> <span class=\"s2\"><i>Specialised Information Service Performing Arts</i></span></a> <a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/\">project</a> aggregates metadata from the performing arts domain and presents them in a<a href=\"http://vufind-org.github.io/vufind/\"> <span class=\"s2\">VuFind</span></a>-based search portal as linked open data. The project was funded by the German Research Foundation and ran at the University Library Frankfurt am Main from January 2015 to December 2017.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The project aggregated metadata describing performance-related objects from libraries, archives and museums in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Due to the diversity of data providers and data acquisition workflows, the metadata turned out to be very heterogeneous and domain specific. In order to equally handle and display the metadata and make it available as Linked Open Data, it had to be represented into one aggregation model (Fig. 1). Hence, an interoperable and flexible metadata standard was needed to meet metadata requirements from the domain.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The additional step of mapping all metadata to a common framework was also crucial to enable smaller cultural heritage institutions from the performing arts domain to have their metadata displayed in the performing arts portal and available as Linked Data. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/Mapping_Workflow_FID.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Fig. 1 Aggregation model : The provided heterogeneous metadata is mapped from its original model to EDM. The resulting metadata is indexed into SOLR, enriched and displayed via VuFind. </span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Metadata in the performing arts domain present a lot of challenges: different cultural heritage objects are at stake such as the performance itself but also printed books, manuscripts, photographs and videos documenting it or being an adaptation of it. In addition, performing arts metadata are rich in information about people, places and events that are crucial to understand the domain. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Re-using the <i>Europeana Data Model</i> (EDM) proved to be the right choice as the model is transcending domain-specific metadata standards. Based on a Semantic Web framework, it can be extended without hindering data interoperability. In using Linked Data technology, EDM provides the basis to model relations between cultural heritage objects and between contextual resources and therefore enabling a richer user experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">EDM has been already re-used in several digitisation projects, each having produced a comprehensive collection of mappings, applications profiles or extensions. The project decided to re-use the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\"><span class=\"s2\">DM2E</span></a> and <a href=\"http://www.eclap.eu/\"><span class=\"s2\">ECLAP</span></a> extensions to address its requirements. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s3\">A specific application profile </span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the nature of the metadata, the project had to create a new set of guidelines<a href=\"#_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>applicable to existing EDM classes and properties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">EDM requires each Provided Cultural Heritage object (<i>edm: ProvidedCHO</i>) to have at least one digital representation (<i>edm:WebResource</i>). Since the main focus of the project is on retrieval of the metadata records, the necessity to provide at least one of <i>edm:isShownAt</i> or <i>edm:isShownBy</i> in <i>ore:Aggregation</i> was alleviated. If a link to a viewer, or a link to the metadata of the object in the providers' catalogue are not available, </span><span class=\"s3\">r</span><span class=\"s1\">ecords without a digital representation are displayed with a generic thumbnail and without a link. In addition, a link to the homepage of the data provider is always available so that the user can contact the data provider to get more information.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The project also created an extension to EDM as the current specifications were not covering all the needs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The<a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/DM2E_Model_V1.2.pdf\"><span class=\"s4\"> DM2E extension of EDM</span></a> was re-used to describe more granular metadata for cultural heritage objects with properties like <i>dm2e:subtitle</i>, <i>dm2e:callNumber. </i></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 14px\">\"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/item/ADK_A_VE_1957226\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/ADK_A_VE_1957226</a>\" a edm:ProvidedCHO ;<br>\r\ndc:description \"Klassifikation: 01.

As specified in the DM2E extension, a distinction is made between metadata describing a person (use of the class<i> foaf:Person</i>) and an Organization (<i>foaf:Organization</i>)<i>. </i>The more general class <i>edm:Agent </i>is used when<i> </i>it is unknown whether the Agent is a person or an organization<i>.</i> Fine-grained properties are also used to further describe a person. For instance DM2E re-uses PRO <a href=\"#_ftn2\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\" title=\"\">[2]</a>, a SPAR vocabulary to describe Agent roles. The project used properties such as <i>pro:author</i> and <i>pro:translator</i> for manuscript data like prompt books and libretti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">EDM was also further extended with the<a href=\"http://www.eclap.eu/\"> <span class=\"s2\">ECLAP</span></a> namespace covering the specific properties for the performing arts domain like the place and type of a performance, <i>eclap:performancePlace</i> and <i>eclap:performingArtType</i>. With properties such as <i>eclap:actor</i>, <i>eclap:dancer</i> and <i>eclap:setDesigner</i>, ECLAP can also reflect the different roles of contributors in the creation of or the performance itself (See data example in Fig.3 below).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 14px\">&lt;<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238</a>&gt; a edm:ProvidedCHO ;<br>\r\npro:author \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/118516906\"><span class=\"s3\">http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/118516906</span></a>\" ;<br>\r\neclap:director \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/118728377\"><span class=\"s4\">http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/118728377</span></a>\"<br>\r\neclap:setDesigner \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/117363782\"><span class=\"s4\">http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/117363782</span></a>\" ;<br>\r\neclap:costumeDesigner \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/11622780X\"><span class=\"s4\">http://performing-arts.eu/agent/gnd/11622780X</span></a>” ;<br>\r\ndc:description \"Prinz Leonce, der Sohn König Peters vom Reiche Popo, ist seines Lebens überdrüssig, das ihm keinen Anlaß zu sinnvoller Betätigung bietet(..)@de ;<br>\r\ndc:identifier \"<a href=\"http://www.duesseldorf.de/dkult/DE-MUS-037616/32238\">http://www.duesseldorf.de/dkult/DE-MUS-037616/32238</a>\", \"TMIN_1911-1912 Düsseldorf\", \"32238\" ;<br>\r\ndc:title \"Leonce und Lena\"@de ;<br>\r\ndc:language \"de\" ;<br>\r\ndc:type \"<a href=\"http://d-nb.info/gnd/4027223-0\"><span class=\"s3\">http://d-nb.info/gnd/4027223-0</span></a>\" ;<br>\r\ndcterms:created \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/timespan/1911-01-01T00:00:00Z_1912-31-12T23:59:59Z\"><span class=\"s3\">http://performing-arts.eu/timespan/1911-01-01T00:00:00Z_1912-31-12T23:59:59Z</span></a>”;<br>\r\nedm:isRelatedTo \"<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/item/TMD_133314\"><span class=\"s3\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_133314</span></a>\";<br>\r\ndcterms:provenance \"Theatermuseum der Landeshauptstadt Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf\" ;<br>\r\neclap:performancePlace \"Schauspielhaus Düsseldorf Dumont-Lindemann\" .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Fig. 3 Representation of a performance <a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238\"><span class=\"s2\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238</span></a> using the ECLAP and PRO namespaces. </span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The project also re-uses properties from the <a href=\"http://bibliontology.com/\"><span class=\"s2\">BIBO</span></a> and <a href=\"http://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/gnd\"><span class=\"s2\">GND</span></a> ontologies.

As shown in Fig. 4 one way to solve this issue has been to represent the performance and the cultural object(s) related to it as two separate <i>edm:ProvidedCHO</i> linked together with the property <i>edm:isRelatedTo</i> (see data example in Fig.2)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/data_model_extensions.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Fig. 4 Data representation of two ProvidedCHOs: one representing a photograph (<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_133314\"><span class=\"s2\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_133314</span></a>) and one for the performance (<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238\"><span class=\"s2\">http://performing-arts.eu/Record/TMD_32238</span></a>) .</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We were therefore particularly interested in modelling theatre or dance performances as <i>edm:Event</i> instead of objects (<i>edm:ProvidedCHO</i>). For instance for a given theatre play, such a modeling enables us to describe information such as the creation of the manuscript, the publication of the print edition, the play’s premiere performance, other performances, or a screen adaptation. Fig. 5 shows how specific cultural heritage objects such as a play or a photograph represented as <i>edm:ProvidedCHO </i>are linked to a particular <i>edm:Event</i> class instance using the property <i>edm:wasPresentAt</i>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Technical_requirements/Cases_studies/data_model_events.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Fig. 5 Example using edm:Event to represent performances.</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Event modeling allowed us to provide an accurate description of the relationships between cultural heritage objects and the specific Event they were present at. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However we could not achieve an ideal mapping. First of all, we experienced difficulties in modeling the provided data as an Event because of its granularity. Most of the aggregated metadata either focuses on cultural object descriptions and therefore does not have the granularity required to model Event data, or on the different aspects of an Event which complicated a homogeneous modeling. As mentioned earlier, in some cases information about a specific performance Event and information about the Provided Cultural Heritage object is still mixed within the same metadata description. Further work will be undertaken to create more performance Events from these metadata descriptions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Secondly, we had difficulties representing the contribution of a specific Person to the performance Event using the current EDM specifications as shown in Fig. 5<i>.</i> We could indicate that a person was present at the event but could not express what kind of contribution a person made to a performance like the role of the director of the play, the choreographer, or the set designer. Therefore, the model needs to be developed so that it allows for properties more specific than the general <i>edm:wasPresentAt </i>that describe the role of a contributing person like <i>eclap:setDesigner</i> or <i>eclap:choreographer </i>in a specific Event. At the time of writing, the refinement of the Event modeling is still ongoing. We are discussing the possibility of using the <i>crm:P11_had_participant</i> property or subproperties in edm:Event. We will, however, need as many properties as roles as it is currently the case re-using the ECLAP properties. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">For further technical insights, the ideas and solutions implemented in the <i>Specialised Information Service Performing Arts </i>are explained in more detail in<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13222-016-0241-6\"> <span class=\"s2\">Beck, J., Büchner, M., Bartholmei, S., Knepper, M. <i>Datenbank Spektrum (2017)</i>. doi:10.1007/s13222-016-0241-6</span></a></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n<p><br><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>The full set of guidelines is currently being documented at <a href=\"https://github.com/j4lib/fid-dk/tree/master/docs\">https://github.com/j4lib/fid-dk/tree/master/docs</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>http://purl.org/spar/pro/</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Re-using EDM in Nomisma.org'
        intro: null
        body: "<p>For several years now Europeana has made a lot of efforts to make\_the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/EDM_WhitePaper_17062015.pdf\">Europeana Data Model an interoperable framework</a> for describing digital cultural heritage data. We strived in making EDM as re-usable as possible for the community. It is therefore always great to see such news!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>On extending the <a href=\"https://t.co/F2TXI1DYnm\">https://t.co/F2TXI1DYnm</a> data model with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">@Europeanaeu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IIIF?src=hash\">#IIIF</a> specs with coins from Rutgers <a href=\"https://t.co/l6Cr9JHi6n\">https://t.co/l6Cr9JHi6n</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/lawdi?src=hash\">#lawdi</a></p>\r\n— Ethan Gruber (@ewg118) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewg118/status/817115926969585664\">January 5, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>EDM has been designed as a flexible model that is meant to be re-used by the Cultural Heritage community to cover their domain specific requirements. And it is exactly what the Nomisma.org project did by re-using only one part of the model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Europeana decided to incorporate the International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>) service to its service infrastructure, we needed a solution to describe IIIF resources within EDM. As for every extension of the model, we tried to root as much as possible EDM into existing standards and expert communities. It was therefore natural for us to adopt the solutions defined by the IIIF community to enable links to IIIF resources in the metadata. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-profiles#iiif-to-edm-profile\">EDM profile for IIIF</a> explains to data providers how to make their IIIF resources available as part of the metadata they send to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://nomisma.org/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Nomisma.org</a> is a collaborative project that provides stable digital representations of numismatic concepts according to the principles of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">Linked Open Data</a>. The project has <a href=\"http://nomisma.org/documentation/contribute#iiif\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">updated their RDF data model</a> with the features of the EDM profile for IIIF in order to serve the IIIF resources of their new data contributor (the Rutgers University's <a href=\"http://coins.libraries.rutgers.edu/romancoins/\">Badian Collection</a>) into the <a href=\"http://numismatics.org/crro\">Coinage of the Roman Republic Online</a> portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In modeling terms, the Nomisma reference image currently represented as a <i>foaf:depiction </i>gives rise to an <i>edm:WebResource</i>. The new <i>edm:WebResource</i> is linked to a JSON-LD IIIF manifest or information object (via <i>dcterms:isReferencedBy</i>) and to the URI for the service (with the <i>svcs:has_service</i> property). The service (<i>svcs:Service</i>) should include several statements that defines it as a IIIF image service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'courier new'; font-size: 14px\">&lt;edm:WebResource rdf:about=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/api/iiif/image/2.0/rutgers-lib:45878;PTIF-1/full/600,/0/default.jpg\"&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;svcs:has_service rdf:resource=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/api/iiif/image/2.0/rutgers-lib:45878;PTIF-1\"/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;dcterms:isReferencedBy rdf:resource=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/api/iiif/image/2.0/rutgers-lib:45878;PTIF-1/info.json\"/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/edm:WebResource&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;svcs:Service rdf:about=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/api/iiif/image/2.0/rutgers-lib:45878;PTIF-1\"&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;dcterms:conformsTo rdf:resource=\"http://iiif.io/api/image\"/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;doap:implements rdf:resource=\"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level1.json\"/&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;/svcs:Service&gt;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The user interface in Numishare (and Coinage of the Roman Republic Online) are now displaying coin images using the <a href=\"http://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF\">Leaflet </a><a href=\"https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF\">IIIF-viewer</a> and allows the query of the IIIF manifest metadata via the <i>dcterms:isReferencedBy</i>. An example of a Rutgers coin is available at <a href=\"http://numismatics.org/crro/id/rrc-474.2b\">http://numismatics.org/crro/id/rrc-474.2b</a> (see \"Denarius - Sydenham 999 - Crawford 474/2b.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nomisma case is a great example of the vision underpinning EDM in which data models can be designed is a decentralised way for specific domain applications while the created data remains interoperable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This post is based on Ethan Gruber’s blog post: <a href=\"http://numishare.blogspot.nl/2017/01/rutgers-universitys-badian-collection.html\">http://numishare.blogspot.nl/2017/01/rutgers-universitys-badian-collection.html</a></p>\r\n"

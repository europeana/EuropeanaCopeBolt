        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Conceptually, the design of the exhibition at the Fashion Museum will be consistent with the sculptural fashion of Madame Grès. To achieve this, MoMu will work with the Belgian artist Renato Nicolodi, who has designed new elements and installations for the exhibition spaces and will also exhibit own work. His archetypal, minimalist and classically inspired works take on a stimulating dialogue with the work of Madame Grès. MoMu welcomes and recomposes the retrospective of Madame Grès from musée Gallièra, musée de la Mode de la Ville de Paris, which was pre- sented in 2011 at the musée Bourdelle in Paris. This exhibition reunites Madame Grès silhouettes originating mostly from the Gallièra collections as well as some private collections.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en/\">MoMu</a>.</p>"

She has won great acclaim ever since. Iris van Herpen is renowned for her remarkable outfits in which she combines traditional craftsmanship and zealous handwork with innovative techniques. Van Herpen’s work harmonizes with an important field of interest in the Groninger Museum, namely, the interface of art, design and fashion. The Iris van Herpen exhibition has been compiled by Sue-an van der Zijpp, curator of present-day art, and Mark Wilson, chief curator.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.groningermuseum.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Groninger Museum</a>.</p>"

Nature and structure are central to her decompartmentalised, multidisciplinary handiwork where textile fibre stands out as the media par excellence.</p>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Manipulated in all its forms and often in surprising ways, fibre is assembled into creations exploring the human condition and our cultural roots. Perception, intuition, identity, emotion, memory and poetry are the artist’s driving creative forces.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Her desire to separate out disciplines leads Carole to associate, for example, nature and textile, clothing and architecture, fibre and sound. Transcending the ephemeral, delicate nature of the medium, she stages architectural installations that often incorporate sound elements to create environments bursting with intense emotional and aesthetic experiences.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more info, please visit \_<a href=\"http://www.cite-dentelle.fr/spip.php?article463\" target=\"_blank\">la Cité internationale de la dentelle et de la mode de Calais</a>.\nCredits image:\_Fred Collier @ pixopale.com</p>\n\n</div>"

Since The Museum at FIT collection is especially strong in designer fashion from the 20th and 21st centuries, it decided to organize an exhibition that focuses on modern and contemporary fashion and accessories from the collection.\_A companion book, to be published by TASCHEN in fall 2012, will feature more than 500 photographs of fashions from the museum's collection, as well as photographs of many of our exhibitions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.fitnyc.edu/12469.asp\" target=\"_blank\">The Museum at FIT</a>.\nCredits image: Charles James, evening dress in silk taffeta and net, 1955, USA, gift of Robert Wells In Memory of Lisa Kirk.</p>"

Special attention is reserved for national and international subcultures, in which the jean is a product for the masses that expresses uniformity, but at the same time a most personal garment that reflects individuality. The exhibition also looks at the DNA of jeans: the materials, buttons, labels and their typical indigo blue colour. The highly polluting production process and current innovative sustainable alternatives, such as ‘zero water waste’ and ‘ozone’ treatments, are also part of the exhibition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/exhibitions/Jeans/\" target=\"_blank\">Centraal Museum</a>.\nCredits image: Gluejeans Revolution Jeans © Bill Tanaka.</p>"

        body: "<p>Even before 1947 and the creation of the couture house bearing his name, Christian Dior put his talent to work as costume designer for the cinema, collaborating with renowned filmmakers such as Claude Autant-Lara and René Clair. Christian Dior’s 1947 success brought other filmmakers to call on his talent, and he often gave in to their demands in spite of his bustling activity within the House of Dior. We owe it to Marlene Dietrich that the name of Christian Dior came to be associated with one of the greatest filmmakers of the twentieth century, Alfred Hitchcock. For the exhibition, the Berlin Film Archive has exceptionally loaned an exhibit dedicated to the actress, who wore Dior on the screen and in the streets. Admiring his talent as a designer, other actresses have made and still make Christan Dior\_their chosen couture.\_ You’ll see some of the sumptuous gowns designed for the actresses whose faces have become synonymous with the brand, bringing you up close to the magical, dreamlike universe which is the cinematic trademark of the House of Dior.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.musee-dior-granville.com/c/287/p/c51e42661f7441dff4f2bfd9a1bab0c8/Stars-in-Dior.html\" target=\"_blank\">Musée Christian Dior</a>.\nCredits image: Marilyn Monroe\_in Dior\_photographed by\_Bert Stern during the shooting\_ of The Last Sitting, in the Bel-Air hotel in Los Angeles, june 1962. © BERT STERN</p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The British Fashion Council was formed in 1983 out of the Fashion Industry Action Group, an ad hoc group created in 1981. The British Fashion Council aims to showcase British designers and develop London’s position as a major player in the international fashion arena. As a result, London Fashion Week ranks alongside New York, Milan and Paris as one of the 'Big Four’. The BFC showcase the best of British designer collections to international press and buyers at a globally recognised event, London Fashion Week. The current venue for most of the \"on-schedule\" events is Somerset House in central London, where a large marquee in the central courtyard hosts a series of catwalk shows by top designers and fashion houses, while an exhibition, housed within Somerset House itself, shows over 150 designers. However, many \"off-schedule\" events, such as Vauxhall Fashion Scout and On|Off, are organised by other private-funded groups and take place at other venues in central London.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">London Fashion Week</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"></p>"

This approach paints a picture of Chloé that is both familiar and yet unexpected. Iconic looks are presented alongside lesser-known yet equally influential designs. Many of these were rediscovered during the creation of the new archive developed since Waight Keller’s arrival. Most importantly, these are on display to the public for the very first time.\_The exhibition is curated and designed by renowned exhibition-maker Judith Clark and staged in the newly refurbished galleries of Le Palais de Tokyo.\_Focusing equally on Chloé’s key designers and the Maison’s enduring themes, garment groupings serve to underscore Gaby Aghion’s original vision for the brand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"https://palaisdetokyo.com/en/exhibition/chloe-attitudes\" target=\"_blank\">Palais de Tokyo</a>.</p>"

Encompassing two centuries of fashion history, this exhibition is designed to show the evolution of styles and silhouettes while contextualizing the pieces with relevant political, technological and cultural developments.</p>'
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The first gallery spans the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. This was a period of revolutionary change that can clearly be seen reflected in the fashions. The American and French Revolutions radically changed the political landscapes while the industrial revolution transformed how goods, particularly clothing and textiles, were made. The luxury and rococo excesses of the eighteenth century gave way to the romanticism and neoclassicism of the early nineteenth century. The next room includes the second half of the nineteenth century to the dawn of World War I. Synthetic dyes opened up a world of color and the sewing machine facilitated the application of yards of ruffles, pleats, and fringe. The upholstered, heavy styles of the Victorian era eventually gave way to Edwardian froth and lace. The final room finishes the timeline with fashions of the early twentieth century. While it may have been a period of world wars and depression, fashions also reflected the heydays of jazz and swing, the boldness of Art Deco, and the endless possibilities of technology from plastics to rockets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.kent.edu/museum/exhibits/exhibitdetail.cfm?customel_datapageid_2203427=3134506\" target=\"_blank\">Kent State University Museum</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"></p>"

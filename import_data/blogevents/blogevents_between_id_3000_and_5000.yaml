        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The exhibition will bring thirty two of the most splendid examples to London for the first time. They include the richly embroidered costume from Astypalaia in the Dodecanese, the astonishing assembly of fabrics, colours and jewellery from Stefanoviki in Thessaly and the superbly brocaded dress from Jannina in Epirus. The exhibition will also illustrate the interplay of native tradition and western aesthetic by displaying the court dress of the first Queen of the independent Greek state, Amalia of Oldenburg and that of her successor at the end of the nineteenth century, Queen Olga, the Russian-born consort of King George I. These splendid costumes represent a synthesis that is emblematic of nineteenth century nation building. All but two of the costumes come from the superb collection of the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation in Nafplio. The other two are being lent by The Benaki Museum of Athens. The curator of the exhibition is the Foundation’s director and renowned expert, Ioanna Papandoniou. The designer is Stamatis Zannos.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://81.19.183.3/~hellenic/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hellenic Centre</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>Self-educated Spanish couturier Manuel Piña played a key role in the revitalization of Spanish fashion. He started his career in the textile sector in the 1970s, achieving great success with his knitted garments which perfectly fitted the market needs of the moment. Aware of his creative gift and of his ability to fulfill the wishes of Spanish women, who were by then starting their comparatively late emancipation process, Manuel Piña entered the world of design in the early 1980s. He created his first catwalk collections in the same period in which the Spanish prêt-à-porter industry was taking shape. Just days before the general elections of 1982, Manuel Piña broke new ground with a spectacular collection which he presented under the circus dome of the Ciudad de los Muchachos. From that moment to the end of his career in 1990, his clothes, which merged tradition, handicraft and avant-garde design, never failed to mesmerize women who were yearning for modernity. Powerful and sensuous, “Piña women” became leading characters of the cultural movement known as “Movida madrileña” and perfect symbols of the brave new times.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://museodeltraje.mcu.es/index.jsp?id=640&amp;ruta=3,16,170,725\" target=\"_blank\">Museo del Traje</a>.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"

More than 150 items are selected by Piet Paris from the Centraal Museum collection and presented in a surprising manner: as scenes in a musical. Taking the visitor from backstage and the red carpet to – eventually- the stage, he shows\_ more than fifty looks by designers such as Comme des Garçons, Maison Martin Margiela, Iris van Herpen, Viktor &amp; Rolf, but also 17th\_and 18th\_century costumes. Paris wants to show fashion in context, and not isolation. He combines fashion with objects, which he actually puts to use: ticking clocks, flower-filled vases and burning lights. He breaks the anonymity of the mannequin by giving each one a complete outfit, as well as a face drawn by the illustrator himself. Piet Paris literally brings the Centraal Museum collection to life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/exhibitions/fashion-muscial-Piet-Paris-selects/\" target=\"_blank\">Centraal Museum</a>.\nImage: \_illustration Piet Paris, 2014</p>"

These pieces, even though small in size, are true works of art for the preciousness of the materials and techniques in which they are manifactured. Made by craftsmen from various disciplines, passementiers, embroiderers, goldsmiths, glass-makers, potters or paruriers, these buttons crystallize themself the memory and the evolution of a certain \"savoir-faire\". They have also attracted the interest of many artists: painters, sculptors and famous jewelry designers created unique designs for different fashion houses.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The study of the use of buttons allows another approach to fashion history. We can discover how each designer turned it into a fashion accessory. More importantly, the exhibition reveals for the first time how each button is used to emphatisize, structure and draw a silhouette.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The exhibition is an opportunity to view this extraordinary collection with a selection of more than 100 apparel and accessories for men and women in a setting designed by the scenographer Eric Benqué.\nFor more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/\">Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Photo: Courrèges, collection Couture Fashion, spring-summer 1970\_\_© Patrick Sauteret</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The exhibition \"Boro: The fabric of life\" presents 54 pieces (kimonos, purses, tatamis) produced using the Boro method. “Boro” means rag and consists of stitching and weaving different fabrics, being the textile pieces subsequently dyed with indigo. This was a common technique in Japan since de late eighteenth century to mid-twentieth century, spreading throughout Japan for about 200 years, since its social and economic structure remained unchanged until the early twentieth century.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">These pieces were seldom in cotton, as this material was intended to wealthier classes. Boro pieces were woven from indigenous plants like hemp, ramie, paper mulberry, wisteria and nettle. The peasants would buy scraps of cloth and used clothes and transform them into unique Japanese pieces to obtain more resistant textiles.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">For more information about the exhibition, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/exposicoes/boro-fabric-of-life_46.html\" title=\"MUDE, Libsoa\">Mude, Lisboa</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Manuel Brito</p>"

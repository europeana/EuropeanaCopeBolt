Most museum collections are locked away from their users, even though there is a strong case to be made for giving direct access. MoMu and the University of Antwerp (Faculty of Design Sciences, Conservation Studies) are setting up an accessible collection compiled for the sole purpose of study, research, training and inspiration. We strongly believe this will initiate a new dialogue with our users, and we want our study collection to be usable and reusable in every aspect.\n\n</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">Is fashion art? A simple question conceals the complex universe of an articulated relationship that has long been investigated, but without arriving at a clear and unequivocal definition. This project analyses the forms of dialogue between these two worlds: reciprocal inspirations, overlaps and collaborations, from the experiences of the Pre-Raphaelites to those of Futurism, and from Surrealism to Radical Fashion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition itinerary focuses on the work of Salvatore Ferragamo, who was fascinated and inspired by the avant-garde art movements of the 20th century, on several ateliers of the Fifties and Sixties that were venues for studies and encounters, and on the advent of the culture of celebrities. It then examines the experimentation of the Nineties and goes on to ponder whether in the contemporary cultural industry we can still talk about two separate worlds or if we are instead dealing with a fluid interplay of roles.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The distinctive aspect of the exhibition layout lies in the collaboration with other cultural institutions, which took an active part in implementing this concept with the aim of inspiring joint reflection: in addition to the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, promotor and organizer of the project together with the Fondazione Ferragamo, in Florence the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, the Gallerie degli Uffizi (the Galleria d’arte moderna di Palazzo Pitti and the Galleria del Costume), the Museo Marino Marini, and in Prato the Museo del Tessuto.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.ferragamo.com/museo/en/usa/exhibitions/\">Museo Salvatore Ferragamo</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: Salvatore Ferragamo,Tirassegno, 1958, pump in ochre suede with polychrome kidskin appliqués.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">As part of the Normandy Impressionist festival, the exhibition \"Women in Dior. Sublime Elegance of a Portrait\", on show at the Christian Dior Museum, invites visitors to discover the designer’s work and inspirations through the women who have chosen and worn the creations of the maison.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After the designer’s sketches, the workshop realization and the presentation on the catwalk, customers give new life to the creations, adapting them to their personalities and the world they live. Worn by the customer, the dress takes on her identity and her history. They show how the Dior fashion house helps to “make women more beautiful”, in the words of Christian Dior himself, and to construct their social identity.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition reveals the allure of the stars who wear Dior. These figures of elegance, from both France and other countries, include women from the worlds of the aristocracy, entertainment, theatre and cinema. These portraits 'in Dior' show icons of refinement and distinction such as the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace of Monaco, Lady Diana, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Soraya, or stars like Maria Callas, Elizabeth Taylor, Olivia de Havilland, Josephine Baker and Marilyn Monroe. The exhibit portrays also Dior’s major customers and close friends: Geneviève Page, Suzanne Luling or Mitzah Bricard, for example, alongside stars of today such as Marion Cotillard, Charlize Theron and Rihanna.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A selection of models evoking both famous and anonymous women wearing Dior illustrates the fashion house’s style and its many faces. A stunning collection of ninety haute couture dresses, as well as photographs, drawings and paintings, showcasing the harmonious way in which a Dior design and the wearer’s individual image and personality enhance one another. Magazines show them at events or social gatherings. Memories, anecdotes, family portraits, and press images all highlight the uniqueness of each woman in Dior.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be on show until May 25th.

As a result, her collection is shown at the MoMu Gallery in the solo exhibition ‘How to Catch a Fish’. The peculiar title of the exhibition has been inspired by an article that caught the eye of the designer and said: ‘we catch the fish faster than they procreate’. Her collection makes a statement against the fast-moving rhythm of the times, in search for authentic simplicity and the bare necessities for a happy life. In the Gallery are also shown her beautiful drawings that visually illustrate her own design universe, inspired by artists like David Hockney, Alex Katz and Ellsworth Kelly.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/tentoonstelling/momu-galerij-momu-award-2016-how-to-catch-a-fish.html\">event page on the MoMu website</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Image: Charlotte Pittoors, ‘How to Catch a Fish’, ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</p>"

La Donna che Legge’, curated by Jean Louis Froment in collaboration with Gabriella Belli, is on show at Ca’ Pesaro International Gallery of Modern Art in Venice, Italy, from the 17th September 2016 to the 8th January 2017.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">‘La Donna che Legge’ is the seventh issue of the ‘Culture Chanel’ exhibitions curated by Jean Louis Froment that disclose through its key elements the vocabulary of Gabrielle ‘Coco’ Chanel and her House. This time, the focus is on the relationship between the fashion creator and the written word. Featuring around 350 works ranging from texts, photographs and sketches, the exhibition offers an insight on the private library of Coco Chanel, showing her strong bounds with the culture of her time. The vast selection of books and art objects, that come from the shelves of the designer's apartment in Rue Cambon, helps to reconstruct the modern world of Coco Chanel through the works and the words of the authors that helped to form it.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://culture.chanel.com/\">event page on Culture Chanel website</a>.</p>\n<p>Image: Portrait of Gabrielle Chanel on her sofa looking at her library July 1962 - Photography Douglas Kirkland Collection, Los Angeles.

        body: "<p>The exhibition 'Brides at the Leventis Museum: tradition and fashion in Greece and Cyprus' is on show at the Leventis Municipal Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus, from the 30th November 2016 to the 23rd April 2017.</p>\n<p>The Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia gathers the costumes of two countries that history has both united and divided, Greece and Cyprus, in an exhibition that features pieces from the collections of the Cypriot museum and the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation. 'Brides at the Leventis Museum' explores the changes of the wedding gowns in the two countries in relation to the events that characterised their history during a period that includes two World Wars and the independence of Cyprus. Ranging from the late nineteenth century to 1974, the bridal gowns on show cover over one hundred years of historical and social events, culminating with the year 1974, chosen by the curator of the exhibition as the year in which ‘the centuries-long order of things of the indigenous population was ruptured, dramatically and irrevocably changing the socio-economic structures’.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.leventismuseum.org.cy/\">Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia website</a> to learn more.</p>\n<p>Image: Nicosia, 1967.

        body: "<p>Japanese fashion is a strong brand that sets the tone for fashion trends worldwide, in streetwear and couture. The collections by the Japanese designers Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo in Paris in the early 1980s were a turning point in fashion history. They thoroughly shook up the clothing industry with their frayed, loose and ripped black designs and they introduced a totally new fashion concept. From that moment on, the West started focusing on everything Japanese and it resumed an old, intercultural dialogue.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\nFascinating innovations by Japanese avant-garde designers and their younger colleagues and western interpretations of ‘Japanese’ aesthetics are the core of the Across Japan exhibition. Emphasis is placed on fashions created in the last 35 years, but the exhibition also pays attention to the historical context. After all, western interest in Japan goes back to the 17th century.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>\nFor more information, please visit\_<a href=\"http://www.modemuseumhasselt.be/#/tentoonstelling/across-japan/nl/id/174\">Modemuseum Hasselt Website</a></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo:</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol start=\"0\"><li>Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano, Fall 2015 Couture.

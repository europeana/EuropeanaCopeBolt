        body: '<p>This is the first major exhibition in Italy to be dedicated to the extraordinary and complex Diana Vreeland (Paris, 1903 - New York, 1989). It will explore the many sides of her work and seek to offer a fresh approach with which to interpret the elements of her style and way of thinking. The title stresses the need today to decontextualise the many facets that go to make up her kaleidoscopic career and to reconnect them in a new reading of the multiple meanings underlying her now legendary professional and human experience. The exhibition will not limit itself to displaying some garments, although it will indeed be possible to admire many and extraordinary items; it will instead “short-circuit” time, the objects on show and their “aura”, showing how fashion is both a complex phenomenon and the perfect observatory for interpreting the tastes and trends of contemporary society. The aim being to restore a sense of the “magnificent gait” with which Diana Vreeland processed through fashion of the 20th century, initially during her years at “Harper’s Bazaar” and “Vogue”, and then in her role as Special Consultant for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>'

How did they succeed in taking the pulse of their respective periods to innovate and take an entire industry forward? How did these two personalities, each with their own language, appropriate cultural phenomena and codes to write the history of contemporary fashion? An analysis rather than a retrospective, this parallel Vuitton-Jacobs comparison will provide new insight into the fashion system during its pivotal periods, beginning with its industrialisation and ending with its globalisation, focussing also on its artistic professions and crafts, technological advances, stylistic creations and artistic collaborations. It will also be homecoming for Louis Vuitton, who set up shop only a stone’s throw from the Louvre, the home of his first great patron, Empress Eugénie. Over a century separates Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs, but both come together in the excellence of their creativity.</p>\n<p>Fore more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr\" target=\"_blank\">Les Arts Décoratifs</a>.</p>"

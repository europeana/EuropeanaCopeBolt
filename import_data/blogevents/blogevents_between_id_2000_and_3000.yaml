        body: "<p>With its exclusive London boutiques, the family-run business of Fior was, for decades, the number-one address for costume jewellery and luxury accessories of the highest order. Apart from stars of the stage and screen, such as Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, the international jet-set also numbered among its customers, as did members of several European royal families.</p>\n<p>Lawrence Feldman started collecting for the Fior Collection as early as the 1950s, by setting aside some of the most dazzling items from each season's collection in his range of jewellery. Most of the objects in this unique collection, which stem from leading international manufacturers such as Trifari, Marcel Boucher and Louis Rousselet, are remarkable for displaying a great proximity in style and craftsmanship to 'real' jewellery of gold, silver, and gemstones.\_ Particularly noteworthy in this regard are the ensembles produced by the German Pforzheim-based company Henkel &amp; Grosse and Mitchel Maer of London, created exclusively for the French couturier Christian Dior and which rank among the finest and most elaborate costume jewellery articles ever made. The Fior Collection of London frequently features manifold sets which impressively demonstrate the different design varieties for necklace, bracelet, brooch and clip earrings.</p>\n<p>In the exhibition the approximately 290 selected jewellery items on display are accompanied by some 120 original fashion photographs from the Lipperheide Costume Library, which depict the fashion trends of each decade from 1950 to 1990.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.smb.museum/smb/kalender/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=37161&amp;type_id=10\" target=\"_blank\">Staatliche Museen zu Berlin</a>.</p>\n<p>Image: brooch Kenneth Jay Lane (U.S.), circa 1965 metal, gold-plated and rhodium-coated, faceted glass stones and cabochons, faux coral, 9.5 x 7 cm.\_© National Museums in Berlin, photo: Martin Gosewisch</p>"

The exhibition is one of the many projects of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp celebrating its 350th anniversary. The exhibition will highlight various aspects of Antwerp fashion education during the first fifty years of its existence: the department's specific curriculum and its education and evaluation methods, the importance of graphic design in fashion, the various generations of students and their careers, the friendship and emergence of the 'Antwerp Six'\_(Ann Demeulemeester, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Van Saene, Walter Van Beirendonck, Marina Yee, Dirk Bikkembergs) and Martin Margiela, and the graduation projects of some of the most noteworthly alumni. The exhibition illustrates how diverse the careers of the Academy's alumni are and how this programme has left a mark on the international fashion world.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en/exhibitions/upcoming/\" target=\"_blank\">MoMu - Fashion Museum of Antwerp</a>.</p>"

The vestiments weren’t prescripted in the 19th century, despite what people tend to think. In fact, the first platforms to conceale increased from the 14th century till present times. Thanks to the preserved items, only rare presented in public, the exhibition can be understood as a long history of “coulisses” of clothing and fashion relevant for the diversity of mechanisms.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/francais/mode-et-textile/expositions-70/prochainement-446/la-mecanique-des-dessous-une/\">Les Arts Décoratifs Paris</a></p>"

        body: "<p>Utrecht is a cultural magnet. It has been for over 2000 years: artists, artisans, religious figures, politicians, philosophers and scientists found their place here, left something behind, shaping Utrecht as they went. All these objects are represented in the collections <em>city history</em>, <em>old painting</em>, <em>modern art</em>, <em>applied art</em>, but also in <em>fashion design &amp; costumes</em>. In \"Dit is het Centraal Museum\" (\"This is the Centraal Museum!\"), you will find a 17th-century leather buff coat as well as a slightly earlier pointed leather hat with a large brim. The hat was found between the bricks of one of the walls of the City orphanage in the year 1875. In the next room, a finely woven linen summer dress is presented. Its dome formed skirt gives an idea of the practicality of a bourgeois woman's outfit on a hot summer day in 1860. A few rooms away, across high-end furniture and paintings, are the more recent pieces by Iris van Herpen, Klavers van Engelen and Viktor &amp; Rolf. With its close to complete collection of historical fashion, Centraal Museum now focuses on designers who dare to cross the borders of the discipline of fashion.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/exhibitions/masterpieces/\" target=\"_blank\">Centraal Museum</a>.\nImage: ©\_Centraal Museum/Ernst Moritz</p>"

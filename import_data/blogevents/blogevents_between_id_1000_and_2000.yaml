The\_curators Stefania Ricci and Sergio Risaliti have succeded at presenting a different perspective of Monroe's life and career. Focusing on the star's classic poses and expressions, the exhibition displays Monroe's famous photographs, juxtaposed alongside 17th century Florentine artworks, proving her affinity with muses from ancient paintings.\_The museum also\_presents Marylin's everyday life photographs, correspondence and personal clothing, which varied considerably from what she has been seen wearing on screen. Marylin, being the most loyal of Ferragamo's customers, has made his four inch- heel pumps world famous. Thirty of her neutrally coloured Ferragamo stilettos can also be seen on display.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.museoferragamo.it/en/mostre-incorso.php?id=32\">Museo Salvatore Ferragamo</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\"And the Bead Goes On\" features twentieth and twenty-first century women’s fashions which display inventive beadwork embroidery. This seemingly modern surface decoration, the variety of bead materials and shapes, and the basic sewing techniques used to embellish the fashions on view were developed in Paris workshops in the eighteenth century. Talented designers and skillful artisans collaborate to achieve dazzling fashions that are comfortable and durable. Glass beads, metallic sequins, metal filigree beads, faux pearls, and faceted crystal rhinestones hand-sewn onto the cloth impart beauty, opulence, and artful originality.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Fashion was democratized in the 1960s, and previously exclusive beaded style became available to all. The fashion industry today, while still centered in Paris, includes major designers from India, Lebanon, and Nigeria, and elsewhere. \"And the Bead Goes On\" presents evening gowns, cocktail dresses, and ensembles from the museum’s fashion collection, complemented with exciting new works on loan from contemporary designers. Designer names featured in the exhibition include Halston, Bob Mackie, Giorgio Armani, Oscar de la Renta, Lisa Folawiyo, and Alber Elbaz for Lanvin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mintmuseum.org/art/exhibitions/detail/and-the-bead-goes-on\">The Mint Museum</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology presents \"Ivy Style\", celebrating the 'Ivy League Look', which originated from elite, all-male, American universities, such as Harvard, Yale, and especially Princeton. The\_classic, sometimes viewed as static style was a cutting-edge look, which by 50's managed to spread beyond the campus to a diverse population of young men. It became codified as “Ivy style” and it has continued to impact men's fashion until this day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The exhibition focuses on menswear that dates from the early days of Ivy to the present.\_ The gallery is divided into thematical sections, creating an overall setting evoking the liveliness of an Ivy League university campus such as a classroom, a dorm or a library. Each “environment” presents material that is appropriate to it, with clothing that ranges from casual to formal, and from old to new. Daywear, evening wear, and even sports clothes from not only Brooks Brothers and J. Press, but also Chipp and Gant intermingle with work by contemporary designers, such as Ralph Lauren, Michael Bastian, and Thom Browne.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.fitnyc.edu/12890.asp\">Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The Savannah College of Art and Design Museum presents the \"Little Black Dress\" exhibition curated by André Leon Talley. The exhibition focuses on the garment's historical significance as well as its contemporary impact on the fashion world, tracing the bold curve of social history across the 20th and 21st centuries. Moreover, it\_explores the evolution of a definitive yet democratic style that, for more than a century, has embodied the shifting social tides of the modern world. In its ubiquity and versatility, the little black dress has delivered some of the most indelible images of our visual age. Endlessly appropriated and translated, each dress is imbued with the value of its day — from service to independence, from restraint to temptation, from glamour to grace. The dress has become\_a metaphor for the collapse of convention in haute couture, which\_can be proven by\_numerous\_contemporary interpretations of it such as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Prada, Balenciaga and Caroline Herrera,\_displayed\_at the exhibition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.scadmoa.org/visit/calendar/2012/little-black-dress\">SCAD Museum of Art</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>The image of the Fado singer wearing her traditional black veil is increasingly further from today’s reality of Fado. This exhibition is centred on the musical and literary universe of Fado, viewing it from the perspective of fashion and the latter’s important contribution in creating the image of the new Fado singers. The objective is to focus on the diversity of styles of the different Fado musicians and singers, highlighting the clothes and the designers who dress them, so as to emphasise an image of modernity or of revitalised tradition that they evoke and personify.</p>\n<p>The exhibition is the result of a co-production with the <a href=\"http://www.museudofado.pt/\" target=\"_blank\">Fado Museum</a> and will be put on in both museums at the same time, creating a new circuit in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/_Temps/fado/fadoEN.html\" target=\"_blank\">MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda</a>.\nPhoto: Carminho by Lidija Kolovrat\_©\_Miguel Rodrigues <em>Voiture Maximum</em>.</p>"

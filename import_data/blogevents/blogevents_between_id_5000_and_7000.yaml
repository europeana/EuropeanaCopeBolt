Infact, despite outfits and garments in this period seem mostly inspired after uniforms, it’s not less interesting to consider that a specific literature for men’s fashion was rising. Intended for a public of professionals and consumers, these publications are the proof of a spectacular development of the business related to menswear. Vocabulary was enriched by a new and varied terminology for the fashionable men and a new figure, the dandy, finds its place on the scene.<br></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first year of the seminary is dedicated to a transdisciplinary approach on the sources of study of an area that certainly has publications that still remain less studied, for the obvious reason of women’s fashion.</p>\n<p>For more informations, please visit <a href=\"http://www.inha.fr/en/index.html\" title=\"Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art\">Institut National d’Histoire de l’Art</a>.</p>"

The exhibition “The Belgians. An Unexpected Fashion Story”, curated by Didier Vervaeren and held at BOZAR from the 5th of June to the 13th of September 2015 gives a unique historic overview of the DNA of Belgian fashion, starting with the legendary Antwerp Six (including Dries van Noten, Walter Van Beirendonck and Ann Demeulemeester) and working up to the individualistic creations of Martin Margiela, A.F. Vandevorst and Raf Simons. The exhibition also highlights the works of several influential players in various fashion and art disciplines. It also touches upon the importance of the fashion academies, especially the Antwerp Academy and La Cambre in Brussels. Naturally this exhibition would not be complete without emerging talent like Jean-Paul Lespagnard and Christian Wijnants.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.bozar.be/en/activities/80682-the-belgians\">BOZAR</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Kristina De Coninck for Martin Margiela S/S91 © Ronald Stoops.</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">This exhibition explores the impact of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and how China has fueled the fashionable imagination for centuries. In this collaboration between The Costume Institute and the Department of Asian Art, high fashion is juxtaposed with Chinese costumes, paintings, porcelains, and other art, including films, to reveal enchanting reflections of Chinese imagery.\nFrom the earliest period of European contact with China in the sixteenth century, the West has been enchanted with enigmatic objects and imagery from the East, providing inspiration for fashion designers from Paul Poiret to Yves Saint Laurent, whose fashions are infused at every turn with romance, nostalgia, and make-believe. Through the looking glass of fashion, designers conjoin disparate stylistic references into a pastiche of Chinese aesthetic and cultural traditions.\nThe exhibition features more than 140 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear alongside Chinese art. Filmic representations of China are incorporated throughout to reveal how our visions of China are framed by narratives that draw upon popular culture, and also to recognize the importance of cinema as a medium through which to understand the richness of Chinese history.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/china-through-the-looking-glass\">Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Roberto Cavalli (Italian, born 1940).

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">During AAH2016 Annual Conference and Bookfair of University of Edinburgh, hosted from the 7th to the 9th April 2016, will be held the conference \"The Place of Fashion Studies in Academia\".\nFashion Studies is a field of knowledge with deep historical roots within History of Art. However, as apparently disparate approaches flank the traditional historiographies of dress, its placement in scholarly settings is, today more than ever, up for discussion. Still innovating, even if Fashion Studies has been an academic topic for more than 30 years now, academics often feel the need to deconstruct disciplinary boundaries within this wide research area. While understanding fashion as a meaningful system within which the production of the cultural and aesthetic representations of the body is made possible, research in Fashion Studies all over the world is undertaken from different perspectives in diverse university departments, including History of Art, Media Studies, Design, Literature, and Cultural Studies. Thus, university programmes in Fashion Studies enrich their unique profiles alongside academic traditions connected to their own institutions, yet the global amount of graduates in this field undoubtedly shares a mutual ground. We believe that the interdisciplinarity of Fashion Studies is an advantage to all individuals and institutions involved. This panel aims to be an occasion to discuss what we have in common as scholars, our independent goals as researchers and our outlook on the future as educators. Therefore, we welcome contributions that highlight the copious nuances that can be explored within Fashion Studies, including, but not limited to:</p>\n<p>•   collaborations between educational institutions and the fashion industry\n•   higher-education programs combining Fashion Design and Fashion Studies\n•   academic journals specialising in Fashion; the predominance of English-speaking contributions within Fashion academia • pedagogical field research conducted within Fashion Studies programs\n•   the role of Fashion Studies in museums or heritage institutions\n•   historical trends in researching Fashion Studies among and across disciplines.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Email paper propsals to the session convenor(s) Alessandro Bucci, The University of Edinburgh, a.g.bucci@sms.ed.ac.uk and Chiara Faggella, Stockholm University, chiara.faggella@ims.su.se by 9 November 2015. <a href=\"http://www.aah.org.uk/media/docs/Call%20for%20Papers%20format%20guidelines(1).doc\">Download a Paper Proposal Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.aah.org.uk/annual-conference/sessions2016/session33\">AAH website</a> to know more.</p>\n<p>Photo: University quadrant, photo by Neale Smith.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">As of January 30 2015 Fashion Museum Hasselt takes you behind the scenes of Paul Smith’s World where intuitive creativity roosts. You are introduced to the astute designer behind this British label that started small, but has become one of the leading fashion brands in the world. This exhibition starts from Paul Smith’s personal archive. From his first pieces, sold in a tiny store in Nottingham all the way to the designer he is today, and with pieces from his most recent collections. Along the way, we’ll see the growth of this major fashion brand and we get a view of the sharp-witted mind of the designer. \"Hello My Name is Paul Smith\" peruses the various stages of design and production with the well-known hallmark of traditional craftsmanship with a contemporary twist. This exhibition reveals how Paul Smith works and what influences him, through projections, audio and video clips of catwalk shows and behind the scenes footage and an overview of all the unique Paul Smith shops. This exhibition was put together by the Design Museum London (curator: Donna Loveday), but Paul Smith’s Belgian world will be about 400 sq.m. larger than the British original. The fashion selection was specially expanded for the Hasselt Fashion Museum.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the world of Paul Smith.</p>\n<p>For more informations, please visit <a href=\"http://www.modemuseumhasselt.be/#/tentoonstelling/hallo-mijn-naam-is-paul-smith-hello-my-name-is-paul-smith/nl/id/140\">ModeMuseum Hasselt</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: ModeMuseum Hasselt.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">\"Maker &amp; Muse: Women and Early Twentieth Century Art Jewelry\" features more than 250 exemplary works of art jewelry between the Victorian Era and the First World War, including cloak clasps, hair ornaments, pins, brooches, rings, bracelets, pendants, necklaces, and several tiaras. This groundbreaking exhibition illuminates the international proliferation of art jewelry through the lens of woman as its maker and muse. For the first time during this period, women emerged as prominent jewelry makers in their own right, establishing independent studios amid changing social norms. In other regions, the female figure acted as a powerful muse, appearing in jewelry as audacious and novel motifs. Drawn from the Driehaus Collection’s extensive jewelry holdings and prominent national collections, many of these stunning pieces have never been seen by the public. The exhibition upholds the same ideals of beauty as did its makers, who in the early decades of the twentieth century were inspired by broader art movements of the day to create audacious pieces of jewelry with dramatic forms, intricate craftsmanship, saturated colors, and semiprecious stones. \"Maker &amp; Muse\" explores five different areas of jewelry design and fabrication: the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain, Art Nouveau in France, Jugendstil in Germany and Austria, Louis Comfort Tiffany in New York, and American Arts and Crafts in Chicago. Each section explores the important female figures and historic social milieu associated with these movements, and is accompanied by historic photographs and immersive decorative arts of the period, including furnishings, posters, and stained glass.</p>\n<p>For more informations, please visit <a href=\"http://www.driehausmuseum.org/maker-and-muse\">The Driehaus Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Frederick James Partridge (English, 1877-1942) for Liberty &amp; Co.

From privileged rulers to hyper-sexualized rock stars this provocative exhibition will explore the history of men in heels from the early 1600s to today, delving into the use and meanings of heeled footwear in men’s dress over the last four hundred years. “When heels were introduced into fashion at the turn of the 17th century, men were the first to adopt them and they continued wearing heels as expressions of power and prestige for over 130 years,” said Elizabeth Semmelhack, Senior Curator, Bata Shoe Museum. Offering rare examples of men’s heeled footwear from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, mid-nineteenth century military boots, 1930s cowboy boots and 1940s biker boots, visitors will also have the opportunity to view John Lennon’s original 1960s Beatle boot, platforms worn by Elton John in the 1970s, and recent heels from haute couture collections, all from the Museum’s own holdings.\nThe opening of Standing Tall will be one of the highlights of the Bata Shoe Museum’s 20th anniversary celebrations, that will include exciting events and activities through to May 2016, including a stylish gala birthday evening, a fun community weekend festival, commissioned art installations, performances, lectures, workshops and more. A complete list of planned activities will be available on the Museum website.</p>\n<p>For more informations please visit <a href=\"www.batashoemuseum.ca%20\">Bata Show Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Canadian, designed and made by Master John, 1973.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition “Fast Fashion”, that will be held at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg until the 25th of October 2015, casts a critical glimpse behind the scenes of glamorous fashion. It is bounded by the magic triangle of consumerism, economic interests and ecological issues, and throws light on these themes from the following aspects: fashion &amp; victims; poverty &amp; affluence; global &amp; local effects; wages &amp; profits; garments &amp; chemicals; clothes &amp; the ecological rucksack; new fibre technologies. One part of the exhibition consists of the “Laboratory”, a platform for ethical fashion labels and new approaches to design aspects such as recycling or upcycling. The laboratory shows what tomorrow’s ethically defensible wardrobe could look like. And finally the question is in the air: what influence does the consumer have? Fashion is a social regulative of a very special kind and is regarded as the pacemaker of social change. In this context the exhibition would like to encourage visitors to think actively about the whole topic of fashion and its social, economic and environmental impacts. To this end it offers comprehensive information and background facts researched together with eminent experts, presented in a scenography especially created for this exhibition The exhibition is being made possible with generous support from the Karin Stilke Stiftung and the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/exhibitions/current/fast-fashion.html\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Tim Mitchell, Clothing Recycled, 2005, © Tim Mitchell | www.timmitchell.co.uk</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Jazz Age. The Roaring 20s\", that will be held at Modemuseum Hasselt from the 12th of September 2015 to the 13th of March 2016, explores the fashion of the 20s in all its aspects. The original style of that age broke with established orders and values and flirted with Modernism. The new moral and social etiquette required entirely different fashions and under the impulse of avant-garde art movements, fashion was subjected to new enquiry. Cultivated by cinema and Hollywood, the figure of the 'flapper' became a stereotype of the spirit of that time and, although in reality very few women enjoyed such a lifestyle, women were nonetheless playing a much more active role in society. Men were changing too and, influenced by the great popularity of sports and leisure time activities, they started preferring a boyish, youthful look to the conservative appearances of their fathers. In addition, technological advancements and further development of synthetic fabrics boosted the garment industry. As a result, fashionable clothing became accessible to all layers of society. While designers also began focusing attention on prêt-à-porter, Paris remained the epicentre of fashion, and styles conceived in the couture salons were now quickly distributed throughout the growing mass market. Thanks to the relatively simple tailoring, fashions of the Twenties were easily copied. The fact that the 1920s were an inspiring time is seen in countless creations that adorn the catwalks today. Designers happily reach back to elements from that fascinating decade, and it is no accident that the principles of those exuberant years are at the foundations of today's contemporary fashion.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.modemuseumhasselt.be/#/tentoonstelling/jazz-age-the-roaring-20sjazz-age-de-bruisende-jaren-20/en/id/158\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Modemuseum Hasselt.

From the collection of the Museum of Applied Art\" displays the collection that Aleksandar Joksimović gave to the Museum of Applied Art in 2005. His bequest includes more than 230 sketches for clothing items, 300 fashion and show photographs, slides with representations of models, a sample book, portraits and drawings, prizes awarded to him and more than 500 press clippings. They, comprising a complete museum collection, serve as documents of Joksimović's opus, which placed him among the most important Serbian and Yugoslav fashion designers, whose talent is appreciated by international public as well. The importance of this collection is even greater if we take into account that samples of his realized models were not preserved even by the companies for which Joksimović worked, and only a few of them can be found in Serbian museums's funds.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more informations, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.mpu.rs/english/index.html\">Museum of Applied Arts, Belagrade.</a></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: \"Damned Jerina\" collection designed by Aleksandar Joksimović featured on the French issue of Elle magazine, 1969.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">Opening 7th November 2015, the exhibition \"La Mode Retrouvée, les robes trésors de la Comtesse Greffulhe\" held at Palais Galliera will focus on the wardrobe of Élizabeth, Countess Greffulhe, whose beauty and elegance was one of the main inspirations for Marcel Proust and the fashion designers of her time. Countess Greffulhe, née Élisabeth de Caraman-Chimay (1860-1952). She was the cousin of French dandy and poet Robert de Montesquiou and was immortalised for posterity by Marcel Proust as the Duchess of Guermantes in the famous novel \"In Search of Lost Time\". Countess Greffulhe was the epitome of elegance, with glorious outfits to match. Her public appearances were highly theatrical, with a sense of their being rare, fleeting and incomparably fascinating, in a cloud of tulle, gauze, chiffon and feathers, or in her kimono jackets, her velvet coats, with her oriental patterns, her shades of gold and silver, pink and green. The outfits were carefully chosen to emphasise her slim waist and her slender figure. On display at the Palais Galliera there are some fifty models bearing the labels of grands couturiers such as Worth, Fortuny, Babani, and Lanvin.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Knitting!\", on display at the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden until the 28th August 2016, presents a journey through the art of knitting. An ancient craft, which is also in vogue now. The exhibition is a celebration of knitting: you’ll see everything from historical patterns to the latest designs. Traditional Frisian baggy caps, retro fabrics from the 1950s and hooded sweaters from the 1980s are presented in unusual ways in a fairytale-like exhibition. Surprising garments by young, popular fashion designers such as Bas Kosters and Stephen West demonstrate how knitting still revitalises fashion. And bizarre knitted installations by international artists prove that knitting offers total creative freedom. In addition, during the exhibition there will be knitting every day in the Fries Museum in a special knitting room where anyone can join in. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, \"museum knitters\" will be in attendance. You can ask them for tips and tricks, and knit together with them. In addition, the museum will organise a knitting contest, knitting courses, a knitting café, an ugly Christmas sweater party, and more.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For further information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.friesmuseum.nl/exhibitions/knitting%3Fv%3Dverwacht?language=en&amp;v=verwacht\">Fries Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: \"Knitting!\" at the Fries Museum, all rights reserved. </p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">Held at the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute until February 21st 2016, the exhibition \"Jacqueline de Ribes: The Art of Style\" focuses on the internationally renowned style icon Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, whose originality and elegance established her as one of the most celebrated fashion personas of the twentieth century. The thematic show features about sixty ensembles of haute couture and ready-to-wear primarily from de Ribes's personal archive, dating from 1962 to the present. Also included are her creations for fancy-dress balls, which she often made by cutting and cannibalizing her haute couture gowns to create nuanced expressions of her aesthetic. These, along with photographs, video, and ephemera, tell the story of how her interest in fashion developed over decades, from childhood \"dress-up\" to the epitome of international style.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A muse to haute couture designers, de Ribes had at her disposal their drapers, cutters, and fitters in acknowledgment of their esteem for her taste and originality. Ultimately, she used this talent and experience to create her own successful design business, which she directed from 1982 to 1995. While the exhibition focuses on her taste and style, extensive documentation from her personal archives illustrates the range of her professional life, including her roles as theatrical impresario, television producer, interior designer, and director and organizer of international charity events.</p>\n<p>For more information about the exhibition, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/jacqueline-de-ribes?utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_medium=statusupdate&amp;utm_content=20151128&amp;utm_campaign=jacquelinederibes\">Metropolitan Museum’s Costume Institute</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Jacqueline de Ribes in her own design, 1983 Photograph by Victor Skrebneski, Skrebneski Photograph © 1983. <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2015/jacqueline-de-ribes/select-images\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, all rights reserved. </p>"

The exhibition will explore dress reformers and designers such as Paul Poiret, who argued for the beauty of the natural body, as well as entrepreneurs, inventors and innovators who have played a critical role in the development of increasingly more effective and comfortable underwear. On display will be over 200 objects for men and women together with fashion plates, photographs and film, advertisements and packaging to introduce changing concepts of the ideal body.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: Corset of satin with hand-made bobbin lace, possibly made in England, 1890-1895.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Une maison, des collections\", which will be on display through the 6th of March at the Christian Dior Museum in Granville offers a fresh look at the sources of Christian Dior’s inspiration and his creations. The first part of the exhibition is devoted to his childhood, to his mother Madeleine’s elegant outfits, and the Carnival costumes which inspired him. Then we are plunged into the great couturier’s life at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris, to discover his most loyal associates like his friend, fabric-designer Andrée Brossin de Méré, or the embroiderer Rébé. Next, a selection of models produced by Dior company during the decade 1947–57 reveals the spirit of the haute couture creations Christian Dior initiated, which would be carried on by his successors, from Yves Saint Laurent to Raf Simons.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Christian Dior Museum belongs to the city of Granville, and is the only Musée de France -recognized museum- devoted to a couturier, as well as obtaining the Maison des Illustres mark in 2012. Since 2010, following the summer season, it has been offering an Autumn/Winter exhibition: Une maison, des collections. This displays the collections conserved in Granville, acquired and restored by the Présence de Christian Dior association since the museum was founded in 1997. The presentation is renewed each year so as to allow visitors to discover all the richness of the stocks, while at the same time preserving the textile collections.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The display in this house where Christian Dior took his first steps is enhanced with loans from the Granville Museum of Art &amp; History and the Media Center of Granville (Heritage Collection), as well as from Christian Dior Couture.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://musee-dior-granville.com/en/les-expositions/Autumn-Winter-exhibition/\">Musée Christian Dior</a>, Granville.</p>\n<p>Photo: Musée Christian Dior, Granville, all rights reserved. </p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Fairy Tale Fashion\" - which will open on the 15th of January and will be on display through 16th April 2016 - will examine fairy tales through the lens of high fashion. The role dresses and costumes play in many fairy tales is central. They may indicate one's character virtues or faults, or they may be the magical instrument which helps the hero to overcome the forces against him.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Organized by associate curator Colleen Hill, the exhibition \"Fairy Tale Fashion\" features more than 80 objects placed within dramatic, fantasy-like settings designed by architect Kim Ackert. Since fairy tales are not often set in a specific time period, \"Fairy Tale Fashion\" includes garments and accessories dating from the 18th century to the present. The display explores many of the most famous fairy tales such as \"Rapunzel\",\"Little Red Riding Hood\", “The Little Mermaid”, “The Swan Maidens”, \"Cinderella\", \"The Snow Queen\" and \"Alice in Wonderland\", all of them part of different sections named \"Forest\", \"Castle, \"Sea\" and \"Parallel Worlds\". A particular emphasis is there on the extraordinary 21st-century fashions by designers such as Thom Browne, Dolce and Gabbana, Tom Ford, Giles, Mary Katrantzou, Marchesa, Alexander McQueen, Rick Owens, Prada, Rodarte, and Walter Van Beirendonck, among others. In addition, the exhibition’s introductory space features artwork that has played a role in shaping perceptions of a “fairy tale” aesthetic.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/fairy-tale-fashion.php\">Museum at FIT</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: Manish Arora, dress, 2010 (remade 2015), France.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">\"Fairy Tale Fashion\", on show at The Museum at FIT through the 16th April 2016, is a highly imaginative exhibition which displays high fashion in the traditional settings of the most famous fairy tales. Dress plays an important role in these tales, it could be the magical instrument through which the hero overcomes the struggles, or a symbol of power, status and vanity. Cinderella's glass slipper may be the most known example, but many others, such as \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Beauty and the Beast\" or \"The Wizards of Oz\" use dress to portray their characters' qualities.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition features more than 80 objects dating from the 18th century to the present, including the work of many 21st-century designers, whose creations distinguished themselves for their magical allure or oddity, like Thom Browne, Christian Louboutin, Dolce and Gabbana, Tom Ford, Giles, Mary Katrantzou, Marchesa, Alexander McQueen, Rick Owens, Prada, Rodarte, and Walter Van Beirendonck, among others. In the exhibition’s introductory space are also displayed the artworks which have played a role in shaping the fairy tale aesthetic. These include illustrations by renowned early 20th-century artists such as Edmund Dulac, Arthur Rackham, and A.H. Watson. Several recent, large-scale photographs from Kirsty Mitchell’s award-winning Wonderland series are also on display, the first time of Mitchell’s marvelous work — for which she designs and makes all of the elaborate costumes and sets — has been shown in the United States. Connections between fashion and storytelling are further emphasized by a small selection of clothing and accessories, including a clutch bag by Charlotte Olympia that resembles a leather-bound storybook.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/fairy-tale-fashion.php\">The Museum at FIT</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Manish Arora, dress, 2010 (remade 2015), France.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Game Changers – Reinventing the 20th century silhouette\", looks at the groundbreaking work of fashion designer Cristóbal Balenciaga whose innovations in the middle of the 20th century created a radically new silhouettte, in which the body got freedom of movement and architectural volumes created a space around the body. On show at MoMu - Fashion Museum of the Province of Antwerp - from the 18th of March to the 14th of August, it will display the \"game changers\" which in fashion provided an alternative for the prevailing constrictive hourglass silhouette. From the pioneers of haute couture in the 1920s and 1930s and later on, to the designers of the 1980s and 1990s, these designers looked at fashion of the 20th century from a new perspective. Influences from Japan, such as the kimono, liberated women from their tight corsets at the beginning of the 20th century. Fashion designers such as Madeleine Vionnet, Paul Poiret, Coco Chanel and Cristóbal Balenciaga  shaped this freedom in the 1920s – 1930s with technical innovations and modern ideas about feminity. At the end of the 20th century, the boundaries of the female silhouette are further explored by Japanese and Belgian designers such as Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garçons, Ann Demeulemeester and Martin Margiela. They paved the way for new body shapes and abstract silhouettes and gave a new interpretation of what could be considered as fashion.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The central figure in the exhibition is the Basque fashion designer Cristóbal Balenciaga  (1895-1972) who is seen as the pivotal figure between the two periods, the architect of innovation. His patterns and work are the central axis of the exhibition. Each of the other designers worked in their own way on similarly innovative ideas and shifted the boundaries of the classic feminine silhouette. In this way, fashion becomes more than a sequence of trends; fashion is a way to shape the body, space and movement. Rei Kawakubo’s \"Body meets Dress, Dress Meets Body\" collection of SS 1997 shows how these new shapes have become a part of the fashion vocabulary. The exhibition unites 100 unique couture and ready-to-wear silhouets by Cristóbal Balenciaga, Paul Poiret, Madeleine Vionnet, Gabrielle Chanel, but also Issey Miyake, Ann Demeulemeester, Comme des Garçons, Yohji Yamamoto, Maison Martin Margiela. With loans from prestigious collections of the museum of Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, the V&amp;A, MUDE Lisbon and Musée Galliera.</p>\n<p>For more information about the exhibition, please visit <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en/tentoonstelling/game-changers.html\">MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: © Comme des Garçons A/W 2012-13.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">To celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its fashion collection, The Musée des Arts Décoratifs will display the exhibition \"Fashion Forward, 3 Centuries of Fashion (1715-2016)\" from April 7 to August 14, 2016.\nThree hundred pieces  of men’s, women’s and children’s fashion, selected from a collection constantly enriched by donations and acquisitions will highlight the key moments in fashion history from the very late 17th century to the most contemporary creation. Freeing itself from the dictates of the conservation of works and the stringent conditions of their display, the exhibition is conceived as an ideal museum of fashion, featuring the finest examples of three centuries of creation habitually illustrated in reference books. It also provides a fascinating new insight into fashion’s evolution via its designers, clients and periods, because now more than ever at Les Arts Décoratifs, fashion is treated as an artistic field that has wide-ranging echoes in the museum’s other collections. Fashion is a history of evolving techniques, materials and designs but also a history of changing times and attitudes, a reflection of the art of living. Fashion is even more fascinating when it is not self-generating but dialogues with the arts of its time, as did great figures of Couture such as Charles-Frederick Worth, Jacques Doucet, Paul Poiret, Jeanne Lanvin, Madeleine Vionnet, Gabrielle Chanel, Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. The exhibition will also be an unique opportunity to showcase the jewels and highlight the particularities of a national fashion and textiles collection curated in full dialogue with the other departments of a museum dedicated to all the decorative arts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/en/exhibitions/forthcoming-events-1365/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/fashion-forward-3-siecles-de-mode-1715-2016\">Les Arts Décoratifs</a>.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">On view at The Jewish Museum, in New York City, from March 18th to August 7th 2016, the exhibition \"Isaac Mizrahi: An Unruly History\" is the first museum exhibition to focus on the influential American fashion designer, artist, and entrepreneur. It explores Isaac Mizrahi’s unique position at the intersection of high style and popular culture. While best known for his clothing designs, Mizrahi’s creativity has expanded over a nearly three decade career to embrace acting, directing, set and costume design, writing, and cabaret performance. Spanning his first collection in 1987 to the present day, An Unruly History weaves together the many threads of his prolific career, juxtaposing work in fashion, film, television, and the performing arts.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/isaac-mizrahi-an-unruly-history\">The Jewish Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Isaac Mizrahi, 2015.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">On show through the 10th July 2016, the exhibition \"#techstyle\" focuses on the new technologies and innovations that are explored by contemporary designers. Clothes that respond to the environment, dresses you can tweet, and garments that come off a 3-D printer ready to wear—all of these innovations are poised to have a profound impact on the future of the fashion industry. Designers have embraced these innovations and “#techstyle” explores how the synergy between fashion and technology is not only changing the way designers design, but also the way people interact with their clothing. The exhibition draws on the MFA’s collection of contemporary fashion and accessories, and features key pieces from innovators in the field including a digitally-printed dress from Alexander McQueen’s Plato’s Atlantis collection (Spring/Summer 2010/2011) and Iris van Herpen’s 3-D printed dress (2013) produced in collaboration with MIT designer and assistant professor Neri Oxman. Visitors experience the cutting edge of hi-tech fashion with special commissions created by CuteCircuit, Hussein Chalayan, Kate Goldsworthy, and Somerville-based Nervous System.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/techstyle\">Museum of Fine Art, Boston</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Designed by Iris van Herpen and Neri Oxman, printed by Stratasys, Anthozoa Cape and Skirt, Voltage Haute Couture Collection, 2013.

Haute couture is synonymous with craftsmanship, luxury, extravagance and spectacle. But aren’t these typical features of contemporary prêt-à-porter? The exhibition examines this question further and researches the changing relationship and cross-fertilization between haute couture and ready to wear.\nThrough a variety of themes and a selection of spectacular silhouettes and accessories from high end designers and fashion houses, the exhibition highlights the significance  of haute couture for contemporary fashion. Completed with photography, film, art and music, Haute-à-Porter offers a unique insight into the fashion industry of the last 30 years.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information about the exhibition, please visit <a href=\"http://www.modemuseumhasselt.be/#/tentoonstelling/haute-porter/en/id/163\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a>.

The exhibition traces cultural influences over the centuries, examines how elements of the uniform have profoundly shaped fashionable dress, and reveals how cinching and padding the body was, and is, not exclusive to women. The exhibition features 200 looks, and celebrates a rich history of restraint and resplendence in menswear.</p>\n<p>For more information about the exhibition, pleasevisit <a href=\"http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/reigning-men-fashion-menswear\">LACMA</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: Coat (detail), France, c. 1800, gift of B.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">\"Inspiring Beauty: 50 Years of Ebony Fashion Fair\" opens on the 20th May and will be on show at Bellevue Arts Museum through the 14th August 2016. The Ebony Fashion Fair began in 1958 and, over the next 50 years, the traveling fashion show blossomed into an American institution that raised millions for charity, helped Johnson Publishing Company reach broader audiences, and redefined the concepts of beauty, style, and empowerment for African Americans. Show organizers overcame racial prejudice to bring the pinnacle of Europe's premier fashion to communities that were eager to see—in real time and space—a new vision of black America that was the hallmark of Ebony and Jet magazines. Eunice Johnson took over as producer and director in 1963, and under her direction, the traveling show took on new heights as she expanded her cachet and power within fashion circles. Inspiring Beauty: 50 Years of Ebony Fashion Fair showcases nearly 100 objects including ensembles and accessories displayed on fully stylized mannequins to recreate the runway experience. The exhibition also includes archival photographs, video, and personal effects from Eunice W. Johnson to tell the full story of these unparalleled events. Among the 40 complete ensembles on view are stunning gowns, feathered coats, and sensational hats by icons of fashion such as Stephen Burrows, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Christian Lacroix, Yves Saint Laurent, Missoni, Nina Ricci, Sarli, Emanuel Ungaro, and Vivienne Westwood.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.bellevuearts.org/exhibitions/inspiring_beauty.html\">Bellevue Arts Museum</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: Patrick Kelly (France). \"I love Fashion Scandal\" evening dress, special order, fall/winter 1986.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\">El Museo del Barrio will present on the 14th of June 'Antonio Lopez: Future Funk Fashion', an exhibition on the work of fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez. The exhibition will explore various aspects of the work of this important artist, developing thematic sections that focus on high fashion illustration, his relationship to particular models, his shoe and jewelry designs, and images of people he came to know and love from the streets of New York City.\nLopez illustrated fashions for Women’s Wear Daily and The New York Times and eventually became a free-lance artist for many of the top fashion publications, including Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle and Andy Warhol’s Interview. He collaborated with the noted designer Charles James, creating an illustrated inventory of James’ fashion designs (now in the collection of the Chicago History Museum). With his friend and business partner, Juan Ramos, Lopez moved to Paris where they both worked with Karl Lagerfeld and many other designers.\nThrough his work, Lopez made great strides in exploring and representing the ethnic or racialized body within the world of high fashion. His imagery helped underscoring a new canon of beauty throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He died in New York of complications related to AIDS on March 17, 1987 at the age of 44.\nA team of art historians, scholars from various disciplines, as fashion, gender and communications studies, and other experts will participate in the organization of this exhibition. The show’s co-curators are Rocío Aranda-Alvarado, Curator at El Museo del Barrio and Amelia Malagamba-Ansótegui, a scholar from Arizona State University and University of Texas San Antonio. In 2003, Dr. Malagamba wrote an important essay on Antonio Lopez for the Smithsonian Institute, which continues to be a key text today for the ways in which it explores Lopez’s attentiveness to race, gender and the body in general.</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.elmuseo.org/antoniolopez/\">El Museo del Barrio</a>.</p>\n<p>Photo: \"ANTONIO LOPEZ: Future Funk Fashion\" at El Museo del Barrio, all rights reserved.</p>"

Fashion in an Age of Technology” will focus on the dichotomy between handmade haute couture and machine-made fashion, a distinction that has become increasingly blurred in the years. This distinction between haute couture and prêt-à-porter, as explains Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Costume Institute, was traditionally based on the handmade and the machine-made, but is now less clear since both disciplines have embraced the practices and techniques of the other. In the exhibition, the theme will be analysed by featuring more than one hundred pieces of fashion, both haute couture and ready-to-wear, including the designs by Alexander McQueen, Hubert de Givenchy, Coco Chanel, Issey Miyake and Raf Simons, covering over 130 years history. In addition, the exhibition will have several “in process” workshops to let the public know how these technologies work.</p>\n<p>For more information about the exhibition, please visit <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2016/manus-x-machina\">MET's Costume Institute</a>.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Photo: Wedding ensemble, Karl Lagerfeld (French, born Hamburg, 1938) for House of Chanel (French, founded 1913), autumn/winter 2014–15 haute couture, back view; Courtesy of CHANEL Patrimoine Collection.

        body: "<p>\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday 21 March Europeana and partners officially launch the Transcribathon Romania, the online competition for the transcription of personal documents from Romania from the First World War. The Transcribathon kicks off in Bucharest at the National Library and will continue with events in Brasov, Sibiu and Cluj. In each city, teams will compete in 48-hour runs transcribing Romanian manuscripts from the period.</p>\r\n<p>Highlights among the documents are the three beautifully illustrated diaries by Dumitru Nistor. During World War One Nistor, a peasant from Năsăud, served on the Austro-Hungarian cruiser ‘SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth’ in East Asia. In November 1914 he and his fellow crew members were taken prisoner in China by the Japanese. Nistor therefore spent the entire war in various POW-camps across Japan. It was during his time as a POW that Nistor created his wonderful diaries, drawings and poetry. Transcribathon România calls the people from Romania to help transcribe these unique personals account Nistor, as well as other fascinating Romanian documents from WW1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2017-03/dsc_2523.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2017-03/dsc_2523.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<br>Romanians are invited to come to one of the events in the four cities and join a team to compete with others in transcribing as much as you can within 48 hours.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n\r\nAbsence may make the heart grow fonder, but what happened to couples torn apart by war, unknowing of when, or if, they would see each other again? As the First World War raged on, so did the hearts of the husbands, wives, and lovers of Europe.  To cope with the separation, many soldiers sent long, romantic letters of to their loved ones back home. Some women waited longingly for their lovers on the field, while others sought companionship with the men left behind. There was love that transcended borders, love that lasted the ages, and love for one woman fought over by two different men.  In the Love Run, we present you stories of romance and betrayal, of lust and longing, heartbreak and new beginnings – all the makings of your favourite melodrama, but from real, handwritten sources of real, lived experiences. The Run is not a competition, but a permanent, regularly-updated selection of documents, hand-picked to get your emotions running and your hearts pumping on the Transcribathon. It is part of a bigger effort of Europeana to highlight treasures of textual sources. <br>Bring the hearts of the men and women of WW1 back to life by transcribing their treasured stories of love.<br></p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/transcribathon/featured/love-run/\"><i>Start here. </i></a> </p>.<br><p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2017-02/6141.69729.original.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2017-02/6141.69729.original.jpg\"></a></p>"

In recognition of their outstanding work, each will receive from us a book prize. </p>\r\n<p>During the Run, we also welcomed 80 new transcribers into the Europeana Transcribe 1914-1918 community, with some of them quickly reaching the rank of Champion.</p>\r\n<p>We would like to take this opportunity, again, to thank all of our transcribers, old and new, for the success of the 2016 Christmas Run.

For  many, Christmas was a time of goodwill towards others, a time for family and a celebration of light and peace. But the war was not over by Christmas. In fact, many soldiers spent more than one Christmas away from home.</p>\r\n<p>In the short and dark December days, as the temperatures dropped and the fighting slowed down, families kept their thoughts on their loved ones at the front. Aware that they would be absent from the festivities of the season, soldiers from all across Europe sent seasonal greetings in long letters and on postcards.</p>\r\n<p>Many of these personal documents, in many different languages are waiting to be read again. You can now help bringing these unique heartfelt testimonies back to life.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>On 9 November we launched a new online crowdsourcing campaign: <i>Transcribe Europeana 1914-1918</i>. We would like to mobilize our community to help unlock all the unique testimonies that can be found on our website for future generations by transcribing the handwritten texts that are otherwise difficult to read and cannot be searched or translated automatically online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Transcribe Europeana 1914-1918</i> will run as an ongoing online challenge — a ‘Transcribathon’ — to encourage members of the public to transcribe digital versions of the unique letters and diaries of those who experienced the First World War and that can be found at Europeana 1914-1918. The challenge will run until 2018, the centenary of the end of WW1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To launch the competition the 1st International Transcribathon took place this week in Riga at the Latvian National Library. Nine teams from across Europe participated in a special 48-hour challenge event judged by an international jury. Prizes were awarded on 9 November, to winning teams from France and the University of Latvia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2016-11/15003255_1171891469543406_3811605020504720741_o.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2016-11/15003255_1171891469543406_3811605020504720741_o.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nYou are invited to take up the challenge at <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/%20\"><i> www.transcribathon.eu </i></a> with digital versions of the handwritten testimonies from WW1’s home and battle fronts in 22 languages. Participants add their own transcriptions, geo-tags and other annotations to texts, enabling greater understanding and access to these original historical scripts. The website is free to use and open to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A simple e-tutorial teaches you how to decipher old and difficult handwriting in various languages with an easy-to-use online transcription tool. We hope that the challenge and the tool will help build an international community of contributors of all ages and nationalities who can share their knowledge and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transcribathon is ‘run’ by accumulating virtual ‘miles’ with every word transcribed. You work on the transcription of selected documents, for example a diary or a letter, in a specific language. If you’ve find an interesting document on this site you can ask to have it uploaded on the tool. A ‘Transcribometer’ charts your progress as they compete against others to move up the transcribers league.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People can take part individually from home or as teams at special Transcribathon events where a jury awards points for quality, quantity and presentation of transcriptions. All future event details will be announced on <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu\">www.transcribathon.eu</a> and <a href=\"http://world-war-i.europeana.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>. The first planned events are for Romania and Italy in the first half of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try it out for yourself now and dive into the lives of those who lived 100 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2016-11/14937325_1171893399543213_7186732861212085275_n.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2016-11/14937325_1171893399543213_7186732861212085275_n.jpg\" /></a></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n\r\nEarlier this year we asked all our contributors, visitors and followers: <i>What does Europeana 1914-1918 mean to you?</i> because we wanted to take a closer look at how we could serve our community best. The question was the starting point of an extensive research program in which we wanted to assess the social &amp; cultural value of the Europeana 1914-1918 service.<br>Between 19 April and 7 June 2016 our partners <a href=\"https://wandg.agency/\"><i>Whalebone &amp; Greenstone</i></a> conducted online as well as offline surveys amongst our community. Interviews were also held during events in Prague and Poznan.</p>\r\n<p>We are happy that we can now share with you the results of our research through this film <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/183833345/0397e5e578\"><i>Workers Underground</i></a>.The film narrates the impact of the Europeana 1914-1918 service from a fresh perspective. As we developed the film we realised that we cannot draw just one conclusion from our research, and that the process of the research itself was as important to share. So, along with the film we developed a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/impact-assessment-case-study\"><i>case study</i></a> that explores the journey we took.</p>\r\n<p>All of this couldn’t have been possible without you. It is your contributions and stories that have made Europeana 1914-18 what it is. We would love for you to share your thoughts and experiences with us via #europeanaimpact or email us at impact@europeana.eu.</p>\r\n<p>But first, please turn up the volume on your device, sit back and enjoy our <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/183833345/0397e5e578\"><i>film</i></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2016-09/21021.240543.original.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2016-09/21021.240543.original.jpg\"></a></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Emil Ranzenhofer (1864-1930) who was an graphic designer and artist from Austria, volunteered for KPQ (Kriegspressquartier - War newspaper office) during World War I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranzenhofer was in Bosnia and Herzegovina where he drew many of his sketches of soldiers, war scenes and of the region. Judith Kanner Gordy, the granddaughter of Emil Ranzenhofer, who lives and works in America, has found one such sketch, with the name of a soldier on it: Salih Brkic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2016-03/2769.61722.original.png\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2016-03/2769.61722.original.png\" /></a><br>\r\nImage provided by Judith Kanner Gordy [CC-BY-SA]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sketch dates from 1917. It is also written on the sketch that depicted person was a soldier of Bosnian 10th Infantry Regiment. Judith Kanner Gordy uploaded her story and the sketch to <a href=\"http://world-war-i.europeana.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>. She also stated that currently in Bosnia lives a well-known journalist with the same name, Salih Brkic. When we prepared promotional materials for Collection days in Sarajevo, we came across this picture and tried to verify the allegations of the story. It turns out that the journalist Salih Brkic, who lives and works in Tuzla, is truly related to the soldier and is, in fact, a grandson of the soldier in the sketch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is just one example of how the <a href=\"http://world-war-i.europeana.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> project managed to connect people who do not know each other and who live in different parts of the world.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n\r\nDuring the First World War men and boys from more than 16,000 parishes in England and Wales joint the Army. Of all these villages there were only 53 so called “Thankful Villages” – places to which everyone returned alive. The village of Skelsmergh (Cumbria, England, UK) was not in this tiny number: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/fgIiWlT_fBCDJA\">  <i>25 men with local links died.</i></a></p>\r\n<p><br></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-11/skelsmergh.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-11/skelsmergh.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/19811\">Photograph of Jona George Thompson</a> shared by a relative for the exhibition “Men on the Memorial”, Skelsmergh, October 2014. CC BY-SA<p>In our new online exhibition <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/exhibit/fgIiWlT_fBCDJA\">  <i><b>The Men on the Memorial</b></i></a> you can now read the stories behind the names of these 25 men from Skelsmergh who did not return. This virtual exhibition is based on the physical original one of the same name that has been displayed in Skelsmergh in October 2014.The Men on the Mmeorial has been made entirely by the people from Skelsmergh and surrounding villages. With help from local researchers and relatives of those who died they dived into the lives of the men behind the names on the WW1 monument in the parrish church.</p>\r\n<p>  It is an inspiring example of a great initiative to honour and commemorate the local men who gave their lives during the First World War. Perhaps you can do this too and tell the stories behind the names of the men on the memorial near you.<br></p>"

        title: 'Defeating the Russians on the Eastern front'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\nDuring the summer of 1915, in Galicia and in Poland on the Eastern front, the German and Austro-Hungarian armies were on the advance, causing the Russians heavy casualties and forcing them to retreat. Due to heavy losses in the earlier Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in May and June the Russian Army as a whole was already roughly 30% short of its nominal strength and found itself in an exposed position in Poland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/kaart-2b15353.161902.original.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/kaart-2b15353.161902.original.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<br>© http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/15353 / W. Wildeman- van Dam [CC-BY-SA] <p>In July, the Central Powers' armies opened a new series of offensives across the entire Eastern front. Especially the Germans advanced quickly to the far north of Poland and into Lithuania, whereas the Austro-Hungarians would finally regain large parts of their territories in Galicia which they lost during the first months of the war. This would include the city of Przemysl which had been under siege by the Russians after their crushing defeat of the Austro-Hungarian garrison. By mid-July 1915, the entire Russian line had been pushed back as far as 160 km to the Bug River, leaving only a small portion of Poland in Russian hands. On 22 July, the joint armies of the Central Powers crossed the Vistula river and in August Warsaw became isolated because of the continuing Russian retreat, offering the German 12th Army the opportunity to conquer the city on 4–5 August. Ongoing attacks by the German armies soon caused the Russian front to collapse and, after having received considerable reinforcements, they took Brest-Litovsk (on 25 August) and a month later  Hindenburg's forces captured Vilna. The overall advance of the Central Powers on the Eastern front during the Summer of 1915 is important, because it marks the beginning of Russia’s later removal from the war in 1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/2607.32962.original.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/2607.32962.original.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<br>© http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/2607 / Bodo A. W. Müller [CC-BY-SA] <p>On this website there is a large number of fascinating firsthand accounts of the various events on the Eastern front to be found. There is for instance <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/19975\">the war diary of Wilhelm Habermann</a>. Habermann was a so called Fahnenschmied, a certified blacksmith within the 46th Field Artilleray Regiment from  Lower Saxony. He took part in actions both on the Western and Eastern front. On 5 May 1915 he writes in his diary that he considers warfare at the Eastern front easier than in France (“Das Kriegführen ist hier leichter als in Frankreich”). Habermann ends his diary on 1 August, just after his regiment reached Warsaw.<br>. <br>Another very interesting account of how the German military advanced in Poland and beyond is given by an NCO in the German Railroad Engineering Corps posted to the Eastern Front ]. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/1331\">The pictures</a> he made during his stay at the front give an inight in the tremendous efforts that were made to keep up or rather rebuilt the infrastructures to ensure the ongoing logistics of the advance.</p>\r\n<p>And there are also the heartbreaking stories of soldiers who fell far away from home. We can read <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/4027\">the farewell letter</a> full of regret and uncertainty that Richard Pick wrote in March 1915 to his wife just before he departed for the Eastern front. It was to be his last letter as well, as Richard died a few months later, on 15 June 1915. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/4027.48260.original.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-08/4027.48260.original.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<br>© http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/4027 / Brigitte Pick [CC-BY-SA]<p>You can also have a look at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/2143\">the memorabilia of Konrad Mayr</a> that his offspring shared with us. Only 16 years old he had just left school to take part in the German war efforts on the Eastern front. He was lucky enough to survive the war as he died in 1976. Also very young, but much less fortunate was student-architect Max Klawitter. Eager to escape his father’s home rule he had enlisted in August 1914. You can read what he <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/14482\">wrote to his parents</a> about his life at the front until he died on 22 June 1915.And how about reading <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6438\">Stabsartzt Otto Kaschel’s story</a> who was awarded a Russian medal for medical services, or taking a look at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6411\">the pictures</a> that baker Willy Finger took of what he saw on the front. </p>\r\n<p><br>In addition to these personal stories you can also see some <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat136729\">spectacular footage</a> from the Eastern Front from the original newsreels that were shown in those days, with moving images from marching soldiers, destroyed landscapes, tired Russian PoWs and captured artillery.There is even <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08621/1037479000000262003\">a complete filmed report</a> on the Capture of Przemysl as shot an Austro-Hungarian army film crew.

        body: "<p>\r\nWe are happy to announce that a highly curated <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Europeana/Europeana_1914-1918_batch_upload\">set</a> of materials from the collection on this website has now been made available via <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. Because of the enormous reach and breadth of Wikipedia, with millions of articles in all the world’s languages, having the material appear in Wikipedia articles is an excellent way of communicating the stories connected to the items to a wider audience.</p>\r\n<p>Already some of the content is finding its way to articles, not only about the First World War itself, but also to more general articles. Look at this image of a <a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-06/file-memorabilia_relating_to_h.g._bagster-_item_2.jpg\">1917 travel document</a> for example: the item was contributed at the Europeana 1914-1918 collection day in Dublin and  it is now used in the Wikipedia article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_document\">\"Travel document\"</a>, where the image is used to add historic context to the concept, as well as in the article on the French village of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulogne-sur-Mer\">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a>, because the document applied to that specific town. Other great examples are <a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-06/file-frad022_-_-22_artisanat_de_tranch-c3-a9e_-22-2c_item_4.jpg#filehistory\">this image of a lighter</a> (in the article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter\">“Lighter”</a>) and <a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-06/file-doose-_hans_-1872-1933-_-_portrait_und_postkarte-_item_3.jpg\">this image of a ferry</a> in the German article <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_den_Nieder-_und_Mittelrhein\">\"Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft für den Nieder- und Mittelrhein\"</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-06/lebensmittel_karikatur-252c_item_1.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-06/lebensmittel_karikatur-252c_item_1.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<br>If you’re a WW1 historian - either as an individual or as representative from a heritage organisation - we call upon you to use the Europeana 1914-1918 material in articles you feel connected with or are an expert in. Anyone can edit Wikipedia; that means that you can too and there is an excellent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started\">tutorial</a> that guides you through the process. <br>"

        introduction: ''
        body: '<p><a href="/files/blogger/2015-03/vp.jpg"><img src="/files/blogger/2015-03/vp.jpg"></a></p> <p>This Spring, on April 28, the Peace Palace in The Hague (The Netherlands) will participate in the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the International Congress of Women that took place in the city of The Hague in 1915. The women who attended this Congress a century ago, were suffragists who up until that time, met every other year through their national organization at the International Women Suffrage Alliance.  Due to the outbreak of World War I, their 1915 meeting could not take place in Berlin.  Despite of the war, the idea of solidarity among the women from different countries did remain intact. A small delegation headed by Dutch suffragist and physician Dr. Aletta Jacobs, believed it to be important to organize a meeting, even during wartime, to discuss the principles of constructive peace.</p> <p>For an interesting blog about the International Congress of Women of 1915 please click the following link:<a href="http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/2015/02/international-congress-of-women-of-1915/">http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/2015/02/international-congress-of-women-of-1915/</a>. </p>'

        title: 'Eastland Disaster'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\nA phD candidate from the University of Illinois in Chicago has uncovered previously unseen footage of the Eastland Disaster in Chicago on Europeana’s 1914-1918 website. The disaster, which killed 844 people, occurred when the Eastland capsized in the Chicago river in July 1915.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/blogger/2015-02/eastland-film-fragment-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2015-02/eastland-film-fragment-1.jpg\"></a><br><i>A fragment from the film footage. Source: EYE Film Instituut film still</i></p>\r\n<p>Jeff Nichols was actually gathering material for his doctoral dissertation on the First World War when he made the historic discovery. While watching Dutch news reels from 1915, he chanced across the coverage of the disaster and realised at once what an exciting find he had made. </p>\r\n<p>“I consider myself a Chicago historian, but I am not an historian of the Eastland Disaster. There are many people who have worked very hard studying the tragedy. But I knew instantly what I had.” </p>\r\n<p>The footage came to Europeana from the EYE Film Institute via the European Film Gateway, which has provided over 600 hours of archive footage to Europeana 1914-18, and shows the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The first clip, which is just under a minute, shows the first responders walking on the ship’s hull, while the second clip shows the ship as it is righted. You can watch the clips on our website <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36915#prettyPhoto\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36913#prettyPhoto\">here</a>. </p>\r\n<p>It is an important discovery for American history, and the story has captured the attention of the world’s media, picked up by news outlets like <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/12/rare-footage-from-century-old-chicago-shipwreck-unearthed/\">The Washington Post</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2947748/Footage-1915-Chicago-ship-disaster-killed-844-found.html\">Daily Mail</a> in the United Kingdom. In the video below, Jeff talks to CBS about the “Holy Cow” moment when he discovered the footage on the Europeana 1914-1918 website. </p>\r\n<p>For Jeff, an important part of the story of the discovery is that “it would have been impossible… just a few years ago.” Though historians suspected some surviving footage might exist, knowing where to hunt for it had been a difficult task. </p>\r\n<p>The material Europeana provides access to has helped to enrich his research on the First World War in other ways, too. Jeff also unearthed a number of important handwritten letters that he could never have otherwise found. </p>\r\n<p>“I could not possibly expect to ask multiple European archives to see if they had any letters from Chicago or if they had any letters that mentioned a handful of American journalists. I would never have asked them to send me copies of the letters for free. That is what your website does. As fantastic a tool as Google is for my research, I wouldn’t have been able to find the items there.” </p>\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 allows people to explore untold stories from the First World War, and brings together material from archives and libraries all over the world with the memories and memorabilia of families throughout Europe. </p>\r\n<p>There are plenty of exciting discoveries like Jeff’s to be made on Europeana. Let his story of the Eastland Disaster inspire you as you make your own.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: '<p><a href="/files/blogger/2014-11/shaping-europe-banner.jpg"><img src="/files/blogger/2014-11/shaping-europe-banner.jpg"></a></p> <p>WW1 and the fall of the Iron Curtain, two events that shaped the Europe we know today will be commemorated at the European Parliament in unique style. A family history roadshow, digitising personal memorabilia of MEPs for these two seminal periods of European history, is taking place in the Parliament. </p> <p>On 2 and 3 December, Shaping Europe will mark the centenary commemoration of WW1 and the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain. Members of the European Parliament and Parliament staff are invited to bring along their personal and family memorabilia to be digitised and to share the stories behind them through Europeana’s two major thematic websites <a href="http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu">Europeana 1914-1918</a> and <a href="http://www.europeana1989.eu">Europeana1989.eu</a>.</p> <p>Monika Grütters, the German Minister of State for Culture said at the beginning of this year: ‘Europeana is a great bridge builder. In a wonderful way, it is founding connections between cultural institutions across Europe. It is making an important contribution to European cooperation and understanding across borders and tranches of history.''</p> <p>For the past three years, Europeana 1914-18 and Europeana 1989 have worked with citizens and our cultural institutions across Europe to create online archives that provide a unique perspective on these two seminal events, which can be shared worldwide. The two collection days at the Parliament, add to 150 held across Europe over the last 4 years and directly connect citizens to their cultural heritage.</p> <p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana Foundation said: ‘Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989 connects our state history with our personal memories. They show the power of a Europe connected through its cultural institutions and our shared heritage’.</p> <p>MEP and one of the initiators of the European Parliament''s resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism (2009), Mr. Tunne-Väldo Kelam is one of those who have already shared their story through Europeana 1989 and the 89 voices project. He said, ''One of our main objectives at the European Parliament has been to develop a balanced understanding and approach to European history as a whole. Because we noticed that our colleagues and friends in Western and Southern Europe know very little about what happened in the East. We should establish a political balance to recognise these [totalitarian, Nazi and Communist] crimes and express solidarity with the victims.''</p> <p>Senior representatives from the EU institutions, Member States and cultural organisations will gather at the commemoration, hosted by five members of the European Parliament and its committee of Culture and Education: Ms. Silvia Costa, Ms Sabine Verheyen, Ms. Petra Kammerevert, Mr Maura Barandarián and Ms. Helga Trϋpel. The event will mark the role of these two formative periods in shaping Europe.</p> <p>On 3 December evening, a reception will be held to mark the importance of culture to the formation of the European Union and the role of the Member States in Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989. The reception will be attended by Commissioner Tibor Navracsics, Culture, Education, Youth and Sport and Mr Bodgan Andrzej Zdrojewski, MEP and former minister for Culture, Poland.</p> <p>To follow developments on social media, please use <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ShapingEurope">#ShapingEurope</a>.</p>'

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Together with the <a href=\"http://onb.ac.at/\">Austrian National Library</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/home?view=grid\">Google Cultural Institute</a>\_we created a new virtual exhibition to commemorate the First World War. Based on the physical exhibition curated by renowned historian Univ.-Prof. Dr. Manfried Rauchensteiner, aspects of the First World War’s history are presented in seven chapters and illustrated by material accessible through Europeana.</p> <p>The exhibition guides you through the Emperor’s manifestos, from announcements for mobilisation, to administering shortages, to dealing with prisoners of war and refugees. It focuses on the role of Emperor Franz Joseph and his successor and grandnephew Karl. The big influence of the First World War on children is presented in remarkable drawings and letters by students in the chapter “My dear Pupils”. The exhibitions ends with a selection of photographs from the front, the hinterland and life in the field.</p> <a href=\"/files/blogger/2014-08/untitled-1.jpg\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2014-08/untitled-1.jpg\"></a> <p>All items in this virtual exhibition are on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana 1914 – 1918</a>, where we collect World War One related materials from Cultural Institutions and stories from the public such as unpublished letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war are being collected and digitised.</p> <p>Digitisation nowadays plays a vital role in discovering interesting artefacts to illustrate history and to enable transnational perspectives on historic events. Hans Petschar, Historian and Librarian at the Austrian National Library: “Europeana 1914-1918 permits to overcome National stereotypes and nationalist historical views on the First World War dominating the Centenary events 2014. Looking at the fascinating individual memories from all regions and parts of Europe we can imagine the scientific potential of transnational and global views on the Great War.”</p> <p>For the first time we have created a virtual exhibition together with Google Cultural Institute. Simon Rein, Programme Manager at Google: \"We're very excited about our partnership with Europeana, and especially delighted that through our cooperation, the Austrian National Library was able to create a fascinating online exhibit on First World War memorabilia during this centenary year. This launch is what the Google Cultural Institute is about - providing tools and services that enable our partners to tell important stories and share diverse perspectives on the cultural and historic events that have shaped our world.

        title: 'Commemoration ceremony of the United Nations with film material from EFG1914 on Tuesday, 8 July 2014, at the UN headquarters in New York'
        introduction: ''
        body: '<p>The Deutsches Filminsitut, co-ordinator of the European film digitisation project about the First World War, EFG1914, and its European partners welcome the appreciation of their work by the United Nations. </p>  <p>With a ceremonial event, the United Nations commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tonight (6:30 pm local time) in New York. The event will be the only commemoration of WW1 that will bring all the Member States of the United Nations together. A clip with film material digitised by the EFG1914 partners will be shown to several hundred international diplomatic representatives as introduction to the event. European film archives participating in the EFG1914 digitisation project provided the trailer to the UN. It shows original footage from and about WW1, which was digitised with support by the European Commission over the last two years. EFG1914 has digitised more then 700 hours of historic film material and made these available online for the first time on <a href="http://europeanfilmgateway.eu/1914">the European Film Gateway</a> and on <a href="http://europeana.eu">Europeana</a>. </p> <p>Organised by the Permanent Missions of France and Germany, the event commemorates the tragedy of the First World War and sends out a joint message of peace and reconciliation through a speech by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. „We very much appreciate that footage from the valuable films digitised by EFG1914 partners can now be seen on the central commemoration event of the United Nations“, says Claudia Dillmann, Director of the Deutsches Filminstitut. </p> <p>A live webcast of the event will be available 8 July 2014 at 18:30 EDT (0:30 CEST): <a href="http://webtv.un.org">http://webtv.un.org</a> </p>'

        title: 'New corresponding Hitler postcard found'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Two days after the soldier Adolf Hitler wrote <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/2543.html\">this postcard</a> to his comrade <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2012/05/extraordinary-personal-stories-of-world-war-1/\">Karl Lanzhammer</a> telling him about avisit to the dentist, he wrote another one on 21 December 1916 about the painful visit, where he claims 19 of his teeth were extracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/fotostrecke/fotostrecke-bisher-unbekannt-hitler-postkarte-aufgetaucht-fotostrecke-113079.html\">second postcard</a> surfaced in Bavaria, just like the first one, which was discovered in 2012 during Europeana’s Family History Roadshow in Munich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogger/2014-03/2020601-attachments-47393-2543-47393-original-47393-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 371px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dated 21 December 1916, the recently discovered correspondence was again addressed to Lanzhammer, who was in the same regiment as Hitler in the war in France. After an evaluation of the dictator’s dental records, it is possible that Hitler may have exaggerated the episode, as only 15 teeth were believed to have been removed, according to German newspaper Münchner Merkur, which broke the news about the postcard. However, the procedure provides an explanation as to why Hitler was not at the front from early October 1916 to early March 1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recently-discovered postcard is privately owned. The owner received the card from his father, who fought in World War Two with a relative of Lanzhammer, and received the card from him.</p>"

        title: 'Berlin: Europeana 1914-1918'
        introduction: ''
        body: '<p><i>By Jon Purday, Head of Communications at Europeana.</i></p> <p>There was huge media interest in the launch of the new <a href="http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu">Europeana 1914-1918 site</a> in Berlin on 29 January. All the main German news programmes, including Tagesschau and <a href="http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europeana102.html">Tagesthemen</a>, ran features which were seen by more than 12 million people. The national newspapers followed up the next morning, and over the first 48 hours the new site had 70,000 visitors. </p> <p>The Berlin State Library hosted the launch, and the formal introduction to the site was given by the new Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media, Monika Grütters, who gave a very <a href="http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Rede/2014/01/2014-02-06-gruetters-europeana.html?nn=402618">supportive and thoughtful speech</a>. Ms Grütters said, ''A project such as Europeana 1914-1918 touches a nerve. It illuminates this time of darkness and destruction by giving access to hundreds of thousands of documents and objects from all over Europe - from a private photo to a documentary film shot. [...] Europeana is a great bridge builder. In a wonderful way it is founding connections between cultural institutions across Europe. It is making an important contribution to European cooperation and understanding across borders and tranches of history.''</p> <img src="/files/blogger/2014-02/monika.jpg" alt="Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media, Monika Grütters"><p>The event also marked the opening of the conference ''Unlocking Sources: the First World War Online'', hosted by the Berlin State Library, an opportunity for historians, educators, curators and digital developers to hear about online resources for learning and research into the conflict as the centenary of its outbreak begins.   </p>  <p>The Europeana 1914-1918 site brings together three sets of content from 20 countries in Europe – 400,000 items digitised by national libraries as part of Europeana Collections 1914-1918, 660 hours of film digitised by EFG14, and 90,000 images of First World War family papers and memorabilia. This last set of material has primarily been digitised during Europeana’s family history roadshows. These have been taking place around Europe over the past 3 years, and ran in parallel to the conference at the Berlin State Library on 30 and 31 January. </p> <p>Because of the publicity, the Berlin roadshows – also known as collection days – were very busy: 350 visitors came along and 11,500 digital images were taken. We had great support from the company <a href="http://www.imageaccess.de/?page=index&amp;lang=en">Image Access</a> who provided Bookeye scanners and other professional equipment, with their operators, on both days. The teams from the State Library, <a href="http://factsandfiles.com/">Facts &amp; Files</a> and volunteers from Oxford University did a splendid job of scanning, interviewing and processing the remarkable range of memorabilia that people brought along. The collection days, co-ordinated by Frank Drauschke of Facts and Files in Berlin, were among our most successful ever.</p>  <img src="/files/blogger/2014-02/digitaliseren.jpg" alt="The Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow gets underway"><p>Europeana 1914-1918 also brings in related information from America, Australia and New Zealand through APIs. Conversely, Europeana’s API, which gives access to the pan-European, openly-licensed dataset of First World War material, is available for organisations or developers to use to incorporate Europeana’s data into their site, web services or apps. Already, <a href="http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/14-18-collections-de">a new exhibition</a>, and two sites for learning are being developed using the source material. One, from the <a href="http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one">British Library</a>, is already live; the other, from the Association of European History Teachers, EUROCLIO, will launch shortly. </p>'

        body: "<p><img alt=\"Map of Europe with countries portrayed according to their national stereotypes\" src=\"/files/blogger/2014-01/download-29-.jpg\" title=\"\"></p>\r\n<p><br>We've made things on this site bigger and better and we really hope you like it! </p>\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 now brings together resources from three major European projects each dealing with different types of First World War material. That     means that national collections from libraries now sit alongside personal stories and treasures as well as important film archives. Together, this creates     a unique perspective of the First World War, showing it from every side of the battle lines and with insights from every point of view. Over time, even     more material will be added to this archive so please keep coming back! So, what have we got?</p>\r\n<p>Stories from the public: We're still collecting the public's previously unpublished letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war. So far, a dozen     countries have taken part in our family history roadshows, digitising over 90,000 items and adding more than <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?count=12&amp;page=1&amp;q=&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Ac&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\">7,000 stories</a>. </p>\r\n<p>National collections: The <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a> project has produced a substantial digital collection of over <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?count=12&amp;page=1&amp;q=&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Ae&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\">400,000 pieces of material</a> from     national libraries in eight countries that found themselves on different sides of the historic conflict. </p>\r\n<p>Film archives: The <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\">European Film Gateway 1914</a> project gives us <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Ae&amp;qf%5B%5D=type%3AVIDEO&amp;q=\">660 hours of films</a> and related material on the First World War including newsreels,     documentaries, fiction films, propaganda and anti-war films. This material is especially important since only around 20% of the complete silent film     production of the era has survived. </p>\r\n<p>And there's even more: You can also find material on this site from other European collections and projects, as well as information from outside Europe -     from the <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?q=&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Aa&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93#dpla\">Digital Public Library of America</a>, <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?q=&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Aa&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93#trove\">Trove</a> (Australia), and <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?q=&amp;qf%5B%5D=index%3Aa&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93#digitalnz\">Digital New Zealand</a>. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/explore\">So start exploring now</a>\_and tell us what you think by tweeting us <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeana1914\">@europeana1914</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For information on the launch and related centenary events, see our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/29jan\">press release</a>\r\n</p>\r\n<br><p>For press images and videos, go to: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/1914-1918-press-images\">http://pro.europeana.eu/1914-1918-press-images</a>\r\n</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<a href=\"/files/blogger/2013-12/france3blogger.png\"><img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-12/france3blogger.png\"></a> <br>Family History Roadshows for Europeana 1914-1918 took place in France from 9-16 November 2013. Thanks to the cooperation between the French National Library (BnF), Archives de France and their network, Europeana and Mission du Centenaire, more than 100 sites all over France participated. Thousands of contributors came to tell their family stories related to the First World War and to contribute to <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr\">Europeana</a>. All the stories are illustrated by documents that give a hint of what life was like for the soldiers and their families.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these stories were particularly powerful:<br><b>Pilots can be photographers too!</b><br>Discover the pictures taken by <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/9514\">Jean Luce</a> who was part of the 83th company of 'aérostiers' (balloon pilots). In the album sent to his family, he reveals what the war was like for him from the beginning of his military service in 1912 up until his time working with airships.<br>Another contributor brought us a series of photographic archives belonging to her grandparents and picturing her great-uncle, Lieutenant <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/9575\">Jean-Baptiste Gibelin</a>. He spent the war years in the air force. His pictures show a emergency landing as well as how a group of soldiers helped to get an aeroplane's propeller going.</p>\r\n<p><b>Life in the trenches</b><br>Sergeant <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/8878\">Martin Choisnard</a>, like many other soldiers, kept a diary almost daily. In the pages selected here covering the period of 2 September 1914 to 8 March 1915, he describes the hard life in the trenches - bullets whistling over the heads of the soldiers, the cold weather, the wounded.<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/9298\">Lucien Gauriau</a>, in a letter to his wife from 4 December 1915, also explains the very difficult life in the trenches. He took part in a moment of truce between French and German soldiers during which everyone went out into the trenches to gather water and mud. He even writes about French soldiers being photographed by German soldiers.</p>\r\n<p><b>Soldiers turned artists</b><br>In a letter dated April 1915, Corporal <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/9639\">René Debailly</a> writes about his participation in a music band during a 'recreational morning'! The programme attached to the letter precisely informs us of the planning, and the exact songs and instruments that were part of this moment of relaxation. In another letter from his stay in Visan in 1916, he sent his mother a drawing showing a view from the room he then lived in.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, there was the soldier <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributions/8994\">Léon Verneau </a> conscripted during the war. Despite being seriously wounded at Verdun, he made a book of songs that he engraved with numerous illustrations. He paid special attention to the titles, the first page of his notebook and to the drawings. This represents an original and colourful testimony!</p>"

        title: '‘I have seen foreign people, countries and continents and all this only due to the war’'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n <img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-11/blogpostpicture.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>More than 400 people took part in the recent Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows between October 12 and 22 in Bonn, Aachen, Bochum and Bremen, Germany. The roadshows collected around 16,000 new digital entries, which will now be added to the online archive. This blog post highlights some of the most interesting stories and objects that came to light.</p> <p>Michael Neumann, a local from Bonn, always thought that this telescope was just an average souvenir his grandfather fished out of the North Sea back in 1916. However, the story behind it turned out to be much more exciting. </p>\r\n<p>Karl Friedrich Neumann once served as an ordinary seaman and musician in the ship’s band on the SMS Westfalen. As such he took part in the Battle of Jutland, the biggest sea battle of the First World War. The then 18-year-old survived the battle and kept the 19th century telescope as a souvenir. It has remained in the family’s possession ever since. A similar ‘Day-or-Night’ telescope from ‘Dollond London’ is part of the collection at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6446\">View the contribution</a> <p><b>Stories from several continents</b></p> <p>One of the most interesting objects collected in Bonn was a suitcase once owned by despatch runner, Walter Naumann.  In it was a leather bag containing a small compass and a pair of binoculars. The suitcase also contained a series of diaries, photographs and four exactly inscribed photo albums with more than 400 medium format negatives.</p>   <p>Born in 1888 in Bad Düben (Saxonia), Naumann served as a despatch runner in the ‘Königlich-sächsische 6. Infanterieregiment Nr. 105 ‘König Wilhelm II. von Württemberg” and took part in the battles of Verdun and Cambrai. Naumann was a passionate photographer. His field camera is presumably of US American origin, because after finishing school he started an apprenticeship in Grenoble and Atlantic City. His father owned a restaurant and his son Walter would one day take over the business. Although he wanted to settle in Atlantic City, he returned to Germany shortly before the outbreak of the war and spent the entire wartime in service. He died in 1952 in his home town of Bad Düben in Saxonia.</p> <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6422\">View the contribution</a> <p>A further example of a world-wide journey during wartime was contributed by Manfred Kersten in Bonn. Two photo albums document the stays of his father Walter Kersten in Asia, Australia and Africa.</p>  <p>Walter Kersten was on a business journey in December 1913 on the SMS Leipzig in the Phillipines. In Zamboanga, he visited and took pictures of cigar factories. In the summer of 1914, Kersten wanted to get himself to safety via the German colony of ‘Kiautschou’ in China. When he was in Hong Kong, war broke out and Kersten was interned by the British authorities. As a civil internee, he spent most of the war time at an internment camp - Trial Bay in New South Wales in Australia. As the photographs and documents suggest, a vivid theatre life was established by the internees of the camp. In 1918, the internees were brought to Durban, South-Africa, on the ship ‘Kursk’, a former Russian cruiser now (after the Russian revolution of 1917) under British colours.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6489\">View the contribution</a><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6487\">View the contribution</a> <p><b>Soldier under Turkish crescent</b></p> <p>Hinrich Dietjen was another soldier who experienced the life of a prisoner of war.  His son Heinz Detjen contributed the memories of his father to Europeana 1914-1918. Detjen was in service from1914 and took part in the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914. Yet it was his service in Palestine that left a lasting impression on him. In Palestine, Detjen served as a special drilling commando looking for water which had run short at the front. For his service he was decorated with the Turkish Iron Crescent.</p> <p>He recalls his experiences in the Middle East in his unpublished manuscript ‘Prisoner of war No. 63583 or German soldiers under Turkish crescent’. The reader gains an impression of him as a man always caring for the people around him. He remembers the English prisoners with honest compassion. ‘There is probably no country where English prisoners have to suffer as much as in Turkey.’ He himself was disgusted by this treatment. ‘From the beginning of the war it has been my highest aim to protect helpless and defenceless prisoners of war.’ He describes his sense of justice with a further example. While on tour with his comrade, he saw a Turkish major treating his subordinate with a truncheon. They took the truncheon and beat up the major, glad to see ‘that he can scream as well as his subordinate’.</p> <p>The German soldier Detjen eventually became an English POW in camps in Egypt, among them Maadi south of Cairo, where soldiers of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck’s Africa corps were also interned. In his memories, he describes illnesses such as dysentery and the so-called ‘Black water fever’. They were to become the biggest threats to the lives of prisoners. When he returned home via the camp in Lokstedt in Northern Germany his conclusion of the war was far from bitter. ‘I have experienced the war not only from its bad and unpleasant side but also from the good and pleasant one. I have seen foreign people, countries and continents and all this only due to war.’</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6883\">View the contribution</a> <p><b>Orthodox Icons from the Eastern Front</b></p> <p>A carton full of war memorabilia came to light at the collection day in Bremen. It contained two small orthodox icons made from wood and a collection of uniform parts from different countries. They belong to the bequest of Gustav Küster, grandfather of contributor Anke Sudingen. According to the family and the postmark, the box was sent home from Güstrow in 1916. Gustav Küster, born in 1870, served in the army as early as the 1890s. He joined the army again in September 1914.</p> <p>Küster probably served on both the Eastern and Western fronts. There, he collected these items. As well as the icons, the box contained  two belt buckles showing a double-headed eagle of Russian origin, a Russian-orthodox crucifix made of brass, several Russian identification tags and an inscribed collection of buttons from Russian, English, Scottish, French and Belgian uniforms. Why and how he collected these items remains unknown. Gustav Küster himself could not report about his war time experiences. After being injured in 1916, he was taken to a military hospital where he died in May 1917.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6837\">View the contribution</a>  <p>Sebastian Garthoff, Facts &amp; Files</p>"

Visitors will be welcomed by experts who will identify and photograph the documents, and collect the individual family stories relating to them. The documents will then be returned to contributors, who can also choose to donate them to the institution if they wish.</p> <p>Some documents such as posters and postcards tell a collective story through their imagery, while others are more personal, but all provide direct testimony from the daily lives of soldiers and civilians. </p> <p>These family documents and stories provide different perspectives of the First World War and each is essential to creating this unique pan–European archive. They will sit with stories from countries across Europe to be shared online, accessed by others worldwide and saved for future generations.</p> <p>A full list of places and dates is available on the Mission du Centenaire website:<a href="http://centenaire.org/fr/les-lieux-de-collecte">www.centenaire.org</a></p>'

        title: 'Youth is life’s flower - Transylvanian soldier''s diaries of life in a Japanese POW camp'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-10/ww1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>Dumitru Nistor, a peasant from the village of Nasaud, was born in 1893. His childhood dream was to travel and see foreign countries, so in 1912, when the time for recruiting came, he asked to be enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian navy, not the Transylvanian militia, where Romanians usually ended up.</p> <p>After graduating from his Navy studies, and a trip to Vienna, he embarks as Geschützvormeister('first cannon pointer') on the ship SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth, destined for Asia. The War finds the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth battleship in the China Sea, where it takes part in several naval battles. On 2 November 1914, the decision is made to sink the ship. The crew also loses the land battle and Dumitru is made a prisoner by the Japanese and taken to Japan.  </p> <p>For the next ten months, the peasant-seaman from Nasaud remains a prisoner in a Buddhist monastery in Himeji, and is then moved to a prisoner of war camp specially built for German and Austrian prisoners at Aonogahara, not far from Kobe, where he remained until the end of 1919.</p> <p>To appease his longing for his homeland, Dumitru Nistor began writing during his imprisonment: </p>\r\n<p>'…seeing that I have so much time, I decided I shouldn’t let it go unused. That would have been a horrible shame; (…) That’s why I always kept myself busy with something: writing, reading, drawing, painting, learning new languages etc. I then attempted to unload the weight and pain which tormented me and burdened my heart: but with whom? And to who? (…) Not having anyone to share my pain and ideas with, I thought it good to share them with the paper: it endures, it gives the right and allows everyone.'  </p> <p>He kept a diary entitled <i>My diary – Dumitru Nistor’s navy service, written by himself as a war prisoner in Aonochara – Japan 1918</i> and compiled two poetry volumes of poems composed by himself and gathered from his army brethren. He describes them as 'international songs. Specifically Romanian, Italian, Serbian, Croatian, Slavonic, Bohemian, German and Hungarian songs, as I really loved singing, since I was always a happy person.' The titles of the volumes are <i>The longing and misery chased away</i> and <i>Youth is life’s flower</i>. </p> <p>Exquisitely beautiful, with charming unique and exotic ink and watercolour drawings, Dumitru Nistor’s volumes are valuable historical documents. In the chapter <i>The European war, or rather, the Universal war</i>, Dumitru recalls in detail, day by day and hour by hour, the battles fought by the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth’s crew to defend the German colony of Kiaotcheao. </p> <p>As an ally of Great Britain, Japan addresses an ultimatum to Germany on 15 August 1914 which goes unanswered. As such, on 23 August, Emperor Yoshihito declares war on Germany. On 27 August 1914, a Japanese squadron blocks the port of Tsingtao, and the SMS Kaiserin Elisabeth, despite being an Austro-Hungarian ship, joins the naval battles (after several stutters) as an ally of Germany. Right from the start, the battle appeared hopeless. On 2 November, the decision is made to sink the ship, so as not to let it fall into enemy hands, and the crew disembarks with the battles continuing on land until 6 November.</p> <p>This is how Dumitru Nistor tells the story of the surrender to the Japanese:</p>\r\n<p>'As the Germans realised that any resistance from our side would be futile, they raised the white flag and surrendered, and us Austrians with them, at exactly 6.30 in the morning. As such, Tsingtau fell to the Japanese on Saturday, November 7th, at 6.30. After surrendering, we laid down our weapons in “Motke Kaserne”, at 7 in the morning. The Japanese minded us and kept us in the barracks’ yard until the evening, without giving us anything to eat. Around us there were now guards with bayonets on their rifles, like traders next to purchased cattle. At night they let us in the barracks to sleep. We slept like logs, as we were so tired after so many sleepless nights. The next day, on November 8th, we woke up at 6 and washed our faces, a very good feeling, as it had been a week since we last did this. After washing, we donned clean clothes. </p> <p>At about 6 in the evening, they took us Austrians to the “Governament Schülle”, where we slept that night. The next day, on Monday, November 9th, we went with the Japanese to the battlefield and gathered up the dead. We were now talking to each other like friends, we were giving each other cigarettes, only the poor dead lied there motionless, they were all crushed by grenades and pierced by bayonets, some had their skulls bashed in and their guts out, with no arms or legs, God forbid, it was horrible to touch them, but what else could we do? We couldn’t leave them there as loot, they were not dogs, they had been our brothers and comrades. In the afternoon we organised a funeral for them with parades, a German priest held a beautiful service, we all shed tears, and then we buried them, we shot three volleys, and the music ended the ceremony.  </p>\r\n<p>The siege (Belagerung) around Tsingtau had lasted for 41 days, a shameful fact for the Japanese who lingered so much around this small town. They came upon it with 60,000 soldiers, the entire garrison of Himeji, and another 5-6,000 Englishmen, while we poor saps were in Tsingtau about 5,000, cats included. We were 318 Austrians, while the others were Germans.'</p> <p>Dumitru Nistor returned home in 1920, and lived until the 1960s. He continued his work as an amateur artist. He compiled a total of 26 manuscript notebooks, but the first three, acquired in 1994 by the 'Octavian Goga' Cluj County Library, are the most valuable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/6191\">These documents</a> are a contribution from the Cluj Library to Europeana1914-1918.eu. </p>\r\n<p>Come to the collection days in Cluj, on 4 and 5 October, and bring your memorabilia.</p>"

        body: "<p>\r\nPordenone September 21, 2013  <img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-09/untitled-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p>In preparation to the 100th anniversary of World War One in 2014, WW1-dentro la Grande Guerra Cultural Association, responsible for the immersive platform of the same name, and pordenonelegge.it have set up a new Collection Day, whose scope includes both Italy and Europe, to be held in one of the “hottest” regions of the conflict, Friuli Venezia Giulia.</p>\r\n<p>In recent years Europeana, the digital European archive-library-museum, has started a major task of digitizing, preserving and publishing records and documents from the Great War.</p>\r\n<p>The WW1 project connects the public contents coming from the archives of the Companies that made our Country’s History with those from the Defense Ministry’s Historical Archive as well as from the Popular Writing Archives, from Onorcaduti and Europeana’s private memories collection. The cultural legacy of the soldiers who served in World War I -  both casualties and survivors, will be made available to the public thanks to the precious work iStoreco and Cimeetrincee have developed in recent years and to the collaboration of sympathetic associations like the Military Historical Center (MHC) of Udine, Italy, which have always cared about the \"human\" issue.</p>\r\n<p>The new technologies provide a strategic language to reach a wide public because they create an easy and immediate access to issues often perceived as difficult or “bookish” and mostly uninteresting.</p>During World War One the Italian Army recruited over five million men, mostly “peasant-soldiers”. The casualties amounted to nearly 600,000, a huge death toll. In our regions, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Trentino and Lombardy the whole population suffered the war directly, was evacuated, suspected to be pro-Italy or pro-Austria, imprisoned, and deeply scarred by this experience. Every Italian family of a hundred years ago lost some of its members in the war, whose memory every family today keeps and cherishes.<p>Now everybody can contribute to the preservation of his/her family narratives back in that critical time and share and disseminate them.</p> <p>WW1 - dentro la Grande Guerra <a href=\"http://www.grandeguerra100.it\">www.grandeguerra100.it</a></p>   <img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-09/untitled-3.jpg\" alt=\"\">"

        title: 'A Journal with a Difference'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-08/ajournalwith.jpg\" alt=\"A Journal with a Difference\"></p>\r\n<p>When looking through diaries written during World War One, it is often striking how matter-of-fact they are (for an example see <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/5354\">the Champion-Jones diary</a> in the Royal Engineers Collection).</p> <p>But Arthur Powell’s journal, written into a French Prayer Book, is astoundingly different. Intensely graphic in nature, its subtext denotes the feelings of one Royal Engineer toward what he was witnessing. The sections that we have transcribed focus on civilian casualties.</p> <p> <i>‘Found dead body male outside cathedral. Likewise four girls with bosoms cut away at BOHAIN; Several others to [sic] horrible to be penned. A. Powell’ </i> </p> <p>Describing how he came to own the diary, our writer comments:</p> <p><i>‘First advance through PERONNE – Picked up by me W.O. ARTHUR POWELL 320707. Dispatch rider of Inter-Allied Commission; in the debris of interior of PERONNE Cathedral out of girls [sic] hand whilst giving wounded girl a drink of water Great War 1914-1918’</i></p> <p> Whilst these passages show contact with civilian casualties, there is a clear pre-occupation and potential acceptance of the writer’s own death, which would clearly have been hard to escape during war:</p> <p><i>‘Who ever may take this Holy Book in hand will never realize the Hidden Horror the writer witnessed nor the Horror behind the ? mark. Who ever [sic] finds this book on my body bury it with me please. A. Powell’</i></p> <p>Clearly, however, Arthur Powell did not die during the war and the book was not buried with him. Instead it is carefully stored in the Royal Engineers Museum and I have had the opportunity to look into Arthur’s story a little further. </p> <p>The first thing of note is that an ‘Arthur Powell’ with the service number ‘320707’ does not exist on the World War One medal roll. But a William A. Powell can be found. Arthur writes his name as ‘W.O. Arthur Powell’ so we deduce that the W stands for ‘William’ and that ‘Arthur’ was a middle name. All of the different sections of writing in the Prayer Book are signed off ‘A. Powell’. It would be interesting to know why ‘Arthur’ chose to use his middle name but the diary does not give us the answer.</p> <p>Another interesting and important aspect of the first quote is that at the end Arthur writes ‘Great War 1914-1918’. It is unclear whether this was written after the first part of the inscription or at the same time but it shows that Arthur definitely made it out of the war alive because he knew when it ended. </p> <p>It should also be mentioned that, when looking at the medal roll, it is clear that William A. Powell only received the Allied Victory Medal and the British War Medal. He did not receive a 1914-15 Star, which means it is likely that he did not serve before 1915. There seems to be a fairly comprehensive case to say that the journal was being kept when Arthur was serving at the end of or just after the war. He mentions Peronne and Bohain, both of which were areas that allied forces took in mid-late 1918, toward the end of the war; and he served as a dispatch rider for the inter-allied commission, many of which were set up both during and after the war.</p>   <p>It would certainly be interesting to find out more about Arthur, when he joined the army, whether he was conscripted, which inter-allied commission he worked for, and what he did when he returned home. However this information is not available in the sources that I have access to and may never be discovered.</p> <p> If you would like to read the original post about Arthur Powell’s Journal you can view it <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/5501\">here </a> </p> <p>By Rebecca Arnott, Assistant Curator, Royal Engineers Museum, Library &amp; Archive</p>"

        title: 'Italian roadshows unearth heartbreaking stories'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-06/naamloos-1.jpg\" alt=\"fort cadine\"></p>\r\n<p> 11 June 2013</p>  <p>The Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows continued their tour of Italy in May, with events on 15 May at the Rome National Central Library, and on 18 May at Valli del Pasubio in the striking location of Monte Maso Fort. The Rome event was organised in collaboration with the Central Institute for the Single Directory of Italian Libraries of MIbAC (Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities) and with the support of the National Museum of the Italian Renaissance.</p>  <p>Many members of the public contributed their personal stories and brought their families’ letters, diaries, notebooks, photographs and medals from the battle front. Among them were the story of a man who was saved by a gold medal that stopped a bullet, and the tale of a mother who, having woken in the middle of the night with a feeling of terror, found out that her son was killed by a grenade at the time she woke up. Among the memorabilia there was also a touching letter written from the front in which a man gave the custody of his three-year-old child to his brother, and other letters sent from a soldier to his wife, in which he signaled his position on the back of the stamp.</p> <p>In Rome, we collected over 70 stories and more than 600 files to illustrate them, whilst in Valli del Pasubio, 40 personal stories and 150 items gave us over 1,800 images to do with the First World War.</p> <p>We also had the opportunity to hold an educational seminar about the use of First World War digital archives. The seminar, aimed at schools, got the web generation involved in preserving historical memories through the use of new technologies, and engaged them in contributing to Europeana 1914-1918, the Europe-wide archive of a unique and important period of world history.</p>"

        title: 'Taking Europeana 1914-1918 personally'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"Brothers Friedrich\" src=\"/files/blogger/2013-03/christianimageblog.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you'll know if you're a frequent visitor to this site, <a href=\"http://world-war-i.europeana.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> is a crowd-sourced project. That means that it is you, its users, the members of the public, who make it what it is. It's your contributions, your stories, your time and effort. So far, with your help, we've collected over 2,500 stories and 40,000 digital files to illustrate them. A huge thank you from all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One contributor, however, has gone even further than simply submitting his family stories to the archive. Christian Reinboth from Germany has blogged about it and offered to set up a 'Europeana Day' in his home town to help others to add their stories to the collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian's great-great uncle Friedrich Reinboth fought in World War I and unfortunately, didn't come home from Ukraine to his native Nordhausen, Germany. Looking through the family attics, Christian found not only postcards and letters from him but also drawings, certificates and other military documents as well as handwritten field diaries from Friedrich's 7-year stint in a Hussarian regiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A photograph of the two brothers Friedrich (left) and Carl Reinboth (right), taken some time in the year of 1914. The older brother Friedrich is dressed in the parade uniform of the 14. Hussarian Regiment 'Friedrich II von Hessen-Homburg', in which he served during World War I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how did Christian find out about the Europeana 1914-1918 project? He says, 'Over the last few years, I have done volunteer work for the Museumsverband Sachsen-Anhalt, which is currently organising a touring exhibition about the First World War, which will be shown in many museums in Saxony-Anhalt from 2014 to 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, many exhibits related to the First World War are being digitised by the museums for the digitisation project museum-digital, which, in turn, is connected to Europeana via the ATHENA project. It was in one of the digitisation workshops organised by the association in 2011, that I first heard about the Europeana 1914-1918 project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I subsequently browsed the 1914-1918 website, I read the call for participation and decided to get involved by digitising documents, photos and field postcards from the inheritance of my great-great-uncle Friedrich Reinboth, who served in the 14. Hussarian Regiment 'Friedrich II von Hessen-Homburg' during World War One and who died on March 21st 1918 during an encounter in the Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, I have been able to contribute 13 exhibits to the project. Digitising these has also inspired me to take up the task of transcribing Friedrich's hand-written war diary - as of today, I have transcribed all entries from July of 1914 ('The enthusiasm for the upcoming war is rising') to August of 1915.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian is now encouraging others in the Walkenried area of Germany (an area with 4,600 residents in the Harz mountains) to contribute too. Christian offers to set up scanners, digital cameras and internet stations at the local museum in order to help others with the technical side of contributing. He has even put a short video together and posted it on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=JYqg-FCDk5M\">Youtube</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian says, 'Since I have had the opportunity to explore our own family archive in search of documents, letters and diaries written during World War One, I have becore more and more convinced that there are many undiscovered historical gems and untold family stories out there, that would certainly deserve to be preserved in the Europeana archives.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his blog, Christian, who is a computer scientist by day, also picks out some stories from the Europeana 1914-1918 archive that he finds most interesting. He recommends a diary of a British nurse with signatures of the wounded people she cared for, this 1914 letter giving a Tyrolean infantryman permission to stay out until 10 o'clock and this postcard from a Prague hospital from the year 1916.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian ends his blog with a sentiment that I'm sure we all share: 'So let's work together to ensure that the memories remain and that we collect the very personal family stories of this destructive and cruel war for the benefit of future generations.'</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-03/forte-cadine_051-bassa-1-.jpg\" alt=\"fort cadine\"></p>\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 is gearing up to visit Italy for the first time. A Family History Roadshow will take place on 16 March at Fort Cadine in Trento, in the Trentino region of northern Italy.</p> <p> Once again, the community is invited to bring along family memorabilia – including letters, photographs, objects, and diaries – and the stories that go with them, so that they can be scanned, recorded and added to the Europeana 1914-1918 archive. </p> <p>The venue for the Roadshow is Fort Cadine, otherwise known as Forte Bus de Vela. This historic building was built between 1860 and 1861, and strategically placed at the entrance to Trento. It was part of a group of permanent fortifications in defence of the communication routes to the region’s capital. It is a road barricade, made with pink calcareous ashlar stone, and has recently been restored.</p> <p>Fort Cadine, along with almost 80 others, controlled the Trentino region, defending the border between the Kingdom of Italy and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire at the start of the 1900s. Around the start of the First World War, the area was fortified further with hundreds of kilometres of trenches and strongholds. After the war, many of these constructions fell into decay and, in a certain sense, became part of the Alpine environment, others remained fearlessly standing and some, like Fort Cadine, have been restored or turned into museums and can be visited.</p> <p>The war lasted a year longer in the Trentino region than in the rest of Italy because at the time, the region was part of the Tyrol, an Austro-Hungarian province. In fact, when the conflict started in 1914, its citizens, soldiers of the emperor, were sent to fight on the Russian front, in Galicia, a region now divided between Poland and Ukraine. 60,000 left for the war and more than 11,000 died, while over 100,000   civilians were evacuated to Austria and Italy and 2,000, suspected of being pro-Italian   or pro-Austrian, were interned.</p> <p> The Trentino region now has a programme of activities aiming to replace the ‘fronts of war with paths of peace’, with a series of projects that aim to bring about a   ‘tomorrow of agreement between peoples of different cultures and faiths’. The   Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow is part of this programme. </p> <p> For more information about Trentino’s activities commemorating the Great War, you can visit <a href=\"http://www.trentinograndeguerra.it\">this page</a> </p> <p> Further Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows will take place in Italy later in the year.

I learned how strong was the pain on the day we had to separate. Do you remember those beautiful kisses? Do you remember the last one we gave each other between the tears. You did not dare to say a word. The tears were suffocating you. While passing by you were at the window. The [train] guard also told me that. I didn't see you. I almost thought you didn't keep the promise made. I didn't dare to watch more than once. My poor heart was suffocated not by tears, but by a strong passion that I couldn't resist. You knew what my beliefs were. Also having to leave you again, what a pain... By the end of the year we hope this will end... Greetings and kisses Giuseppe. Enjoy this souvenir from me. In these rough mountains you can find these flowers.</i> </p> <p> This moving love letter was sent by Sergeant Major Giuseppe Castellani, to his wife Antonia at home in Fossato di Vico, while he was away serving in the Italian army during the First World War. All her life Antonia cherished this edelweiss card, which was contributed online to Europeana 1914-1918 by their grandson Manuel Castellani. You may also contribute your family's stories from the Great War, and soon we will be running family history roadshows in Italy including Trento 16 March 2013.</p> <p> View the full story and pictures <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/3863\">here </a> </p> <p>Words by Alun Edwards and Monica Rossi (University of Oxford)</p>"

        title: 'An act of revenge'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2013-01/editorspickdenmark.jpg\" alt=\"map\"></p>\r\n<p> In the years leading up to the First World War, Southern Jutland was divided against itself. The region is now the South-Western part of Denmark, but from 1864 to 1920 it was the Northern part of Germany. The division between German-minded and Danish-minded people and families in the region still lingers intangibly today, albeit peacefully, but in the first quarter of the 20th century there was nothing peaceful about it. It was a clear and present fact of life and always felt to some degree in the family histories of the time. Very concretely it was often a matter of life and death. </p> <p> Iver Simonsen Juhler was born in 1880 in Aaved, Vodder parish, Skærbæk. He was called to arms on August 2nd, 1914, and eventually sent to the Eastern front. Here he contracted Typhus and was sent back to his home in Arnum in Southern Jutland. He was soon ordered to report to the field hospital in Toftlund where he was summarily declared healthy and sent back to the Eastern front. This was an unusual occurrence, because not only had he done one tour, he had a farm, he was a newlywed with a young daughter, and he had almost certainly not recovered from the typhus. </p> <p> There was a very good reason for the unusual process, however, if not a very honourable one. Iver’s mother-in-law, Katrine Stamp of Ullerup, came from a Danish-minded family. Years earlier she had sent her daughter to a high school in Denmark. The so-called ‘Germanification’ people led by regional mayor Lindemann from Toftlund and the German reverend Jacobsen of Skærbæk tried to put a stop to this. When Katrine refused they then tried to strip her of custody of her children and insert legal guardians for them against her will. Her complaints made their way upwards in the German bureaucracy and eventually reached Berlin where Katrine won the case. Her daughter was allowed to remain in the Danish high school. The mayor and the reverend could read about their humiliating defeat in all the newspapers.</p> <p> It was mayor Lindemann who recognised Iver as Katrine’s son-in-law and it was he who ordered him to the field hospital in Toftlund and had him sent back to the front. Iver was later transferred from the Eastern front to the Western front in France. He fell two days before the war ended in a big battle at Gouzon with so much shooting the Germans never had a chance to bury their dead. Two days before his death he wrote what amounted to a farewell letter to his wife Wiebke back home. The letter has been digitised and uploaded to the Europeana 1914-1918 family history database where it is accessible now along with thousands of other stories from all over Europe.</p> <p> View the full story and pictures <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/4387#prettyPhoto\">here </a> </p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2012-12/st-jandressingstation_map.jpg\" alt=\"map\"></p>\r\n<p>Simon Ray made contact with the In Flanders Field Museum (the venue for the next Family History Roadshow on 12 December) with a question he hoped staff could help him to answer.</p> <p>Simon’s grandfather, Charles William Alan Ray, fought in World War One and was wounded near Ypres on 25 April 1915. Simon knew that his grandfather was in the 5th Battalion London Rifles Transport, that he left Vlamertinghe on 25 April 1915 to help relieve wounded Canadian troops and that whilst at St Jean dressing station, shell fire injured him and killed several of his companions. But where was St Jean dressing station? That was the question Simon came to Ypres to answer.</p> <p>Simon has many items, letters and photographs relating to his grandfather’s experiences in World War One. Some of his digitised photographs are to be uploaded to Europeana 1914-1918 and he is working on digitising the letters. The following extract from one of the letters details what happened on that day at St Jean in Charles’ own words:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><i>\"Vlamertinghe is just a small town 3 or 4 miles behind Ypres and last Sunday when we got there it was packed with wounded mostly Canadians who have lost very heavily. They had been in the trenches for the two days previous without food or water as transports could get nowhere near for the shells and it was our duty to go and relieve them, which we started to do at 5.30 on Sunday evening. We could tell it was pretty hot further up as the wounded were coming down in a continual stream, those who weren't hit in the legs were walking, some were riding in empty RA limbers and the serious cases were going in the Red [Cross] motors.</i></p> <p><i>When we got near Ypres we were given the order to gallop as the place was being bombarded and you can guess we had an exciting ride for a couple of miles. Of course the place is very much torn about and dead horses and broken carts were fairly numerous on the roadside. At last we got to a little village called St. Jean on top of a hill, we called a halt just outside a dressing station where there were 4 or 5 motor ambulances and it was here that a shrapnel landed right in the middle of us.  It laid out quite a few of us and I won't tell you what things looked like afterwards as it is not very pleasant.\"</i></p> <p>Dressing stations were temporary places providing basic care and injury treatment, sometimes even emergency amputations. The In Flanders Field Museum has copies of the war diaries of the divisions, brigades and regiments who were on the Ypres front and so checked the war diary of the brigade in which Charles’ battalion served. As luck would have it, they found a map showing the location of many dressing stations near Ypres. St Jean dressing station is marked to the north-east of Ypres.  A collection of aerial photographs also showed the exact position of the dressing station during the period in which Charles was wounded. Equipped with this new information, Simon was able to visit the exact location in which Charles was wounded, taking with him his grandfather’s medal.</p> <p>The Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow takes place on 12 December 2012 from 10:00-17:00 at Kenniscentrum In Flanders Fields Museum, Lakenhallen, Grote Markt 34, 8900 Ieper, access through the Tourist Information Office.</p>"

        title: 'Success in Cyprus'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2012-12/4491.52410.original.jpg\" alt=\"leg\"></p>\r\n<p>The latest Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow took place last weekend (1-2 December) at the Cultural Services of the Ministry of Education and Culture in Nicosia, Cyprus.  More than 150 visitors from all over Cyprus attended and brought their memorabilia and stories. The roadshow went very smoothly following successful promotion - every community and village in Cyprus was contacted and the event was covered on all Cypriot TV channels. More than 150 people contributed the WW1 memorabilia of their ancestors, such as photographs, letters and diaries, at the roadshow.</p> <p>Even though the roadshow is now over, it isn’t the end of the collections in Cyprus. The team, who have already visited many villages in person, are on the road again this week with a small roadshow in Paphos for those who couldn’t make it to the main event. Many people are joining together to participate - collecting the stories from their villages and sending them collectively to the roadshow.</p> <p>So far more than 500 digital images from Cypriots are published on the project website, adding to the rich archive of thousands of WW1 images from all over Europe - just search for ‘Cyprus’ to find them.  An interesting place to start is the extraordinary story of Agathoklis Hajichristodoulou from Polystipos – who later went by the name Polistipiotis. Agathoklis lost both his legs in Salonika to frostbite. He was the only injured person to have been given compensation: 40 pounds and a set of ‘new’ prosthetic legs. He drifted for a few years, before being given a job in the Forestry Department, but after about a decade of service, he was fired because he constantly complained about his legs, which had been replaced twice. So in the late 1930s he was given 50 pounds and another new set of legs to start his own business, either a grocery or a cobbler. One of the three sets of prosthetic legs that Agathoklis changed is now kept at the Science Museum of London!</p>"

        title: 'Cyprus in WWI – documents rediscovered'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img alt=\"Keith Brain\" src=\"/files/blogger/2012-11/8volumes_dsc_0536.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p> <strong>Foreign Office - Nov 9th 1914 - CIRCULAR</strong></p>\r\n<i>\"His Majesty’s Government having annexed Cyprus, all Natives of that island, unless domiciled in the Ottoman Dominions elsewhere than in Egypt, are to be considered British Subjects.”</i> <p>This document and other records kept at the National Archives of Great Britain clearly show the great impact of the world-changing events of WWI on Cyprus. With the complete British annexation in November 1914, Cyprus became more and more integrated into British war efforts. It was an important base in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p> <p>The war also influenced the personal life of ordinary Cypriot families. During the years of war a great shortage of labourers was felt, since a high proportion of the male population went to serve in the Macedonian Mule Corps (MMC) at the Salonika Front in Macedonia. These young muleteers, as newly British subjects, were later entitled to receive the British War Medal (BWM), cast in bronze.</p>   <p>In 1919, a list of all Cypriot members of the Macedonian Mule Corps was compiled. All eight volumes of it have survived and are housed at the National Archives. The Greek members, however, were not entitled to the medal and were not listed. This list is a unique historical source for Cypriot history. It states the names, relatives and home towns of about 13,000 Cypriots serving from 1916-1919 in the MMC. All efforts will be made to transcribe the list and make it available online, so that every Cypriot family can discover if their grandfathers or great-grandfathers took part in WWI.</p>     <p><strong>MMC roll list</strong></p> <p>The turbulent events in Greece also influenced life in Cyprus. The British documents state that when the Greek mobilisation call came out in 1915, flocks of volunteers reported to the Greek consulate to join the Greek army. Later, the former Cypriot volunteers from the Balkan wars were asked to register at the Greek consulate. Unfortunately, the documents do not say if any of these Cypriots actually went to serve in the Greek army during WWI.</p> <p>The British Commissioner also reported that in 1916 all Greek subjects living in Cyprus were asked to swear an oath of allegiance to Greece and be registered at the Greek consulate. In Larnaca, 39 people were registered as Greek subjects. At the end of the war in 1918, a nationalist demonstration calling for the reunion with Greece took place in Larnaca on the name-day of Eleftherios Venizelos, the then Prime Minister of Greece.</p> <p>All these documents show that the war did not go unnoticed in Cyprus. Many families were affected in one way  or another.</p> <p>If you have any personal documents, photos or other memorabilia from that time, please share them online or bring them to the Cyprus Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow on 1 and 2 December 2012 at the Cultural Services of the Ministry of Education and Culture (27 Ifigeneias, Strovolos, Nicosia) from 10:00am until 5:30pm.

        title: 'Oxfordshire families turn out in force for UK roadshow'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogger/2012-11/rsz_cigarettetin.jpg\" alt=\"cigarettetin\"></p>\r\n<p>More than 250 people came to the Europeana 1914-1918 Roadshow at Banbury Museum, UK, on 3 November, bringing with them their families’ World War One treasures. Approximately 4,000 images of their objects were captured on the day. Historians and experts from the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, the Western Front Association and University of Oxford IT Services were on hand to talk about the significance of finds as they came in.</p> <p>Here is a sneak preview of just some of the stories from Banbury coming to this website very soon…</p> <p> <strong>Arthur Reginald Mann</strong> could be described as a very lucky man, or equally, a dreadfully unlucky one. In separate incidents the soldier, who served in the Flying Corp and became a Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery, survived a bullet in the leg, being gassed in the trenches, being shot out of the sky by the Red Baron, and being a cigarette smoker. The latter, in fact, saved his life. Whilst on the front line, he came under enemy fire and survived only because the cigarette tin (pictured) he kept in his pocket took the brunt of the shot.</p> <p>In a letter dated 19 February 1918, <strong>Horace William Hawtin</strong> tells with a sense of foreboding how he predicts the war will last longer than the month his comrades anticipate and how he does not want to be sent to France to fight. Horace was right – the war was not over in a month, although his wish was granted in that he was not stationed in France. Instead, he was sent on to Belgium where he was wounded. He died of his injuries on Thursday 10 October 1918, aged 21 years old, just a month before the war ended.</p> <p><strong>Percy Chaplin’s</strong>family brought along a German South-West African campaign flag on which Percy had written ‘This flag I took from the Germans at Windhuk (sic) German South West African Campaign. 1915’. Percy was the driver for Boer War Hero and first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, General Louis Botha.  A photograph shows Percy driving the General’s Vauxhall car.</p>"

Aarhus and Copenhagen open their doors to patrons with stories and artifacts from the First World War. The events are the second leg of the Danish Europeana 1914-1918 initiative which started with a national Collection Day at Sønderborg Castle April 24th 2012. The libraries typically collaborate with the relevant archives in their area to offer digitisation of objects and recording of family stories.</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the gathering is to get citizens to tell the story of the time and how the Danes lived at that time. We hope that you might show up with objects that may shed a new light on the First World War.</p> <p>Do you have memories of the First World War - from war or simply from everyday life? Have you letters, photographs, diaries or other things from time 1914-1918, which you have inherited?</p> <p>We are looking for memories that can shed light on the time living with a focus on the war and postwar conditions. Even small stories and objects can be used to help elucidate the time and Denmark as a neutral nation up to the war zone. It is best to consult a history of the object or photograph to be digitized. In this way we told the story of how people lived in Denmark during the war.</p> <p> Look in de sidebar for more information!</p>"

        title: 'The Tragedy of the Brain Brothers'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img alt=\"Keith Brain\" src=\"/files/blogger/2012-11/rsz_schermafbeelding_2012-11-02_om_123432.png\"></p>\r\n<p>A photograph of his grandfather in World War One prompted Keith Brain to research his family’s history and led to the discovery of great-uncles he never knew he had. Keith hopes that by making his photographs available online through Europeana 1914-1918, some of the other men seen serving alongside his grandfather may be able to be identified.</p> <p><strong>‘It’s important to preserve documents and photos to ensure that the men who served are not forgotten.’</strong></p> <p>Keith, a retired IT systems support analyst, was born in Banbury and lived the first 35 years of his life in the town. He attended the then Banbury Grammar School and played rugby for Banbury Rugby Club where he is still a member. His wife, Sue, is a Banbury girl and they both have strong family connections to the area.</p> <p><strong>Keith’s story…</strong></p> <p>A photograph of my grandfather, Harry Brain (on the left of the picture), in tropical army uniform was the start of a fascinating journey to discover the part played by Harry and, as I later discovered, his brothers in the Great War. Why was Harry in tropical uniform when his regiment, the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars served throughout the war in France and Belgium? Who was the unknown brother beside Harry in the photograph? Harry had been wounded in the war and the bullet in his leg was never removed. Where was he when he was wounded and what was he doing?</p> <p>\"During my research I was amazed to find that Harry had three other brothers who had served in the war. Albert Brain, 2nd Battalion Warwickshire Regiment missing believed killed in action 21st Nov 1914 in Fleurbaix, France. George Brain, 10th Battalion, Sherwood Foresters (Notts and Derby) Regiment killed in action 22nd March 1918 in Havrincourt, France. And William Brain, 2nd Battalion Grenadier Guards.</p> <p>One can only imagine the anguish of their mother Sarah Brain of Calthorpe Street, Banbury, on learning that two of her sons had been killed and another wounded.</p> <p>George had moved to Tollerton, Notts before the war and William, a former postman in Bloxham, near Banbury had married then moved to Liverpool. Albert and Harry, however, like very many other Banbury men had set out from Calthorpe Street to ‘do their bit’ in the Great War.</p> <p>I found a photo of Harry in a group of wounded/sick men and nurses in the grounds of the Red Cross Hospital, West Street, Grimsbury. Harry is the fifth man from the left in the back row. This Wesleyan Chapel was used as a hospital from 1915 to 1919. It would be very exciting if the other men in the group could be identified.</p>   <p>Digitising and uploading the artefacts and documents about the men who served will ensure that their experiences and sacrifice will never be forgotten.</p>"

        body: '<p> Cyprus’ participation in World War One was significant, especially when compared to the island’s size and capabilities. 16,000 Cypriots served in the British Army during the war. This was a huge number, equivalent to 5.8% of the island’s total population of 274,108. Most of them served on the Macedonian front as muleteers.</p> <p>Do you have memorabilia from World War One? Letters, photographs, diaries, sound recordings, films, or any other material?</p> <p>Share them on this online archive.</p> <p>Or bring them to the Cyprus roadshow on 1 and 2 December 2012 at the Cultural Services of the Ministry of Education and Culture (27 Ifigeneias, Strovolos, Nicosia) from 10:00am until 5:30pm.</p> <p>Experts will be available to digitise your material and record your oral stories. All material will be returned to you on the same day.</p> <p>The war had a significant impact on the everyday life of Cypriots at home. So as well as military memorabilia, we’re looking for non-military material that tells Cyprus’ story during the period of 1914-1918.</p>'

        title: 'Could Europeana 1914-1918 solve 12-year-old boy’s mystery?'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n<img alt=\"Kevin Northover\" src=\"/files/blogger/2012-10/rsz_2blogcasestudy2.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p>When a 12-year-old boy from Banbury was given two items of World War One memorabilia by his grandmother, he had no idea that they would reveal a ‘remarkable coincidence’ that he would still be researching decades later.</p>\r\n<p>It was several years before young Kevin came to question the provenance of the objects now in his care – a photograph of a young soldier and a piece of fabric thought to be part of a German aeroplane. By this time, his grandmother had passed away and so all he had to go on were scraps of information from his mother and the clues written on the items themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photograph of a smart moustached man in Army uniform is captioned ‘Uncle Will’ and was taken at Blinkhorns, Banbury, a portrait photographers established in 1883 and still in business today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A handwritten note on the back of the piece of fabric provides the link between the two objects. It reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><b>15-771</b></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>My Dear ones all,<br>I am sending this, a piece of a German aeroplane brought down by men of our own with machine gun fire on 29/4/16 at Maroeuil just behind our lines. Take care of it, I may not have a chance to get another piece. I am glad to say I am quite well, hope you all at home are. Love to all from your loving husband Will xxxxxxxxx </i></p>\r\n<p>‘Uncle Will’ was in fact Kevin’s great-uncle, the brother of his grandmother. The family had lived in Kings Road, Banbury, and Will had brought up his sister from the age of six months when his mother had died. According to family legend, Will went to war and had some fingers bitten off by a horse, a story Kevin later found out to be incorrect.</p>\r\n<p>Kevin did some digging and managed to locate some of his great-uncle’s service records which helped him to fill in the gaps in the story, including what really happened to Will’s fingers.</p>\r\n<p><b>William’s story…</b><br>William Henry Goldsmith was born in 1880 and enlisted into the Bedfordshire regiment in August 1915. He went to France in 1916, transferring to the Machine Gun Corps. It was whilst serving at the front near Arras that his comrades brought down a German aeroplane. The piece of fabric he sent home to his family was from this very plane.</p>\r\n<p>In November 1917, William was wounded in action. He wasn’t, as the family story had told, been bitten by a horse. Was this simply a story told to the children so as not to frighten them? The more violent truth was that two of William’s right-hand fingers had been blown off by gunfire.</p>\r\n<p>William was evacuated to England. His injuries eventually healed but he was unable to return to the frontline. Instead, he was retained at the Machine Gun School in Grantham, Lincolnshire, working in the Officers’ Mess.</p>\r\n<p>After his discharge from the Army in 1919, William returned to Banbury where he stayed until the early 1920s. He then moved to London with his wife and son. <br>William’s sister (Kevin’s grandmother) married and stayed at the house in Kings Road until her death in 1994 at the age of 95.</p>\r\n<p><b>Remarkable coincidence</b></p>\r\n<p>But what of the German aeroplane and its crew?</p>\r\n<p>Kevin’s research turned up what could be a remarkable coincidence and one which he hopes the Europeana 1914-1918 project might be able to confirm or deny.</p>\r\n<p>In trying to uncover the identity of the German plane, Kevin found that a German aircraft - Reconnaissance Flight 4b - was indeed brought down on 29 April 1916 at Arras by Maroeuil. This matches the date and location Will specified in his note. This plane’s pilot, Frederick (Peter) Bichert and observer Georg Krafft were buried in the British Military Cemetery at Arras. Could this be the exact plane brought down by William’s regiment and these the men killed in the incident?</p>\r\n<p>The crew’s last resting place provides an intriguing link to the Goldsmith family. Less than 12 months after the German plane was shot down, a man named Bill Batts, who was Kevin’s grandmother’s husband’s brother (another of Kevin’s great-uncles) was himself buried in the same cemetery as the German soldiers, Frederik and Georg.</p>\r\n<p>Kevin says, ‘If this proves to be correct, it would be a remarkable coincidence for our family. It would be interesting to think that by displaying my items on the Europeana 1914-1918 site this may be proven by someone.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Beth Daley</p>"

        title: 'Runway Archive: Kansai Yamamoto A/W 1985-86'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/thumbnail-by-url-6-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 586px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sayoko Yamaguchi on the catwalk of Kansai Yamamoto, a/w 1985-86 collection. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the picture, the model Sayoko Yamaguchi is wearing a look from Kansai Yamamoto a/w 1985-86 collection. The look is composed by a long red multi-layered cape with black satin sleeves, which the model is opening in the picture, showing the golden bodice she is wearing underneath. The bodice, that resembles an armour, is decorated with red and gold scales and moulded as a women’s breast. With her head wrapped in a red veil, the model is also wearing a golden hat, shaped like a moon’s quarter, with a cockade on the front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDesigner Kansai Yamamoto debuted his first collection in London in 1971, but moved to Paris in 1975, where he later opened his boutique and invaded the catwalks of Paris with his dramatic and colourful pieces. Far from the wabi-sabi aesthetic usually associated with Japan, Kansai Yamamoto has well expressed his theatricality in the costumes designed for and worn by performers like David Bowie; asymmetric knitted jumpsuits, immense capes with Japanese idioms and space-likes bodysuits evoke both the eccentricity of the late artist and of the Japanese fashion designer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: Ensemble by Cristóbal Balenciaga, 1947'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/2048217-mude-m-0647-01.jpeg\" style=\"width: 886px; height: 1328px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Esemble designed by Cristóbal Balenciaga, 1947. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows an ensemble designed by Cristóbal Balenciaga in 1947.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ensemble is composed by a long dress and a bolero. Both items are in bright red, and decorated with rich embroidery in floral and vegetable motifs and beads, concentrated on the lapel line and sleeves for the bolero, and around the neckline and waistline for the dress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cristóbal Balenciaga was a Spanish fashion designer known as “The King of Fashion” for the groundbreaking designs he presented, and especially for the iconic silhouettes he developed during the 1950s and 1960s. Son of a seamstress, at the age of twelve he began working as apprentice in a tailor shop in Getaria, his hometown in the north of Spain. When Balenciaga was just a teenager, a noblewoman in his town became his customer and patron, sending him to Madrid to train as tailor in one of the best schools of the capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He opened a boutique in San Sebastián, in the north of Spain, in 1919, and then other two branches in Madrid and Barcelona. Amongst his clients, were the Spanish royal family and the aristocracy. However, at the end of the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his business and immigrate to Paris. He opened his first atelier on George V Avenue in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balenciaga’s earliest collections were heavily influenced by Spanish history and culture, to which the designer was very attached to. The references to Spanish culture remained consistent throughout his whole career. Talking about the designer, Diana Vreeland declared: \"Balenciaga was the true son of a strong country filled with style, vibrant color, and a fine history. He remained forever a Spaniard…his inspiration came from the bullrings, the flamenco dancers, the fishermen in their boots and loose blouses, the glories of the church and the cool of the cloisters and monasteries. He took their colors, their cuts, then festooned them to his own taste.” </p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'A Craft''s Story: the Delphos Dress'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Mariano Fortuny was an inventor, interested in the electricity and focused on the invention of lightning techniques and other technological devices. He patented over two thousand invention; but one of the most famous, the Delphos dress, was an example craftmanship, completely produced by hand in his Venetian workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 532px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Delphos dress by Mariano Fortuny, 1911 ca. Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mariano Fortuny was a one kind of total artist. Impressed by the music of Richard Wagner after assisting to Bayreuth Festival at the age of 21, the Spanish artist, designer and inventor made his ambition that to achieve the <em>gesamtkunstwerk</em>. He applied himself to different artistic disciplines, including painting, photography, sculpture, engraving and scenography. Based in Venice, where he moved with his family from Paris following the death of his father, he made of the <em>Palazzo</em> that he inhabited his atelier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/thumbnail-by-url-3-.jpg\" style=\"width: 258px; height: 389px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Detail, belt of a Delphos dress, Mariano Fortuny, 1920-1940 ca. Courtesy Museo Del Traje, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Delphos dress was his contribution to couture. Having experimented with printing techniques and dying on velvet, producing scarfs and shawls that were worn by Mata Hari among others, the Delphos gave form to his research and curiosity over dress. It was inspired by the line of the <em>chiton</em>, an ancient Greek costume that consisted of a long tunic worn over the body and fixed to the waist with a belt. The Delphos, made in Venetian velvet or in thin Japanese silk fabric, was a long pleated dress, with no seams, and bind with Venetian glass beads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/thumbnail-by-url-2-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 603px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>“Peplos” gown by Mariano Fortuny, a variation of the “Delphos”, of pleated mauve silk, decorated with Murano glass beads at the side and gold prints at the belt; 1910s. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Mariano Fortuny was focused throughout his life in new technologies and inventions, the Delphos dress was crafted entirely by hand in his venetian workshop, where he overlooked each procedure of its production, which involved not only dying and hand pleating the fabric with the technique of ‘<em>plissé soleis</em>’, but also the hand dying of the thread used for the details and to fix the glass beads, and their application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Delphos dress was first invented by the artist in 1907. It was light enough to be wrapped and put in a hatbox. It was conceived to be worn without corset, its pleated fabric clinging to the body, freeing the previously constrictive women’s silhouette. For its simple lines and freedom of movement it enabled, the Delphos was appreciated and worn by many artist, such as the dance innovators Martha Graham and Isadora Duncan.</p>"

        title: 'Customization as Craft: Punk and DIY Aesthetics'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Every action that involves the use of hands to make something, or to make a change on something, can be considered a craft. This is why styling - as a way of creating an image by piecing together different items and also modifying them - can in some cases be called craft. In the 1970, the Punk movement originated in the UK. Together with it came Do-It-Yourself aesthetics and practices, directly affecting the material culture and image of the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/1498121114_thumbnail-by-url.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 554px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Punk ensemble, beginning of the 1980s, Courtesy Stieflsen Nordiska Museet, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The punk movement came as a violent and loud response to the institutional structure that was suffocating the lower classes. Using their visibility as first weapon to counteract this stagnant situation, punks exploited fashion in order to stand out and make their voice heard through their appearance, so strikingly different from the middle class men and women they were protesting against.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protest happened also through the active production of material culture: using as a basis some of the codes of British culture - the Scottish check, for example - Punks used to customize their clothing and accessories with other symbols. The most iconic were safety pins, used to reconstruct the items that were deliberately ripped or torn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/2048217-mude-m-0574.jpeg\" style=\"width: 539px; height: 786px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Seditionaries by Vivienne Westwood, 1977, Courtesy MUDE - Museo do Design e da Moda, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, early Punk fashion was based, more than on designing items, on styling what was ready to buy. Customization came in all forms and allowed punk aesthetic to develop as a craft. The most skilled at this craft managed to turn the movement into a business. The names most commonly linked to the Punk Movements were Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, who opened Sex and Seditionaries in the Chelsey area in London in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/780237e82879755f921b0e423030ac49.jpg\" style=\"width: 446px; height: 698px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Items from Zandra Rhodes collection, 1977, Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another designer who got inspired by the Punk Aesthetic was Zandra Rhodes, who presented a collection called Conceptual Chic in 1977, which featured safety pins, chains and other symbols of what started as a DIY aesthetic.</p>"

        title: 'Runway Archive: Yves Saint Laurent S/S 1984'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/61573309.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 750px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Yves Saint Laurent s/s 1984 ready to wear collection, photo by Paul Van Riel. Image courtesy Paul Van Riel, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this picture a model is walking the runway of Yves Saint Laurent s/s 1984 fashion show held at the Cour du Louvre, swinging her printed black chiffon dress. The dress, long to the feet, is multi-layered and is composed by a wide skirt and a ruffled top. The print on black backgroud looks like ribbons and confettis, in the colours of red, blue, white and orange. To complete the silhouette, the model is wearing a chuncky gold necklace and wide red hearrings, and a veiled hat with a big rose on its top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s and all through the 80s, Yves Saint Laurent revolutionized Couture bringing new air in the almost centenary French tradition. He is said to have taken inspiration 'from the street', overturning the rules of the ever-imposing couture. Throughout his career - which began as assistant of Christian Dior and, soon after his death, as director of the Maison Dior - his indomitable style led him to become one of the most celebrated French designers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion appears as case study on Art Libraries Journal'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Art Libraries Journal (ALJ) is the main international forum for libraries and documentation of the visual arts and is published quarterly by Cambridge University Press. In 2017, the academic journal decided to dedicate two thematic issues to fashion. According to the editor, Erica Fohden-Lenahan, the inspiration for the issues came from a conversation about the literature of dress between ALJ editor, Philip Pacey, and Stella Mary Newton, who at the time was a research fellow at The Courtauld Institute of Art. The conversation was documented in the 1976 Autumn Issue of Art Libraries Journal; it was characterized by Newton’s disappointment about the lack of resources available in libraries to those studying and researching the study of dress. The fact that two ALJ-issues had to be dedicated to fashion resources clearly shows that, since 1976, we have come a long way forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both issues featured many European submissions and the article about Europeana Fashion was selected because the Europeana Fashion archive draws together so many contributing collections from so many important institutions and thus forms an interesting corpus of knowledge on fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/lmp-jaargang-19-19101015.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 540px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>La mode pratique: revue de la famille - issue Oct. 15, 1910, Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content of the article is probably familiar to most readers of this blog; it outlines the origins of the Europeana Fashion project, focusing on its main achievements and offering a look into the future. The article starts with explaining the main goal of Europeana Fashion, namely to harvest the digital collections of fashion institutions and to represent them in a uniform way on a specialized fashion portal. The article looks at the start of Europeana Fashion by explaining the targets of the EU-funded project (under the Competiveness Innovation Program (CIP) for the objective: Aggregating Content for Europeana). The main achievements of this CIP-funded phase, that lasted from 2012 until 2015, were layed out, and featured the introduction to the aggregation platform MINT, built to harvest and transform the diverse records of its 20 content partners. It further focuses on the Europeana Fashion datamodel (EDM-fp) and the Fashion Thesaurus available in ten languages to harmonize the multilingual content of the project. The functionalities of the Europeana Fashion Portal are also explained, as is the Wikimedia collaboration on Europeana Fashion content that resulted in edit-a-thons for Wikipedia articles on fashion, and the many network events, workshops and conferences organized by Europeana Fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life after the Europeana Fashion project was treated in the second part of the article, which featured the establishment of the Europeana Fashion International Association, and the continuation of Europeana Fashion as an expert hub under the so-called Europeana DSI (which is a new phase of EU-funding, that supports Europeana as a Digital Service Infrastructure). As an expert hub, Europeana Fashion focuses on improving the quality of its data (currently more than 1 million photos and more than 860.000 records) and curating and editing this wealth of information through its social media, but also keeping alive the network of Europeana Fashion, a network that has grown to 40 content providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article concludes with a section dedicated to the continuation of the portal Europeanafashion.eu as a thematic channel of Europeana, and spells out the future ambitions of our initiative, which is to continue to grow our network, improve and expand our content, and organize training and events for our partners and stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dieter Suls, Scientific Librarian at MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</strong></p>"

Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blouse is made of natural coloured wool, knitted in an intricate design resembling a sixteenth century doublet. The knit is twisted, turned and braided to create different layers and volumes over the knitted blouse. The shoulders are padded with a braid, and the short sleeves are ribbed. The body is also ribbed, and ends with a twisted basque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This design was shown in MoMu’s exhibition ‘Unravel. Knitwear in Fashion’ (March – August 2011) that showed how the technique of knitting keeps being pushed and challenged by contemporary creatives and designer. One of these designers is Sandra Backlund, who discovered and explored the braiding technique during her studies and in 2007 won the Grand Prix at the Festival International De Mode et De Photographie Hyères with her extreme knits. For her designs, she takes inspiration from her personal and intimate experiences; her a/w 2008-09, for instance, is entitled 'Last Breath Bruises' after the time she fell from the stairs in the exact moment her grandmother passed away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>What is a fashion object? What is in a fashion object? The answers to these questions are far more complex than ‘an item of clothing.’ Together with the materiality of the object comes a whole constellation of other characteristics, which may be less tangible but surely not less meaningful. In being complex agglomerates of material and metaphoric features, fashion objects become signs, symbols of our position in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/57200934.jpg\" style=\"width: 522px; height: 762px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Fashion show of Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, spring/summer 1979 women's ready-to-wear collection, Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since fashion is something that gets meaning when worn, fashion has been exploiting the power of symbols in order to reach a higher level of meaning.

Objects can sometimes be produces in order to celebrate or commemorate a moment, turning them into the material remain of something as ephemeral as a memory.

Diving into these matters will be this month’s task for us, and we are thrilled to present how the holdings in the European Fashion archive can contribute to the understanding of the symbolic power of fashion.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Fashion shows are an essential part of the fashion industry. Having evolved from private ‘défilés’ staged by the couture houses for their costumers to major events including the most breath-taking special effects, fashion shows are indispensable to narrate contemporary fashion history. From the most humble to the most sensational, they contribute to describe the fashion zeitgeist and to inscribe its protagonists in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-10-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Valentino couture show, a/w 1989, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different elements concur in making fashion shows so important: from the choice of the location to the way models walk the runway, to the music that gives rythm to the catwalk and the people sitting on the front row, and finally the looks presented. As a result, fashion shows can be considered the point where much of the efforts of all the professionals involved in the design process converge, and more than a vehicle, sometimes they are the actual concretization of the holistic vision of the designer or creative director, showing his or her research and work, in an ephemerals but still memorable way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-5-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Dries Van Noten, a/w 1997, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month, on the Europeana Fashion Tumblr we aim to highlight these ephemeral events through the pictures that captured them. Jumping from the past to the present and back again, we will try to illustrate the different forms these shows have taken, to revive and discover the history fashion thorugh the images of its enactment.</p>"

Their careless attitude reflects that of their clothes, two oversized ensembles in denim, composed of a buttoned jacket and baggy jeans, tied to the wast with a knitted belt in blue and green.

The titled referred to the resemblance to hyerogliphs and and magic signs of the art of Keith Haring's, who designed the prints and the patterns of the jacquard knitted pieces. The collection mixed the rebellious spirit of the British punk with the streetwear looks of the New York hip-hop scene, signalling one of the most memorable collaboration between art and fashion.</p>"

        body: "<p>On July 5, the museum of Les Arts Decoratifs in Paris opened a major retrospective on the Maison Christian Dior, celebrating the 70th anniversary from its foundation, staging the dresses that contributed to turn the maison into a myth. The selection implied in the development of an exhibition entails a thought, a choice - and the results of this choice have the power to become symbols.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/2048218-uf-74-25-1.jpeg\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 899px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Mexique ensemble, Christian Dior, 1951, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>The Exhibition \"Christian Dior, Designer of Dreams” was curated by Florence Muller and Oliveir Gabet showcases 300 Haute Couture creations of the maison Dior, telling the story of the brand through its most iconic creations. It is organized according to themes, in order to point out the influences and other links that have informed the work produced by the designers working for the maison throughout the years. This is why not only dresses, but also objects are part of the selection the curators made, to give the audience also the context that inspired the dresses.</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/2048218-uf-69-28-14-abcde.jpeg\" style=\"width: 568px; height: 852px;\" /></strong></em></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Adélaïde ensemble, Christian Dior, 1948, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>The exhibition not only focuses on Christian Dior, the founder of the maison, who kept his position in the years between 1947 and 1957, when he suddenly died and his young assistant Yves Saint Laurent was appointed his successor. In those ten years, Christian Dior layed out some codes which became the core elements of the language of the maison, and each designer that followed had to get in con versions with. In the exhibition, it is possible to see designs also from Yves Saint Laurent, Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferré, John Galliano, Raf Simons and Maria Grazia Chiuri, giving the chance to the audience to understand the path each of these designers followed while confronting with the heritage of the maison.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-1.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Stour Head ensemble, Christian Dior by John Galliano, 1998, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition is a unique occasion to really understand the work of Christian Dior and appreciate his legacy; it allows to grasp how the identity of the maison adapted to social and cultural changes throughout the years, while always being able to translate the ‘spirit of the times’ into stunning creations, whose sublime manufacture also talks about an attention to craftsmanship and a will to establish a timeless elegance.</p>"

        title: 'Schiaparelli to the utmost: sculpture buttons'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Fashion designers constantly draw their inspiration from art, and collaboration between artists and designers have been frequent since the early days of Paris Couture, when avant-garde movements started to establish themselves. One of the most consolidate relationship between art and fashion is the liason couturiere Elsa Schiaparelli established with Surrealism. The couturiere not only took inspiration from the movement to create some of her most remarkable pieces, like the shoe-hat. She also invited surrealist artists to contribute to the creation of her fashion objects, like for the famous lobster-print and the torn trompe-l’oeil dresses, both made with fabric designed by Salvador Dalì.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-2-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 266px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Button designed by Jean Schlumberger for Elsa Schiaparelli, ca. 1935-40. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this collaboration found its greatest and most celebrated results in this prints and embroideries, the surrealist influence in Schiaparelli's creations could be found even in the smallest and apparently discrete details – the buttons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-4-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 266px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Button, Elsa Schiaparelli, 1930s. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of various and different shapes and forms, the buttons took the form of the Maison’s obsessions. These included the renowned circus horses, but also trapeze artists, bugs, nuts and lumps of sugar. As Schiaparelli was allegedly said to find buttons ‘boring’, she did her best to transform them in a different sculpture. for every collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 266px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Button designed by Jean Cocteau for Elsa Schiaparelli, 1930s. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do so, she was helped by her artists friends like Jean Schlumberger, Jean Cocteau or Hans Arp, who came up with the most extravagant design, that Schiaparelli was willing to accomplish. Made of different materials, from wood to gold and gems or terracotta, Schiaparelli’s extravagant buttons even became one of the symbols of her Maison. More than a decoration, they could be defined the embodiment of Schiaparelli codes and spirit.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: Ensemble designed by Christian Dior and photographed by Kerstin Benhard, 1947'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/new look 1947.jpg\" style=\"width: 589px; height: 840px;\" /></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ensemble designed by Christian Dior and photographed by Kerstin Bernhard, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet, CC BY-NC-ND</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows a model wearing an ensemble from the infamous 1947 collection of Christian Dior, where he present for the first time his 'corolle' line. The photograph was taken by Swedish photographer Kerstin Bernhard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 February 1947, Christian Dior launched his first collection. The show was presented at 30 Avenue Montaigne, in the salons of the maison. The lines presented were named Corolle and Huit. However, soon after the presentation, the collection became known as the ‘New Look’ thanks to Carmel Snow, then-editor inches of Harper’s Bazaar, who exclaimed \"It's such a New Look! It’s quite a revolution, dear Christian!’ The New Look represented the new spirit that was about to permeate fashion right after the restrictions imposed by World War II. The most known ensemble of the collection is the Bar suit, whose silhouette was characterised by a small waist and rounded shoulders, emphasizing the bust, and a full skirt falling below mid-calf length falling gently on the hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The skirt took twenty yards of fabrics, and many detractors said it was inconsiderate to use so much material after years of rationing. The new look was quite controversial for many other reasons: feminists complained it was dragging women backwards, given that it reintroduced the corset, depriving women of the freedom of movement - and independence. However, the new style introduced by Christian Dior was extremely popular among women in Europe and America from its presentation, and its influence is still alive not only in the creations of the designers of the maison Dior - from Galliano to Simons and now Maria Grazia Chiuri - but represents a reference for fashion students and designers worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kerstin Bernhard was a Swedish photographer. She studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and, in the middle of the 1930s, she began studying at the architecture, design and photography school Contempora Lehrateliers in Berlin. She started working as a freelance photographer in 1938 and got her first own studio in the beginning of 1940. During the 1940s, Bernhard began to photograph fashion and in 1947, she traveled to Paris to photograph the Haute Couture, and got the chance to be present when Christian Dior launched his New Look.</p>"

        title: 'Stolen Symbols / Original Identity: Franco Moschino'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Ownership <span style=\"color: rgb(29, 33, 41); font-family: 'San Francisco', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, '.SFNSText-Regular', sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.23999999463558197px; white-space: pre-wrap;\">- of ideas, of images, of codes -</span> in fashion is always a complicated matter. Even though many designers have tried to patent their creations in order to avoid copies, Some other designers took the most well-established symbols of fashion and included into their own language, in order to generate new meanings. Franco Moschino was undoubtedly one of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franco Moschino was born in 1950 near Milan. He studied fine art at Accademia delle Belle Arti in Milan, and while he was a student there he worked as freelance illustrator in order to pay the school fees. In 1971, Moschino started working as illustrator for Gianni Versace, and in 1977 moved from illustration to design, and in 1977 became the designer for the Italian brand Cadette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His brand Moschino Couture! Was founded in 1983. The identity of the brand was based on the ironic and almost irreverent attitude of Franco Moschino himself. Coming from a working class background, the designer decided to challenge the establishment, using the staples of high fashion and turning them into their ironic copycats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/2048217-mude-m-0021.jpeg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 800px;\" /><strong><em>Moschino Dress, 1993, Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo, All Rights Reserved</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most well-known creations following this philosophy are the jackets, modeled on the classic Chanel jacket, but embellished with slogans such as ‘Expensive Jacket’ or flashy and ‘un-classy’ trimmings and other details. The look of his creations was exaggerate, garish and opulent, almost exuding richness, but the materials used were definitely uncommon for the couture world. The very name of the brand declared the position of the designer: couture! With an exclamation point that set the brand apart from the ‘hauteur’ of the regular couture straight away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/b999425eb6fb38cc308002dbc49a628c.jpg\" style=\"width: 461px; height: 600px;\" /></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Leather handbag with shoulder strap, designed and made by Moschino, 1996, Italy, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, Moschino took the most well-known symbols of fashion and turned them in their cheap - but chic - versions. Cheap and Chic was in fact the name of his second line, created in 1989. \"I copy and desecrated other designers, recount what happens by trying to understand the motivations of people” with these words, Moschino explained his approach to fashion, unveiling also his position towards the whole fashion system.</p>"

        title: 'Coco Chanel, Fashion''s ''Dame aux Camélias'''
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Many are the emblems characterising both the history and the current - or rather timeless - image of Chanel. The chain, the double c, the black&amp;white, the tweed: all of them are linked to either Coco Chanel’s own personality, or to the way who followed her decided to interpret the codes of the maison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/2048215-europeana-fashion-http-ceres-mcu-es-pages-main-idt-147038-inventary-ce101243-table-fmus-museum-mt.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 233px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Brooch with a white camellia on a black ribbon, Courtesy CER.ES: Red Digital De Colecciones De Museos De España, All Rights Reserved </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most widely known symbols of Chanel is the Camellia. It is also one of the most personal, inextricably linked to the life story of Coco Chanel and above all to her feelings. The camelia is the flower the heroin of Alexandre Dumas’ novel ‘La Dame aux Camélias’ wears, as a sign of her purity of heart. It is also said that Boy Capel, Chanel’s lover who tragically died in a car crash, gave her her first bouquet of camellias, fixing this flower - and its emotive meaning - into her memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coco Chanel, a designer known for her wit and severe attitude towards work, is remembered for her modernist approach. However, the camellia is the symbol of her most feminine and delicate side, which shows up even on the most straightened and neat designs, adding a layer to the messages inscribed in her creations. Camellias transforms according to the material they are made of - be it silk or diamonds, plastic or rhinestones and, since the 1920s, camellias have blossomed on a variety of Chanel’s creations: from dresses to accessories, and above all in the jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/2048232-europeana-fashion-61895865-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"width: 644px; height: 938px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Chanel by Karl Lagerfeld, autumn-winter 1984-1985 Fashion Show, Model Anna Bayle, Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 'legacy of the camellia’ goes on, and Karl Lagerfeld always takes that code into account, transporting it into the contemporary, using it as a strong visual link to the history of the maison and its founder.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/thumbnail-by-url.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Christian Lacroix, a/w 1992, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this picture, a model is wearing a Haute Couture creation by fashion designer Christian Lacroix during his A/W 1992-93 fashion show. The gown, of historical inspiration, resembles a <em>robe a la française. </em>The skirt - lightly leaning towards the back - is full and wide with side hoops, worn under a tight top with puffed sleeves that end with frills. From the shoulders, a train reaches the ground. The dress is made of brocade and taffeta silk in green and gold. On her head, the model is wearing a golden jewel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the end of the Eighties and through the Nineties, Christian Lacroix went against the zeitgeist, presenting his collections of rich and lavish gowns on the Parisian catwalks. A student of art history interested in costume design, he started his career in fashion on suggestion of his friend Jean Jacques Picard, who introduced him to the Maison Patou, thinking he would be perfect to revive the fashion house. His success at Patou brought him to win the Golden Thimble Award in 1986. He presented his first collection under his name in 1987. The collection drew inspiration from his beloved Provence, that throughout his career echoed in the details and amospheres of his collections.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: Photograph by Imre von Santho, 1936'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-07/1501454472_thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 445px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Frau in Kleid von Schulze-Bibermell', photograph by Imre von Santho, 1936. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen von Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This original print shows a woman wearing a dress designed by Schulze-Bibernell and photographed by Imre von Santho in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the black and white photograph, the model is wearing a floor-length, sleeveless evening dress with a fitted skirt. The dress is in sheer lam, gathered over the shoulder and the dress is worn by the model with a wide band on her left wrist and a chiffon scarf, that she is keeping in her left hand while bending over a short table with a mirroring surface to look at her reflection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The avant-gardist atmosphere of the picture is characteristic of the style of the Hungarian photographer, born in 1900. Before moving to Germany, Imre von Santho made his name working for Hungarian magazines, creating graphic designs and illustration too. During the time of the Weimar Republic, Berlin's fashion industry was thriving, and so was its publishing industry. Diverse fashion magazines were, in fact, published in the city offering many photographers to have their pictures featured in. Imre von Santho opened his studio in Berlin in 1929. He only returned to Budapest in 1945, where he eventually committed suicide.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>There is no set place where to start researching the history of fashion. Given its complexity and hybridity, fashion modem in between different areas, and this dynamism characterised its development since the very early stages of its systemisation. On the other hand, one way to research history, with all its flashbacks and flash-forwards, is in the pleats of fashion itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 631px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>David and Rina Davidoff after their betrothal, wearing traditional Bukharan festive attire, Courtesy The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costume history is loaded with examples of how the past leaves very material traces. Traditions are often represented, in the present, by clothes themselves, which become the fundamental props to reenact situations and commemorate important events. History comes into the contemporary also as techniques, learned from the past and applied to new and unexpected materials. The mesh between history and future is fascinating, because the tension in place between the two allows the space to represent history and also question it, as it happened with the revival of some controversial style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each era has its own peculiarities, and these peculiarities form a recognizable style. Creators from different epochs have drawn inspiration from the styles the felt most near to their sensibility, and therefore history became a basin from which to gather information. Quotations in fashion have also been a way to link it to art, trying to relocate fashion in between other disciplines, often justifying its pace and extravagances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048232-europeana-fashion-56988011-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"width: 524px; height: 763px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Photo from the Christian Lacroix 1989/1990 women's ready-to-wear fashion show, Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary fashion, and especially for big fashion houses, the archive is gaining invaluable importance.Many professionals gravitate around the archive: not only the archivist, but also the researcher, the designer, the manager of communication, the curator, the critic. The trajectories described by all these actors create a map with the archive as a core centre. Reviving the archive means researching and reflecting on what can be done to update tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these experiences will be described this month, dedicated to the past, but always with the eyesight turned to the future.</p>"

        title: 'Romantic Longing: Robe de Style'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The 'roaring Twenties' are generally described as a modern decade, being represented by the figure of the flapper, the cutting-edge girl wearing a straight, short dress and the bob haircut. However, in the same decade another fashion, with a more romantic appeal, became popular. In fact, during the 1920s and throughout the 1930s, women could indulge in looking back to the past centuries wearing their <em>robes de style</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Robe de style, Jeanne Lanvin, 1919. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Robes de style</em> were those dresses and gowns with a usually simple top, dropped waist and full wide skirts that required hoops and panniers; they were inspired by the costumes of the 18th or 17th century. They became popular amongst girls, who were too young to wear the daring flapper's look, and their mothers, as the cut and volumes of the gowns resulted in a more flattering fit than those of the linear flappers' dress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url-4-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 510px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Drawing by Muguette Buhler, 1924. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not being the inventor, Jeanne Lanvin championed the design of these dresses, debuting her first takes on the silhouette towards the end of the 1910s. A trained milliner, Lanvin moved to dressmaking as her clients asked her for the garments she made for her daughter, delicately embroidered and embellished <em>robes de style</em>. For this reason, her earlier creation for women also included a pendant version for younger girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url-3-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 445px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Dresses and hat by Jeanne Lanvin, \"Planche IV - Supplément du 'Style Parisien\" No. 7, le directeur-gérant Lucien Vogel\", February 1916. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeanne Lanvin was not however the only celebrated creator of <em>robes the style</em>. The House of Worth, Paul Poiret, Callot Soeurs and Boué Soeurs worked on these silhouettes too. Not only limited to the evening, there was a full range of <em>robes the style</em> that could be worn all through the day during different occasions. For their wide skirts, the main characteristic of these robes was the fabric implied in their creation and various decorations they featured. This was though also the reason for their decline. In fact, World War II and the shortages and restrictions of fabrics that came with it, led the tastes to a less dispendious look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>"

        title: 'YSL: The avant-gardism of revival'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The relationship fashion has with its past is quite complex. The past can either be a prison to flee away from or a jar where to find atmospheres, shapes, vibes. We are taught that, when past is the declared source of inspiration, we are talking about a ‘revival’. The dynamics of revival seem plain: revival means taking a period and rethinking it, reconsidering it with a different awareness, that of the present, and actually remaking its objects with the memory of the mould.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first ‘revival’ collection was actually thought for people who ‘did not have memories’, and was developed by one of the designers whose name is related with avant-garde: Yves Saint Laurent. In 1971, Yves Saint Laurent presented his ‘Liberation’ collection, also called ‘Forties’, for the evident reprise of themes and variations of the war years. The collection was defined ‘hideous’ by the press, because it was a ‘sad reminder’ of a period of restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048217-mude-m-0655.jpeg\" style=\"width: 686px; height: 1027px;\" />Pleated dress with mythological figures, Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>France felt betrayed by the elected heir of the grand couturiers. Saint Laurent himself compared the clash he provoked with the ‘scandal’ of Manet’s ‘Olympia’, finding himself both ‘sad’ and ‘delighted’ by the results of what he considered a rebellion to the static nature of Haute Couture. ‘L’important, c’est que les filles jeunes qui, elles, n’ont jamais connu cette mode, aient envie de la porter,’ he declared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe pushed both by the ‘revival craze’ fashion is experiencing in these days and the general lack of novelty in fashion, in 2015 the Fondation Yves Saint Laurent Pierre Bergé and curator Olivier Saillard decided to put on stage the infamous ‘Liberation’ collection. The set, designed by Nathalie Crinière briought the audience inside the laboratory of the couturier, with clothes, sketches, fabric choices and the whole line up of the eighty-pieces collection, printed human-scale on the walls, and then moves through the many pages of newspapers which strongly criticised the collection. The exhibition came in a moment when scandal was no longer a scandalous word. For Saint Laurent, revival meant provocation, a ‘historical exercise’, useful to convey a brand-new message.</p>"

Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the picture taken by photographer Etienne Tordoir, a model dressed in all-silver is going down the stairs of the Opera Garnier, where the Christian Dior couture spring/summer 1998 show was staged. The look was designed by John Galliano - then creative director of the Maison - and is composed by a multilayered dress with an asymmetric cut; it is made of two different ligh fabrics, both in silver, and an armour sleeve in metal. On her head, the model is wearing an headpiece resembling a metallic crown with long bejewelled chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Featuring a lavish succession of Art Noveau silhouttes in richly brocade and velvet fabrics, and sumptuous ornaments and trims, the collection of which this look is part of was inspired by the Marchesa Casati, the eccentric Italian heiress and patroness of the arts, who became an icon of the first half of Twentieth century. During the show, the stairs of the Opera Garnier welcomed models in overwhelming clothes that looked like they were coming to attend a masked ball. Drawing from the ecletic figure and wardrobe of the Marchesa, the collection featured 1920s inspired coats and dresses, but also wide 19th century gowns. The whole show - a real event - ended with a shower of pastel coloured confetti cut in the shape of butterflies.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: Sketch from the Collezione Palio by Emilio Pucci, 1957'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048205-sc00095.jpeg\" style=\"width: 577px; height: 817px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Sketch from the Collezione Palio by Emilio Pucci in 1957, Courtesy Pucci Archive.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows a sketch of a bathing suit from the Collezione Palio designed by Emilio Pucci in 1957, Courtesy Pucci Archive. The bathing suit is a one-piece in black and yellow fabric, one-shoulder, with a central design recalling the battlements of medieval castles. The battlement divides the yellow from the black part, creating an interesting geometric play on the curvaceous body of the model sketched wearing the swimsuit. The silhouette of the model is clearly inspired by the divas of the 1950, who were costumers and also friends of the Marchese Pucci. Together with the bathing suit, a matching headpiece in black fabric is also added to complete the look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957 The Marchese Emilio Pucci presented at Palazzo Pitti a collection inspired by the Palio di Siena. The collection drew inspiration from the colors of the flags and the heraldic motifs of the various contrade battling each year in the famous Palio di Siena: an history event taking place every year, and to which the Marchese assisted in 1955. The translation he made of this event into his fashion language was a synthesis of the atmosphere of the Palio with the ‘modern’ attitude to dress that was developing in western society. Emilio Pucci himself declared: It may seem strange that I have chosen such a remote theme for my work that is so modern. But I, a Florentine craftsman of today, feel very close to the artisans of the Three and Fourteenth Centuries and it is the medieval element of the Palio with its rich geometric and color motifs that fascinated me.</p>"

        title: 'Bill Gibb: Romantic Fantasy'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>In the late Sixties and throughout the Seventies, the youth movements brought a renewed interest in historicism, provoking a romantic exploration of the techniques and crafts of the past centuries. This influenced many aspects of creative expression, including fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url-2-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 494px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Full-length blue evening dress of crêpe, designed by Bill Gibb, 1972. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many designers who took part to this revival craze of romantic historicism, was Bill Gibb. Coming from a village in Scotland, Gibb attended the fashion course at the Central Saint Martin's School of Art in London on suggestion of his school teachers, and later won a scholarship to the Roayl College of Art, to which he enrolled and then left before completing his degree to start his own business. In 1967 he was on of six designers invited to New York to present their collections, and on this occasion he spent three months touring the USA, after which he returned to London to open his first boutique, the 'Angela Paul'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ensemble designed by Bill Gibb, ca. 1970. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the boutique, which he run with three firends through 1969, he designed clothes that reflected the spirit and the style of 1960s London. However, it was during the Seventies -he started his own line in 1972 - that he embraced the fantasy style for which he became mostly known. Beside taking inspiration from the world of nature and animals, his creations that looked at past handcrafts and techniques, combined  in historically inspired gowns and dresses, made him one of the best representat of 'romantic eclecticism,' a style that was popular at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/1502800522_thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 500px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Suit consisting of printed glazed cotton skirt and jacket, possibly designed by Bill Gibb for Baccarat, 1971.

He kept designing until the mid-1980s; he presented his last collection in 1985, one year before his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;\"><o:p></o:p></span></p>"

The waistcoat and the tailcoat present a heavy golden embroidery on the front, representing some floral motifs that go around the edges of both items. The outfit is part of Vivienne Westwood S/S 1991 collection, which was presented during Pitti Uomo 38 in Florence in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English designer Vivienne Westwood always looked at the past and, more precisely, at past traditions and cultural and artistic artifacts, in order to ground her collections into a well-thought scenario. The collection this outfit belongs to was called ‘Cut and Slash:’ it featured different fabrics, such as satin, cotton and denim, all of them slashed and mixed together. The inspiration for the collection was the mania, which emerged in the sixteenth century but lasted at least two centuries, for cutting and pricking fabrics. This collection followed the A/W 1990-91, which was called ‘Portrait’ and was inspired by oil paintings, proposing outfits that could literally to come out of historical paintings.</p>"

        title: 'Exhibition Archaeology: NEO at Centraal Museum'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Each time artists and designer feature, in their practice, elements of existing styles of the past, be it distant or more vivid, it is possible to talk about 'Neo.' Neo, in this sense, is a reinterpretation of the past, re-read with the eyes of the contemporary. In 2003, the continuing re-use of past styles in art, fashion, music and design inspired some reflections that led into the exhibition 'NEO', showcased at the Central Museum in Utrecht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048209-t200340.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 405px;\" />Neo, view of the exhibition, Courtesy Centraal Museum, All Rigths Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition NEO was displayed the Central Museum from the 27th of September 2003 to the 1st of April 2004. The exhibition showcased examples of what were considered the ‘new styles’ in the last 250 years. After the excavation of Pompeii and Herculaneum in the eighteenth century, in all aspects of culture, from visual arts to design, pop culture and music, it is possible to retrace the references in the reuse of classical style elements. In an ever faster way, artists, architects and designers used style features from Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo and Exotic cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NEO articulated the meaning of the notion \"neo\" in the broadest sense. Curator Frans Haks, then the director of the Groninger Museum, showed that neo consisted not only of the \"famous” neo-styles such as neoclassicism or neogotics; nature can also function as a neo subject, just as exoticism can be a neo style. NEO not only included neo-styles in visual arts or crafts, but also in architecture and film. In the nine rooms that composed the exhibition path, aspects of various neo-styles were thoroughly explored. The exhibition represented a journey amongst the most varied facets of the neo-culture from 1750 to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/t200340-d-013.jpg.630x378-q50-upscale.jpg\" style=\"width: 561px; height: 378px;\" />Neo, view of the exhibition, courtesy Centraal Museum, All Rigths Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo means something new, but neo stands also for the imitation of existing styles. The exhibition presented many famous artworks made by copying, enlarging, reducing and perfecting. In 1769, English ceramist Josiah Wedgwood saw a gap in the market and asked for a patent on 'encaustic collection', a method of perfect imitating red-headed Etruscan vases. He also developed 'biscuit' as a light and cheap substitute for marble, and 'basalt ware' for bronze. This led to a wide range of imitations of precious originals in cheap contemporary materials. And that happens until today. A good example of this is what Italian designer Alessandro Mendini did in 1978, when he developed some chairs looking at existing models of world-famous designers such as Gerrit Rietveld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another section focussed on the way Neo is also about giving new features to existing designs. For example, an image of the Italian artist Canova can be transformed into a flower basket and a Greek column will form a knife handle. A highlight of the exhibition was the room in which a large number of table pieces were presented in different 'neostiles' like classical and rococo. It was shown how neostijes penetrated into the royal food culture at home and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo also had a connection with nature. Since the eighteenth century, the exact imitation of fruits, plants and animals in porcelain, glass, ivory, textile and metal became all the rage. Nature inspired lush decorations, such as in the glassware of Gallé and Lalique, embellished with exuberant plant and animal motifs. The fact that nature continues to attract modern artists was represented, in the exhibition, by Andy Warhol's series of silk prints entitled 'Flowers' in 1970.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>In fashion, Eighteenth century has never stopped to inspire. The overwhelming decorations, extreme volumes and the push for lavishness that are at first glimpse often associated with it keep recurring on catwalks and as inspiration for editorials in magazines as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, Raf Simons went back to that precise moment in history, when he designed a narrow-fit pink jacket with contour decorations for Christian Dior a/w 2014-15 couture collection, as Jean Paul Gaultier did twenty years before for his menswear line for s/s 1994. For John Galliano it has been a deep pool for inspiration, from where he has drawn many times and for the many lines he directs and directed, including Givenchy, Maison Margiela and Christian Dior, whose founder also was also fond of that exuberant century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/eeee.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Chanel haute couture show, a/w 1990, photo by Etienne Tordoir.

In the exhibition the curator argued, in fact, that the atmosphere for lust and excess that was expressed in the costumes and styles of the century never stopped to influence and inspire fashion in the following ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/1503529076_thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 599px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Ensemble designed by Vivienne Westwood, 1981. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside the Costume Institute own collection’s of Eighteenth century clothes, in the exhibition the curator decided to include pieces from the Nineteenth and Twentieth century as well, to show the correspondences between each dress, illuminating how the ceaseless century was evoked and took form in its aftermath. The exhibition featured designs by Worth, Drécoll, Cristobal Balenciaga, Christian Lacroix, Karl Lagerfeld, Gianni Versace, Vivienne Westwood, all mounted up to show the continuity of a century whose grandiosity still holds its fascination over fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/thumbnail-by-url-1ss-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Evening dress designed by John Galliano for Givenchy, 1996. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, it is clear how the Eighteenth century is still a period in time where designers can refresh the sometimes-weary zeitgeist with a magnificent and sometime impossible feeling for excess and lavishness that still has no comparisons. In this sense, those who glance back at this moment in history are not made drowsy and kept from moving on; instead, as Richard Martin pointed out, the 'ceaseless century' never ceases to infuse a renewed exuberance on those who dare to look back and linger on its memory.</p>"

On the parka is depicted the iconic album cover designed by Peter Saville for the English band 'New Order'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The light brown hooded parka is made of cotton canvas, with a funnel neck, clasp button, zip and two pockets. On the back is sewn a hand-painted patch with the cover of the album 'Power Corruption and Lies' designed by Peter Seville. On the lower back is reported in black letters the title of a song by the New Order, 'Touched by the hands of God'. The trousers are black, wide flared and with asymmetric details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prints and patch featured in Raf Simons' 'Closer' collection are all drawn from Peter Saville's personal archive, to which the fashion designer was granted full access. Peter Saville's work as a graphic designer and art director includes the collaboration with many fashion designers, of the likes Yohji Yamamoto, John Galliano and Jil Sander, but he started as the graphic designer for album sleeves for Factory Records. There, not only he designed the album covers for the New Order, but also for other bands like OMD and Joy Division, including the one for the infamous 'Unknown Pleasure'. Raf Simons drew from these artworks to design his collection, reflecting the same aesthetics of the covers in his clothes, therefore including in his own narrative elements from Bauhaus, Russian Constructivism and British underground movements.</p>"

        title: 'The History of Symbols: Flares'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Many styles that are now seen on the streets come from unexpected places. Not all designs, in fact, are born exclusively in ateliers and design studios; the biographies of many of the most iconic objects tell us something about the fascinating ways in which styles are created and also disseminated. 'Flares' trousers, for example, have become a symbol of 1960s-70s fashion, even if the story of their origins is quite different from the atmosphere of those years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048216-localid-europeana-fashion-su07133.jpeg\" style=\"width: 1025px; height: 1151px;\" /><em><strong>The Guardian: The History of Flares - in pictures - Screenshot Courtesy of Stockholm University, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also called bell-bottom because of their shape, flares originated in the early 19th century, when some sailors serving in the US Navy started wearing these kind of trousers, since no uniform was set for them yet. The style was later adopted by the British Royal Navy, which adopted the flares as part of the official uniform around the mid-19th century. Actually, these \"bell-bottoms\" were often wide-legged trousers that could be rolled up easily and were therefore functional for sailors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048216-localid-europeana-fashion-su07134.jpeg\" style=\"width: 1023px; height: 672px;\" />Sonny Bono and Cher wearing flares. The Guardian: The History of Flares - in pictures - Screenshot Courtesy of Stockholm University, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decades that saw the passage from the functional uniform of sailors to mainstream fashion were the 1960s and, above all, the 1970s. In the 1960s, they were usually worn with Cuban-heeled shoes, clogs, or Chelsea boots. In the 1970s, Sonny Bono and Cher made flares iconic by wearing them on air, during their television show. The pants flared from the knee down, and many variants were developed: 'Loon pants' were even more flared, usually worn by go-go dancers; another kind were the so-called 'Elephant bells', which were similar to loon pants but longer, covering the high-heeled shoes popular in the 1970s, and made of denim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/2048216-localid-europeana-fashion-su07144.jpeg\" style=\"width: 1084px; height: 556px;\" />The Guardian: The History of Flares - in pictures - Screenshot Courtesy of Stockholm University, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flares made their comeback in the second half of the 1990s with a new name: boot-cut, since the flare was not so wide. Now pants with very wide flares are back in fashion, enriched by ruffles and other embellishments; not only can they be found on the runways of famous fashion designers, drawing the audience back to the references that inspired the designs, but also in the collections of major high street brands: a sign of the popularity of this style at various levels of the producer and consumer chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to see how the narrative surrounding flares has developed through the media. The images illustrating this article were collected by Stockholm University as part of their collaboration with Europeana Fashion to preserve digital heritage. They are screenshot from an article published in 2015 by The Guardian, visually retracing with archival images the history not only of the object itself, but of the style that it came to be the symbol of.</p>"

        title: 'Referencing Classicism in Fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Although its most famous expression is the Empire style that became popular in French fashion after the Revolution, the references to Classicism recurred in fashion in many forms and periods throughout Western history. Since the Renaissance, men started to look back at the Classical period as a depository of knowledge and taste to rediscover; Classicism and its motifs become popular not only in the arts, but also in dress and textiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/1504171910_thumbnail-by-url.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 497px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Evening dress and belt of embroidered tulle, designed by Jean Patou, 1932-1934. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Classical fashion and costume refer in particular to two kinds of ancient Greek attires, the <em>chiton</em> and the <i>peplum</i>. The first, for both sexes, and the second for women, were tunics worn and folded over the body. While the <em>chiton</em> was sewn and fixed on the body trough pins - <em>fibulae</em> - or buttons, the second consisted of an orthogonal piece of fabric draped on the body and held by a belt. The ancient statuary and the Greek antiquities conserved in museums and private collections became the main source for inspiration for Classicism in fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/1504172597_thumbnail-by-url-3-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Evening dress designed by Grès, 1946. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in fact due to the renewed interest this period when the Neoclassical movement invested all humanistic disciplines in the Eighteenth century that costumes inspired by the <em>chiton</em> and <em>peplum </em>became popular in women's fashion. In particular, this happened in France in the period between the 1790s and 1810s. The rich and voluminous mantua worn before the French Revolution were abandoned, and women started to adopt light mousseline gowns in white and other delicate, bright colours cut in with the so called Empire line, which consisted in a fitted bodice with the waist placed high up to bust and linear, pleated skirts. It is said that, to make the dress cling to the body just like those on the statues, women even used to wear them wet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-08/1504172047_thumbnail-by-url-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Chloé fashion show, s/s 1994, photo by Paul van Riel. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, although classical motifs were recurrent as ornaments, dresses inspired by classicism came back in fashion only one century later, after women got freed from their corsets. Then, the soft volumes and straight lines got adopted by modernists, as it is in the most popular case with the Delphos dress of Mariano Fortuny, but also with the linear silhouettes of the 1920s or later, where the reference can be found in the sculptural creations of Madame Grès. As pointed out by curator Harold Koda, the Classical continues to inspire designer as a testimony of the universal ambition of transforming women into goddesses through dress.</p>"

Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the picture, model Mariacarla Boscono is wearing a motorcycle ensemble in red. The ensemble was designed by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel s/s 2002 ready to wear collection. It consisted of a sporty leather jacket with metal zips and buttons and low-waisted trousers in the same material worn with a silver belt. Under the jacket the model is wearing a white shirt, and, at her feet, matching sneakers. On her hands, with nails painted with matching red nail polish, she holds a helmet bearing in the frond the interlocking 'Cs' and on her neck, Boscono wears another symbol of the Maison, the pearl necklace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the opening look of a collection that was all abaout speed. Although other looks consisted in landamrk pieces more common to the Maison aesthetic and tradition, the obsession with speed and the sporty looks and details of riding has been a source of inspiration for the collection. Since the German designer landed on the brand as artistic director in 1983, he infused new life in the Parisian brand, bringing a youthful wave that was expressed through his sometimes irriverent exploration of contemporary obsessions and crazes. </p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>All fashion objects tell a story, and these stories can shed light on other issues, informing our understanding of the past. This September, we decided to start for the material hold in our archive and recover the stories of the people and communities behind the ideation, production, success or failure of those objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048222-1527.jpeg\" style=\"width: 382px; height: 573px;\"></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Flower Basket' sandals by designer Andre Perugia, Courtesy Shoes or No Shoes, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion speaks to the public about people, habits, styles, and history through a material and visual language. It has, over the centuries, been an extraordinary viewpoint on contemporary society, offering a rich platform of reflection on key issues, ranging from practices of production and consumption to the establishment of hierarchies and roles, and the construction of identities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, fashion is the result of a reflection, it is a design discipline that entails a process of thinking and making, and therefore is an exquisitely human activity. And also, a shared activity, to which contribute not only designers, but technicians, manufacturers, photographers, models and image-makers: this month we will try to recover the names of those actors who have shaped the history of fashion but are now almost forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048213-item-o153492.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 600px;\"></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Henry' ensemble by Gina Fratini, 1973-75, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion is an important part of our common cultural heritage. It permeates different spheres of our life, from economics to psychology, society and culture. It relates to the individual as well as to the society. Thanks to the objects hold in archives, and to the stories encapsulated in their materiality, we are able to reconstruct the biographies of these people, and give them the attention they deserve. This is how the archive becomes alive: it gets reactivated transforming a material memory into a story that can recovered, preserved and disseminated to the broad audience of the present.</p>"

        title: 'Flowing London Style Master: Gina Fratini'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Gina Fratini was a British fashion designer whose naively elegant style was very popular during the sixties and seventies in London. Born Georgina Caroline Somerset Butler in Japan, she was raised between the Middle East and India, but chose England as her basis, and soon became on of the ‘hot names of the British fashion scene’. Her interest in design took her to study at the prestigious Royal College of Arts, then she travelled with Katherine Dunham’s dance as costume designer, she came back to London and set up her eponymous fashion house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048213-item-o138382.jpeg\"><br>\r\nVelvet smock dress designed by Gina Fratini, London, 1972, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gina Fratini made of flowing, multi-layered, soft dresses with delicate prints her signature. All her inspiration came from the material she had in her hands, as she could nearly feel the potential of that fabric and enhance it with apparently simple dresses cut to enhance the intrinsic characteristics of the material she was dealing with. She had been capable of seizing the zeitgeist of her time, feeling the shift of taste from the close fitting, short designs of the 1960s to a more relaxed and retro look, which will become the image of 1970s ‘Britishness’, epitomised by iconic ‘hippy’ designers as Zandra Rhodes and Barbara Hulaniki. “I think I was the first to believe that amusing fabric is more important than close fit. I like soft fabric, but only natural ones like pure silk or pure cotton. I cut everything in bias and just let it fall into the person. I like movement. There’s nothing more fascinating than a woman flowing instead of walking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048213-item-o153492.jpeg\"><br>\r\n'Henry' ensemble by Gina Fratini, 1973-75, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fit was the issue of an argument with one of her famous clients, Princess Margaret. ‘She insists on a fitted bodice. That really goes against my grain, so we compromise on the issue.’ The list of personalities who dressed in Fratini’s creations is long and filled with ranting names, such as Princess Anne, Ursula Andress, Raquel Welch, for whom Fratini not only provided everyday clothes, but was also requested by the actress herself as her personal costume designer for the movie ‘Bedazzled’.<br>\r\nPrincess Diana continued to be faithful to Fratini’s designs even after the shut down of her fashion house in the 80s; and even Elizabeth Taylor, known for her preference for flowing, flouncy gowns and caftans, chose Gina Fratini to design the dress in which she married Richard Burton for the second time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I believe Elegantes want to dress up even if they are headed for the kitchen. A firm fashion attitude makes living palatable.’ Gina Fratini firmly believed elegance had to be a way of life: an attitude coming out naturally every moment of every day, and not a superficial apposition to put on and off when the occasion requested.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048217-mude-m-0338.jpeg\">Metal coat designed by Paco Rabanne, 1966 ca.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coat belongs to one of the first collections designed by Paco Rabanne for his own label. It is made of metallic plaques crafted from thin sheets of Rhodoid, linked together resembling a futuristic armor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francisco 'Paco' Rabaneda Cuervo is a Spanish fashion designer of Basque origin who became known during the 1960s for his futuristic design and use of unconventional materials, such as synthetic fabrics, paper and metal plaques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabanne started his career in fashion by creating jewelry for Givenchy, Dior, and Balenciaga. He founded his own fashion house in 1966. His first collection was presented in Paris and later in New York at Lord &amp; Taylor’s Fantasia boutique. The collection of dresses was very well received overseas: Vogue US called it a 'sensational collection of modern clothes;' WWD declared that New Yorkers were 'bowled over by his outerspace dresses.’ His dresses were appreciated because they were short and bold, and they 'made noise,’ given the materials used to produce them. His fashion designs have been termed as ‘Metal Couture,’ something Rabanne also brought to the big screen, designing the costumes for Vadim’s science-fiction film Barbarella.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Tales of Italian Style: Biki'
        introduction: 'Elvira Leonardi Broyure, or Biki, as she was personally and professionally known, has always preferred to be considered a tailor, and not a designer.'
        body: "<p>Elvira Leonardi Broyure, or Biki, as she was personally and professionally known, has always preferred to be considered a tailor, and not a designer. Growing up in a culturally ebullient environment – Giacomo Puccini was her grandmother’s husband, the one who gave her the nickname ‘Bicchi’ – she decided to get into fashion because of her ‘natural taste’ and the rather stubborn inclination to shape what was around her through her vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048224-00000488.jpeg\">Cocktail Ensemble by Biki, 1950s, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n‘I just want to dress beautiful women’. Biki opened her first atelier in Milan in 1934, together with fellow aristocrat Gina Cicogna. Her designs were of French inspiration, but recognisable in the combination of bold colours and unusual fabrics. She has been, in fact, one of the forerunners of the use of artificial fabrics for both daywear and evening gowns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selective and adamant in all her choices, both in design and in the choice of her clients, what drove Biki’s practice was surely her strong personality – it was probably her who pushed Maria Callas to lose weight, telling her that it was the only way she could be dressed in her creations. After her first boutiques opened between Milan, Sankt Moritz and Portofino, she went on expanding her label and arrived to produce almost everything, from lingerie to suits, from gowns to accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048224-00001481.jpeg\">Dress by Biki, 1955, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her designs undoubtedly belong to Italian Alta Moda; nevertheless, she paved the way to the development of prét-a-porter, collaborating with, for example, GFT Gruppo Finanziario Tessile, for whom she signed a line called ‘Cori-Biki’ in the late Sixties. Biki’s style was typically Italian, linked to a well defined world: that of the Milanese ‘vita’, gathered around the theatre La Scala and the posh Via Montenapoleone. Still, she managed to cross the boundaries of the country, thanks to the actresses and personalities who proudly wore Biki style, made of tailored suits in audacious combinations and, above all, accessories, like her infamous turbans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048224-00000489.jpeg\">Cocktail Dress by Biki, 1950s, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her role in history of fashion is surely that of a pioneer: actually, more as a businesswoman than a tailor. Her figure stands out as one of the first examples of emancipated women who showed, in unsuspected times, a capacity to run a huge business while being a creative and a woman.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The picture by photographer Carlo Cantini, captures two looks designed by the Italian duo Calugi e Giannelli for their a/w 1987-88 collection, that was presented in Florence during Pitti Uomo 31.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/thumbnail-by-url%20(8).jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Calugi e Giannelli a/w 1987-88 fashion show at Pitti Uomo 31, photo by Carlo Cantini. Courtesy Pitti Immagine, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the picture, a model in the foreground is walking, his\_right hand in the pocket, wearing a printed sweatshirt, trousers and a pointed beanie hat. In the background, another model seems to be performing, walking in the cold streets of a city landscape, wearing a sweatshirt printed with legs over letters and words. The attitude of the models transpires that of the Italian menswear design duo:\_ironic, strong and decisive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brand Calugi e Giannelli was founded in Florence by Mauro Calugi e Danilo Giannelli in 1982. As Richard Martin, fashion historian and curator, said, ‘Calugi e Giannelli has invented and reinvented clothing—menswear in particular—as if it were conceptual art’. Their take on menswear has been subversive, introducing element of sportswear as well of clerical dress in their collections, using fabric and body to explore new masculinities. Art has been a leit-motif, although they used clothes as a playground where to gather and experiment with the most various inspirations, from Pop Art, Mark Rothko and Piet Mondriaan, as well as tattoos and ecclesiastical hats. Although artistic in their conception, they were distant from art and crafts in their design, favouring a research in textile technology to update. While Danilo Giannelli unfortunately died in 1987, Mauro Calugi directed the brand and continued to design with the same spirit that characterised the duo, imbuing Italian menswear with an avant-gardist take that made the brand a quite unique voice in its landscape.\_ \_</p>\r\n"

The hooded jacket is long to the waist and its fit is tight. It is quilted and with a central button flap. The full, wide skirt is worn\_over a crinoline. Its hem is folded and sustained by threads that pass through reinforced holes place on the hem at regular distance. A thread gathering at the waist of the model to lift up the skirt, showing laced pumps worn at the model’s feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion designer Olivier Theyskens, who is going to be the subject of a major retrospective that inaugurates at MoMu – Fashion Museum of Antwerp on the 12th October 2017, first gained international recognition in 1998 when pop star Madonna wore one of his design – a long gown in yellow silk satin - for the Academy Awards. Theyskens, who attended the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Visuels de la Cambre, had dropped out only one year earlier to establish his own label, whose first collection, that featured a gloomy take on the 18th century French costume, was shown in 1998 in Paris. Since then, the designer has given his imprint on different lines, from his own brand Olivier Theyskens and Theyskens Theory to the haute couture line of Rochas, and Nina Ricci. His universe will be shown at MoMu not only through his designs, but also through the pictures, film and drawings that document the complexity of his visual world.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Parsons Paris and Europeana Fashion: Fashioning Europe Project'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>As aggregator of digital content from the major public institutions and private archives in Europe, the Europeana Fashion portal holds different kinds of digital items. From historical clothing and accessories to fashion plates, from contemporary fashion items to catwalk pictures, from editorials to corporate advertising campaigns, the items in the archive cross different chronologies and geographies, commenting on the very meaning of European cultural heritage. The variety of the collection has the potential to challenge stereotypes and fight preconceptions, allowing space for the creation of new concepts and definitions: this is the reason why we chose Europe as theme for this October.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/46568a90f79884291d032ab52c520283.jpg\"><br><strong>Jacket made with painted textile from India, Courtesy MoMU - ModeMuseum Antwerp, All Rights Reserved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reflection upon the idea of Europe portrayed by the Europeana Fashion archive started some months ago, fostered by the recent political events and by the need to question the very construction and utility of our digital archive. These motivations led to an interesting conversation and, \_in May, we teamed up with The New School Parsons Paris and asked the students of the course ‘Curating Fashion: History, Theory &amp; Practice’ to dive into the Europeana collection to develop curatorial projects themed around the many definitions of Europe the archive allows. As a result of this collaboration, this October the Europeana Fashion Tumblr will host the outputs of this collaboration in the form of ‘capsule curations’ developed especially for Europeana by the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main aim of the curatorial project, called Fashioning Europe, was to use the objects held in the Europeana Fashion archive to construct a narrative that informs a more nuanced definition of Europe, using fashion as privileged point of view to enter a wider debate on community, boundaries and belonging. The project wanted students to familiarise with a digital fashion archive such Europeana Fashion, reflecting on the issues linked to its dimension and nature of contents; it also wants to present the digital/Tumblr exhibition as space where to consider on the material and immaterial aspects of curatorial practices.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/2048202_DE_MUS_018313_874227.jpeg\"><strong>Caricature by George T.

The exhibitions are three: Les Objets Etrangers that focuses on the meaning, within European collections, of objects coming from different ‘elsewheres’; Europe vs Europe that explores the ways in which national identities were depicted on satirical prints; and Silent Resistance, an historical account of the material culture linked to World War II.\_<br><br>\r\nThe main goal was to shape a definition of Europe, exploiting the potential of the plurality of the materials encountered in their research by students. \_Each curation will be showcased on our Tumblr, preceded by a rationale published on our blog, where the members of each group will articulate their curatorial idea in words and explain their process and the reflection behind their choices.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the curations took into account issues of provenance, in terms of both time and place, and ownership, in terms of both production and consumption. Students successfully drew historical trajectories and links between different images in order to instigate one or more specific reflections on the problematic themes of stereotypes, the relationship between the domestic and the foreign, and national, trans- and international identities.

        title: 'Tumblr Exhibition: Les Objets Etrangers'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Les Objets Etrangers, literally ‘the foreign objects,’ addresses the presence of objects from other countries/cultures in European museums. These museums, established as institutions for preserving and exhibiting European culture as well as for educating the public, are also places where non-European cultural heritage is conserved and interpreted. Europe has historically and uniquely been fertile ground for absorbing and adapting foreign cultures, and this richness is particularly evidennt\_in the field of fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/objects.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Les Objets Etrangers highlights these transcultural dialogues and the connections between these non-European objects and the museums in which they are conserved. The exhibition shows the varied ways in which European museums present these ‘foreign objects’ to their audiences, and ends with a presentation of the reverse - objects originating in Europe displayed in a non-European museum. By tracing histories of provenance and presentation, we examine the different types of museums in which these objects are collected and displayed, and also the multiple museological spaces in which fashion can be hosted, and consequently defined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this exhibition we selected six pairs of objects originating in non-European cultures that are now located in the collections of six European museums and, as our final pair, use the same device to present an example of the reverso condition: two European objects conserved and presented in a non-European museum. We selected pairs with similar geographic and chronological origins for each museum, but in all cases, it is their foreignness - their ‘otherness’ - that links them. We present a variety of museum types and a multiplicity of cultures that can be found in these museums’ collections of foreign objects as well as considering presumptions made regarding the origins of these objects, what the object represents to its originating culture, to the audience, many of them were originally collected as cultural / ethnographic objects, not as fashion. In most cases these objects were not made for a western market or to satisfy western taste. They have all been, to some extent, ‘re-contextualized’ - the hand-painted Indian fabrics and the Saudi embroidery can be studied as examples of motif and craft that is re-interpreted in historical and contemporary apparel; the kimono, burnous and shawl are both historic costume and ethnic fashion; all are also available as inspiration for contemporary design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition is organized chronologically - we begin in the 18th century and end in the 1980s. We begin and end with hand-painted fabrics (India to Matisse), and in between touch on the Far East, the Near East, and the Americas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit the exhibition at: http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nText &amp; Concept by Julie Mahdavi,\_Anqi Ni,\_Melany Telleen from The New School - Parsons Paris</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Tumblr Exhibition: Europe vs Europe'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Europe vs. Europe is an exhibition highlighting how European identity is discussed and fragmented through visual culture dating back to the 18th century. Covering a variety of mediums, from fashion illustrations to advertisements, these visuals can be drawn together by their mocking tone and sartorial indicators.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/2048202_DE_MUS_018313_879654.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>A Russian Dandy</em>, caricature by William Heath and Samuel William Fores, 1818, Courtesy\_Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen Zu Berlin, CC BY-NC-SA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the images clothing goes from signifying distinctive nationalities to blurring the images of opposing nations into one. A conflict becomes apparent that while fashion is ripe with a potential for mockery it is nonetheless upheld as a desirable signifier of identities in close proximities, sometimes only distinguishable from each other by the individuals themselves. These visuals reveal a struggle for identity that exists not only between nations, such as England versus France, but also as internal divisions within individual nations. Fashion as an elite inception forms the basis of sartorial signifiers that demonstrate tensions concerning class, status and cosmopolitanism.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection we have chosen to display is only a glimpse of this architecture, an architecture that is still being built today. To contextualize each piece we have traced its provenance considering its dissemination historically and within archives today. Since our efforts remain a simple flirtation with the wealth of images and discourses accessible, we’ve decided to suggest a searchable tag with each image. This will allow the visitors to extend their exploration into the archive and find out for themselves – how did Europe fashion itself?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aims of the exhibition are: to observe the mediation of European identities in the past; to consider the referential nature of European fashion despite its claim to be individualized; to introduce people to the ways in which they could discover more about this discourse in the archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit the exhibition at: http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text and concept by Tala AlGhamdi, Yasmine Sebti, Kirsten Wang, Chanel Host</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Tumblr Exhibition: Silent Resistance'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/post/166615096921/silent-resistance\">The exhibition</a>\_explores the ways in which fashion was used, during WWII, as a tool to resist oppression in occupied countries and as a mean\_to create a shared identity between subjugated communities. Unlike rebellion and activism, the acts of silent resistance\_the countries engaged in World War II were peaceful in nature and expressed the disapproval with the Nazi regime and its values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/da2b444e799eef4dc32ee7997a338a7e.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scherl, Frauen in Jacken und Mänteln von Schüler, (1941), Courtesy\_Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From refusing to enforcing\_the dress code for Jewish folk in their country as a moral reproval of their persecution, to secretly going to Jazz clubs clad in Swing dresses despite their prohibition, many people expressed their disapproval of the third Reich through small acts of defiance. This exhibition makes use\_of different media (sketches, documentary images, garments) coming from six different European countries to explore different forms of what we define as a ‘silent resistance’ in order to show how clothing and vestimentary practices played a crucial part in resisting the Nazi political ideology. The exhibition shows how garments become vessels used by different groups of people in different spheres of living, to exercise economic, political and cultural opposition, to the Nazi occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing on 'Fashion under Occupation' by Dominique Veillon (2002) and 'Fashion under Fascism. beyond the Black Shirt' by Eugenia Paulicelli (2004), this digital exhibition seeks to ask how sartorial habits and decisions can become a silent way to oppose a regime like the Nazist Regime, that sought to implement a way of thought and a political agenda.\_<br>\r\nEach selected object shows how different types of clothing foster the image of fashion as a form of resistance, creating an important offspring in the occupied countries. Thus, the criteria of selection contribute to show the different forms of resistance that Europe exercised during the occupation through vestimentary practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-10/B87_0765.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Yellow badge, 1940s, from The Ortenau Family Collection, Courtesy\_The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, All Rights Reserved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We chose to focus on the period of the WWII to highlight the importance of the fashion on the example of the resistance movement in the critical momenutms in the history of Europe. Europeana Fashion wants to highlight a European project around fashion. We\_looked at the creation of Europe while wondering how fashion, dressing participated in European unification. We chose the key period of the WWII due to the fact that the resistance movement allowed European communities advocating resistance to be independent. Thus, the example of the resistance movements in fashion served as the direct examples of democracy in politics and fashion. Since ancient times, fashion has served as a mean of resistance. This project relives the idea of fashion in revolt and shows how fashion adhered to the resistance. In particular, the garment serves as an implicit message of an ideology of resistance community, which wore clothes and implied the resistance ideology through their outfits. It therefore allows the resistance groups to recognize each other in order to unite in the name of the resistance and seeming freedom from the Nazi regime through the garment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During WWII, Europe was propagated by the Nazi order, which led to the establishment of a resistance on a European scale. As a proof to the resistance movement, a Manifesto of the European Resistance was adopted in Geneva on May 20, 1944, wishing for the creation of a federal union among the peoples allowing the construction of a democratic Europe. This Manifesto compares the union of Europe with the process of forming a state. The European federation became a pillar of world peace. Resistance during the WWII showed a possibility of a common alliance and the aid between the member countries. The European idea was born out of resistance to the Nazis. Thus, this historical momentum contributes to the establishment of the European identity as we know it today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text by\_Camila Abisambra,\_Adriano Appelius,\_Beatrise Gutmane</p>\r\n"

There is an opening under the sleeve inset, which allows the wearer to easily glide the arms in or out. Kimono are traditional for both men and women, and are always worn with the left side over the right, secured by an obi (sash). Both garments selected are silk, one richly embroidered with golden thread. Kimono have always been a symbol of nationhood and a projection of Japan’s self-image. During the mid-1800s, Japan itself was complicit in encouraging tacit Orientalism by making the kimono a symbol of the unified national identity it created after opening its borders to the West in 1853.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These kimono are conserved in the Tropenmuseum (Amsterdam Tropical Museum), an ethnographic museum, one of the members of Stichting nationaal Museum Van Wereldculturen (Dutch Museum of World Cultures) in Amsterdam. The conservation of Japanese kimonos not only shows how fashion is considered an essential part of everyday life, but also indicates how European ethnographic museums document non-european cultures in order to tell the story of humankind.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text by\_Julie Mahdavi,\_Anqi Ni,\_Melany Telleen</p>\r\n"

The colors here could be interpreted as the only signifiers of the nations within nations, after the French Revolution the Russian invasion, French styles of the moment strived to be a statement about a new free France, even after Russia won the Battle of France. The lack of tension in this depiction implies a momentary ambivalence to looking for differences, but rather still finding ways to enforce segmentation – the reference of the Russian Mountain as a sudden barrier within the city, even if a barrier they find themselves enjoying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The viewers assumedly Russian and the participants light-hearted Parisians who enjoy the recuperation of all trends and in their own view, improve on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the previous images in our collection, we’ve seen how Europe takes to self-fragmenting in a way to create more individual identities for the nations, then for the regions within them – in this instance we can see how despite all their prejudices against one another, they are of each other. Europes within Europe, the Russians depicted with their fashions, here not only limited to clothes, brought a spectacle with them which eventually becomes an important and celebrated part of the culture. The spectacle of sartorial nuances, and of course, the Russian Mountains.</p>\r\n"

However, the designers in these couture houses argued they were helping the cause by producing such expensive and decadent outfits for Germany so they would indulge in overspending in fashion wasting their resources. It is important to note most of the more eccentric pieces were taken to Berlin and showcased there as shown in the second photograph which depicts German women attired in expensive furs. This showcases the tremendous influence Parisian couture had on the affluent Berlin. The sketch displays a proposed garment which is very voluminous, it uses a vast quantity of fabric and furthermore is made in lace. The expenses necessary to create such a garment would be prohibited in the allied countries but not in Berlin. As such, the creative power of couture kept functioning at full speed during the war in the name of creating extra expenses for the Nazis. (Veillon, Dominique. Fashion under the Occupation. Berg, 2002.)</p>\r\n"

On his head, a big hat made of a fish. The engraving is part of a series illustrating the ’right’ outfit for each profession with a grotesque and fantastical style, which anticipates\_the intuitions and experimentations of surrealist artists of twentieth century. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image is part of the Israel Museum collection, and precisely of the The Vera and Arturo Schwarz Collection of Dada and Surrealist Art. The Museum owes this rich collection to Art historian\_Arturo Schwarz, who in 1972 gifted thirteen replicas of readymades by Marcel Duchamp, and then in 1991 the Arturo Schwarz Dada and Surrealist Library, a collection of documents, periodicals, books, manuscripts, and letters. In 1998, on the occasion of Israel’s 50th anniversary year, Schwarz also donated his vast collection of Dada, Surrealist, and pre-Surrealist art, comprising more than 700 works.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The Editor''s Column: Masters and Students'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Fashion is a discipline that requires passion, ability, and focus. On a more practical level, what is central to fashion is a solid training. For designers, the learning experience of the apprenticeship is one of the most important moments for their professional life, shaping\_the way in which they they will then deal with their practice. This month is dedicated to how the infamous couples of masters and students populate the history of fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048218_UF_66_38_31.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Dress by Yves Saint Laurent, 1958, Courtesy\_Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>School sometimes is not just a physical and institutionalised place, especially considering the history of fashion training, which developed on different channels. All those spaces where designers have the possibility to see, learn and experience something about their work can be regarded as ‘schools of fashion’, whose definition is linked to the kind of work that is carried out and, above all, to the people who lives these spaces, and the relations these professionals entertain with one another.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stories of the relationship between students and their teachers are fascinating, and often offer glimpses into the approach these people had towards dress and design in general. They are also useful in understanding how, especially in the last century, fashion has come to be recognised as cultural and social force, whose relation to the present-tense is always fundamental to its value.\_<br>\r\nThis November, on the Europeana Fashion blog, we will deal with some of the most important cases of in fashion history. As usual, we will try to recall these experiences by looking at the objects these designers produced, in order to understand from their practice the kind of lessons they listened to, learned or - in some interesting cases - rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048215_europeana_fashion_http___ceres_mcu_es_pages_Main_idt_151214_inventary_CE103703_table_FMUS_museum_MT.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Cape by Ungaro, 1969, Courtesy\_CER.ES: Red Digital De Colecciones De Museos De España,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>looking at cases of this kind is surely compelling for both students of fashion and people passionate about biographies, above all because the professional relationships quite often move into personal ones; most times, the teacher becomes a mentor, whose influence remains present even when the apprenticeship comes to an end. All these experiences talk about the formation of a creative mind, but also about the personal growth of individuals, who learn about themselves through their practice, and reflecting on the world that surrounds them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this scenario, fashion becomes a territory where this growth happens, and where the very identity of designers - students, but also teachers - mutates, contributing to the creation of the personae we now regard as icons.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The picture taken by Paul van Riel shows a model on the runway of Emanuel Ungaro’s a/w 1989-90 fashion show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048232_europeana_fashion_56986684_jpg.jpeg\"><em><strong>Emanuel Ungaro’s a/w 1989-90 fashion show, photo by Paul van Riel. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The model is wearing a shirt and wrap skirt. The shirt, in a dark blue and white dots\_fabric, is puffy and wide. It is worn with the\_lower hem tucked into the wrap skirt, accentuating its volume. The wrap skirt, in a gleaming fabric, is pencil shaped, with ruffles appearing on the right from the back of the skirt.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The width and volume of the\_shirt may suggests that Emanuel Ungaro is still reminiscent of his master’s lesson. In 1958 the designer was assistant to Cristobal Balenciaga, whose sartorial sculptures are still a landmark of the golden age of couture. Ungaro opened his line in 1965, stating his refusal in creating evening dresses with the aim of dressing a modern wardrobe for contemporary women. His design where celebrated for the clashing mix of bold patterns in bright colours and for the ease of its volumes. After a successful career lasted over forty years, Ungaro retired from fashion only in 2005, when he sold his line.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The image shows a sandal designed by André Perugia, one of the most celebrated shoe designers of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048207_00704.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Sandal by André Perugia, 1952. Courtesy Rossimoda Shoe Museum, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sandal is made of light blue and white kid leather with beige stitches. The heel is in white, and the sole is black. The upper consists of tangle of stripes and opens on the heel with a buckle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>André Perugia was born in Nice in 1898. Son of an Italian shoemaker, he learned his trade from his father and showed his first creations in one of Nice most luxurious hotel, the ‘Negresco’. There his talent had the chance to be noticed by the rich guests who not only bought his first models, but introduced him to the world of French couture.\_André Perugia was welcomed into that world by Paul Poiret, with whom he collaborated. In 1921 Perugia opened his shop in Faubourg St. Honoré in Paris, and his new clients comprised actresses Pola Nigri and the diva Josephin Baker, as well as many Hollywood actresses. Beside Paul Poiret, he collaborated with many couturies, most notably Elsa Schiaparelli, who shared his enthusiasm for Surrealism. His career lasted over sixty years, until his retirement in 1965.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Christian Dior and Yves Saint Laurent: teaching and learning the ''essential'' of fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>In June 1955, a young student of the Ecole de la Chamber Syndicale de la Haute Couture stepped into the gilded doors of a couture house at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. There, the student met Monsieur Dior, then one of the masters of Haute Couture, who understood the incredible talent of this youngster, and decided to immediately hire him.\_This was the beginning of one of the most celebrated fashion collaborations, that between the master Christian Dior and young Yves Saint Laurent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048221_10918x1y158165.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sketch of an ensemble designed Yves Saint Laurent, author Constance Wibaut, Courtesy\_Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yves Saint Laurent worked alongside Monsieur Dior for two years. The collections produced by the couture house were extensive - made up of more than two hundred designs. Saint Laurent was exposed to all the moments of the creation of a collection, from the early sketches, to the toiles developed by the premieres and the fittings, the important moment when the couturier could work directly on the dress in its trip-dimensional form, moulding it to his desires and ideas.\_The first task Saint Laurent performed was that of decorator of the boutiques, which in itself is a great school: he had to think about the woman dior was willing to dress and create the right atmosphere \_for clients to feel in the right place.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saint Laurent soon went on to contribute directly to the design of the collections of the maison Dior, In 1957, Monsieur Dior said to Jacques Rouet:\_'Yves Saint Laurent is young, but he is an immense talent. In my last collection, I consider him to be the father of thirty-four out of the 180 designs. I think the time has come to reveal it to the press. My prestige won’t suffer from it.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048217_MUDE_M_0409.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cocktail Dress by Dior, 1956. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo, photo Luis Ferrera,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his side, Yves Saint Laurent declared that Christian Dior taught him ‘the essential’, what made other influences relevant and prolific. Reminiscence of his work at the maison Dior can be found in his subsequent collections, but maybe the strongest influence lays in the attitude to work that characterised Saint Laurent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premature death of Monsieur Dior made Saint Laurent the ‘spiritual heir’ not only of a fashion house - YSL was at the artistic director of the maison for two years afterwards - but of an attitude, and of a certain idea of fashion that is relevant still today.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Runway Archive: Jurgi Persoons A/W 2001'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Taken from a different perspective than usual runway pictures, this photo by Etienne Tordoir captures one of the looks of Jurgi Persoons’ a/w 2001 collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048212_jurgi_persoons_aw01_0005.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jurgi Persoons a/w 2001 fashion show, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the picture, the model is wearing a grey wool coat with curly edges and white stitching; under it, an asymmetric knitted jumper that has been cut and sewn together not to make the stripes of its pattern match. The jumper is worn over a grey shirt and a white skirt in light fabric that allows to see the silhouette of the legs wearing\_dark stockings. The model, whose\_make up consisting of white powder sprayed on her face,\_is standing still as a statue in front of a panel printed with\_a patchwork ofwooden and metallic materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As that of the picture, the designer’s perspective on fashion can be defined as unusual and off-centred too. A graduate of Antwerp’s Royal Academy, Persoons\_is considered part of second wave of Belgian designer that took over international recognition – the first one consisting in the famous Antwerp Six and Martin Margiela. His crude and fiery take on fashion resulted in often raw pieces in dark fabric that incorporated details of the seedy and dark imagery that found form also in his campaigns. Persoons stopped in 2003 but he became the director at the Textile and Fashion Department at KABK in The Hague, mentoring students towards an industry that he has faced fearlessly.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: Outfits designed by Pierre Cardin, 1969'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048217_MUDE_M_0349.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Outfits designed by Pierre cardin, 1969.\_Courtesy\_MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows five outfits designed by Pierre Cardin at the end of the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierre Cardin was born in 1922 in San Biagio di Callalta near Treviso, in the North-East of Italy, but soon moved to France, since his family was escaping fascism. Cardin began pursuing his career in fashion very early: aged 14, he started working as a clothier’s apprentice. Then he moved to Vichy, where he worked as a tailor, making suits for women.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he moved to Paris in 1945, Cardin he worked with the fashion house of Paquin. Then he moved to Elsa Schiaparelli until he became head of Christian Dior's tailleure atelier in 1947. After having learned from these masters, Pierre Cardin founded his own house in 1950, launching his own line of haute couture three years after. \_It is not his couture creations that made him one of the most studied names of recent history of fashion: in 1959, he was expelled from the Chambre Syndicale for launching a ready-to-wear collection for the Printemps department store as the first couturier in Paris.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though his style is recognized to be extremely new, actually reminiscences from his masters can be retraced even in his most extreme and scandalous creations, like for instance the combination of the mini and the maxi skirt: a perfectly tailored mini skirt with floor-length fringes, that combined his tailoring skills with his wit and attention to the contemporary culture of the 1970s. \_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Sharing experiences in fashion: Margiela and Gaultier'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Martin Margiela is a one-of-a-kind fashion designer. His fashion is regarded to be conceptual, producing clothes that are the sublimated result of a reflection on the very materiality of items, their appearance and construction: an intellectual gesture, a sophisticated reflection, a quasi-scientific reinterpretation of the past. At a very superficial glance, it comes as a surprise that his first apprenticeship was at Jean Paul Gaultier, but looking closer, it is possible to grasp the connections between these two designers, and their only apparently distant takes on fashion.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048208_OBJ36424.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Reedition of a body designed in 2007, Maison\_Martin Margiela, 2013.\_Courtesy MOMU\_ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Margiela graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 1979. In 1984 he moved to Paris to work as a design assistant to Jean Paul Gaultier. The legend goes that Margiela sat in Gaultier’s office waiting room for days, before being introduced to Gaultier himself. Margiela was so determined in working for the enfant terrible of French fashion probably because he believed he could learn something he couldn’t get in Antwerp. He stayed with Gaultier for three years, before setting up his own label ‘Maison Martin Margiela’ and shocking the fashion world with his first collection in 1989. Later, Gaultier said: ‘I knew he could do something great, but I did’n know to which extent.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-11/2048232_europeana_fashion_56987591_jpg.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Jean Paul Gaultier fashion show, 1989, Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though very different in the appearance, Gaultier’s and Margiela's works are similar in the obsession they show for the body, which is always the starting point of their production: for Gaultier, the body is something that has to be enhanced, celebrated, displayed; while Margiela’s sensibility leans towards concealing the body, changing its forms and negating its identity.<br>\r\nMargiela and Gaultier show a similar approach also in the way they consider the fashion show: even though with very different techniques and evoking distinct atmospheres, a common thread can be perceived in the level of reflection they put in their shows, often turning them in real happenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent documentary on the Belgian designer, Gaultier declared that he doesn’t consider himself to be Margiela’s teacher, because he didn’t need one. However, his apprenticeship at Gaultier proves to be very important to understand a bit more Margiela’s creations, whose meaning is often considered very difficult to grasp.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The Editor''s Column: Extra-Ordinary Fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>December is a unique month. It signals the end of a period, and prepares us for a new beginning. In this being in-between it is special, and surely out of the ordinary; this is why, for this December, we decided to dedicate our attention to attires and objects that are not part of everyday culture, and are special items both for their appearance and their meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-12/2048232_europeana_fashion_62626942_jpg.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Kenzo Fashion Show for the A/W 1985-86 Collection. Photo Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion deals with the ordinary, but most times the fashion we are most drawn to is that that makes us wonder, which allows us to dream. While everyday fashion is an interesting and fundamental tool to understand the way clothes are part of the construction of personal and public identities, as well as they contribute to the build up of national and international narratives, clothes that are unexpected and flamboyant, or appear ‘strange’ and non-conform to what society considers normal, are able to give us glimpses into the life of unconventional groups of people, who used fashion precisely to mark their difference. In other cases, something that for us looks unconventional today might have been the norm in other eras, and understanding this is important in order to better grasp the atmosphere and way of thinking that was common in that precise time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-12/2048213_item_O78803.jpeg\"><em><strong>Court dress consisting of an embroidered silk mantua robe and petticoat, probably made in England, 1740-1745. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extra-ordinary dresses are, for us, those that tell interesting stories about their design, the way the were or are used in special occasions and the way their form has changed or stayed the same over time. It will be a journey defying some old conceptions, crossing times and spaces, touching on different issues such as historicism, quotation, traditions and cross-cultural references: a good way, we think, to say goodbye to\_the old year and welcome the new one.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Europeana Fashion joins the celebrations of the European Year of Cultural Heritage this 2018 alongside the major European institutions to reflect upon its rich and diverse heritage. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On December 7th, Europeana Fashion took part at the latest European Culture Forum during which was presented the European Year of Cultural Heritage at Superstudio in Milan, a project that involved\_the major Europeana Institutions throughout 2018 to celebrate the European heritage in its many forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-12/thumbnail-by-url.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Print from 'La mode illustrée', 1874. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, public domain.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with the aims of the upcoming Year of Cultural Heritage, Europeana Fashion goals are to give a free access to the archives and collections of European fashion institutions, and to share and inform a wider number of people interested in fashion, costume and decorative arts. In addition, in collaboration with the The NEw School - Parsons Paris’ students, Europeana Fashion reflected upon the meaning and the history of Europe through its archive, inviting the students to curate three digital exhibitions - which were called 'capsule curations' - on show on our Tumblr. In a moment now in which the very concept of Europe is being questioned and redefined, to share and celebrate the varied heritage and culture is an essential base for a reflection on what it means to belong to a common European space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the European Year of Cultural Heritage and the events related visit: https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Sumptuous, fascinating,\_wide: these dresses, examples of which can be found in the collections of many museums across the world, have a specific name, and of course, a precise history. They were called<em>\_robes de cour</em> - or robes de corpse,\_grand habits,\_grand habits de cour - and\_were\_the formal court wear across Europe\_during the 18th century. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048202_DE_MUS_018313_1957646.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Robe de cour, illustration by Georg Matthäus Probst and Matthäus Albrecht Lotter, ca. 1770. Courtesy\_Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The person who contributed to its design was no less than\_Louis XIV, the Sun King, around\_1680s.\_It consists of a stiff, boned bodice\_laced\_up the back, a skirt, and separate\_sleeves. It also accounted for a\_train to be worn either at the waist or falling from the shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louis XIV admired the female body, and could not stand\_the loose robes that were in fashion at the end of the 17th century. \_In order to control the look of the people around him - he was the sun king, after all -\_he ordered to design a dress that featured a\_fitted bodice and made it mandatory for women to wear in court at all formal events.\_It is said that in\_1704, he reprised some women who dared disobey this unwritten law and wear a more informal dress at the theatre.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048213_item_O137678.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Mantua and petticoat of French silk, brocaded with silver-gilt threads, made in England, 1755-60. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of style, the bodice remained quite the same, while the skirt changed in dimension and form.\_The skirt shape also changed from region to region in Europe:\_in the 1740s-60s, English robes de cour were quite rectangular and flat, while\_the French hoop that gave the form to the skirt was\_less square at the corners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1770s, it was another king who decided the end the craze for the robes de coeur:\_Louis XVI, influenced by hist wife Marie Antoinette, who considered it “obsolete and unbearable”, allowed women to come to court with different attires, and especially the so-called\_robe a la francaise - a looser and wider kind of gown - for the most formal occasions.</p>\r\n"

While moving towards the centre of the dark stage, the only light is coming from the model’s floral neckpiece, which is gleaming\_intermittently, pacing the show towards its finale.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the month preceding the show, Alexander McQueen announced his decision of not taking over the role of creative director of Yves Saint Laurent, wanting instead to focus on his own brand. The show’s breath-taking conclusion was meant by the designer to bring back all the attention on clothes and design, as this collection, entitled ‘Pantheon as Lecum’, was for Alexander McQueen an attempt\_to turn away from the theatricality of his previous presentations. Set in a futuristic runway, illuminated to resemble the landing pad of an alien spacecraft, the show was opened by flesh/nude coloured looks that gave no hint of such a grandiose finale if not for their extra-terrestrial aura.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'In Fashion, More is More: Patrick Kelly'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>'Patrick landed like a bomb in my shop in 1985. He was so gay and so full of energy, and so were his clothes.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these words, the buyer at Victoria boutiques in Paris described Patrick Kelly and his fashion, as if the man and his practice were one the natural extension of the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048232_europeana_fashion_56986283_jpg.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Patrick Kelly Fashion Show, March 1989. Photo Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick Kelly was obsessed with fashion. He learned to sew at a very young age, worked in thrift shops when he was young and eventually managed to establish his own label and move to France, to pursue a career that brought him to conquer the Parisian fashion scene of the 19080s. It is in Paris that Kelly became the designer of records. In fact, he was the first American designer to be admitted to the prestigious Chambre syndicale du prêt-à-porter des couturiers et des créateurs de mode: something that consecrated him to the statue of ‘createur’. He is probably the most well-known ad remembered African-american designer who actively included his own roots and background into his practice, merging these references with an extraordinarily contemporary aesthetic sensibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048232_europeana_fashion_56986205_jpg.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Patrick Kelly Fashion Show, March 1989. Photo Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The references he used to create his clothes were recognisably linked to his sensibility and background: these included elements of Black culture - he was a collector of black memorabilia - as well as to pop art and culture. His style was flamboyant, playful and daringly excessive. This was true also for the way he orchestrated the presentations of his collections, which had to be the very first celebration of his creative thought.

        title: 'The (feminine) body of fashion: Azzedine Alaia'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><em>'I work for women. I only think for them. If I didn't like women, I wouldn't do this job.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFashion is a very bodily matter. The body is the first object, some designer see it as an obstacle, some others are so in love with it that their philosophy is shaped by the curves, movements and particularities of the living female body. Azzedine Alaia is one of them. His relationship with women had always been very close: he declared he could not create without a model in front of him, and considered women to be the true creator of fashion, while he was ‘only making clothes’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048217_MUDE_M_0669_01.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Bolero by Azzedine Alaia, 1998. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alaia was born in Tunisia. From a very young age he showed an interest in fashion, and in this was supported by his sister Hafida and a French friend of his mother, who used to bring him copies of Vogue. The study of sculpture in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Tunis led him to a very deep understanding of the human form, something he directly applied in his part-time job as dressmaker, which allowed him also to pay school fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/2048217_MUDE_M_0669_02.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Dress by Azzedine Alaia, 1998. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda,\_All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957 Alaia moved to Paris, where he briefly worked for Christian Dior and then moved to Guy Laroche, then Thierry Mugler. At the end of the 1970s he opened his atelier, supported by high-profile clients, from Greta Garbo to Marie-Hélène de Rothschild. From then, his name got recognition, and his creations started being admired - and sold - worldwide.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not fair to define Azzedine Alaia as a fashion designer. His material approach to creating clothes directly focussing on the body and the quasi-artisanal attitude he put even when developing his ready-to-wear lines clearly identify him more as a couturier: someone who makes fashion with his hands, rather than inventing something someone else would then give form to.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'In search of lost times: Callot Soeurs'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><em>Quoted as one of the greatest couture house by Marcel Proust in his novel “À la Recherche du Temps perdu”, Callot Soeurs, was a Parisian fashion house ran by three innovative sisters.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While wandering on avenue Matignon in Paris one can notice - or inadvertedly\_step on - a mosaic representing a woman in a light-blue dress beside the words ‘Callot Soeurs’. There to commemorate the address of one of their shops, the mosaic\_keeps alive the memory of one of the\_most influential and successful fashion houses of the 20th century, named\_Callot Soeurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/callot3.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evening dress, designed by Callot Soeurs, 1907-10. Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, all rights reserved.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fashion house was founded in 1895 by four sisters. They descended from a family of aert and textile dealers and were thus accustomed to precious fabrics, lingerie and laces their family shops were renowned for. Lace, indeed, was one of the fabrics that most characterised the sisters’ work, Marcel Proust himself noted in his novel that Caillot Soeurs\_used “a little too much” of it. Their couture gowns were realized with hand-made lace, usually reconstituted eighteenth century lace. However, they also introduced more innovative fabrics such as gold and silver lamé and an\_elastic gabardine for their sport couture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/callot2.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Long dress, designed by Callot Soeurs, 1927. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were also among the first to abandon the corset for less constrictive silhouettes. Marie Gerber, the elder sister, had a design talent besides having\_trained herself as a première in the atelier of Raudnitz &amp; Cie. Inspired by the Orientalism and avant-garde arts, she eventually designed also Cubist dresses, made of laces and embroideries resembling collages. She used to drape fabrics on models and let her toile-makers to execute the design. One of these toile-makers was, from 1901 to 1906, Madeleine Vionnet. Later, the great couturiere\_would\_recognise\_Callot Soeurs as those who inspired her in her work. She declaired 'without the example of the Callot Soeurs, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls Royces'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-01/callot1.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evening dress, designed by Callot Soeurs, ca. 1908. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the death of Marie Berger, the couture house was run by her sons Pierre and Jacques, who continued to sell to the maison's\_loyal clientele. However, the economic crash of the 1929 had a great impact on the business, which\_was then closed in 1937. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The model is holding a hockey stick with\_her hand, covered by red padded gloves. Although she has her head protected by a helmet, on her neck the model is wearing a white pearl necklace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Chanel is mostly popular for its tweeds, Karl Lagerfeld’s sporty designs do not depart from the spirit of the Maison and of its founder. In fact, Coco Chanel’s attention for modernity brought her to use less traditional fabrics and models for her creations, like jersey, which was before restrained to male underwear. A pursuer of novelty and coolness, Karl Lagerfeld introduced sportswear inspired clothes in the runway rejuvenating the brand’s aesthetic and remarking the all-encompassing power of the brand.</p>\r\n"

It was founded by John Redfern, who followed the steps of his father who run a clothing shop since 1811 in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, internationally famous centre for yachting since 1815. A tailor since 1855, John Redfern specialized in tailored dresses and suits for women, designing for the aristocratic clientele tailored suits for sport activities such as yachting, tennis and riding, which remained for long the house speciality. Although designed for sport, these suits and dresses ended up to be worn by Redfern clients in more everyday occasions, marking the house popularity and success.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/2048212_paco_rabanne_css96_0009.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Paco Rabanne Couture Show, Spring/Summer 1996. Photo Courtesy Catwalkpictures, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photo shows a model on the runway of Paco Rabanne's show of his Spring/Summer 1996 Couture collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outfit is composed by a jacket, a short skirt and boots, all made in a black shiny material, which could either be leather or PVC. At the centre of the jacket, a sort of big nail is attached, sustaining a sort of umbrella-like hood made of white and transparent plastic, which the model is holding above\_her head. The design recalls a sort of space inspiration,\_which characterise the work of Rabanne of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paco Rabanne is a Spanish designer of Basque origins, who became known as the 'enfant terrible' of the Paris fashion scene in the 1960s. Rabanne originally trained as an architech, but soon started to collaborate with different fashion houses, such as Dior, Maggy Rouff and Givenchy, creating jewellery and accessories for the Couture. In 1966, he established his fashion house, and his creations were appreciated by many French actresses, artists and singers: Francoise Hardy was one of his fans. In 1968 he dressed Jane Fonda for the infamous Roger Vadim's movie 'Barbarella.' His style is characterised by a thorough use of unusual materials, especially metals and plastic, which he used in his revolutionary couture designs.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>For this month, we have explored our archive in search of those pieces whose specific use confines them to private spaces. From underwear, to nightgowns,\_negligées and banyans, whose colourful fabrics challenged the sobriety of men’s daywear, our Tumblr will showcase the wide variety of what we ccall 'private fashion'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/prf1.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Model of negligée, designed by Mad Carpentier, 1943. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not exempt from the whims of fashions,\_underwear and house-wear presented in this curation shows how not only these pieces were object of ornament but also how some of these were designed with ingenuity and were resulting from research and experimentation, being made with avant-garde materials or crafted to make them more functional. This can be said of all the pieces presented, from clothes to accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/prf2.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Woman wearing a negligée by Jacques Doucet, photo by Talbot, ca. 1912. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.\_</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it can be perceived from the advertisements they were featured it, this category of clothes is characterised by two main qualities. Being the clothes worn in most proximity to the body and those that had to transform it or to welcome it in times of relax and recovery, these clothes race in a quest between comfort and vanity.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>As well as the recently appointed menswear designer Virgil Abloh, the French designer Louis Vuitton, founder of the eponymous house that is nowadays a colossus of the industry, was a smart innovator who landed in fashion and luxury following an odd path, and was the creator of objects that are still very much desired to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/lv2.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Louis Vuitton f/w 2011 fashion show. Courtesy Netherlands Institute for Sounds and Vision, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born on 4th August 1821 from a working-class family that counted in his roots joiners, carpenters and milliners, at the age of thirteen Louis Vuitton left home heading to Paris to find a job as an apprentice in a workshop. His journey to the city took him two years in which he found odd jobs on the road to Paris. In the city he found a job as a box maker and packer, an occupation regarded as the most respectable at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/lv3.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Bags by Louis Vuitton, 1990s.

It’s trunks, that flat and flat-bottomed could be easily stacked, gained him a wide recognition and success, epitomized by his presence at the 1867 Paris’s Universal Exhibition.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Marc Jacobs is an American fashion designer, who served as artistic director of Louis Vuitton for many years, till 2014, when he left to concentrate on the brand that bears his name.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/2048212_louis_vuitton_ss13_0221.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2013, Photo Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacobs was appointed at Louis Vuitton in 1997, where he created the first ready-to-wear line of the maison. During the twelve-year period, he developed special projects and collaborations with many artists and designers, and heavily contributed to the\_growth of the fashion house. He played woth the most regcognisable codes of the history of the maison, using them to refresh the identity of the brand itself and projecting it on the global platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-03/2048212_louis_vuitton_ss14_0010.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2014, Photo Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacobs has always been interested in the idea of performing, and fashion is a big part of the performances he references to. For his last collection at Louis Vuitton, Jacobs recreated some of the sets from his sixteen years at the maison. The clothes on the runway were all black, with feathers, beads and glitters, and the collection was dedicated - as stated in the press release - “to the showgirl in all of us.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show was closed by model Edie Campbell, who stepped on the runway with a transparent body-suit covered in writings that reminded one of the artistic collaborations, that between Stephen Sprouse and LV, promoted by Jacobs, wearing a big feathered headpiece, chains and handcuffs.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Cristian Lacroix is a French fashion designer and couturier. He was born in Arles, in southern France. Lacroix studied Art History in Montpellier, following his utter interest in historical clothing, which he used to sketch from a very young age. He then moved to Paris to enroll at the prestigious Sorbonne; while working on a dissertation on dress in French 18th-century painting, Lacroix also pursued a program in museum studies at the École du Louvre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though interested in matters such as museum and curatorial studies, fashion turned out to be the driving force of his life: in 1975, he opened his own haute couture house. His background in historical costume, as well as his interest in folklore and regional traditions, influenced Lacroix’s style, characterized by rich embellishments, prints, and wide volumes, of which the short puffball skirt, called \"le pouf”, often worn with a corset to emphasize its form, is a symbol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048212_christian_lacroix_css99_0005.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Christian Lacroix Spring/Summer 1999 collection.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>During the 18th century, and much later on, tailoring for men and women were a quite distinct practice and were\_pursued by different professional figures. In the english language, even the words that defined 'making clothes' for men and women were different: tailors were the ones (usually men) producing men's attires, while women making clothes for women were usually called dressmakers.\_Still today, menswear tailoring is still looked as the epitome of distinction and mens’ tailors keep their patterns and knowledge to pass it on only to their worthy successors. However, there were occasions in the 18th century already, in which women had their clothes designed and made by menswear tailors. The riding jacket was one of these occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘riding habits’ therefore included also elements of men’s costume. This jacket\_in particular is styled after a man’s coat, but it was added a waist seam to fit over stays and a wide petticoat. Another masculine element is the mariner’s cuff, with a scalloped flap with three buttons running parallel to the length of the sleeve. It was a style first seen on the coats of naval officers, although their uniform was not officially defined until 1748. The mariner’s cuff became a fashionable feature of civilian coats in the 1750s and soon began to appear on women’s riding habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/rid1.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Women’s riding coat of worsted and lined with linen and silk, England, 1750s.</strong></em></p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Jean-Louis Scherrer was a Parisian\_fashion designer and couturier active between the 1960s and the early 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scherrer was born in Paris. He first trained as a dancer at the Conservatoire de Paris, but after an injury he decided to turn to fashion design. In 1956 he became one of the assistant designer to Christian Dior. He then worked with Saint Laurent at the maison Dior, and afterwards moved to Louis Feraud. Finally in 1962 he opened the doors of his own maison on Rue du Fauburg Saint-Honoré.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1971, his fashion house\_moved to the number 51 of Avenue Montaigne, where some of the most well-known women - Farah Diba, Sophia Loren, Raquel Welch, Isabelle Adjani and Françoise Sagan - used to go shopping for Scherrer's sumptuous 'idea' of fashion that he turned into clothes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992 he was sacked from his own label by former business partner: this fact was openly criticised by designers on the press, since it was the first time something like this happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he died in 2013,\_French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti said:\_“an important chapter of the history of French haute couture has closed (...)\_his famous leopard-print cocktail dresses and polka-dot skirts were emblems of a new feminine silhouette.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048230_europeana_fashion_10599.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Dress by Jean-Louis Scherrer, 1980s.

        body: "<p>Stomachers are panel of fabric that were\_worn to fill the front edges of an open gown. Usually triangular in shape, they are sucred to the dress with fastenings or pins. Although they became fashionable in women’s dress between the 1680s and 1780s, the stomacher was used since the 16th century in both men and women’s costume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though differing in style, stomachers were usually highly decorative and richly embroidered with designs and materials sometimes matching or contrasting with the gown. The\_one in the picture below\_is in light silk taffeta, embroidered in silk and metal threads. The embroidery depicts a multitude of coloured summer flowers and fruits alongside the curved shapes made of the metal threads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/stomacher.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Embroidered stomacher, 1740s.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>A corset is a garment that has its roots in the history of fashion, but still tickles the imaginations of contemporary designers. It was originally developed and worn to shape the torso and create a silhouette that was\_smaller at the waist and\_larger bottom. It was used both\_for aesthetic or medical purposes - and this is true for women and men alike, even if it is mostly associated with womenswear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corsets were\_usually made by a corsetmaker and\_fitted to the individual wearer.\_They are typically constructed of\_cloth, particularly coutil, or leather and\_stiffened with what is called 'boning' (also\_ribs or stays). In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century these 'bones' - the most famous are the strips of baleen - were inserted into channels in the cloth or leather, shaping the corset and giving it structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048221_10918x1y2180.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Corset in light blue silk satin with embroidery and stitching in dark red silk.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><em>‘A hat makes clothing identifiable, dramatic and, most importantly, fashion … It’s the cherry on the cake, the dot on the ‘i’, the exclamation mark, the fashion focus. Everyone from showgirls to dictators knows that by wearing a hat they will be centre of attention.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For sure Stephen Jones knows how to make hats that get everybody’s attention. For over forty years now, the English milliner designed hats for his own collections and for many great designers and fashion houses, from Vivienne Westwood to Dior.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048208_OBJ7587.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Velocity' hat, designed by Stephen Jones, 1998. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Cheshire, Stephen Jones moved to London to study fashion at the Central Saint Martin School of Art and Design. The city in the late Seventies was home to a creative turmoil that found its expressions in the whimsical parties thrown in underground clubs, like The Blitz, which the milliner frequented wearing on his head his own creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1980, Stephen Jones opened his first boutique and atelier, in which he sold his first creations to loyal clients, from music stars to Royals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048208_OBJ21557.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Lupina' hat, designed by Stephen Jones, 2006-07. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His hats reflect the multitude of his inspirations and his desire to amaze and wonder and the collaborations with designers shows how the can stress his crafts to interpret the glamour of John Galliano’s fashion to the punk crafts of Vivienne Westwood and the more conceptual vision of Comme des Garçons.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, Jones even curated an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, entitled ‘Hats: An Anthology by Stephen Jones’. Referencing the exhibition curated in 1971 by Cecil Beaton, the milliner selected from the Museum’s archive hats and head-pieces to tell with his own words the history and craft of millinery, from research and inspirations, and through the atelier to the boutique; a creative path that he since long has learned to enjoy and overturn.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Although men and women covered their heads for various reasons since the antiquity, It was between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that hats began to be widely used in western culture; hats quickly became sign of status and social standing and marking ceremonies and special occasions. Hats also caused the emergence of a new profession, that of the milliner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-04/2048211_NM_0214269.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Straw hat, 1700 ca. Courtesy\_Stiftelsen Nordiska museet, CC BY-NC-ND.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term 'milliner' was first used in London around sixteenth century. It describe a seller of women's fashion items imported from Milan - in fact at first they were called ‘the Milaners’. They used not only to sell headpieces, but ribbons, gloves, trims and other accessories. \_Later, the word came to identify the person making hats and bonnets, initially with straw and then with the most diverse materials: from fabrics such as silk, velvet, taffeta, to leather, felt and fur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the eighteenth century in European and American cities millinery shops abounded, competing in selling the most precious accessories to complete the look of a fashionable ensemble. The first name associated with millinery is surely that of Rose Bertin,\_called in French\_<em>marchande de mode. </em>Her shop, or better her fashionable salon,<em>\_Le Grand Moghul</em>, situated on rue Faubourg Saint-Honoré, was the best in Paris, for both the materials and the gossip that circulated there. Bertin’s fame was fostered by her most known client, Queen Marie Antoinette.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>\"<em>Il n'y a de nouveau que ce qui est oublié</em>\" (There is nothing new except what has been forgotten.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rose Bertin is often referred to as the first fashion designer. These words are said to be the ones she used with her most prominent client, Queen Marie Antoinette, when describing the new styles she was going to ‘craft’ for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-05/2048202_DE_MUS_018313_1929092.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Pariser Coeffuren: Chien-couchant avec un pouf, print by Joachim Pauli, second half of eighteenth century. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bertin begun her career in fashion as a milliner and marchande de mode. She opened her shop at the beginning of 1770s on Rue Saint Honoré; In The Grand Mogol, this the name of the shop, Bertin used to sell trimmings, lace and other embellishments to the noblewomen of Paris. Soon her clientele counted many members of the French court, who appreciated her advice and followed what Bertin told them about how to style themselves. In 1772 she was introduced to the new queen of France, Marie Antoinette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She concentrated on the hairdos of the queen, designing them to fit occasion and make them into material celebrations of events. The most famous is surely the pouf a l'inoculation, reared to celebrate the Kings' vaccination in June 1774. \"It represented a rising sun, and an olive-tree laden with fruit, round which a serpent was twisted, holding a flower-wreathed club. The classical serpent of Esculapius represented medicine, and the club was the force which could overcome disease. The rising sun was the young King himself, great-grandson of the Roi-Soleil, to whom all eyes were turned. The olive-tree was the symbol of peace, and also of the tender affection with which all were penetrated at the news of the happy success of the operation which the King and the Royal Family had undergone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-05/2048202_DE_MUS_018313_1870420.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Examples of poufs on Gallerie des Modes et du Costume Français, second half of eighteenth century.

Once the Revolution was over Rose returned to Paris, and soon regained her status: one of her new customers was in fact Joséphine de Beauharnais, the soon-to-be empress of France.</p>\r\n"

Photo Piotr Szaradowski, courtesy Muzealne Mody, all rights reserved</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture shows a dress made of light jersey featuring a trompe-l’oeil print with a motif that visually recreates the silhouette of a heavily embroidered, sequined dress. It is a re-edition of a Maison Martin Margiela dress from the Spring/Summer 1996 collection, made for the collaboration the Maison did with the fast-fashion brand H&amp;M in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collaboration between Maison Martin Margiela and H&amp;M was more of a retrospective than an ‘original’ collection made of new and never-before-seen items: the designers from the Maison decided to look back at the history of the brand itself, carefully selecting from various collections the pieces that most characterized the aesthetic of the brand itself.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection counted some of the ‘staples’ of the fashion house, reissued for the occasion: Painted jeans, jackets made from leather belts, camel topcoats with the collars shorn off, oversized jackets, shoes with invisible heel. As declared copies, all the items came with a special tag connecting them with their ‘original’: the tag gave informations about the collection the piece - as a design - was first presented.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dress is part of Muzealne Mody, a collection of fashion and costume from 1800 onwards. The collection was put together by fashion historian Piotr Szaradowsk; it is mostly focused on French fashion and Parisian couture and includes, among others, breath-taking pieces by Schiaparelli, Paquin, Dior and Yves Saint Laurent. In collaboration with Piotr Szaradowski, part of the collection has been now included on the Europeana Fashion channel, which can be browsed at this link: https://bit.ly/2jwsa62.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Although the use of wigs is attested since ancient times, it was between sixteenth and eighteenth centuries that ‘perukes’ - this the way they were called - really became an indispensable accessory, for women as well as (if not more!) for men.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-05/3bf5b431362eb0f671a898c64e71f89e.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Peruke of Pruik van Egbert de Vrij, Major of\_Amsterdam. Courtesy Amsterdam Museum, CCO</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uses were various: hygienic and medical purposes, but above all wigs were an integral part of ceremonial and occupational dress, able to signal the social role and status of the person wearing one of a particular kind.<br>\r\n\_\_<br>\r\nAt the end of sixteenth century, the syphilis epidemic spread all around Europe, and therefore the members of the upper classes afflicted by the disease attempted to safeguard their reputation and appearance by covering their balding pate with elaborate and apparently perfect peruke, often made with human hair. Samuel Pepys, talking about his brother who acquired syphilis, wrote, “If [he] lives, he will not be able to show his head—which will be a very great shame to me.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also spiritual leaders and high ranking officials have been known over the centuries to cover their head when performing their duties. The traditional use of wigs became then part of the dress code of members of the court, professionals, officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louis XIV started balding at 17, so it is reported that he hired 48 wigmakers to save his image. Some time later, Charles II king of England did the same thing, when his hair started to gray, and the members of both the French and the English courts followed their kings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late eighteenth century, the trend started to disappear, but some roles maintained the use of wigs, turning a fashion into enduring tradition</p>\r\n"

Then, shortly before the Liberation of Rome in June 1944, she prepared for her\_wedding with Gaio Visconti and started her career as a fashion designer. In 1946 she opened an atelier in the family palace and organized\_a\_presentation of the first collection: fourteen models, all charaterized by a\_bold and chic\_taste inspired by post-war bricolage. This event leads her to be, at twenty-four, the youngest and most promising Italian couturière.\_In 1949, his fashion-creation met with the appreciation of buyers from US department stores, Bergdorf Goodman and Marshall Field, who arrived in Italy in search of a sartorial style that was alternative to that of French fashion.

Both followed separate careers until 1962, when they decided to work together and present\_their brand on the Parisian scene. The creative partnership lasted\_until 1964, the year in which Fabiani returns to his Roman atelier and Simonetta launches the Haute Boutique formula in Paris.\_In 1969 he met the guru Swami Chidananda and starts rethinking her life and connect withg her spirituality.\_In 1971 she left Paris and the world of high fashion to move to India, where\_she settled in an ashram,\_devoting\_herself to the practice of meditation and the study of oriental philosophies.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: null
        body: "<p>Maria Monaci Gallenga is a pivotal figure in\_the history of fashion, since she contributed to the acquisition, for the discipline and production of fashion,\_of\_autonomous value and dignity with respect to the artistic product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-05/2048224_0000027801.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Detail of a feminine cape designed by Maria Monaci Gallenga, 1920-1922 ca. Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, all rights reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria Monaci Gallenga was the\_daughter of Ernesto Monaci, professor of philology at the University of Rome La Sapienza, and during her youth she was surrounded by well-known personalities from the literary and artistic world of the time. Her career in design started in the 1910s: in those years she exhibited\_her\_creations, which included\_objects of furniture, cushions and panels with drawings printed with a new texcnique she invented,\_in many public events: the\_exhibition\_of the Roman Secession,\_the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, the\_California exhibition. Demonstrating strong entrepreneurial skills, she was able to organise the flow of work in her atelier and transform it into a company able to produce big numbers and supply also the American market, whose costumers were\_fascinated by her innovative\_experimentations with printing and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also worked with\_Vittorio Zecchin, with whom he took part in the\_Amsterdam and Paris exhibitions in the 1920s. She also collaborated with Antonio Maraini and Marcello Piacentini. She was also part\_of the National Agency for Crafts and Small Industry, founded in 1925 to promote the image of Italian products in the world. After\_the participation in the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts, held in Paris, in 1928 she\_opened the 'Boutique Italienne'\_together with Bice Pittoni and Carla Visconti di Modrone,\_a permanent showcase of the best products of Italian art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934 she left France\_to return to\_Rome, where her shop still was an active\_laboratory of ideas of artists working in different sectors. She retired from the business in 1938, leaving his son to run the Via Veneto store, which specialized in interior design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fame of Maria Monaci Gallenga is linked to the invention of a particular technique of printing , which consisted in the use of wooden matrices on which a glue was applied before being pressed onto the fabric, on which was then distributed a powder of metallic pigments in gold and silver. This way, one colour blended into the other, obtaining an effect that made the fabric look hand-painted rather than printed. As\_source of inspiration, Gallenga used\_both motifs from contemporaneous artists as well as\_ancient models. Her way of treating the ancient motifs was so original and modern, she used to study their structure and 'break it'\_into singular details and\_simpler groups.\_</p>\r\n"

Courtesy MoMu, all rights reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows the cover of an\_issue dated 18th February 1900\_of\_La Mode Illustrée. The magazine was first published in 1859 in Paris. It\_was one of the most important French magazines of the late nineteenth that carried on well into the twentieth century. It was published on Sundays, with illustrations and description of Victorian attires and accessories, in the form of fashion plates that could be framed and used for display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second half of nineteenth century, the fashion market underwent a huge expansion both in America and Britain, where numerous fashion engravings and patterns were being printed and sold. Paris, however, was the center of it all, and La Mode Illustrée was the unrivaled leader of the fashion engraving during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1860 to 1872 La Mode created some of the finest fashion plates of the era. Its engravings were larger, more detailed and much more artistically hand-coloured than any of its competitors in England, France or America. By 1872, however, the high cost of publishing these original works were too prohibitive, and La Mode was shut down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years these original engravings have been avidly sought by collectors. The appeal of these works, in fact, has been so strong that photomechanical reproductions have been made since the early 1920’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The europeana fashion archive, thanks to the MoMu holdings, has an extensive number of issues of the magazine that can be browsed entirely online.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Revisiting ‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion’ exhibition at MoMu'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p>In 2009 MoMu hosted the exhibition ‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion’ that investigated the use of paper in fashion design and the historical importance of the paper dress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-06/thumbnail-by-url.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion' exhibition at MoMu. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paper is the material of the ephemeral, the physical support where fashion is usually sketched, represented and through which it is diffused. Realm of the bidimensional, \_paper flattens fashion in photographies, drawings and illustrations or explores it through words. However, in the 1960s the relationship between paper and fashion went beyond the two dimensions, and paper dresses became a craze which would have made history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vassilis Zidianakis, curator and co-founder of the non-profit cultural organization ATOPOS CVC, that explores the expression and adornment of the human body through various initiatives and projects, investigated the importance and influence of these paper dresses through the touring exhibition ‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion’, hosted at MoMu in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-06/thumbnail-by-url%20(2).jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion' exhibition. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in an original installation designed by the French Industrial Design office Normal Studio, the exhibition displayed a selection of original paper dresses from the 1960s part of the ATOPOS CVC own collection, alongside more recent experiments by contemporary fashion designers and artists, who were asked to create something inspired by the dresses in the collection. Sophia Kokosalaki, Michael Cepress, Yiorgos Eleftheriades, Johanna Trudzinski, Bas Kosters, Angelos Bratis, Deux Hommes, Marcus Tomlinson, as well as the internationally renowned stage designer Bob Wilson participated with their creations to the exhibition, together with Dirk Van Saene, John Galliano, Issey Miyake, A.F. Vandevorst, Hussein Chalayan, Kosuke Tsumura, Walter Van Beirendonck, Ann Demeulemeester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although paper had been used for clothing in different geographies and chronologies - for instance, for the papier-mâché clothes and accessories common during the 18th century and for the paper kimonos of the Japanese Edo period - \_it was in 1966 that the dresses became a global trend. They were first released in America, as a mean to promote the products of a paper manufacturing company. These light, disposable dresses soon captured the vibrant atmosphere of the 1960s and became a big phenomenon; they were sold in major department stores and printed with bold and whimsical pop-art patterns. Their popularity though was ephemeral as their materiality: by 1968 they almost disappeared from any market.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: ''La Perse'' Jacket by Cristóbal Balenciaga, 1956'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-05/2048221_10918x1y97234.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The image shows a detail of 'La Perse',\_a jacket designed by couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga\_in 1956. The object is\_currently part of the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag Collection.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cristóbal Balenciaga was a Spanish couturier, who merged the atmospheres of his homeland with the precepts of French Couture. Son of a seamstress, at the age of twelve he began working as an apprentice in a tailor shop in Getaria, his hometown in the north of Spain.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Balenciaga was just a teenager, a noblewoman in his town became his customer and patron, sending him to Madrid to train as a tailor in one of the best schools of the capital. He opened a boutique in San Sebastián, in the north of Spain, in 1919, and the other two branches in Madrid and Barcelona. Amongst his clients, were the Spanish royal family and the aristocracy. However, at the end of the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War forced him to close his business and immigrate to Paris. He opened his first atelier on George V Avenue in 1937.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in Paris, he established his fame as ‘The King of Fashion’ for the groundbreaking designs he presented, and especially for the iconic silhouettes, he developed during the 1950s and 1960s. An acute observer of the social scenario in front of him, considering the revolution that happened in France in front of his eyes, in 1968 he decided to close his maison, declaring that that moment was the end of what he considered fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*This text is taken from the exhibition 'Les Couturiers' - check it out here\_to discover more:\_https://bit.ly/2lcXnfj\_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-06/2048217_MUDE_M_0563_02.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Below the Nave swimsuit, produced by\_Harmon Knitwear and designed by Rudi\_Gernreich, 1968. Courtesy\_MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rudolf 'Rudi'\_Gernreich is considered among the first designers who openly used fashion to make social statement and to speak in favor of equality and sexual freedom. Active in the 1960, his creations featured materials such as vinyl, plastic and artificial fibers, using simple and daring patterns, often featuring cutouts and bold and daring constructions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list of items for which he is said to be first designer is quite long: the thong bathing suit, the swimsuit without a built-in bra, the so-called No Bra, and the topless monokini. All of these creations made headlines, also thanks to the efforts and strategies put in place to communicate them.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For four times he was the recipient of the Coty American Fashion Critics Award. He also experimented with media, producing what is regarded as the first fashion video in 1966: \"Basic Black: William Claxton w/Peggy Moffit\", featuring model Peggy Moffitt, who sort of became the face (and body!) associated with his creations.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1968 Gernreich closed his company but continued his work as a designer. From the beginning of his career, Gernreich also designed costumes for various film productions: in 1960, he was in charge of Eva Marie Saint's wardrobe in Otto Preminger's film Exodus; in 1970 he designed \"Dress Codes\" of the new decade for the January issue of Life magazine. Interestingly, he also declared his idea of future fashion was linked not to a binary definition of gender, but instead to a non-diversity, and worked on the concept of \"unisex.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His activism did not stop at fashion design: Gernreich was in fact a founding member of and financially supported the activities of the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest LGBT organizations established in the United States.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Dressed to Travel'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p>Since travelling became an accessible activity in the nineteenth century, travellers have been in search for a special attire designed to accompany them on their fares, eventually promoting new trends and customs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today travelling is an ordinary action that occupies much of everyone’s daily routine. By private or public means, people travel short or longer fares not only for leisure, but for work or study resons. If nowadays travelling has become an ordinary practice not requiring much more effort than to make the luggage fit the size restrictions, not that long ago travellers had the need to wear particular clothes designed precisely for travels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-06//2048208_FEM_jaargang_02_19020801_017_jpg.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Toilette de voyage et d'excursion', in Femina magazine, August 1902. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘travelling dress’ made its appearance in the nineteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution cut the costs of textile and clothes production, and people could afford specialized dress conceived to be worn only in specific occasions. Before this time, to travel was an occupation affordable only by the few and both higher and lower classes used to wear, in many cases, their best and most protective outerwear; from this time onwards, the improvement in the means of transport and the renovation of travel fares democratized travelling, letting more people embark on longer journeys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key-words were now modesty and practicality. The ‘travelling dress’, in fact, did not only serve to protect the wearer from dust and dirt, but, whether people were travelling by train, ship or steamboat, they also needed a dress which allowed comfortable movements in a public transport - especially because the space for toilette was usually restricted or shared. In addition, it was essential for the dress to be appropriate for appearing in public among strangers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-06/2048213_item_O13856.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Day outfit comprising a coat and skirt, embroidered silk and cotton canvas, designed by Jacques Doucet, Paris, 1895. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.\_\_</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of the travelling dress moved along with the development of the travelling system. As the public means of transportation evolved, becoming overall more comfortable, and new means, such as cars and later airplanes, appeared, the travelling dress gradually lost its functionality. Instead, a precise etiquette arose, indicating what dress to wear during a particular fare or while on a precise mean of transport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the ‘travelling dress’ lost its popularity in recent times, the research for the ‘ideal dress for journeys’ led fashion creators to design the most diverse and peculiar clothes.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

The name originally means 'closed\_on the neck by\_a\_band'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bindmössa\_originated in France in the mid-sixteenth century, where it was then a widow's garment, to be worn together with a dock.

The binder was originally quite soft but became increasingly harder during the 1700s, and was usually stiffened with a filling of papier-maché, felt wool or\_tagel; it was usually worn\_over a thin white linen cap. \_Even in the nineteenth century it was used, but mostly older people and memmbers of the lower classes\_in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the eighteenth century,\_the dark binder caps became lighter in colour, often decorated with a floral emboridery a real bouquet on the\_side. Even easier fabrics like printed cotton or linen fabrics were used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sweden, the binder is present in several costumes, including Bohuslän, parts of Västergötland, Häverödräkten with several places. In some parts of Uppland and Västmanland, the binder remained alive even after the costumes were totally removed.</p>\r\n"

Originally set up to sell lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, umbrellas and other varied\_goods, it had four departments, twelve employees, and a floor space of three hundred square meters.\_<br>\r\nIn 1852, Aristide Boucicaut became a partner and changed the marketing plan, instituting fixed prices and guarantees that allowed exchanges and refunds, advertising, and a much wider variety of merchandise. The annual income of the store increased, and this led to the building of another marche on the Left Bank, and a. further renovation of the existing store to which participated Gustave Eiffel, the engineer in charge of the building of the infamous Tour Eiffel.\_<br>\r\nApart form the good it sold - coming not only from Paris or France, but from many parts of the world - the Marché's peculiarities are linked to its being a 'modern' building.\_\_In fact, it was\_developed for the new inhabitants of the modern city: not only it was selling a wide array of goods, from clothes to homeware and other different objects, but it also provided different experiences, changing completely the definition of marketing. Amongst the spaces it articulated in its inside, there were a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped and many possibilities of the entertainment of children. It also employed many women - in 1880 half the employees were in fact women - and the employees who needed it could live in dormitories on the upper floors.</p>\r\n"

Since the beginning, the label\_mixes various\_influences, from sportswear to military wear, to tailoring and traditional menswear.\_Junichi Abe is\_considered one of the most interesting contemporary designers.\_Abe studied at Tokyo’s prestigious Bunka Fashion College and went on working under Junya Watanabe at COMME des GARÇONS fashion house.\_Out from the ‘common grounds’ of fashion, Abe's interests move between materials and construction, which are the strongest directions shaping his research and design process.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 he was invited as Guest Designer by Pitti to present his 2014 spring/summer collection - the one celebrating the first ten years of the label - during Pitti Uomo 84. About the choice, Lapo Cianchi, Pitti Immagine Director of Communications and Events declared: 'Over the past few seasons kolor’s classic, distinctive fluidity and lightness had developed into a mature project and become the heart and soul of men’s collections that are more structured and look at the men’s wardrobe with intelligence, precision and a touch of humor. We are fascinated by Junichi Abe’s determination in developing his brand, and in building a solid commercial venture on the basis of a very precise personal inspiration that has little interest in chasing mainstream fashion trends.'</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Fashion for Art: Jacques Doucet'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p>The link between the fashion world and that of the arts was quite strong at the beginning of the twentieth century, especially thanks to couturiers who also were avid art collectors central in the cultural life of Paris. Jacques Doucet is surely one of the most famous designers who not only collected art, but also supported artists and architects in their activity, asking them to shape the spaces in which he lived and worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/M-2009-0194-JT.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Robe à transformation embroidered with a motif of clouds and bees, 1900-1905 ca. Courtesy les Arts Decoratifs, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doucet was born in Paris in 1853. His family owned a very profitable lingerie and linens business, Doucet Lingerie. Raised in a refined and rich environment, from a very young age Doucet begun collecting eighteenth-century furniture, paintings and sculptures. In 1871, he opened his fashion house, and in his creations can be seen a heavy influence from the style of the objects he collected. His penchant for this opulent era made him the go-to designers for the divas of the time, as Cécile Sorel, Rejane and Sarah Bernhardt, for whom he created outfits that were both refined and recognisable, enriched with embroideries, frills, rouches and volants.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/M-2008-0813.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Black velvet jaquette, 1898-1900 ca. Courtesy les Arts Decoratifs, all rights reserved.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His style was too grand for the modern look in vogue in the 1920, so his popularity faded in that period. However, he kept working and in 1927 he asked cubist artists and sculptors to decorate his Studio House in rue Saint-James, Neuilly-sur-Seine. Its name was 'hôtel particulier': it was designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and included works and projects by Laurens, Csaky, Lipchitz and Marcoussis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from being interested in the eighteenth century, throughout his life he accumulated contemporary works of art, especially Post-Impressionist and Cubist paintings; the most know piece in his collection was surely Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which he bought direct from Picasso's studio. His collection of books included both art publications and manuscripts from contemporary writers: the first was donated to the University of Paris in 1917 and then transferred to the Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art in 2003; the second formed the Bibliothèque littéraire Jacques-Doucet, dedicated to the designer in 1929, year of his death.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: null
        body: "<p>It’s official! From today the Europeana Fashion International Association changes its name in European Fashion Heritage Association. A new name, a new identity, but the same mission: “make it easier for fashion GLAMs and brands to get better value from their cultural heritage assets by opening them up and connecting with new audiences”. We still believe that sharing the vast wealth of fashion heritage assets stored in public and private museums and archives across Europe empowers these institutions, improves their visibility and prestige and connect them with new audiences; at the same time, it allows the full exploitation of our shared fashion heritage for work, for study and for fun. These are the main reasons that will continue to drive our activities and define our scope. The Association today launches also its new website: <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu\">fashionheritage.eu</a>. Our website wants to be a space where a thriving network of fashion heritage professionals, scholars, creatives and enthusiasts can meet, share experiences, learn from each other and have a specialised access to the largest and richest digital repository of fashion heritage online, daily curated by our editorial team. The curatorial work developed on our website and elsewhere - as the entries on our blog or what we share on our social media platforms - crosses our vast archive, selecting and showcasing together items from different institutions across Europe, and thus creating new narratives and connections that put in context and exploit the rich content of our network. All the ways in which we manage the archive aim at providing background information and guidance to both professionals but also to fashionistas or to people simply interested in discovering more about the topic; our goal has always been - and still is, indeed - to help shaping personal researches of our users and unveiling some of the most interesting gems contained in our repository, often hidden in the width of the archive itself. In all our activities, we will be supported by our Scientific Committee, which will outline the scientific program of the international events that we organises yearly, support us in the definition of project proposals in the framework of the different EC programmes, and advises also about the editorial and curatorial lines. The Association will also continue to operate the Europeana Fashion thematic aggregator, keeping on publishing and enriching high quality digital fashion content on the Europeana Collections portal, putting it in the broader framework of the European cultural heritage, engaging there a larger audience of culture lovers. But the news are not ending here. Soon, we’re going to announce our forthcoming international conference on “Europe and Fashion: Questioning Identities and Cultures” with an impressive lineup of speakers. To stay tuned and discover more about our activities, subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/37394762_1893277837400411_6743137970850627584_o.jpg\"></p>\r\n"

        introduction: null
        body: "<p>An article in the Times published in 1922 deemed Ascot to be “the best place in England to see beautiful women in beautiful clothes.” Since the very beginnings of modern horse racing, the tracks were used as a ‘catwalk-avant-la-lettre’ by ladies and fashion designers alike. Horse races were a golden opportunity for high society women to spot and to don fashionable outfits, while couturiers dispatched models to the tracks dressed in their latest creations. Especially in France - host to such legendary races as those in Auteuil, Longchamp and Chantilly - ladies and models ‘promenading’ in high-end fashion thoroughly influenced the development of the fashion industry and the growing reputation of Paris as the fashion capital of the world. But the 'trend' of races was soon taken up with enthusiasm all around Europe, making these sport events catalyst of new social behaviours characteristic of the modern age. \_Today, still, ‘Race day’ is as much about the clothes as it is about the sport, and dressing up in the finest garments and luxurious accessories is a self-evident requirement if you’re aiming at blending in with the in-crowd. Yet in this double guest-curated feature for our friends at the recently renamed ‘European Fashion Heritage Association’, managing also the sister-thematic collection ‘Europeana Fashion’ on Europeana.eu, we shift the focus to the early decades of the 20thcentury, when modern horse racing was reaching its heyday.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/races.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Fashionable crowd at a racecourse in Copenhagen (Denmark), circa 1900. Léon &amp; Lévy.\_<br>\r\nRoger-Viollet / Parisienne de Photographie<br>\r\nPublic Domain</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curations will be presented on <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/introducing-the-new-tumblr-curations-fashion-at-the-races-i-ii/\">EFHA Website</a> and\_Tumblr and will run for two months, and then they will be included as co-curated galleries on the\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a>\_thematic collection. Zooming in on French fashion of the 1900s and 1910s first, then jumping ahead to the 1920s and 1930s in the UK, we follow major trends and changes on the racecourse-runways and discover through early photographic images that paddocks and stables, muddy tracks and groomed greens were among the first ever outdoor backdrops shown in fashion photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curation will start tomorrow - stay tuned and visit the\_EFHA\_<a href=\"http://eurfashion.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the Guest Curator:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sofie Taes has been working as an online curator of early photographic collections for the <a href=\"http://europeana.photography.eu\">Europeana Photography Thematic Collection</a> for several years.

        title: 'Daring Geniuses: Pierre Cardin'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/b7c2da2babd16747b4c38d05781def7d.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Overview of the Fall/Winter 1965/1966 collection of Pierre Cardin. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What made fashion become as we understand it today is a series of completely revolutionary events, carried forward by emerging but far-sighted personalities.<br>\r\nOne of the most representative of these moments is the launch in 1959 of Pierre Cardin’s first prêt-à-porter collection, which cost him the expulsion from the Chambre Syndacale de l’Haute Couture Parisienne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pietro Cardin was born in 1922 in Sant’Andrea di Barbarana, a hamlet of San Biagio di Callalta, near Treviso and Venice, in the north of Italy.<br>\r\nHe is considered both an Italian and French national fashion designer, as parents were forced to move to France in 1924 due to the poverty brought by the First World War.\_In France Cardin began his apprenticeship with a tailor in Saint-Étienne and after a brief experience, he became a tailor in Vichy; in 1945 he arrived in Paris working first for Jeanne Paquin and then for Elsa Schiaparelli. He was the first tailor of the Christian Dior maison during its opening in 1947 (after being rejected by Balenciaga) and was a participant in the success of the master who defined the New Look.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1950 Cardin founded his own fashion house, then venturing into high fashion in 1953.\_What has always characterised him was his experimental taste for avant-garde, the space age and unusual fabrics such as vinyl (at the time considered sacrilegious), or a taste that led him to prefer geometric shapes that very often did not appear follow the lines of the body and its natural movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After progressing in unisex fashion, in 1959 he opened a high fashion shop in Japan and in that year he launched a collection for the first time in the history of fashion for the Printemps department store in Paris. Since the term – and the concept as a whole – of prêt-à-porter did not yet exist, Cardin was expelled from the Chambre Syndacale for having transgressed the imposed norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierre Cardin, however, was immediately reintegrated, probably thanks to the reactions of his colleagues, who felt themselves the drive towards change, but he decided to resign in 1966; since then he showed his collections first at the “Ambassadors’ Theater” near the American Embassy, ​​later at his “Escare Cardin” headquarters opened in 1971 in Paris, where artistic talents, as performed and musicians, are still promoted today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cardin was a member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture et du Prêt-à-Porter and of the Maison du Haute Couture from 1953 to 1993; in 1994 he decided to show his creations only to a select group of selected clients and journalists.\_The first license contract in clothing between a fashion designer and a French company was signed, therefore, by Pierre Cardin, to promote a women’s ready-to-wear collection.\_This was to the advantage of the fashion designer, who in doing so could secure the production capacity, so much so that from the seventies onwards, especially in Italy, the licensing phenomenon spread more and more, until the 90s, when it began to safeguard the name of the fashion house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, Cardin stipulated more than 900 licenses and its brand arrived in over 140 countries.\_But his design philosophy was far from the productive and commercial mechanisms, as he always stated that he did not want to be a label, but a brand; this meant turning to those who shared his taste: so it was necessary to address the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the 1950s, he felt that fashion was approaching a new kind of people and had to be able to address them; fashion could now and must have been both a creative process and a business, and a man, Pierre Cardin, could play an excellent businessman and an excellent artist at the same time.<br>\r\nIt was therefore this kind of events that brought to light what is still the struggle between haute couture and prêt-à-porter, a conflict that is at the base of what is now fashion for us.<br>\r\nThe revolution brought by Cardin and followed by many other fashion designers is not just about economic strategies, but uses them to convey a message, a new – personal and commune – vision.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'A Day at the Races, pt. II: The English Gentry in the 1920s & 1930s'
        introduction: null
        body: "<p>After having wandered around the glamorous streets of Paris for last month’s guest curation - themed on the ‘promenading’ Parisian Couture of the beginning of the twentieth century - the second curation that sees PHOTOCONSORTIUM as guest-curator seems to stem from a completely different fashion universe. This time, our way-back-machine landed in England, during the 1920s and 1930s, where events such as the illustrious Ascot races were deemed “the best place in England to see beautiful women in beautiful clothes.” (The Times, 1922). While gentlemen can be spotted still wearing their traditional black waistcoats and pin-striped trousers, ladies’ fashion could not be more different from the elaborate ‘lingerie dresses’ that reigned a few decades earlier.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A striking feature of many a 1920s outfit depicted here is the low waistline, obscuring natural curves in favor of a ‘straight’, androgynous look. The big hairdos from the early 20thcentury made way for bobbed cuts, often crowned with a “cloche hat”. In the 1930s, once again, the pendulum seems to have swung to a less rigid, more feminine silhouette, inspired by the bias-cut introduced by Parisian couturiers. With fabrics now flowing along the curves of the female body, long satin gowns became all the rage. However, what stands out most in ladies’ 1930s fashion was the growing influence of day- and sportswear on occasion dress. Instead of full-length gowns, many women opted for wool suits with shoulder pads and (often pleated) knee-length skirts. Much-loved accessories were small hats, worn at an angle and decorated with feathers or flowers, as well as fur stoles and collars.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The looks spotted in these photos mirror what was happening in fashion in those years, not just in in England or Europe, but more generally in the West. The major changes in style, cut and materials responded to the new needs of a scenario that saw women more actively involved in the social life, and also more conscious of their role and also their power to ask for change.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these years designers and couturiers had already developed strategies to promote and show their collections all around the world with ad-hoc presentations in department stories and press tours that turned into spectacles, so they did not need to ‘use’ the races as a runway anymore. However, the races remained an important stage for people to present themselves to society in the way they wanted to be considered (and remembered): as modernist, traditionalist, devoted to classicism or extremely revolutionary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The monumental differences between the images presented for last month’s curation and the ones presented this month t seem to suggest a reinforcing factor was at play here. And that well could be the very different function of fashion at the horseraces in France and England respectively: while the former was clearly oriented toward (self-)promotion, public visibility and commercial/advertorial interests, the latter was more a matter of (social) codes, rules, formality and (class) distinction. The picture of the exquisitely yet exotically dressed Lady Hall, gazed after by sniggering bystanders, is a forceful reminder of what could befall women who - instead of the dress code - decided to follow their adventurous fashion sense...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The curation starts today – visit the EFHA <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu\">website</a> and\_<a href=\"http://eurfashion.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>\_to see the amazing images coming from the archive selected by the guest curator Sofie Taes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/fashion/2018-07/EU013515_TopFoto_2.jpg\"><em><strong>Lady Griffin spotted at Royal Ascot on 19 June 1924. © Topfoto.co.uk.

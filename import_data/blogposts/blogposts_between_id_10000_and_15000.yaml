        title: 'Rising interest in fashion exhibition underlines relevance of Europeana Fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>The ever-rising interest in fashion demonstrated by the\_increasing number of fashion exhibitions underlines the relevance of Europeana Fashion. Europeana Fashion embraces this growing involvement of the public and even takes it a step further</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Big showcase exhibitions\_at institutions such as the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/museum-departments/curatorial-departments/the-costume-institute\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolitian Museum of Art Costume Institute</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Les Arts Décoratifs</a> are attracting crowds in the hundred of thousands. Designer Hussein Chalayan, himself the subject of such a blockbuster exhibition,\_attributes the success of the fashion exhibition\_to the fact that\_it “reemphasizes that fashion is part of culture,” and added that, in the museum, the visitor is more free to view in the way he or she\_wishes: “you can look at the clothes as long as you like.\"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In that sense, the fashion exhibition is very similar to Europeana Fashion. Its' wealth of information on each object ties into the need to view fashion as part of our culture. Plus, viewing objects online also gives the user the liberty to study\_it for as long as he or she likes. Europeana Fashion and a fashion exhibition, in many ways, create the same experience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However,\_Europeana Fashion\_goes\_further and\_even adds to that experience. It brings its' user the luxury of hopping from the Louis Vuitton dress of Les Arts Décoratifs to the nineteenth century bracelet in the <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/\">Centraal Museum in Utrecht</a> in just a click, at any time of day and in any place in the world. Embracing and stimulating the rising fashion interest of the public, Europeana Fashion enhances the experience of fashion and gives the user more liberty than ever to study it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><em>By Gabrielle de Pooter, Communication Advisor for Europeana Fashion at MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</em></p>"

        title: 'Fashion Heritage under Discussion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Danilo Venturi -fashion and luxury consultant, author of <a href=\"http://www.luxuryhackers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">“Luxury Hackers”</a> and head of department at Polimoda- unleashed <a href=\"http://www.polimodamag.com/eternal-life-1609/\" target=\"_blank\">a hefty debate on Polimodamag.com</a> around a brand's use of its heritage, stating that brand Alexander McQueen under PPR has lost the character of its name-sake designer after his unfortunate death. Concurrently, <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2012/07/facebook-commenters-horrified-by-ysls-new-logo.html\" target=\"_blank\">the YSL logo change by Hedi Slimane elicited some vehement opposition on Facebook</a>. Obviously, heritage can be a hot and touchy topic in the online sphere.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Brands go about their heritage in different ways. While some brands reveal some of their heritage to the public and curate the content in an especially designated space (e.g. <a href=\"http://cristobalbalenciagamuseoa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cristóbal Balenciaga Museoa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gucci.com/be/worldofgucci/mosaic/the_house_of_gucci/gucci_museo\" target=\"_blank\">Gucci Museo</a>), the majority of brands keep their heritage in private archives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, whether public or private, the identity of a brand's heritage is always being reconstructed. Even a curator at a museum decides what to put on show (and what not) and a newly-appointed designer to a brand going through the archives of that brand cannot\_(and should not)\_literally replicate the brand's essence, it always has to be reinterpreted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">But with fashion’s increasing presence online, a new factor comes into the equation : the online fashion\_consumer. Now both the brand Alexander McQueen and the designer Hedi Slimane for YSL\_are under fire for allegedly losing the essence of the brand, while on the other end of the spectrum\_<a href=\"http://runway.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/02/simons-starts-triumphantly-at-dior/\" target=\"_blank\">Raf Simons is being lauded for his first Dior collection</a>, allegedly succesfully reinterpreting the brand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Whether positive or negative, the responses testify to the mass involvement of the online\_fashion consumer. It has transformed a brand's heritage from a dictated image, towards an identity that is ever in flux, endlessly chopped away at, constantly reconstructed,\_and finally a\_discourse in the online sphere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Credits image: via <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ysl\" target=\"_blank\">YSL Facebook page</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><em>By Gabrielle de Pooter, Communication Advisor for Europeana Fashion at MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</em></p>"

        title: 'When Fashion Heritage meets Contemporary Art'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Whether fashion is art is a crux that is explored time and time again. Whatever the answer might be, it is more interesting to keep on exploring than to arrive at a decisive answer anyway. Dior and Chanel have been doing so,\_mixing heritage with contemporary art and presenting it in the format of a travelling exhibition. Most notably, Chanel with <a href=\"http://www.chanel-mobileart.com/\">Chanel \_Mobile Art</a>, a giant worm-like container designed by Zaha Hadid that can touch down anywhere, but also \_Dior with <a href=\"http://www.dior.com/couture/minisite/asseenby/index.html\">Lady Dior As Seen By</a>, a travelling exhibition\_taking\_place in-store and in seperate spaces.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Key feature of both exhibitions is the involvement of contemporary artists reinterpreting an iconic object that represents the heritage of the brand. Dior had its Lady Dior bag photographed and sculpted by internationally renowned artists, and decorated by\_fashion blogger Garance Doré (video below this post). Chanel asked twenty international contemporary artists to reinterpret the iconic quilted 2.55 bag. The\_ larger-than-life Chanel bag positioned at the end of the exhibition was a show-stopper.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><img src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/chanelslide2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" /></dt><dd><strong>The Chanel Mobile Art Pavilion by Zaha Hadid. Photo: Michael Falco for The New York Times via New York Times.</strong></dd></dl></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Other than presenting an object in a museum, it seems that the temporary and mobile nature of the travelling exhibition lends the object the ephemerality of conceptual art. Moreover, the fact that the exhibition does not show any object as it is, but only reinterprets it through contemporary artists,\_ adds yet another ingredient to the fashion-art mix.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/08/01/when-fashion-heritage-meets-contemporary-art/blog-week-31-2012-chanel/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-611\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-611 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/blog-week-31-2012-chanel.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"490\" height=\"330\" /></a></dt><dd><strong>The larger-than-life Chanel 2.55 by Silvie Fleury. Image via New York Times T Magazine.</strong></dd></dl></div>\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/08/01/when-fashion-heritage-meets-contemporary-art/blog-week-31-2012-dior/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-628\"><img class=\" wp-image-628 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/blog-week-31-2012-dior.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"600\" /></a></dt><dd><strong>The classic Lady Dior reinterpreted by Kohei Nawa. Image via Fashion Trend Digest.</strong></dd></dl></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Interestingly, the nature of the format forms a stark contrast to the iconic object itself. The Lady Dior and the quilted Chanel bag are timeless, classic, rooted in place and history. The irony is that, while not present, they remain at the core of the exhibition. In the travelling exhibition, where an iconic fashion objects meets contemporary art, heritage then becomes a paradox: not present yet present, ephemeral yet timeless, classic yet reinterpreted, rooted yet mobile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Dior and Chanel have opened up yet another dimension in the fashion and art crux.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">[youtube_sc url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCNJkjsuaXU\"]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"></p>"

        title: 'New Discourses in Fashion Studies: Sustainable and Cross-Disciplinary'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.fashionprojects.org/?p=4147\" target=\"_blank\">Fashion Projects published a wonderful interview with Hazel Clark</a>, fashion scholar and initiator of the <a href=\"http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/ma-fashion-studies/\" target=\"_blank\">Parsons’ M.A. Fashion Studies program</a>.\_ For the past few years, Clark has been exploring the subject of fashion and sustainability, venturing into the fields of anthropology, sociology and psychology. In the interview, she contrasts the visual approach to fashion with a more cross-disciplinary and personal approach to the subject:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>“I think one of the issues [with fashion] is that it’s so predicated on the visual, on the image (in fashion magazines and now the internet)”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>“</em><em>Thinking about the sorts of qualities and relationships we have with our clothing goes hand in hand with acknowledging continuities and sustainability.\_ It really brings us down to a more involved, intimate level and the recognition of the individual experience, and this is being recognized in scholarship.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Europeana Fashion, as a collection of images, is firmly embedded in that visual dimension of fashion that Clark mentions. However, it also strongly responds to the need for a discourse that considers the anthropological, sociological, psychological and even personal dimensions of fashion. Thanks to the object research done by the Europeana Fashion partners,\_the object in Europeana Fashion has more to offer than a mere image.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Europeana Fashion project partner the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">V&amp;A</a>, for example, offers a wealth of information on the objects in its collection, truly making each object come alive. It was Cecil Beaton who brought in <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O120798/evening-dress-pierre-balmain/\" target=\"_blank\">this Balmain dress from Lady Gladwyn</a>, wife to the British ambassador to Paris in the 1950s. According to the diary entry the V&amp;A attached to this object, Lady Gladwyn hosted a very successful soirée in her Balmain gown. We can already imagine the dress starring among the beau monde of 1950s Paris.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even when it comes to sustainability, exploring Europeana Fashion will offer access to other ways of dressing that will make us rethink our daily fashion routine. What about this early twentieth century <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O16780/tea-gown-worth/\" target=\"_blank\">Worth tea gown</a>, a gorgeous dress to sip tea with your friends in the intimacy of your own home. One very elaborate dress just for a tea stands in stark contrast with our preferred \"functional outfits that work day-to-evening-for-any-occassion”, but it shows us that we can change the way we think about dressing ourselves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Worth tea gown or a Balmain gown. They are just a few of many objects that will respond to new discourses in fashion scholarschip.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/08/10/new-discourses-in-fashion-studies-sustainable-and-cross-disciplinary/blog-week-33-2012-worth/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-779\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-779\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/blog-week-33-2012-worth.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"600\" /></a></dt><dd><strong>Worth tea gown © Victoria and Albert Museum, London</strong></dd></dl></div>\n<em>By Gabrielle de Pooter, Communication Advisor for Europeana Fashion at MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</em>"

The exhibition will unfold several early facets of the beloved pants, which youth massively started ripping from the worker’s clothing shop shelves in the 1950s. Ever since, it has developed to become a piece available in all kinds of shapes, finishings and price ranges, worn by almost every age group and numerous subcultures. How people wear them, and how jeans are made is also to be discovered through several unique loans.\n\nThe exhibition ‘Blue Jeans’ will be open for visitors from 24 November and will last until 10 March 2013.\n\nFind out more about the Centraal Museum and the Blue Jeans exhibition <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/visit/exhibitions/Jeans/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n\n \n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/08/17/blue-jeans-at-the-centraal-museum-utrecht/blog-week-33-2012/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-823\"><img class=\" wp-image-823 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/blog-week-33-2012-1024x764.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Jeans Centraal Museum Europeana Fashion\" width=\"614\" height=\"458\" /></a></dt></dl>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>The team at Centraal Museum Utrecht preparing the Blue Jeans exhibition</strong></p>\n\n</div>"

To find out more, Europeana Fashion spoke Dr. Dana Mustata who worked on the fashion and trends exhibition on EUscreen.\_Dana holds a PhD from <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/EN/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Utrecht University</a> in the history of Romanian television and is currently teaching at the Center for Journalism and Media Studies at <a href=\"http://www.rug.nl/corporate/index\" target=\"_blank\">Groningen University</a>. Besides being an expert on media, Dana love fashion. So it was only natural she co-curated EUscreen’s online fashion exhibition.</strong></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This interview is an excerpt. You can download the full interview with many links to EUscreen material here:\_[wpfilebase tag=file id=21 /]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/08/31/fashion-and-the-moving-image-euscreens-online-fashion-exhibition/info-box-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-889\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-889\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-08/info-box1-255x288.png\" alt=\"EUscreen Europeana Fashion online fashion exhibition Dana Mustata\" width=\"255\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333333\">EF: What does EUscreen have to offer in terms of fashion?</span>\n</strong>DM: If one searches for fashion on the EUscreen portal, they will find 1451 items from 21 different countries spread across Europe. This includes videos, photographs and a more recently launched virtual exhibition. Items date back to the 1920s and 1930s until the present day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333333\">EF: Nowadays, many designers decide to stream their fashion shows live online and initiatives like <a href=\"http://showstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SHOWstudio</a> publish fashion film online. Are these initiatives part of the evolution of fashion and the moving image?</span>\n</strong>DM: The relation between television and fashion is now exploring new directions, and those very much reflect changes in the television industry. Look at Fashion TV, for instance. It started in 1997 at a time when niche channels were spreading and when audiences could choose content according to their very specific interests. Nowadays, Fashion TV presents a lot of its broadcast content on their own website. Fashion will still be present on television, primarily because it is very much part of our social life, culture and history which television constantly records. But broadcast content on fashion will proliferate to new platforms: to the online environment or the mobile phone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><span style=\"color: #333333\">EF: What do you foresee in the future for fashion and television?</span>\n</strong>DM: Fashion will still be present on television in the same ways in which it has been present until now, but changes in television technology could add new dimensions to audiovisual presentations of fashion. The switch to high definition television, to big screens or even to 3D image will enhance viewers’ experience of fashion on television. On the other hand, the spread of broadcast content in the online environment will offer new distribution outlets for fashion as well as new interactive ways of connecting to consumers, fans, fashionistas or just the casual fashion curious.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A photograph often makes a statement and fashion photographs in particular, often illustrate an attitude or a state of mind. The moving image on the other hand organizes different shots into a narrative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"color: #333333\"><strong>EF: Is there a difference between fashion in a still image and fashion in the moving image?\n</strong></span>DM: First of all, there are aesthetic differences: audiovisual images are about movement, which enhances the presentation of something as visual as fashion. The audiovisual image also works with space, sequencing and points of view, which delivers an enhanced mode of presentation. Not to mention that the moving image adds a new sensorial experience to the still image: the experience of sound.\_The two types of content also differ in how they convey meaning: a photograph often makes a statement and fashion photographs in particular, often illustrate an attitude or a state of mind. The moving image, on the other hand, organizes different shots into a narrative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span style=\"color: #333333\"><strong>EF: Are you planning on any future fashion exhibitions on EUscreen?\n</strong></span>DM: The recently launched <a href=\"http://euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html?id=fashion\" target=\"_blank\">EUscreen exhibition on fashion</a> showcases just a mere fraction of all the items on this topic, which the portal has to offer. The aim of this exhibition is to show users how audiovisual material on fashion can be used to tell a story about fashion. Therefore, we invite people interested in fashion to explore the EUscreen material on this topic and make their own exhibitions, using the exhibition-making tools developed in EUscreen, which will become available to the user by the end of September.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/10/19/the-importance-of-being-fashion-heritage-2/fo03956d-234x332/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1237\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1237\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-10/fo03956d-234x3321.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion heritage archives cultural art\" width=\"234\" height=\"332\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Fashion is really a strange topic: we have dressed \_up every day, from the beginning of human history, but we needed thousands years to understand its artistic value. Now that a rising interest in fashion has gone hand in hand with digitization and the Internet, Europeana Fashion plays a unique role.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Nowadays it is quite usual to see fashion and contemporary art walking together in innovative exhibitions.\_But it was something quite shocking and totally new in 1997 when Germano Celant, art curator, organized the first Biennale di Firenze dedicated to “Art and Fashion” and their relationship from the beginning of the last century.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">One of his most interesting critical reflections, following the Biennale, was that they serve \_in more than a way each other purposes as \_both are dealing with creativity: while fashion gets inspired with art, art learns the reproducibility from fashion.\_It’s not so difficult to understand how, since then, \_art came on catwalks and \_fashion moved from the shop window to the display case as an art piece.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In more recent years a further step has been taken to understand the importance of fashion heritage and its cultural relevance\_ not only in museal collections, but where fashion itself is created: in the fashion brands and\_ in their\_ archives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Fashion heritage has turned up to be much more than an asset of a fashion brand: it is something that deals with its own identity: Brand archives do not only keep a number of\_ documents and old clothes, they cherish the memory of the founder’s dream, they focus on \_keeping alive the identity of the brand and its values.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\_Heritage just means that fashion has got a past, a history, and if we recognize its importance in the social and economic development, we need to established highlights in this history.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In recent years an increasingly large audience has developed a growing interest in fashion content for research, learning and leisure. The digital era and the development and wide availability of new technologies have proven to be fundamental in allowing many institutions to face and solve their different conservation and access issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Moreover \_the Internet has become the principal source of information for the fashion world and industry through a wide range of websites, portals, blogs, social networks, etc. The virtual dimension has become a fundamental territory for the creation, diffusion, consumption and study of fashion, requiring a global recognition. The difficulty of collecting and studying the enormous amount of knowledge produced within the Internet has become an urgency of the contemporary study of fashion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, there is an evident lack of structured, easy searchable and reliable contents. At present, searching these digital materials is difficult and is likely to become even more complicated as digital content on fashion continues to grow in a scattered way.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In addition to disclosing\_ and showing to the largest possible audience the richness of European fashion heritage, a project about fashion heritage should work as a dictionary, it should analyse the products of fashion, to give them a name, to understand what they mean, to help understanding the differences in levels of quality and relevance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is the ambition of \_the<strong> Europeana Fashion</strong> project and its consortium, which represents the leading European institutions and collections in the fashion domain, gathered together to build a thematic fashion aggregator, while putting a strong emphasis on the quality and the granularity of data, reflecting the versatility of fashion as a medium.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Fashion is a <em>langue</em>, can you imagine what does it mean to write an <em>Encyclopédie</em> about <em>celle</em><em> langue</em>? It means acting the unique opportunity to present high quality fashion content not only to the general public, but especially to creatives, researchers, all the professionals involved in the multiform fashion domain.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1194\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-10/iris-van-herpen-escapism-no-11.jpg\" alt=\"fashion heritage archive centraal museum utrecht europeana fashion\"><em>Iris van Herpen, Escapism collection. From the collection of the Centraal Museum Utrecht. © Ernst Moritz</em></p>\n\n<strong>In<em>\_The Europeana Fashion of..\_</em>we explore the unique role of each partner in the Europeana Fashion project. In this edition, an interview with Ninke Bloemberg, fashion and costume curator at Centraal Museum Utrecht.</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>How would you describe your institution’s role in the Europeana Fashion project?\n</strong>We will provide imagery of our 9000 piece fashion and costume <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/ontdekken/object/?q=&amp;fct=logical_collections:Mode&amp;sort=richness&amp;img_only=1\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a>, which covers the history of Dutch fashion since the 17th century. The focus is on contemporary fashion though, including pieces from many national as well as international designers such as <a href=\"http://www.maisonmartinmargiela.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maison Martin Margiela</a>, Junya Watanabe and <a href=\"http://chalayan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hussein Chalayan</a>. We have the biggest <a href=\"http://www.viktor-rolf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Viktor &amp; Rolf</a> collection in the Netherlands and were the first to exhibit and collect pieces of the young Dutch designer <a href=\"http://www.irisvanherpen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Iris van Herpen</a>. An overview of fashion exhibitions as from 1906 will also be part of our contribution.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What \_aspect of Europeana Fashion are you most excited about?</strong>\nWorking with European colleagues. I am very curious to see if there are parallels between our collection and other collections of European partners, and where the main differences can be found.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What is your future vision of digitization and fashion heritage, and how can it contribute to awareness of fashion heritage?\n</strong>New generations grow up using the internet, social media and so on. I am convinced that Europeana Fashion will increase curiosity and make it easier for viewers to find a way to the physical collection. Therefore, I believe this online initiative together with the real pieces will create a synergy. It is also a perfect solution for exhibiting the often fragile textiles, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These new technologies make it possible to - for example - create your own online fashion exhibition with the European fashion treasures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>What is your favorite object in the collection and why?</strong>\nSince I am an omnivore, I appreciate historical pieces as well as contemporary designs. The white 3D printed dress of <a href=\"http://www.irisvanherpen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Iris van Herpen</a> is one of my favorites, since it combines new technologies and exploring the borders of fashion, with fabulous sculptural results.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/10/27/interview-ninke-bloemberg-costume-curatorcentraal-museum-utrecht/cm-logo-zwart/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1222\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1222\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-10/cm-logo-zwart-332x285.jpg\" alt=\"centraal museum europeana fashion ninke bloemberg iris van herpen viktor rolf\" width=\"332\" height=\"285\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"></p>"

Although costumes and textiles did not receive any special attention back then, a lace exhibition in 1967 unexpectedly turned out to be a great success.\_That success,\_together with a renewed interest in textiles in the 1970s, led to the acknowledgement of the costume collection as a separate collection and the focus shifted to collecting costume of Belgian origin.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">From that moment on, the collection came to include unique objects: silhouettes from \_fashion house Valens from Brussels and <a href=\"http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?url=article&amp;id=2029543\">atelier Roeis</a>, artifacts of Belgium’s highly developed sewing industry; a lace collection of unique size and value, including lace by Charles Frederick Worth\_ and 17th century table cloths; a collection of\_bead embroidery from the city of Lier and most recently, objects from Jacoba de Jonge’s collection of historical costume. 100 of these recently featured in the\_<em><a href=\"http://blog.momu.be/2012/exhibition/jacoba-de-jonge-before-the-opening/\">Living Fashion\_exhibition</a></em>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/11/21/the-collection-of-momu-fashion-museum-province-of-antwerp/the-collection-of02/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1314\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1314\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-11/the-collection-of02-332x308.jpg\" alt=\"momu lace costume chantilly bobbin\" width=\"332\" height=\"308\" /></a></dt><dt><strong>Silk Chantilly bobbin lace, 1850-1900. © Hugo Maertens, Bruges</strong></dt></dl></div>\n \n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/11/21/the-collection-of-momu-fashion-museum-province-of-antwerp/the-collection-of01/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1311\"><img class=\" wp-image-1311 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-11/the-collection-of01-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"momu collection costume contemporary antwerp 5\" width=\"532\" height=\"709\" /></a></dt><dt><strong>Patrick van Ommeslaeghe, autumn-winter 2000-01. © Hugo Maertens, Bruges</strong></dt></dl></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The present is also marked by an expanding collection of contemporary Belgian fashion design. Made world famous by the <a href=\"http://www.provant.be/en/binaries/6%2B%20antwerp%20fashion_LEAFLET%20PRESS_ENG_tcm10-102589.pdf\">Antwerp Six</a> in the 1980s, the success of Belgian fashion design has grown ever since. The collection of contemporary fashion was established under former director Linda Loppa.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Every Paris Fashion Week, MoMu visits the shows of Belgian designers to add new objects to the contemporary collection. MoMu also regularly receives gifts from designers and collectors. Objects are judged on technique, material, cut, the presence of the signature style of the designer, the image of the overall collection or narrative power about the wearer’s life, social position and time period.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A highlight in\_ the collection is the long-term loan from <a href=\"http://thewordmagazine.com/style/geert-bruloot/\">Geert Bruloot</a>, founder of Louis, the first Antwerp boutique for Belgian designers. The loan includes many objects by Belgian designers, but also an extensive collection of hats by British milliner <a href=\"http://www.provant.be/en/binaries/MOMU%20ENGELS%20DEFINITIEF_tcm10-148979.pdf\">Stephen Jones</a> and an <a href=\"http://blog.momu.be/2012/collection/a-trunk-of-designer-shoes/\">exclusive selection of designer shoes</a>, from the store <a href=\"http://www.coccodrillo.be/\">Coccodrillo</a>, which he up to today manages together with his partner Eddy Michiels.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">MoMu’s collection can be accessed via <a href=\"http://www.provant.be/momu/CollectionConnection/\">Open Fashion</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/11/21/the-collection-of-momu-fashion-museum-province-of-antwerp/the-collection-of04/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1326\"><img class=\" wp-image-1326   \" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-11/the-collection-of04-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"geert bruloot stephen stones momu modemuseum antwerpen hat\" width=\"383\" height=\"510\" /></a></dt><dt><strong>Stephen Jones \"London\", spring-summer 2006 © Geert Bruloot</strong></dt></dl></div>"

        title: 'Learning the Tools of the Trade in Athens'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: left\">Who ever thought fashion could be such a technical affair? Well.. it is!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">On 20 and the 21 November, an important Europeana Fashion workshop took place in the library building of the <a href=\"http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Technical University Athens (NTUA).</a> All the <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/about/\" target=\"_blank\">content partners</a> of Europeana Fashion came together to learn how to bring their collections into the Europeana Fashion Aggregator, the system that compiles all the information from the collection databases. The tools of the trade? The EDM-fp and the MINT-tool!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>The Europeana Fashion data model</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: left\"><dl><dt><a href=\"/files/fashion/2012-12/file-color_fabrics.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1390\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-12/color_fabrics-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion fashion profile edm-fp\" width=\"665\" height=\"498\" /></a></dt><dd>Fashion comes in many colours, the Europeana Fashion data model includes them all. This photo is © 2005\_kakada licensed under a CC BY 2.0 license\_</dd></dl></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">On the first day of the technical and practical sessions, partners were introduced to the Europeana Fashion data model. A data model is a structure that organises and relates all the information in a database.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">Because fashion has a unique richness of materials, techniques, creators, brands, colours etc., <strong>the special Europeana Fashion data model ensures</strong> <strong>every important piece of information on a fashion object will be represented in the portal</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">The data model used in Europeana Fashion is an extension of the data model used in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a>. This <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> has been adapted to the needs of the fashion sector, hence the name 'EDM fashion profile' or EDM-fp. This EDM-fp was produced by partner <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\">MoMu</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><strong>The MINT-tool</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: left\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/12/03/europeana-fashion-technical-workshop-in-greece-athens-edm-fp-mint-tool/p1020847-kopie/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1393\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1393\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-12/p1020847-kopie-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion mint-tool profile ntua\" width=\"665\" height=\"498\" /></a></dt><dd>Europeana Fashion content partners are learning the tools of the trade! The EDM-fp and the MINT-tool. This photo is © 2012\_Europeana Fashion 2012 \_licensed under a CC BY-NC 3.0 license</dd></dl></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">After the EDM-fp, NTUA introduced their MINT-tool. This software platform helps the partners to fit their collection data into the EDM-fp for Europeana Fashion and finally for Europeana. <strong>All partners together will ingest over</strong> <strong>700.000 objects into Europeana Fashion, so the user-friendly MINT-tool will help them get the job done</strong>!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">On the second day, \_a practical hands-on-session took place. Using the MINT-tool and the Europeana Data Model fashion profile, every partner ingested their own sample content under the guidance of the NTUA.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">So after the two studious days, partners returned home, ready to bring their collections into the Europeana Fashion portal. <strong>The first version of the portal will be available as from May 2013.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><em>This internal workshop was prepared by NTUA, Fondazione Rinascimento Digitale (FRD) and the Fashion Museum of the Provincie of Antwerp (MoMu).</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp mceIEcenter\" style=\"text-align: left\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2012/12/03/europeana-fashion-technical-workshop-in-greece-athens-edm-fp-mint-tool/p1020830-kopie/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1392\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1392\" src=\"/files/fashion/2012-12/p1020830-kopie-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion ntua edm-fp mint-tool profile\" width=\"665\" height=\"498\" /></a></dt><dd>Very studious!

Extending this role, LAD will provide to the portal fashion-related digital objects, ranging from historical dresses to contemporary garments,\_ accessories, drawings, representing the French fashion heritage. Users will benefit from the most outstanding and rich materials coming from LAD. Besides providing content, LAD will also contribute to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1416697\" target=\"_blank\">fashion thesaurus</a>, providing a French translation for the terms in the thesaurus</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What aspect of Europeana Fashion are you most excited about?</strong>\nTo make fashion heritage accessible on the Internet means that collections can be used and re-used for education and research and by the cultural heritage, leisure and creative industries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How do you think Europeana Fashion will contribute to awareness of fashion heritage?</strong>\nEuropeana Fashion will make Europe’s fashion heritage more available and usable online. Europeana Fashion will provide direct access to objects in a database fed by the digital fashion archives of 22 partners in 12 European countries.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is your future vision of digitization and fashion heritage?\n</strong>Digitization will offer fashion heritage to users wherever they are and whenever they want it.\_Mobile devices such as phones and tablet computers provide seamless access to cultural portals on the web. Sharing information and reusing data in an unlimited way is a great perspective for users that will facilitate creativity, social cohesion and the democratization of culture in general. Additionally, digital information also requires authoritative sources and high quality content.\_The Europeana Fashion aggregator facilitates knowledge transfer of huge amounts of data from trusted sources as the Europeana fashion partners represent Europe’s leading fashion institutions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is your favorite object in the LAD collection and why?\n</strong>My favorite object is a navy blue sweater by Elsa Schiaparelli, made of knitted jacquard wool,\_because of the fantasy of the “trompe l’oeil” bow.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2013/01/04/interview-emmanuelle-beuvin-documentation-les-arts-decoratifs-paris-musee-collection-mode-textile/les-arts-decoratifs-logo-cut/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1536\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1536\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-01/les-arts-decoratifs-logo-cut-665x166.png\" alt=\"les arts decoratifs musee de la mode et du textile paris europeana fashion heritage emmanuelle beuvin logo\" width=\"665\" height=\"166\" /></a></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Pucci is one of the illustrious names in the Europeana Fashion consortium of partners. At Pitti Uomo (organized by yet another Europeana Fashion partner, Pitti Immagine), Pucci celebrated the second edition of the fashion book \"Decades\", in which Emilio Pucci has an important presence.\_</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1598 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-01/img_7058-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"pitti uomo emilio pucci florence europeana fashion decades cameron silver\"><em>&quot;Decades: A Century of Fashion&quot; by Cameron Silver</em></p>\n\n \n\nThe famous brand of Florentine luxury has opened the doors of its headquarters Palazzo Pucci to Pitti 83. Guest star was Cameron Silver\_ and his <strong>“Decades: A Century in Fashion”</strong>, a lucky opus that after one month and a half has already sold more than 10.000 copies and is at its second edition.\n\nThe book tells about fashion since 1900 through formely\_<strong>unreleased pictures\_</strong>divided in decades. Each chapter starts with the two opposite most important trends of a period and ends with the most representative fashion designer of that period positioned next to one of his best creations, spiced up with his clever and lively comments.\n\nDuring the cocktail party, in an open dialogue with Laudomia Pucci, the king of L.A.’s vintage has declared his passion for Italian fashion and its importance in style choices in every decade, pointing out the presence of <strong>Emilio Pucci’s pieces</strong> inside the book.\n\nSpecial guests to the event were, among others, \_<strong>Suzy Menkes, Ferruccio Ferragamo, Raffaello Napoleone, Sibilla della Gherardesca, Cristina Morozzi, Tiziana Marchi of Polimoda, Alessandra Arezzi, Maria Luisa Frisa</strong>, and other representatives of fashion institutions in Florence.\n\n \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1597 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-01/img_7361-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"pitti uomo emilio pucci florence europeana fashion decades cameron silver  Laudomia Pucci Suzy Menkes Marchesa Cristina Pucci di Barsento\"><em>Laudomia Pucci, Suzy Menkes, Cameron Silver, Marchesa Cristina Pucci di Barsento</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1596 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-01/img_7176-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"Laudomia Pucci, Suzy Menkes, Cameron Silver, Marchesa Cristina Pucci di Barsento\"><em>The guests at the book celebration at Palazzo Pucci</em></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Thesaurus'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Today, Nacha Van Steen at Europeana Fashion partner Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels (KMKG), explains how the Fashion Thesaurus that is being developed under the guidance of KMKG will help you explore fashion in the Europeana Fashion portal.\_</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1653\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-01/ceci-nest-pas-un-robe03.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion thesaurus dictionary kmkg\"><em>What is a dress? A dress is.. a main garment for the body.. or costume. Or can it be a nightgown? Or an underdress perhaps? Image by Europeana Fashion, CC0.</em></p>\n\n \n\nWhat springs to mind when I say ‘fashion’? Exactly, an immense variety of images, clothes, shoes, magazines, lifestyle choices, as diverse and complex as your own imagination. Now imagine trying to capture all of that in words, and worse still, structure…\n\nAnd yet, that is exactly what the\_Europeana Fashion\_project has set out to do in creating a\_<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus#Thesauruses_in_IT\">thesaurus</a>\_on fashion, a reference that assembles all things fashion in a controlled, structured hierarchy, including\_<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym\">synonyms</a>\_and\_<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonym#Antonyms\">antonyms</a>. The result will be a tree-like structure with branches for every topic within the world of fashion, ready to be discovered, explored and used for research or entertainment.\n\nThe thesaurus will be used to enrich metadata (information about digitised objects) within the Europeana Fashion project and to provide <strong>high quality disclosure of fashion-related content</strong> within\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>\_itself. Moreover, the thesaurus will be made publicly available on the project’s\_own website, ready to be used by all interested.\n\nBecause it will exist as a digital reference only, it can serve as a starting point for fashion researchers, can be expanded as the need arises and will encompass the richness and complexity that the fashion industry, from creator to manufacturer to buyer and collector, has to offer.\n\n<strong>The benefits are numerous</strong>: the vocabulary is controlled, can be translated (the Europeana Fashion Project offers 10 languages!), and the information can be retrieved in a fast, complete and orderly manner. Relationships become clear, data entry is simplified and a vast amount of knowledge is gathered in a logical, structured, organised way.\n\nFor you, as a Europeana user, Europeana Fashion’s thesaurus will give you the opportunity to <strong>search for fashion-related content in each of the 10 represented languages</strong> – English, Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, Greek, Swedish and Serbian.\n\nNevertheless, creativity – the base, the building block of fashion – always comes up with new takes on existing concepts. This means that any thesaurus, especially one on fashion, will need to be looked after and updated or become outdated.\n\nThis is why <strong>we base our thesaurus on existing international standards</strong>, such as the\_<a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html\">Getty Research Institute’s Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)</a>, and we strive to add new concepts in this existing structure where possible.\n\nWe aim to provide users with a myriad of search options, to help you find what you need, to keep you informed, interested and curious, and to help the fashion domain to publish its work.\n\n<em>This blog also appeared on <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/01/capturing-imagation-europeana-fashion-thesaurus/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>.</em>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>With a degree in Historical Studies and a background in the field of education, multimedia and cultural heritage, Marco Rufino has extensive experience in cultural heritage's digitisation and access issues.</strong>\n\n<form action=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog;jsessionid=7602977C951824373778D9466EF9D3F0?p_p_id=33&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_33_struts_action=%2Fblogs%2Fedit_entry\" method=\"post\" name=\"_33_fm1\">\n<div>\n<div>\n\n \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/2fff4130-5d6f-4984-ad7d-da3ee64aa48e\" alt=\"marco rufino fondazione rinascimento digitale europeana fashion digitization\"><em>Marco Rufino, project co-ordinator for Europeana Fashion at Fondazione Rinascimento Digitale</em></p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.rinascimento-digitale.it/news-eng-europeanafashion.phtml\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/c027b312-0d3a-42e5-a629-84bb8021cec2\" alt=\"\" /></a>\n\n \n<h2>How did you get involved with Europeana Fashion?</h2>\nFlorence, where Fondazione Rinascimento Digitale is based, has a great tradition in fashion. We can say that\_<em>haute couture</em>\_in Italy was born here in 1951, when Giovanni Battista Giorgini organised the first fashion show in Palazzo Pitti in front of an international audience, making Italian fashion famous in the world. Pucci, Ferragamo, Gucci, Coveri and Cavalli started their fashion houses in Florence. Today, the fashion industry is still a big asset in the economic and cultural life of the city. So when Alessandra Arezzi and Marco Rendina came to me two years ago with <strong>the idea of gathering the major fashion archives and museums in Europe to build a fashion portal</strong> connected with Europeana, I immediately embraced the idea! And from 1 March 2012, this idea became a reality with the kick-off of the Europeana Fashion project.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/61ce17dd-7586-4b95-a19b-089488657243\" alt=\"marc jacobs europeana fashion \"><em>Marc by Marc Jacobs, Spring-Summer 2011. From the collection of Europeana Fashion partner CatwalkPictures. © CatwalkPictures/Etienne Tordoir</em></p>\n\n \n<h2>What are the goals of Europeana Fashion?</h2>\nEuropeana Fashion is a best practice network, encompassing 22 partners (3 technical partners and 19 content providers) from 12 European countries, representing the leading public and private museums, archives and libraries in the fashion domain. The ambition of this consortium is to build a thematic fashion aggregator, <strong>reflecting the versatility of fashion as a medium while putting a strong emphasis on the quality and granularity of data</strong>. The project will also build a dedicated portal, as a specialised front-end for further development of specific functions and services.\n\nOur main goal by March 2015 is <strong>to publish online through Europeana over 700,000 fashion-related digital objects</strong>, ranging from historical dresses to accessories, photographs, posters, drawings, sketches, videos, and fashion catalogues.\n\nWe are also contributing to the development of interoperability in the fashion domain by creating and promoting a common metadata schema for fashion content, based on the Europeana Data Model. To achieve interoperability on a semantic level, we are developing a multilingual Fashion Thesaurus, based on the widely adopted AAT thesaurus from the Getty Institute, enriched with fashion-related specific terms.\n<h2>What are the biggest challenges for Europeana Fashion and how are you tackling them?</h2>\nManaging a consortium of 22 partners from 12 different countries is a challenge: every partner has different technical skills and different experience levels in participating in European projects. Different languages and cultural differences don't help, but this challenge is probably the easiest to win, and in the first months of the project we have already created a very united and enthusiastic group.\n\nThe<strong> real challenges are probably about the interoperability and harmonisation of the aggregated content</strong>, coming from the different institutions in our consortium. Every content provider in the project is using its own metadata schema locally and its own classification system, describing content in its own local language. Without taking any action, the content aggregation process would result in a 'babel' of mixed data in different languages, different data structures with different description granularity and quality.\n\nIn Europeana Fashion, <strong>we decided to address this big issue by taking several actions</strong>: from the metadata structure point of view, we developed an application profile of the Europeana Data Model specialised for fashion content (EDM-fp), and we gave content providers a visual mapping tool to map their local metadata schemas to the common defined EDM-fp.\n\nFrom a semantic point of view, we defined a common multilingual fashion thesaurus that will be used to semantically enrich and classify all the aggregated content. This means users will have a multilingual access point to all the fashion content we're providing, despite the local classification scheme and the local language of the original source. We're confident that this approach will allow us to provide Europeana and the public with a rich and homogeneous fashion data set.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/4fc85e5f-41c6-4dcf-8a0e-95e2079e99dc\" alt=\"MoMu Antwerp ModeMuseum Antwerpen Europeana Fashion\"><em>Jacket in chintz, India, 1750-1800, and skirt in wool damask, Europe, 1750-1800.

The internet has become the principal source of information for the fashion world and industry through a wide range of websites, portals, blogs, social networks, etc. The virtual dimension has become fundamental territory for the creation, diffusion, consumption and study of fashion. However, there is an evident lack of structured, easily searchable and reliable content about fashion. <strong>At present, searching these materials online is difficult and it is likely to become even more complicated as digital content on fashion continues to grow in a scattered way. Our Europeana Fashion thematic portal represents an ideal answer to these issues, and not only at a European scale.</strong>\n\n<strong>All the institutions involved in our project (both public and private) agree and are in fact highly interested in keeping this initiative up and running</strong>, not only from a financial point of view but also from a content enrichment point of view. And since fashion is a popular theme online that potentially could attract a broad audience to the Europeana portal too, it was also natural that we started to explore possible ways for a long-term collaboration with the Europeana Foundation, keeping the Europeana Fashion initiative alive beyond the funding period. I hope to have the chance to tell you more about these developments in the forthcoming months.\n\n<em>This interview has also appeared on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1475656\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Professional Blog</a>.</em>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</form>"

Everything that can disclose and enhance the history and the uniqueness of our brand.\n\n<strong>What about Europeana Fashion are you most excited about?</strong>\nIt is an opportunity to dialogue and share best practices, information and know-how with the most important European institutions in the fashion domain and it is also a way to move from our local concept to an European context.\n\n<strong>How do you think Europeana Fashion will contribute to awareness of cultural heritage?</strong>\nThe idea and concept of Europeana Fashion is rather new in the fashion domain. It already exists for museums, libraries, art collections etc. but not for European fashion. I believe in the importance of this discipline as fashion is today part of a general collective system and part of Europe’s cultural profile. A serious reflection on fashion culture and history in a specialised portal had become a must.\n\n<strong>What is your future vision of digitization and fashion heritage?</strong>\nWe can only hope this will be one of the most adviced projects of its kind and that for its importance it will be able to aggregate more and more content holders and museums. That is the way for us as Europeans to come toghether as a creative industry and create a general approach to our tradition and identity.\nIf we look at new methods of learning (like MOOC.Ca) and at the importance of digital resources in tomorrow’s academics the challenge is really unique!\nWe believe that from China to Brazil passing by the Middle East the appetite for fashion is enormous and growing. This initiative can provide so much to so many!\n\n<strong>The collection of Fondazione Archivio Emilio Pucci.</strong>\nThe Fondazione Archivio Emilio Pucci, was created in 2001 by the Pucci family with the purpose of preserving, classifying, digitalizing and cataloguing the rich and diversified heritage gathered in more than 60 years of history of the Emilio Pucci Maison, comprehending more than 10.000 garments, 30.000 photographs, 3000 drawings for textiles, 20.000 textile samples, sketches, look-books, magazines. The Archive is housed in the Pucci Palace, in Florence, headquarter since 1947 of the Pucci Company, with spaces dedicated to the conservation, consultation and also to a selected permanent exhibition. Among the main purposes of the archive is spreading the knowledge of creations and work of Emilio Pucci through publications, exhibitions, didactic activities with schools and institutions connected with fashion. Since 2004 several exhibitions were also curated by the Foundation.\nBetween the projects of the Archive there is the creation of a Documentation and Training Centre at the new set of the foundation in the Family Estate at Granaiolo.\n\n<strong>A special object from our collection.</strong>\nThis look fully represents the Pucci style : the Pigiama Palazzo, one of his inventions and most typical looks in the Sixties with its idea of relaxed elegance, a mix of easy but extremely chic silhouettes, light and transparent silk organza and precious details like the “jewel” neckline embroidered in Swarovski crystals ; moreover the \"Vivara\" print , surely one of the most iconic in Emilio Pucci's entire work as it was designed in 1964 for the launch of the Vivara perfume and, since then, has been proposed in all the possible ways, particularly in this nuance that recalls Capri's Mediterranean colors and landscapes.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2013/03/19/the-europeana-fashion-of-the-emilio-pucci-foundation/logo-definitivo/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-2002\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2002\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-03/logo-definitivo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"585\" height=\"237\" /></a>"

        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">On 22 March 2013, Europeana Fashion hosted its first in a series of edit-a-thons in collaboration with Europeana Awareness, Wikimedia Sverige and partners Nordiska museet and Stockholm University Centre for Fashion Studies. Erwin Verbruggen from partner Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision reports!</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2063\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8579423695_2cd2ee0c87.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion wikimedia wikipedia edit-a-thon nordiska museet stockholm centre\"><em>Editing Wikipedia articles.

An edit-a-thon is an event during which people come together to <strong>edit and contribute new information to Wikipedia</strong>.\n\nBut when you have never before written or edited a Wikipedia article, it can be a frightening undertaking: zillions of possibilities, millions of topics, plenty of buttons and quite a few ways to get them right. An edit-a-thon helps: by bringing together volunteers from\_the Wikipedia support organisation and a crowd of people knowledgeable about a certain topic. <strong>Formerly inexperienced people can be turned into encyclopaedia writers in less than a day</strong>.\n\nAnd so everybody wins: the Wikipedia community gains much-needed helping hands and the world at large receives expanded knowledge about what it is that the edit-a-thon is about. In our case, of course, that is fashion!\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2064\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8579083173_8b4c073ba5.jpg\" alt=\"nordiska museet library fashion edit-a-thon europeana stockholm centre studies\"><em>Nordiska museet library.

The first of these edit-a-thons took place at the library of <a title=\"Nordiska Museet\" href=\"http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Nordiska museet</a>.\n\nThe museum hosts <strong>an impressive library</strong>, which made it the perfect location for the participants of our edit-a-thon. \_As Christer Larsson, Nordiska's librarian, told us, the library holds\_<a title=\"Timeline: Fashion magazines in the Nordiska museet library\" href=\"http://www.dipity.com/biblioteket/personal/\" target=\"_blank\">60 metres of fashion magazines</a>\_and is often used for research by\_<a href=\"http://www.ims.su.se/english/\" target=\"_blank\">Stockholm University's\_Centre for Fashion studies</a>,\n\nAnd so amongst these resources, our fashion expert started writing. As a source of inspiration, Europeana Fashion partners Nordiska and <a title=\"ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen\" href=\"http://www.momu.be\" target=\"_blank\">MoMu</a> made a selection of <a title=\"Europeana Fashion images on Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion\" target=\"_blank\">images available on Wikimedia Commons</a>.\_We are trying to make<strong> as much material as possible available for use and reuse on Wikimedia Commons</strong> platform, so keep an eye on the Europeana Fashion category to see this collection grow over the upcoming months.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2065\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8580183002_97ac073457.jpg\" alt=\"nordiska museet library fashion edit-a-thon europeana wikipedia wikimedia stockholm university studies\"><em>Documenting the edit-a-thon.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Professionals from the museum and fashion industry got together with bloggers, journalists and other fashion enthusiasts today to attend the first day of the Europeana International Conference. Gathered in the Cenacolo di Sant’Apollonia in Florence, they enjoyed lectures in the bemusing auditorium and exchanged on fashion under the balmy Florentine sunshine.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8656713635_c2012c23ca_z.jpg\" alt=\"Panel on Museums, Archives and Fashion\"><em>Valerie Steele, Laudomia Pucci, Mariuccia Casadio and Kaat Debo. Image used under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</em></p>\n\nThe morning focussed on <strong>how archives, whether public or private, play an important role in stimulating creativity</strong>. How can the fashion industry interact with archival materials in the future? Stefania Ricci fromMuseo Salvatore Ferragamo illustrated how archival material can inspire new designs and Raffaello Napoleone from Pitti Immagine confirmed that \"archives are places dedicated to memory that offer design inspiration.\"\n\nAnother theme that recurred was the importance of <strong>being able to access fashion archives</strong>. Valerie Steele from Museum at FIT underlined how sharing images online alleviates obstacles like time and distance. Sonnet Stanfill from the V&amp;A demonstrated how important access to archives was in preparation for her upcoming exhibition on Italian fashion. Kaat Debo from the MoMu Fashion Museum in Antwerp stressed the need to open up not only archives but also the workings of the museum in general in order to stay relevant as a museum.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8656767395_4ed84f7b47_z.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion conference florence valerie steele pucci casadio napoleone pitti\"><em>Raffaello Napoleone, Valerie Steele, Laudomia Pucci, Mariuccia Casadio. Image used under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</em></p>\n\nIn the afternoon we moved on to<strong> galleries, libraries, archives and museums and their relationship to education</strong>. Linda Loppa from Polimoda emphasized the need for a renaissance in design and how the heritage of the past is needed to build the archeology of the future. Maria Luisa Frisa from IUAV University also added the necessity of discipline in learning visual languages as an underpinning for new creative processes and imagination. Louise Wallenberg took us through the development of the fashion studies program at Stockholm University, while Adelheid Rasche showed us the treasures of the Lipperheide Costume Library. Maria Canella from the University of Milan spoke about the importance of protecting archives and at the same transforming them into an engine of communication\n\nAs the day came to and end, the crowd headed off into the sparkly Florentine night for the gala dinner hosted on behalf of Polimoda.

With the <a href=\"http://www.ashadedviewonfashionfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Shaded View on Fashion Film Festival</a>, Diane has been a catalyst in bringing the <strong>moving image to the forefront of the fashion industry</strong> that was traditionally dominated by the \"still\" photograph. Film also plays a central role at <a href=\"http://showstudio.com/#bound\" target=\"_blank\">SHOWstudio</a>. Marie Schuller, head of Fashion Film, explained how SHOWstudio revolutionized fashion film by not only showing the end-product, but also <strong>the creative process that precedes the final image</strong>.\n\n[youtube_sc url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuxwG19P5ec\"]\n\nCreative processes in new media are of a specifically collaborative nature. Gabriele Monti from the <a href=\"http://www.iuav.it/English-Ve/About-Iuav/Iuav-profi/\" target=\"_blank\">IAUV University of Venice</a> illustrated how the internet is a place where <strong>platforms have developed that show the work of fashion students</strong> and how fashion students do not just share material online to show their individual work, but exchange on it with others. Geer Oskam of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Foundation</a>\_demonstrated how new media can also be used to engage and exchange with new audiences.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-04/8660404362_558f6e645a_z.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion conference florence new media diane pernet showstudio marie schuller london school of fashion agnes rocamora marco pecorari geer oskam anja aronowsky cronberg vestoj gabriele monti\"><em>Gabriele Monti, Anja Aronowsky Cronberg, Geer Oskam.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"> In the month of May, <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\" target=\"_blank\">MoMu</a> curator Karen Van Godtsenhoven is taking over the <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a>. With MoMu currently amidst preperations of the \_exhibition around the anniversary of the renown Antwerp Fashion Academy, the curation of the Tumblr is inspired by Karen's research.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2434\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/screenshot-tumblr-665x315.png\" alt=\"antwerp six walter van beirendonck marina yee dries van noten martin margiela ann demeulemeester dirk bikkembergs dirk van saene\"><em>Screenshot of the Tumblr with a sketch by Marina Yee, a silhouette by Walter Van Beirendonck, the Antwerp Six and a graduate silhouette by Walter Van Beirendonck. Images : all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n \n\n<strong>EF: You are currently preparing the upcoming exhibition, “Happy Birthday Dear Academy”, can you shortly tell us a little bit about this exhibition?</strong>\nKVG: This exhibition is part of a bigger project about the 350th birthday of the Royal Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts. This anniversary is celebrated with multiple exhibitions throughout Antwerp from September onwards. You can check the project's website at <a href=\"http://www.happybirthdaydearacademy.be/new/\" target=\"_blank\">www.happybirthdaydearacademy.be</a> for the full programme. The whole project is curated by Walter Van Beirendonck, head of the fashion department.\n\nThe fashion department exists 50 years and gets a <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en/exhibitions/upcoming/\" target=\"_blank\">Momu exhibition</a> showcasing work of the students of the fashion department. Through graduation silhouettes, drawings and film , the exhibition will trace the evolution of the academy during 50 years. From a small department under Mary Prijot, over the breakthrough of the Antwerp Six and Martin Margiela over the next generations of designers under the direction of Linda Loppa and Walter Van Beirendonck, the fashion department of the Antwerp academy has grown into an institution of international acclaim with more than 40 nationalities of students. The artistic principles of the teaching methods and the results (careers) will get the spotlight in this intense and wonderful exhibition.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-2436  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/tumblr_mm41wohhg11s0n7o6o1_1280-665x964.jpg\" alt=\"antwerp fashion academy royal department exhibition 50 year anniversary academie europeana fashion momu\"><em>Poster of the upcoming exhibition at MoMu. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<strong>EF: The academy has been around for 50 years. MoMu was founded 10 years ago. What role does MoMu play in preservering and researching the history of the fashion academy?</strong>\nKVG: Most 'Belgian' designers MoMu collects, come from this school. Many designers are not Belgian by birth, but are labeled Belgian because of their education in Antwerp. Their silhouettes and collections are the primary focus of MoMu's collection and exhibition policy. The success of the Antwerp school is also responsible for MoMu's 10 year existence, so the two are very interrelated. We are now also collecting the graduation silhouettes from the most important Antwerp trained designers for our archives. MoMu also gives an award each year to the student with the most artistic merit, whose silhouettes we showcase in our gallery.\n\n<strong>EF: You are currently curating our Europeana Fashion Tumblr. What will you be showing on the Tumblr this month and how does it connect to the upcoming exhibition?</strong>\nKVG: It connects through my research of the graduates' collections for the exhibition. Each week I will post some graduation images from a different decade, starting with those of the Antwerp Six and Martin Margiela, followed by the student generations of the nineties and noughties. Not all of them are in the exhibition because they didn't survive time, but I think they are worthwhile to be seen in the virtual world. The evolution of the work will hopefully tell a little bit of the story of 50 years of Antwerp fashion.\n\nGo to:\_<a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/</a>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-2435 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/tumblr_mm5xeejar31s0n7o6o1_1280-665x424.jpg\" alt=\"antwerp six marina yee dries van noten ann demeulemeester walter van beirendonck dries van noten martin margiela momu europeana fashion\"><em>Photograph by Karel Fonteyne.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"> On Monday, May 13th, Europeana Fashion is organizing its second edit-a-thon. We wrote <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2013/04/04/europeana-fashion-edit-a-thon-nordiska-museet-sweden-wikimedia-wikipedia/\" target=\"_blank\">before</a>\_about how at Nordiska Museet in Stockholm, we gathered almost 50 fashion students to enrich Wikipedia with articles about fashion history. This time, we’re bringing together enthusiasts, curators and Wikipedians to gather their fashion knowledge and bring it to the world’s best known source of information. The event will take place at Europeana Fashion partner Centraal Museum in Utrecht.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2448\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/800px-centraal_museum-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"centraal museum utrecht europeana fashion edit-a-thon\"><em>Centraal Museum Utrecht. Image used under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license.</em></p>\n\n<a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Centraal Museum</a> owns the 50.000-piece collection of the city of Utrecht among which are pieces of design, paintings and: pieces of fashion. Its costumes span over three centuries, covering the development of the silhouette from circa 1750 until the most intriguing works of today’s fashion designers. Their recent exhibition on Blue jeans that closed in March of this year explored the garment in all its detail - from its earliest traces to contemporary fashion’s love for denim. The other Europeana Fashion partner organizing this event is <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Sound and Vision</a>, the broadcast archive of the Netherlands, that will bring broadcast content about fashion events to the Europeana Fashion’s portal.\n\nAlso joining the event is the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ModeMuze?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">ModeMuze project</a> - a national project still in progress, started by curators from seven Dutch museums who saw the large benefits of putting online their rich but fragile costume collections.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2459\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/kolder_ca._1660-1670.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion kolder coat edit-a-thon centraal museum utrecht \"><em>This is one of the images Centraal Museum has made available on Wikimedia for the edit-a-thon.

Another activity they undertake is developing Wikimedia Commons, a vast repository of media that can be used freely for educational or other purposes. You can find the reusable images from Europeana Fashion’s project <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> - why don’t you dig in and see what you could use for an encyclopedic article... right now?\n\nIt is our conviction that Wikipedia is a wonderful place to bring fashion knowledge to, as it is the go-to information source for the world and is still lacking information that approaches fashion as a fundamental component of our culture. By bringing together fashion experts, from bloggers to curators, with the Wikipedia community at various physical events, we hope to spark an online relationship that expands our understanding and the readily available knowledge of the fashion domain.\n\nIf you want to join us on Monday, you can:\n\n1. still sign up on <a href=\"https://wikifashion-nl.eventbrite.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eventbrite</a> and join us in Utrecht or\n2. write from home! <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is a good article about getting started with wikipedia and <a href=\"https://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana_Fashion_Editathon\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> you can add any articles you write throughout the day"

In essence, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_run_an_edit-a-thon\" target=\"_blank\">edit-a-thon</a>, is an event during which <strong>people come together to edit and contribute new information to Wikipedia</strong>.</p>\nThe day started with a warm welcome and a delicious breakfast served by Centraal Museum. After \_a round of introductions, Hay and Sandra from \_<a href=\"http://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hoofdpagina\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Netherlands</a> \_gave a crash course about editing on the global cooperative encyclopedia. Did you know Wikipedia is the fifth most used website in the world? It makes <strong>correct and rich fashion information on the largest online encyclopedia all the more important</strong>. And the best way to ensure correctness on Wikipedia is to dive in and edit it yourself!\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/8734300169_406667a0aa_z.jpg\" alt=\"Europeana Fashion Editathon, Centraal Museum Utrecht\"><em>Meeting the fashion community.

We had attendees from museums, like the <a href=\"http://www.amsterdammuseum.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">Amsterdam Museum</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.friesmuseum.nl/?language=en\">Fries Museum</a>; from fashion projects, like <a href=\"http://infashionutrecht.nl/\">In-Fashion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ModeMuze\">ModeMuze</a>; from fashion association <a href=\"http://kostuumvereniging.nl/\">The Dutch Costume Society</a> and from <a href=\"http://www.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/\">The New Institute</a>. We also welcomed journalists, writers, students and even people who are <strong>not necessarily active in the field, but have a great personal interest in fashion.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/8735418210_09819fbe0d_z.jpg\" alt=\"Europeana Fashion Editathon, Centraal Museum Utrecht\"><em>Tour of the Centraal Museum.

The tour included the<strong> most essential pieces of the collection</strong>, such as a seventeenth century \_<a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolder_(vest)\">kolder</a> (a type of jacket) that is still in perfect condition.

They are shown side by side, thus forming an interesting and beautiful view on the way Dutch designers approach fashion. It also shows the new way of thinking about fashion at Dutch museums. Fashion is not just approached historically, but in a dynamic way that also acknowledges <strong>fashion as an art form and as a cultural expression. \_Through the Europeana Fashion edit-a-thons we aim to promote a varied approach to fashion on Wikipedia as well.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-05/8733948335_e1a679d3e9_z.jpg\" alt=\"Europeana Fashion Edithathon, Centraal Museum\"><em>Photo: Sebastiaan ter Burg.

        title: 'Exhibition:"Oh, Those Shoes!"'
        introduction: ''
        body: 'The one hundred pairs of women’s footwear date from the period between 1830 and 1918 and they trace the process of transformation undergone by the dress of the Serbian bourgeois class during the 19<sup>th</sup> century on its way from traditional Oriental dress towards European fashions. The first footwear items in the museum were slippers, <em>mestve</em> and bath clogs. In 1957, they were joined by walking boots and satin evening shoes. Footwear reflects a plethora of phenomena that shape each epoch. The exhibition comprises the two last centuries in Serbia’s history: from the end of Ottoman times until it ceased to be a part of the Yugoslav community of nations. Footwear also reflects the huge technological progress which made possible mass fashion production. The exhibited pieces of women’s footwear offer aesthetic pleasure and bear witness to the constant change in fashion and the concepts of elegance, luxury, comfort … femininity and sex appeal.'

        title: 'Pucci "Prince of Prints" on our Tumblr'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">In June, Europeana Fashion partner the Emilio Pucci Archive curates our Tumblr, infusing it with the iconic colours and prints of the classic Italian house. Alessandra Arezzi Boza, the archive's curator, tells us more.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-2619 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/wed-1-0237-332x220.jpg\" alt=\"pucci emilio archivio archive foundation europeana fashion\"><em>Emilio Pucci known as “Prince of Prints” always used colours as the signature of his style. © Emilio Pucci Archive</em></p>\n\n<strong>EF: How would you describe the legacy of Emilio Pucci to the fashion world?\n</strong>AAB: I will start with a quote by Vanessa Friedman: \"It is about innovation: Pucci was not only the first real Italian ready-to-wear brand, but also one of the first to bear a logo, to diversify into other design areas such as interiors and sportswear, to exploit technology, and to create fabrics that could be tossed into a handbag for ease of travel.” (<a href=\"http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/fashion/all/00372/facts.emilio_pucci.htm\" target=\"_blank\">from Pucci by Vanessa Friedman, Taschen</a>)\n\nAs everybody knows, Emilio Pucci was a ski instructor when he created his first outfit, a very comfortable ski jumpsuit that went into production. In 1957 he made his first iconic collection inspired by the Palio race in Siena, that was an <em>esploit</em> of chromatic fancies and became his declaration of intents. The perfect connection between joyful prints, charged palettes and soft shapes able to underline women silhouettes, is the magic mix for success of Emilio Pucci.\n\nBeing faithful to sportswear without ever losing his elegance has carried him to become one of the most beloved designers of the jet-set. Starting with icons like Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor, Greta Garbo and Jackie Kennedy, till modern stars like Madonna and Nicole Kidman: everybody has always been crazy for Emilio of Capri.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2622\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/thurs-1-665x943.jpg\" alt=\"emilio pucci archive archivio foundation self portrait fashion europeana\"><em>A self-portrait sketched by Emilio Pucci. © Emilio Pucci Archive</em></p>\n\n<strong>EF: What role does the Emilio Pucci Archive play in preserving the heritage of Emilio Pucci?\n</strong>AAB: The Emilio Pucci Archive was created in 2001 by the Pucci family with the purpose of preserving, digitalizing and cataloguing the rich and diversified heritage comprehending all the creations gathered in more than 60 years of history of the Emilio Pucci Maison. The Archive is housed in the Pucci Palace, in Florence, headquarter to the Pucci Maison since 1947, with spaces dedicated to conservation, consultation and also to selected permanent exhibitions.\n\nThe main \_purpose of the archive is spreading the knowledge of the creations and work of Emilio Pucci through publications, exhibitions, didactic activities with schools and institutions connected with fashion, while also being a source of inspiration and documentation for the brand’s creative and communication staff.\n\nSince 2004 several exhibitions, events and publications were curated by the Foundation. One of the projects of the Emilio Pucci Archive in the following months, is the \_creation of a Documentation and Training Centre in the new spaces, completely restored and \_dedicated to the Foundation's activities and \_purposes, at the Villa di Granaiolo near Florence.\n\n<strong>EF:\_What will you be showing on the Tumblr this month?\n</strong>AAB: The wonderful world of Emilio Pucci’s prints and colours, hints of Pucci’s inspiring themes and some little precious highlights from the Archive’s wardrobes. For this special occasion we are going to disclose for the first time some of the treasures of the Archive. It is meant to be just a first preview of all the beautiful and inspiring contents that will be soon available through the Europeana Fashion portal.\n\nVisit our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a>."

        title: 'Tribute to Schiaparelli: SCHIAP SHOCK by MUDE'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">The revival of the house of Schiaparelli has inspired Europeana Fashion partner MUDE to share with the public the Schiaperelli designs from its collection. In this blog, MUDE tells us about the legendary house and gives a behind-the-scenes look of the set-up of the exhibition.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2679\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/ximg_0143-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"schiaparelli mude elsa christian lacroix mude europeana fashion\"><em>From left to right: white dress, ca. 1950; bolero Les Chevaux du Cirque with Maison Lesage embroidery, 1938; dress and coat, 1937; coat, tunic and skirt by Christian Lacroix, 1991.\_\_© Museu do Design e da Moda</em></p>\n\nElsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973) or Schiap, as she liked to be called, was born in Rome. She bound fashion and art together, collaborating with artists such as Jean Cocteau, Francis Picabia, Man Ray and Salvador Dali. In her witty creations inspired by Surrealism, <strong>humor and fantasy come together in sophisticated <em>couture</em>.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2678\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/ximg_0115-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"schiaparelli mude elsa christian lacroix mude europeana fashion\"><em>Bustle skirt in silk tartan, 1948.\_\_© Museu do Design e da Moda</em></p>\n\n<strong>Schiaparelli was a pioneer</strong>: she introduced shorts in women’s clothing; visible zips used in <em>couture</em>, hitherto confined to underwear; promoted fashion shows; created fragrances commercialized in packages that were true art work; joined the beautiful with the bizarre; made the shocking pink and the <em>trompe l'oeil</em> iconic.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2676\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/ximg_0095-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"schiaparelli mude elsa christian lacroix mude europeana fashion\"><em>Evening hat in silk with beads, ca. 1930.\_\_© Museu do Design e da Moda</em></p>\n\nIn the 1950s, due to the post-war austerity, Schiaparelli closed her Parisian fashion house. Nevertheless, <strong>her work remains today as visionary and singular as ever. In 2012, the name of Schiaparelli was everywhere</strong>: more than fifty years after the closing of her house, the reopening of <em>maison </em>Schiaparelli was announced by the Italian businessman Diego Della Valle; the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York presented the hottest show of the year, <em>Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible</em> <em>Conversations</em>, which put in (imaginary) dialogue the two Italian designers from different generations - Elsa Schiaparelli and Miuccia Prada.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2674\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-06/ximg_0073-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"schiaparelli mude elsa christian lacroix mude europeana fashion\"><em>From left to right: dress and coat, 1937; bolero Les Chevaux du Cirque with Maison Lesage embroidery, 1938; coat, tunic and skirt in wool crepe, 1991 by Christian Lacroix.\_\_© Museu do Design e da Moda</em></p>\n\nFrench designer <strong>Christian Lacroix (Arles, 1951) was elected to design the first couture collection of the renewed Schiaparelli</strong>, sharing with the Italian designer the sense of humor and boldness. About this challenge, Lacroix said:<em> \"Elsa is a sacred sphinx who will never cease to make us question things, all the while offering new puzzles by way of answers. My wish is to reinstate her at the centre of her fashion house and on the stage through which she seduced the world. \"</em>\n\n<strong>To evoke the relaunch of the Schiaparelli brand, <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/en/mude_site.html\" target=\"_blank\">MUDE</a> wants share with the public the pieces designed by Schiap that are part of MUDE’s Collection.</strong>\n\n<strong>The <a href=\"http://www.schiaparelli.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">house of Schiaparell</a>i will present 15 unique pieces created by Christian Lacroix paying homage to the Schiap legend in July 2013.

        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Europeana, our partner in the Europeana network, might be facing a drastic budget cut from 2015 onwards. We cannot afford to lose a service that connects Europe with its shared history and heritage. Europeana offers 27 million freely and openly available objects in one online portal. Support Europeana by participating in the #AllezCulture campaign. Read on to find out how.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2815\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-07/7f8e434fa1aae66f0fff5b33b2f9.jpg\" alt=\"allezculture europeana fashion portal support gown illustration\"><em>Europeana already includes a selection of fashion-related material, such as this illustration. A woman wearing a fashionable gown and a hat with feathers in it, she is carrying an eyeglass and a fur stole. Wellcome Library, London. Image used under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license.</em></p>\n\nWhy are we asking for your help? Because the budget under which Europeana was to be funded from 2015 onwards has been slashed<strong> from 9 billion euros to 1 billion</strong>. Europeana is still in the running but is now in direct competition with health, justice and safer internet programmes. If it loses the funding, much of the hard work put in will be wasted.\n\nEuropeana works with galleries, libraries, archives and museums in every European country to make knowledge and culture available online. It connects everyone in Europe with their shared history and heritage – <strong>27 million books, pictures, films and recordings</strong> so far.\n\nWith its partners across Europe, it is pioneering <strong>new ways to engage people in culture</strong> through websites, apps, software and social media, through sharing its expertise, business models and code, and through services for education and tourism. Europe needs this innovation – there’s faster progress in the digital sector than most other areas of the economy.\n\nAs Europeana Fashion, we cannot stress enough the connections between fashion, culture and the economy. <strong>Fashion is both a commodity and a cultural expression</strong>. Fashion draws inspiration from culture, is culture and creates new cultures, and at the same time is one of the world's largest industries.\n\nSupporting Europeana is supporting Europe. <strong>None of us can afford to lose a service that is both good for people and good for the economy</strong>.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">One of the objectives of Europeana Fashion portal is digitally disclosing the outstanding fashion-and costume collections of our partners. Due to the sensitivity and fragility of textiles, display of the collection in the physical world is always limited. Many objects are carefully preserved behind the scenes in a special storage area. Partner Museo del Traje in Madrid shows us around this rarely seen part of the museum where the actual preservation of fashion heritage takes place on a daily basis.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2880\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-07/storage-area-traje-1-665x446.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion museo del traje blog storage area depot preservation conservation museum madrid costume\"><em>Museo del Traje staff carefully handle its collection © Museo del Traje. CIPE. Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte\_</em></p>\n\nTextiles are fragile materials. Our storage area is organized depending on the nature of the materials of each collection. Many costumes are already protected in<strong> individual acid-free cotton bags, made-to-measure</strong> by our personnel, and we keep on producing these bags in order to store the whole collection.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2884\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-07/storage-area-traje-5-665x441.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion museo del traje blog storage area depot preservation conservation museum madrid costume\"><em>The museum&#039;s staff makes these acid-free cotton bags made-to-measure for each garment © Museo del Traje.

Therefore, each bag has the garment number sewn in the outside, a small cut-out window protected with a semi-transparent acid-free fabric and a pocket in which we tuck a picture. This way we can identify the costume easily without opening the bag.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-2886\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-07/storage-area-traje-7-665x923.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion museo del traje blog storage area depot preservation conservation museum madrid costume\"><em>More fragile or larger pieces like this dress \_are kept in these special boxes © Museo del Traje.

Missoni quickly grew into one of the most famous Italian fashion brands, receiving raging reviews from the likes of Diana Vreeland and Maria Pezzi. Since then, the Missoni family has developed the house into a<strong> true lifestyle brand</strong>, extending the Missoni aesthetic beyond clothing and into interior design and hotels.\n\nThe Missoni aesthetic is unmistakble, it combines a mix of zigzag motifs, stripes, waves and slub yarns in a patchwork of geometric and floral jacquard. Over the decades, the Missoni family has been continuously <strong>developing and reinventing this aesthetic</strong> through technology and craftmanship.\n\nMissoni's contribition to Europeana Fashion, as a living brand, combines cultural heritage with contemporary fashion. It highlights the\_dynamic relationship between culture and the fashion business and<strong> illustrates the importance of fashion heritage to a brand</strong>. Missoni's fashion heritage is kept in the Archivio Missoni and will be revealed on the <a title=\"Europeana Fashion Tumblr\" href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr this month</a>.\n\nVisit Missoni on <a title=\"Missoni Facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missoni\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a title=\"Missoni Google+\" href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/109529259412937532067/posts\" target=\"_blank\">Google+</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Missoni\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/missoniofficial\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://instagram.com/missoni\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and on <a href=\"http://missoni.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">its own Tumblr</a> featuring the Missoni lifestyle."

This may point to the garment’s royal origins, as the Cérémonial de l’Empire Français from 1805 states that all ladies granted access to the court wear a garment of the same form as that of the Empress and that, if the ladies choose to have an embroidered border, this may not exceed one decimetre in width.\n\nDiscover this <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/ontdekken/object/?q=manteau&amp;img_only=1#o:16476\" target=\"_blank\">court train in the Centraal Museum</a> collection or explore the imperial style of the Bonaparte's in a<a href=\"http://www.chateau-malmaison.fr/en\" target=\"_blank\"> virtual visit to Château de Malmaison</a>, a former residence of Josephine and Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nWritten by Ninke Bloemberg\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3052\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-08/manteau-de-cour-detail-665x524.jpg\" alt=\"manteau de cour court train centraal museum utrecht cmu bonaparte napoleon josephine hortense 19th century french europeana fashion\"><em>Detail of manteau de cour, c. 1810.

Wedding dress of Danica Paligorić kept in the collection of the Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade.</em></p>\n\nMarriage is <strong>an important fact in human life and accompanied by many rituals</strong>, most of which have a religious significance and cultural expectations, aiming to ensure the happiness of the newlyweds. Generally, marriage is preceded by the engagement period, which is dedicated to the promise of a happy marriage. Wedding ceremonies used to take \_place on Sunday (until late 1980s where the wedding day often became Saturday), but preparations begin several months, if not years, before.\n\nEspecially, the\_<strong>wedding outfit has special significance for the bride</strong> and it is probably the most important garment a woman could ever wear. As it is chosen for such an important occasion it reflects the bride’s family wealth and social status, the change of technology, the shifts in the economy and also the fashion of the moment. It is usually made of delicate materials, finer fabrics, lace, jewels and has more exquisite workmanship than can be found in other dresses.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.mpu.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Applied Art Belgrade</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.pli.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation</a>'s <strong>bridal costume collections reflect a wide social range</strong>, from high society wedding gowns to simpler village wedding outfits. Most of them are donation from the wearer or their relatives whom often provide information about the wearer, whom she married, the date and the place of the marriage, the provenance, the maker. Original photographs were also given that show how the dresses were worn and accesorised. Although a lot of women chose to preserve their wedding dresses others altered them to evening style gowns.\n\n<a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visit our Tumblr to discover these exquisite collections</a>.\n\nBy Draginja Maskareli and Angeliki Roumelioti"

        title: 'You Can Look and You Can Touch Too'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Fashion is highly visual . Naturally, so are fashion exhibitions, where we can always look, but usually cannot touch. There is good reason not to touch though, garments are highly sensitive and museums do their utmost best to conserve them. \_But is fashion not more than just the visual and what if you are visually impaired? Our partner Museo del Traje is creating an area where you cannot just look, but also touch.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3300\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-10/traje-sensorial-area-5-665x410.jpg\" alt=\"museo del traje madrid spain europeana fashion sensorial area\"><em>© Museo del Traje. CIPE</em></p>\n\nOne of the main goals of <a href=\"http://museodeltraje.mcu.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Museo del Traje</a> –as of all the national museums of the Spanish Ministry of Education and Culture- is to <strong>communicate its collections to the widest possible public</strong>.\n\nNevertheless, <strong>garments have to be exhibited in particular conditions</strong> as textile is very sensitive to light, air and humidity. Therefore, the museum changes the garments in its permanent exhibition every few years and makes sure that all support materials are acid-free. To make the representation as accurate as possible, the museum also creates its own mannequins, which are made to measure for each historic outfit. They are also shaped and painted in such a way that once the garment is put on the mannequins virtually dissappear.\n\nThese conditions might make it difficult for people with perception problems to fully appreciate them though. That is why Museo del Traje is creating<strong> a special sensorial area where visitors may touch the garments,</strong>\_to perfectly complement the experience in the permanent exhibition and the educational area. The sensorial area displays mannequins with replicas of the highlights displayed in the permanent exhibition. With an audio tour that develops each garment in full detail, visitors can hear and touch at the same time.\n\nThe sensorial area will allow visitors to trace the evolution of male and female garments and changing silhouettes over time. There will also be a \"textile library\" giving the visitors an overview of fibres and fabrics as well as a chance to experience tools that have been used throughout history for the making of costume.\n\nThe sensorial area will be opened in 2014 and will be accessible to all visitors of the museum.\n\n \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3303\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-10/traje-sensorial-area-8-665x441.jpg\" alt=\"museo del traje madrid spain europeana fashion sensorial area\"><em>© Museo del Traje.

The<strong> princess dress</strong> was worn with a busk and reflects the style of the day. It has no horizontal waist seam, but uses vertical tucks to fit closely to the upper part of body.\n\nThe conservation process consisted of <strong>taking the dress apart, mechanical cleaning, washing, drying, conservation of damaged areas, sewing the dress back to its original form</strong> and its preparation for the exhibition. The conservation was conducted by the museum conservator Marija Labudović, with the professional and practical help provided by the Ethnografic Museum, Belgrade and The Central Institute for Conservation, Belgrade.\n\nThe wedding dress was on display at the museum exhibition <a href=\"http://www.mpu.rs/srpski/temporary/izlozbe_2011/11_vencanice/catalogue.pdf\">“Wedding Dresses in Serbia in the Second Half of the 19th and at the Beginning of the 20th Centuries, from the Collection of the Museum of Applied Art”</a>, curated by Draginja Maskareli, between September 22 and December 31, 2011.\n\n<a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more about bridal costume from the Museum of Applied Art and the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation \_on our Tumblr.</a>\n\n \n\n \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3130\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/02ataking_the_dress_apart-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Taking the dress apart. © Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3131\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/04aconservation_of_the_damaged_areas-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Conservation of the damaged areas. © Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3139\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/05sawing_back_to_the_original_form-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sewing the dress back to its original form. © Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3128\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/07aon_display.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The wedding dress on display after conservation.

        title: 'Belgium Momentum: Third Fashion Edit-a-thon at the MoMu Fashion Museum in Antwerp.'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><strong>On a humid September day, fashion enthousiasts, Wikipedians, archivists and students met at MoMu – Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp in Belgium to improve and expand fashion knowledge on Wikipedia.</strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><em>Edit-a-thon report by Gregory Markus, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</em>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/9915495094_463c6582a0_z_3.jpg?itok=bN7hO3MJ\" alt=\"\"><em>The books come out: Photo: Christin and Monica Ho, Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event was co-organised by Europeana Fashion partner MoMu and Wikimedia Netherlands. It marks the <strong>third Europeana Fashion edit-a-thon</strong> and the first one with an actual theme, which was <strong>Belgian fashion</strong>. After a meet-and-greet breakfast, the morning started with a brief introduction on <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\">MoMu’s collections</a> and how it contributes to Europeana Fashion by Gabriëlle de Pooter. Romaine from Wikimedia Belgium then gave a detailed overview of the world of Wikipedia. After these introductions, it was time to write!</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/9915510463_5d0b6d3393_z.jpg?itok=FwVrInWk\" alt=\"\"><em>Introduction time. Photo: Christin and Monica Ho, Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://www.ffi.be/‎\" title=\"Fashion News &amp; Events\" target=\"_blank\">Flemish Fashion Institute (FFI)</a> and researcher Sarah Heynssens had prepared a helpful<a href=\"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/MoMu_Fashion_edit-a-thon_2013/Onderwerpsuggesties\"> list of Belgian Fashion topics</a> that deserve more attention on the Dutch-language Wikipedia. The list included names of Belgian fashion designers, brands, organizations, and jewelers. It was extensive. With <strong>more names than I expected and with names that I had certainly never seen before</strong>. But others knew right away which articles they wanted to edit or create and the MoMu library was more than prepared. When I asked the librarian  for a specific old copy of Elle Magazine I didn’t think there was any possibility of her having it. Five minutes later she returned from the library, copy in hand, so fresh and crisp it appeared as if it had just come off the newsstand.</p>\n<h2>Touring the Antwerp Fashion Museum</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The extensiveness of the list and available resources served as a testament to MoMu’s, Antwerp’s and Belgium’s fashion history. This wealth of knowledge and depth of expertise became more apparent during the tour of the school’s <a href=\"http://www.happybirthdaydearacademie.be/new/eng/page/50-years-fashion-department-\" title=\" 50 years Fashion department\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Birthday Dear Academie-50 years Fashion Department”</a> exhibition. A perk of participating in the edit-a-thon.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/9915556004_234b2c0f2c_z_1.jpg?itok=NQMCVDid\" alt=\"\"><em>All graduates&#039; names from the past 50 years. Photo: Christin and Monica Ho, Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibition begins with a timeline that lines  the building’s main stairwell. Visitors can see the school’s  incredible development and progression in the timeline as they make their way up the stairs; from Mary Prijot’s classical, subdued approach and the subsequent silhouettes students created to Linda Loppa encouraging for students to be individualistic and avant-garde. These changes become even more apparent inside the exhibition itself, which showcases pieces from decades of graduates. The works range from subdued colors and silhouette to avant-garde and aggressive, <strong>showcasing the </strong><strong>diversity and individualism of the students as well as the influence their professors had</strong><strong> on them</strong>. However, the underlying themes are never lost and the collections are harmonious and inspiring.</p>\n<h2>Pinning down the <em>Antwerp 6</em> (+ 1)</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A large section is dedicated to the “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp_Six\">Antwerp 6</a>”. For those who do not know, the Antwerp 6 (+1, in fact) were a group of students from 1980-1982 who chose to rebel against the pedagogical vision of Mary Prijot. The 6 +1 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Demeulemeester\">Ann Demeulemeester</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dries_Van_Noten\">Dries Van Noten</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Van_Beirendonck\">Walter Van Beirendonck</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Yee\">Marina Yee</a>, <a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Van_Saene\">Dirk Van Saene</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Bikkembergs\">Dirk Bikkembergs</a>—and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Margiela\">Martin Margiela</a>) were inspired by the punk scene and inspired one another to push themselves and fashion boundaries. After much struggle due to the fact that they were from Antwerp, <strong>not exactly a fashion Mecca at that time</strong>, the 6 +1 went on to great international success and are still regarded as the individuals who put Antwerp on the fashion map.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-09/9915441415_be16b599ec_z_1.jpg?itok=DCgSVXKq\" alt=\"\"><em>The home stretch. Photo: Christin and Monica Ho, Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the tour it was up to us to put Belgian fashion on the Wiki map. Inspired by the tour we went back to work finishing up our articles, editing, and uploading. With the wealth of information available in the library we could have stayed all night but alas time was up. Many participants noted that they wanted to add more to their articles and planned on finishing up at home or the next day. <strong>Sometimes things take time.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Belgian fashion scene was not built in one day. It took years of hard work, devotion, pride and rule breaking for Antwerp to make a name for itself in the fashion world. And today it stands near the top. While not all topics were covered during the edit-a-thon (the <a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/MoMu_Fashion_edit-a-thon_2013/Onderwerpsuggesties\">list</a>  was four pages long), Europeana Fashion successfully made a dent thanks to MoMu’s incredible library,  the patient tutelage of our on-hand Wikipedia experts, and the hard work of all the volunteers.</p>\n<h2>More information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want to help out and write about Belgian Fashion?

        title: 'Europeana Fashion at the LIM College Conference in New York this Friday'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Friday, October 4, LIM College will host Alessandra Arezzi Boza, Communications Director of the Europeana Fashion Project, to the conference “Fashion: Now &amp; Then: Meaning, Media, and Mode” to discuss the past, present, and future uses of global fashion information.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2013-10/fashion_now_and_then_2013.jpg\" alt=\"LIM College Fashion Show, Plaza Hotel, 1970’s.

Image Courtesy of the LIM College Archive</em></p>\n\nLIM College will host Fashion: Now &amp; Then: Meaning, Media, and Mode, a conference in which participants will discuss the past, present, and future uses of global fashion information, Thursday, October 3 through Saturday, October 5, 2013 at LIM College (12 East 53rd Street).\nThis year’s edition of the annual international fashion information conference will feature the exclusive preview of Europeana Fashion, the online European fashion archive connected to Europeana, the European Digital Library.\n\nAlessandra Arezzi Boza, Communications Director of the Europeana Fashion Project, will hold her speech on Friday, October 4 from 10:15-11:00 a.m.\nThe presentation talks about Europeana Fashion as a best practice network composed of 22 partners from 12 European countries, which represent the leading European institutions and collections in the fashion domain. It focuses on the first year basis results achieved in all Project related activities, with a huge quote of its successful communication strategy. In this occasion a preview of the website and a presentation of its functionalities and features will be showed for the first time.\n\n“Europeana Fashion offers a variety of specialized services and features including a specialized data model known as EDM-fp, a fashion thesaurus available in 10 languages, and the IPR Best Practice Guidelines Manual, which was created in collaboration with the V&amp;A to assist Europeana Fashion partners in clearing intellectual property rights for images. In addition to delivering content through its portal, Europeana Fashion will develop an interactive component -- with a Tumblr blog dedicated to virtual fashion exhibitions curated by partners and guest curators, an events section, and an active presence on leading social media platforms. Europeana Fashion aims to become a true forum of fashion, where all of its users and communities—including the general public, creative and research professionals, and fashion institutions-- exchange information on fashion topics, contribute fashion content and provide feedback.\n\nLisa Ryan, LIM College Reference &amp; Instruction Librarian and organizer of the Fashion: Now &amp; Then conference said, “We are very pleased the Europeana Fashion consortium has chosen to announce their worldwide preview at our conference. Until Fashion Now &amp; Then began in 2011, there had not been an international forum for discussion among fashion information professionals. Unfortunately, a significant portion of historical fashion and fashion-related information and materials have been lost or not collected and preserved, and information about their existence and availability has not been well-disseminated. LIM College is very proud to be the venue of choice for the introduction to the world of what will be the premier source of European digital fashion information.”\n\nFor more information please visit:\_\n<a href=\"http://www.limcollege.edu/news/14107.aspx\">LIM College</a>\n<a href=\"http://fashionnowandthen.blogspot.it/\">Fashion: Now &amp; Then</a>"

        title: 'MUDE brings Portuguese fashion design to Tumblr'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">This month, our partner Museu do Design e da Moda (MUDE) gives an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the museum's preparation of its upcoming Felipe Oliveira Baptista exhibition.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3277\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-10/portrait-665x665.jpg\" alt=\"Felipe Oliveira Baptista MUDE lisbao lisbon portugal exhibition europeana fashion\"><em>Felipe Oliveira Baptista. Source: MUDE</em></p>\n\nThe exhibition features the work of Portuguese fashion designer <a href=\"http://www.felipeoliveirabaptista.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Felipe Oliveira Baptista</a>. Baptista graduated in fashion design from Kingston University in the late 90s and went on to work for \_<strong>established houses</strong>, such as MaxMara and Cerruti. He also entered into <strong>creative collaboration</strong>s with Nike and Uniqlo. Along the way his work received wide recognition as he gathered <strong>awards</strong> from LVMH and the Hyères Festival. Currently, Baptista is the Creative Director of Lacoste and also runs <strong>his own label</strong>, shown in Paris during the Haute Couture and Ready-To-Wear collections.\n\nBaptista has had his work exhibited several times and will now have a exhibition fully dedicated to his work at <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/entradaMobile.html\" target=\"_blank\">MUDE</a>. MUDE will give <strong>a sneak preview of the exhibition</strong> on our Tumblr by showing how the exhibition is being build up, a process normally not visible to the public. Conceived as an installation, this exhibition offers an immersion into the creative universe of Felipe Oliveira Baptista, escaping from the typical chronologic and linear style of exhibition.\n\nThe scenography, designed by Bureau Betak, is <strong>a kaleidoscopic space</strong> with mirrors intersecting the gallery in different angles and directions. It offers a multifaceted reading of Baptista's journey and work, from the time when he has was recognized with the Grand Prix at the Festival d’Hyères (2002) until now. The result is <strong>not just an exhibition,</strong> but a place that plays with reality and fiction, with the object and its image, thereby capturing the scenic, performative and always transforming universe of fashion.\n\nThe exhibition opens on 17 October 2013, but you can already <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">get a sneak preview on our Tumbl</a>r."

The Nordiska Museet was host to <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2013/04/04/europeana-fashion-edit-a-thon-nordiska-museet-sweden-wikimedia-wikipedia/\" target=\"_blank\">the first edit-a-thon</a> we held and is opening its doors and collections once again. Museum curators provided brand new images of eighteenth century shoes to Wikimedia Commons for your inspiration.\n\nHosting a stunning collection of shoes is the Italian Europeana Fashion partner <a href=\"http://www.museodellacalzatura.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Museo Rossimoda della Calzatura</a>\_in\_a beautifully located villa outside of <strong>Padova</strong>. The museum is joining forces with Wikimedia Italy and the Universities of Venice and Padova to teach eighty students what editing on Wikimedia entails and how shoe history can be explained in an open, neutral way on the collaborative encyclopedia. The edit-a-thon at Rossimoda will take place on 14 November. Take a look at the shoes the museum has uploaded onto <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Museo_Rossimoda_della_calzatura\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia</a>.\n\nThe third edit-a-thon will take place in <strong>Israel</strong>,\_where museum specialists from all over the world are coming together at the annual <a href=\"http://www.digital-heritage.org.il/\" target=\"_blank\">EVA/Minerva conference</a>. Specialists from Wikimedia Israel and Europeana Fashion's technical coordinator Marco Rendina will present the edit-a-thon series and give an introductory session on how to become a contributor to Wikipedia. A local edit-a-thon event will be held on the 20th of November at the <a href=\"http://www.hit.ac.il/en\" target=\"_blank\">Holon Institute of Technology</a>.\n\nBut <strong>you do not have to physically present at the edit-a-thons to participate</strong>. To get people all over the world to share their knowledge about fashion we are holding an online competition: the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana_Fashion_edit-a-thons/Europeana_Fashion_Challenge/Welcome_to_the_Challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion Challenge</a>. From <strong>12 November until 12 December anybody can join the competition</strong> and write Wikipedia articles, either at one of the edit-a-thons or from home.\n\nYou will receive points for creating new articles and expanding existing articles that contain one or many Europeana Fashion images.

For example the Banér necklace from 1581, given by nobleman Gustaf Banér to his daughter hours before he was executed in the Linköping Bloodbath (see video below), the pendant commemorating Gustav II Adolf after his death at the battle of Lützen in 1632 and a ring bearing what is so far the only known portrait of “the Lady of Årsta” famous for her late eighteenth and early nineteenthcentury diaries.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2OuYXPksg4&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nMore items, approximately 10,000 pieces of jewellery in the museum’s collections, can be viewed in <strong>the museum’s <a href=\"http://smycken.nordiskamuseet.se/\" target=\"_blank\">online database</a></strong> and will also be available through the portal of Europeana Fashion.\n\nNordiska museet in Stockholm is <strong>Sweden’s largest museum of cultural history</strong>, which opened 1873.

        title: 'ARRRGH! Monsters in Fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">\"ARRRGH! Monsters in Fashion\" is the title of the latest exhibition at our partner <a href=\"http://centraalmuseum.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Centraal Museum</a>. The exhibition explores unconvential forms of fashion, which might be so bizarre we would label them as monstrous and ask ourselves what beauty really is.\_</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3450 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/overview-room-4_dea-rijper-centraal-museum-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion centraal museum utrecht monsters\"><em>Overview room 4. © Dea Rijper / Centraal Museum</em></p>\n\nThe title of this exhibition might be slightly misleading. It’s based on the Ancient Greek meaning of the word “monster”, which differs from the meaning still in use today. \"The word described <strong>everything strange that had to be given an explanation</strong>, including the astonishing, heavenly phenomena of the world and universe: anything that could not be explained,\" explains the Greek collective ATOPOS cvc, which is responsible for the creative concept and design of this exhibition.\n\nIt’s a meaning proving useful for the pieces Centraal Museum exhibits until 19 January 2014. The young designers involved – renowned as well as upcoming – all created <strong>outfits that transform the human body into an unknown, bizarre, often ‘monstrous’ figure</strong>, opting for less common materials, creating odd forms and volumes, masking the face and using vibrant colours.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3457\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/room-1_dea-rijper-centraal-museum1-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Room 1 © Dea Rijper / Centraal Museum</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3458\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/room-4_dea-rijper-centraal-museum1-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"monsters europeana fashion centraal museum utrecht\"><em>Room 4 © Dea Rijper / Centraal Museum</em></p>\n\nThe idea of designing wearable clothes for comfort and style appears to have been abandoned, giving creativity free rein. Many of the works seem to draw their inspiration from <strong>unrestrained fantasies fed by comics, video games or cartoons</strong>. This development coincides with the virtual lives that people now lead on the Internet: creating and developing our own avatars invites us to contemplate an alternative ‘self’.\n\nThe designs in this exhibition, although often presented as fashion, should actually be seen as <strong>artworks that question the meaning of beauty</strong>, as well as the identities we communicate with our bodies. Evidently, what is attractive in one culture, place or time, may be ugly or ‘monstrous’ in another.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3451\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/pins-and-needles-by-bart-hess_dea-rijper-centraal-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"bart hess centraal museum utrecht monsters europeana fashion\"><em>Pins and Needles by Bart Hess. © Dea Rijper / Centraal Museum</em></p>\n\n<strong>Four installations in the exhibition are part of Centraal Museum’s own collection</strong>. Bart Hess and Bas Kosters both created very diverse pieces especially for the occasion; respectively ‘Pins and Needles’ and ‘My Emoticon Family’. Viktor &amp; Rolf’s 1994 installation ‘L’hiver de l’amour’ is the center piece in the first room. Two winter ’13-’14 pieces by Craig Green – a white outfit and its exact copy “shadow” in black - close the exhibition.\n\nThe museum space, designed as “invaded” by these creatures, all differ in light, colour and sound intensity, which makes a visit even more an experience difficult to forget.\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/all-events/exhibition-arrrgh-monsters-in-fashion/\" target=\"_blank\">Monsters in Fashion</a>, 19 October 2013 through to 19 January 2014\n\n \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3449\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/my-emoticon-family-by-bas-kosters-_dea-rijper-centraal-museum-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion monsters centraal musuem utrecht emoticon family bas kosters\"><em>My Emoticon Family by Bas Kosters © Dea Rijper / Centraal Museum</em></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "S!X, the Melbourne-based fashion designers, are holding an exhibition entitled “cités de milles feuilles” at the premises of ATOPOS Contemporary Visual Culture in Athens, Greece. The exhibition\_will explore relationships between square cutting, the ancient Greek garment called the chiton, and the flag, the symbol of political nationalism. The installation will drape the courtyard of the neo-classical building in flags, designed and printed with the themes of decay and renewal, and the collision of cultures. Off the courtyard two rooms will display the wallpaper of an 18<sup>th</sup> century French drawing room, a recurrent motif of S!X’s design aesthetic, while a filmed mélange of images from Caulfield’s historic house Labassa will be projected. The exhibition is an exploration of the meeting of Athens and Melbourne, each in its own way a city of a thousand layers. The exhibition coincides with S!X’s participation in Melbourne Now, a major exhibition to be held at the National Gallery of Victoria for which S!X will fly the flags they have designed for a site specific work in Bourke St, Melbourne.\n\nFor more information, please visit ATOPOS Contemporary Visual Culture."

        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Our partner MUDE talks to renowned Portuguese fashion designer\_José António Tenente about his curatorial work at the museum, his work with the museum's collection and his views on the Europeana Fashion project.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2013/11/27/mude-interview-fashion-designer-jose-antonio-tenente-europeana-fashio/jatenente/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3489\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3489\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/jatenente-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"mude museu do design e da moda jose antonio tenente europeana fashion interview\" width=\"665\" height=\"443\" /></a>\n\n<strong>In 2010, under Creative Lab, you were invited to make an exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/mude_site.html\">MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda</a>, Colecção Francisco Capelo, <em>Assinado por Tenente</em> which showed your creative process. You took the role of the curator putting side by side emblematic garments of fashion history, belonging to the museum’s collection, and your own work. How was the experience of designing the exhibition?</strong>\n\nThe 'curatorial' work was the result of my proposal to present my creative process starting from the museum's collection. Since the first visit to the museum’s reserve collections, it was clear that my selection could organize a thematic display alongside with the mainlines of my work. More than an objective choice, guided by criteria of historical importance or cover the wide range of the collection, my choice was always very emotional. Actually, I realized soon that the selected items were intimately connected to my imagination and therefore with my work. And so the exhibition took shape from reason, representing the cutting and the construction; emotion, representing the more theatrical spirit; devotion, for the details and minutiae and passion symbolizing colourr. Four themes equally important in my work, and that may represent the fundamental characteristics of 'my signature'. The exhibition turned out to be an exercise that 'forced' me to think and rationalize about my creative process with distance and objectivity.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3486\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/20101022_4874-c-c3-b3pia-665x445.jpg\" alt=\"mude museu do design e da moda jose antonio tenente europeana fashion interview\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Assinado por Tenente&quot; by José António Tenente at MUDE, November 2010</em></p>\n\n<strong>Which designers and items represented in MUDE’s collection are an inspiration for you and why?\n</strong>\nThe exhibition held at MUDE gave me the opportunity to know the collection very well. Beyond the highlights, It was a privilege to meet designers that I did not know so well or did not know at all ... However, the highlights are unavoidable: Balenciaga and Dior of the 1950s and 1960s are extraordinary in cut, shape and volume, representing the feminine elegance of that era. Other times and languages, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Christian Lacroix, Alexander McQueen and Yohji Yamamoto, are well represented in the collection with very significant items that mirror their creative identities.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3487\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/20101109_5839-c-c3-b3pia-665x445.jpg\" alt=\"mude museu do design e da moda jose antonio tenente europeana fashion interview\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Assinado por Tenente&quot; by José Antonio Tenente at MUDE, November 2010</em></p>\n\n<strong>\nHow would you rate the fashion collection of MUDE- Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo?\n</strong>\nVery good indeed. It spans a vast range of fashion designers covering several decades of the XXth century, from the late 1930s, with a particular focus on the French creativity or made in France, such as Belgian and Japanese designers that presented their collections in Paris. The collection is strong in historical items but also in contemporary fashion. It is a very lively and interesting collection that has been presented to the public in a very dynamic display.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3485\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/20101021_4122-c-c3-b3pia-665x445.jpg\" alt=\"mude museu do design e da moda jose antonio tenente europeana fashion interview\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Assinado por Tenente&quot; by José António Tenente at MUDE, November 2010</em></p>\n\n<strong>MUDE is a partner in the Europeana Fashion Project. How do you see this partnership and the importance it may have in the future for the dissemination and promotion of the Portuguese fashion abroad?</strong>\n\nIt will certainly be a privileged platform to present the collection internationally and obviously also to Promote the portuguese fashion designers represented in MUDE’s collection. To the public, and specially to the fashion professionals, it will be an asset to have online access to the collection, which allows to study, to plan visits to the museum, etc…\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3484\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-11/20100902_5577-c-c3-b3pia-665x445.jpg\" alt=\"mude museu do design e da moda jose antonio tenente europeana fashion interview\"><em>Preparing the mannequins for the exhibition, September 2010</em></p>\n\n<strong>BIO JOSÉ ANTÓNIO TENENTE</strong>\nJosé António Tenente was born in Cascais in 1966. He began by studying Architecture, which he dropped out of to take the Fashion Design course at Citem. At the end of the 1990s, he opened his first shop in Largo do Carmo, Lisbon. Besides clothes, his brand universe extends to a variety of projects such as glasses and perfumes, among others. Throughout his career he has received countless awards and is one of the obligatory names when one speaks of Portuguese fashion, due to his consistent evolution and work."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Origins of chintz</strong>\n\nIn the second half of the 17<sup>th</sup> century, a small fashion revolution was to occur when the Dutch East India Company loaded their ships with a fabric so far unknown to the European people. All the way from the Coromandel coast, in South-East India, sturdy but shiny cotton fabrics arrived, splendidly decorated with floral patterns. Originally intended for home decoration, the material hardly stained and resisted washing treatments. In English, this marvel was called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chintz\">chintz</a>, a pluralized version of the Hindi word for ‘bright’. By 1680 more than a million pieces of chintz were being imported into England, France and The Netherlands per year. As chintz was considered a threat for the national textile industry, French and English citizens were prohibited to either produce or import chintz for over 70 years, respectively from 1686 and 1701. In The Netherlands its production flourished. The country was happy to cater for its neighbors, to which the Dutch merchandise, as well as the Indian originals, were smuggled.\n\nWith making chintz the Dutch entrepreneurs didn’t choose for an easy option. Even if in India most of the designs were hand painted whereas in the Low Countries they were printed, it remained time consuming. Weeks were involved in making the natural dyes, cleaning the fabric (beating it with wooden bats), preparing it with a tannin solution (retrieved from plants), submerging it in various baths, rinsing and letting the fabric dry. Dying colors always happened in the same order: black, red, blue, purple, yellow and green. Some of them, such as red and purple, appeared only when the fabric, hand painted or printed with a type of mordant, was plunged in a color dye bath afterwards. Others could be applied to the fabric directly, such as black, yellow (for Indian chintz) and blue (for chintz from Europe). The final bleaching of the white background needed a good amount of sun and goat or cow’s poo. Finishing happened with rice water, in order to make it sturdy; the shiny look was obtained by waxing and polishing with a shell or by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendering\">calendering</a>. By the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, chintz fashions went by, having become too widespread and too brightly colored compared to the new trend: 100% white."

The Tumblr blog will feature at least ten items made out of this material, but what is chintz exactly?</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3518\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-12/tumblr_mwvneomlgw1s0n7o6o1_1280.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion centraal museum utrecht chintz tumblr\"><em>Robe à l’anglaise made of chintz, c. 1780. Collection Centraal Museum, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Copyright: Centraal Museum.</em></p>\n\nThe exotic textile arrived in Europe during the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century on the ships of the East India Companies, all the way from the Coromandel coast in South-East India. It concerned sturdy but shiny cotton fabrics splendidly decorated with floral patterns. It also\_hardly stained and resisted washing treatments. In English, this marvel was called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chintz\" target=\"_blank\">chintz</a>, <strong>a pluralized version of the Hindi word for ‘bright’.</strong>\n\nBy 1680 chintz had become massively popular; more than a million pieces of chintz were being imported into England,France and The Netherlands per year. As <strong>chintz was considered a threat for the national textile industries</strong>, French and English citizens were prohibited to either produce, import or even wear it for over 70 years, respectively from 1686 and 1701.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3520\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-12/tumblr_mxc7ezjlxe1s0n7o6o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion centraal museum utrecht chintz tumblr east india trading company\"><em>The Dutch East India Company was the main importer of chintz fabrics to Europe during the 17th and 18th century. This engraving shows the shipyard and warehouses of the company in Amsterdam, around 1750. Collection Fries Scheepvaart Museum, Sneek, The Netherlands.</em></p>\n\nIn The Netherlands the sale of both original chintz and reproductions flourished; over the years chintz was used for fashionable and for regional dress. The country was happy to cater to its neighbors, to which the Dutch merchandise and the Indian originals were smuggled.\n\nTrying to reproduce Indian chintz, the Dutch entrepreneurs did not choose an easy option. Even though in India most of the designs were painted by hand, <strong>printing reproductions in the Low Countries remained time-consuming</strong>. Weeks if not months were involved in making the natural dyes, cleaning the fabric (beating it with wooden bats), preparing it with a tannin solution (retrieved from plants), submerging it in various baths, rinsing and drying.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3519\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-12/tumblr_mx8n5n1hwh1s0n7o6o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion centraal museum utrecht chintz tumblr\"><em>Caraco made of mustard yellow chintz, blue checked linen lining, c. 1750-1775, combined with a silk satin ruby red matelassé skirt, c. 1740. Collection Centraal Museum, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Copyright: Centraal Museum.</em></p>\n\nColor dying always happened in the same order: black, red, blue, purple, yellow and green. Some of the colors appeared only when the fabric, hand painted or printed with a type of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant\" target=\"_blank\">mordant</a>, was plunged in a dye bath afterwards. Others could be applied to the fabric directly.\n\nThe bleaching of the white background, which needed to be repeated several times, required a good amount of sun and goat or cow dung. Finishing happened with rice water, in order to make it sturdy; the shiny look was obtained by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendering\" target=\"_blank\">calendering</a> or by waxing and polishing with a shell.\n\n<strong>Visit our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> for some silhouettes made of this fascinating textile</strong>."

        title: 'Who "owns" fashion? Europeana Fashion releases IPR Guidelines'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">What do Chanel’s interlocking ‘C’s and\_ Louboutin’s red sole have in common? The answer is they are all protected by intellectual property rights (IPR). As many professionals in the cultural and creative industry often face IPR, Europeana Fashion has decided to release its guidelines on how to manage IPR when publishing content online.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3544\" src=\"/files/fashion/2013-12/ipr1.png\" alt=\"intellectual property fashion europeana\"><em>An example from the IPR Guidelines</em></p>\n\nSo what does IPR mean exactly? <strong>IPR means someone has ownership over a creation or invention and that this ownership is protected by law</strong>. For example, other fashion houses are not allowed to use the interlocking 'C's of Chanel because this symbol is the intellectual property of Chanel and only Chanel is allowed to use it.\n\nThe<strong> importance of IPR in fashion</strong> is illustrated by legal disputes. For example, Christian Louboutin and Yves Saint Laurent recently went to court over the intellectual ownership of the red sole. Can Yves Saint Laurent also use the red sole on its shoes or does that idea solely \"belong\" to Christian Louboutin?\n\nThese examples show that<strong> IPR is a valuable asset</strong> in the fashion industry and whether you create a new shoe or want to share a photo of that shoe online, it is important to understand your rights and respect the rights of others.\n\nSo when the cultural heritage organisations in the Europeana Fashion project decided they would publish images of their collections online, they also needed to think about the intellectual ownership of the objects in their collection.\n\nThat is why our partner the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum wrote ‘best practice’ IPR guidelines. These guidelines support partners with selecting content they can publish online. They combine the most important IPR principles with ‘best practice’ flowcharts and useful documents.\n\nNow we<strong> decided to make these guidelines available to the public</strong>. While we think they can help other professionals in the cultural and creative industry, we also hope that they can <strong>promote awareness about publishing and sharing cultural material on the Internet</strong>.\n\nWhile these guidelines do not constitute legal advice and simplify a complex subject, we hope they go some way to reassuring you that by combining a little bit of law, logic and experience, you can handle intellectual property matter.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Europeana%20Fashion%20IPR%20Guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View and download the IPR Guidelines</a></span></strong></span></h2>"

        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">This year, the house of Lanvin is celebrating its 125th anniversary. To mark the occasion, the house has decided to reveal the best of its archives online. The website will host a special section dedicated to the house’s history and is using social media for some special projects.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3654 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-01/pinterest-lanvin-665x388.png\" alt=\"pinterest lanvin 125 europeana fashion curation exhibition history archives patrimoine \"><em>Lanvin celebrates 125 years on Pinterest with boards around the house&#039;s key codes. This board represents &quot;Lanvin Blue&quot;. See more at: http://www.pinterest.com/LANVINOFFICIAL</em></p>\n\nA milestone in the history of Lanvin is celebrated every Thursday on Facebook, Instagram will soon see snapshots from objects in the office of Jeanne Lanvin and Pinterest hosts boards highlighting the house’s five key codes: Lanvin blue, the house’s logo, hats, Jeanne Lanvin and her daughter Marguerite.\n\nIt was Marguerite after all that was behind the success of Jeanne Lanvin (1889-1946), founder of the brand and milliner by trade. Jeanne’s motherly love inspired the custom designs Jeanne starting making for her daughter. They became all the rage with the fashionable Parisian set of the early 1900s and Jeanne soon found herself in womenswear.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3655 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-01/momu-lanvin-21.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The mother-daughter connection is reflected in Lanvin’s logo. Lanvin, powder-box and box, 1930-1950. Collection MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nLanvin’s success grew throughout the 1920s and 1930s. She introduced a youthful aesthetic that blurred the lines between childrens’ clothes and womenswear, reflected in her popular “robe de styles”. Her patterns were simple but she embellished them with embroidery, appliques, ribbons, and sunbursts. Colour was another code for Lanvin, particularly “Lanvin Blue” inspired by a fresco of Fra Angelico that Jeanne saw in Florence.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3656\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-01/momu-lanvin1-665x520.png\" alt=\"momu modemuseum antwerp lanvin 1920s twenties robe de style dress\"><em>Lanvin, dress, 1925-1930. Collection MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAfter Jeanne passed away in 1946, her daughter took over for a short time, followed by several designers over the next decades. Since 1999 designer Alber Elbaz has been credited with restoring Lanvin’s glory and reinstalling the house’s signature codes.\n<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/search.html?term=lanvin\">\nSee all Lanvin in the Europeana Fashion portal</a>\nSee <a href=\"http://www.lanvin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lanvin</a> on <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/LANVINOFFICIAL/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>,<a href=\"http://instagram.com/#lanvinofficial/\" target=\"_blank\"> Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LANVINofficial?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3657\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-01/catw-lanvin.jpg\" alt=\"catwalk pictures catwalkpictures lanvin alber elbaz europeana fashion\"><em>A silhouette for Lanvin by Alber Elbaz.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">All through February, the Museo del Traje will show a selection of remarkable pieces from its jewellery collection on our Tumblr. These pieces are part of the temporary exhibition: “Dressing with Jewels. Fashions, types and prototypes\" and address fundamental questions of how humans have dressed and adorned their bodies since centuries.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-3776    \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-02/5.-ce103652_r.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion tumblr pinterest curation jewellery museo del traje necklace\"><em>Dior, 1959. Collection Museo del Traje.</em></p>\n\nEach in its own way, both jewels and costumes dress the body; all through the ages, both garments and jewels have been <strong>essential elements of the attire of men and women</strong>.\_ Their coexistence in the same physical frame allows for a complex relationship which is aesthetic, formal and functional at the same time. Jewels are, therefore, worn according to costume; this basic principle of jewellery is still alive today thanks to the remarkable adaptation abilities of jewels.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3781\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-02/tumblr_n0ilgmj8om1s0n7o6o2_500.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion tumblr pinterest curation jewellery museo del traje exhibition \"><em>Scenography of the “Dressing with Jewels. Fashions, types and prototypes&quot; exhibition</em></p>\n\nJewels and costumes are also subject to the tides of fashion. Fashion is <strong>an extraordinarily complex social expression</strong>; this is mainly due to its permeability, a quality which allows fashion to work as both cause and effect. Talking about fashion is therefore talking about ways of use, about the different ways in which men and women have come to fulfill their needs, inlcuding the need for personal adornment. Jewels tell the story of this basic human aspiration through a seemingly unlimited répertoire of precious objects.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-3786  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-02/mtfce001341_seq_012_p1.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion tumblr pinterest curation jewellery museo del traje exhibition fan queen victoria\"><em>Fan belonging to Queen Victoria, 1850. Collection Museo del Traje. Photo: Francisco Javier Maza Domingo.</em></p>\n\nJewels and costumes provide us with a series of models which work like <strong>mirrors of the historical periods in which they were conceived</strong>; moreover, they can also transform themselves –in form or in content- into never ceasing sources of inspiration for new fashions and new ways of use. Such is the case of Oriental jewels and jewels from Classical Antiquity, which have impregnated European and Spanish jewellery designs through the centuries.\n\nVisit our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> or <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/eurfashion/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>\nFind out more about the \_<a href=\"http://museodeltraje.mcu.es/index.jsp?id=670&amp;ruta=3,16,170,725\" target=\"_blank\">\"Dressing with Jewels.

Nowadays managing heritage does not mean to just look back at the past, \_but instead to <strong>make the values from the past relevant in contemporary contexts</strong>. The materials kept in archives inspire future collections, are used \_in marketing campaigns and form the heart of exhibitions and fashion film.\n\nNow that archives are starting to show their materials on the Internet, more and more people can discover and re-use these materials. <strong>This opening up of archives to a large audience combined with the power of archives to inspire new forms of fashion culture is the topic of \_this conference.</strong>\n\nSpeakers include Jane Reeve, CEO of <strong>Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana</strong>, and Luca Missoni, Creative Director at <strong>Missoni</strong> as well as noted fashion historians such as Amandia Triossi from the <strong>Bulgari Heritage Collection</strong>.\n\nThe conference is the second in a series of three annual international conferences organised by Europeana Fashion that explores <strong>the relationship between the fashion industry, the digital world and the Internet</strong>.\n<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/event/3139/made-in-italy-re-use-of-fashion-heritage-and-new-digital-perspe-4542/\" target=\"_blank\">\nClick here to register.</a> The conference has sold out.\n<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/media/uploads/files/Made_in_Italy_programme_2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see the full conference programme.\n</a>\nWed 9 April 2014 10:30-17:30\nVictoria and Albert Museum\nThe Lydia &amp; Manfred Gorvy Lecture Theatre, London\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/press-releases/Press%20Release%20Europeana%20Fashion%20Conference%202014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view the press release.\_</a>"

Archivio Emilio Pucci © Emilio Pucci.</em></p>\n\nThe cotton dress above is one of the highlights of Palio Collection. The colours and patterns represent the coat of arms of each “Contrade” (district) of Siena: “Civetta”, “Lupa”, “Montone”, “Chiocciola”, “Giraffa”, “Torre”, “Bruco” and “Oca”.\n\nThese coats of arms were to be found in the costumes and flags of each district, but Emilio Pucci reworked the prints \_into scarves, shirts, trousers and dresses. Each print was an intricate combination of up to ten different colors.\_The prints were prominent in his 1950s designs and earned Pucci the Neiman Marcus award in 1957.\n\nYou can find many objects related to Pucci's Palio collection in <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/search.html?term=palio\" target=\"_blank\">the portal</a>.

Plumes &amp; Feathers in Fashion at MoMu in Antwerp. For the occassion, the curatorial team is feathering up our Tumblr and Pinterest nest with images from its research for the exhibition.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4131\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-03/alexander-mcqueen.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion momu birds of paradise feathers alexander mcqueen etienne tordoir catwalkpictures\"><em>Alexander McQueen, S/S ‘11. © Etienne Tordoir/CatwalkPictures - See more at: http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/post/79444231075/alexander-mcqueen-s-s-11-c-etienne#sthash.wYwaXU23.dpuf</em></p>\n\nFeathers and fashion have always had a love affair. Throughout centuries the application of feathers has rendered fashion and haute couture with an <strong>extraordinary level of refinement and elegance</strong>.\n\nJust think of the femininity, luxury and wealth of the ostrich and marabou feathers on ladies' hats in the time of the the<strong> belle époque</strong> (1871-1914). The immense popularity of feathers during the period led to the near-extinction of certain birds.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-4133 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-03/societe-des-journaux-665x900.jpg\" alt=\"societe des journaux europeana fashion momu tumblr pinterest curation feathers momu birds of paradise\"><em>Société des Journaux de Mode Réunis. Collection MoMu - Fashion Museum Province Antwerp.</em></p>\n\nThe <strong>roaring twenties</strong> signified the true heyday of feathers. Flapper girls donned feathers on their hats, boas and dresses. Their feathers swayed as they danced to the beat of the charleston.\n\nBut there is a heavier side to the lightness of feathers too. There is a sense of <strong>dark romance and loss of innocence</strong> to feathers, probably best exemplified by contemporary fashion designers such as Alexander McQueen and Ann Demeulemeester.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-4132 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-03/momu-fan-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion momu feathers birds of paradise fan online curation \"><em>Fan with leaf in pheasant feathers and frame in nacre, 1890–1910, MoMu collection, inv. no. T13/1536/W15. © MoMu. Photo by Stephen Mattues</em></p>\n\n \n\nThe curation by MoMu explores themes of feathers in fashion through fashion photography, objects and illustrations. You can view the exhibition on our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/eurfashion/feathers/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>.\n\nFind out more about <em><a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en/exhibitions/present/\" target=\"_blank\">Birds of Paradise.

CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\nAfter a classic French breakfast, Alessandra Arezzi Boza, Communication Director at Europeana Fashion, started the day with a presentation on the Europeana Fashion project.\n\nThe participants then went to work in the library where they could use books and other sources for their articles. French Wikipedians were there to help participants write on Wikipedia. Participants wrote\_on <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Van_Beirendonck\">designers</a>, certain <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapeau\">types of dress</a>\_and <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_sous_le_Second_Empire\">historical time-periods</a>.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4240\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/europeana_fashion_editathon_mus-c3-a9e_des_arts_decoratifs_paris_2014_5-kopie-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion edit-a-thon les arts decoratifs\"><em>Participants use sources from the library at Les Arts Décoratifs.

In this exhibition, Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten’s work is shown side by side with fashion and art objects that inspire him.\n\nAt the end of the day, participants shared their experiences. Some found the learning curve for writing on Wikipedia a bit steep and would have appreciated another short workshop at the start of the day. Nearly half of the participants indicated that they would again write on Wikipedia in the future.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4239\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/europeana_fashion_editathon_mus-c3-a9e_des_arts_decoratifs_paris_2014_1-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion edit-a-thon les arts decoratifs paris\"><em>A concentrating participant.

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Publishes Edit-a-Thon Handbook'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">In an effort to improve fashion knowledge online, Europeana Fashion organises a series of “edit-a-thons” with Wikimedia, during which fashion enthusiasts and professionals get together to improve fashion knowledge on Wikipedia. In order to help other organisations also set up an edit-a-thon, we created the <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%20GLAMs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon Handbook</a>.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%20GLAMs.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4265\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/screen-shot-2014-04-02-at-1.04.32-pm.png\" alt=\"europeana fashion edit-a-thon handbook GLAM wikipedia wikimedia\" width=\"469\" height=\"663\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Fashion has already organised several successful edit-a-thons over the past year. The project has held edit-a-thons in Belgium, Sweden, The Netherlands, Israel, Italy and France and will continue to do so in the next year, because <strong>Wikipedia still needs more and better articles on fashion</strong>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In an effort to <strong>connect the world of Wikipedia to the fashion world,</strong>\_The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision started to set up collaborations between local Wikimedia chapters and partner institutions at the beginning of the Europeana Fashion project. Since then, even institutions outside the project got interested in working with Wikimedia.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4267\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/8733948335_e1a679d3e9_z.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion edit-a-thon wikimedia wikipedia GLAM handbook centraal museum utrecht\"><em>Fashion edit-a-thon at Centraal Museum in Utrecht. Photo: Sebastiaan ter Burg. CC-BY.</em></p>\n\nOne challenge, however, for anyone new to the Wiki world is understanding the terminology. <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a> is the encyclopedia that everyone knows, but there are numerous variations, \_like\_<a href=\"https://www.wikivoyage.org/\">Wikivoyage</a> for travel or <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/\">Wikibooks</a> for books. <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.org/\">Wikimedia</a>\_is the organisation that oversees all these subsets and\_<a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedian\">Wikimedians</a> are volunteers who write, edit and program on Wikipedia.\n\nTo build a bridge between the Wikimedia community and cultural institutions, Europeana Fashion wrote<strong> a handbook that supports institutions who want to organise an edit-a-thon</strong>. The handbook gives an overview of Wikimedia, Wikipedia, ways to ensure a successful edit-a-thon, how to measure success, tips for getting content on Wikimedia, event promotion, as well as a suggested day programme, a 3 month preparation agenda, and an abundance of relevant links.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4240\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/europeana_fashion_editathon_mus-c3-a9e_des_arts_decoratifs_paris_2014_5-kopie-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion edit-a-thon les arts decoratifs\"><em>Fashion edit-a-thon at Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris. Photo: Jesse de Vos. CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\nThe handbook is based on Europeana Fashion's own experience in organising edit-a-thons, but also on external research and direct input from Wikimedians. These different perspectives make it a <strong>valuable resource for any institution interested in setting up its own edit-a-thon</strong>. We invite anyone to share their experiences in the survey included in the handbook.\n\n<strong>You can download the fashion edit-a-thon handbook <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%20GLAMs.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%20GLAMs.pdf\">\n</a>."

Nevertheless, these forms constituted the basis of what was to follow in the middle of the 19th century when<strong> the Romantic Movement brought attention to local costume in Greece, Western Europe and elsewhere.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4292\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/tumblr_n3b0hf6swc1s0n7o6o1_1280-665x676.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pattern of a dress from Kassos, Dodecanese, Greece The dotted line on the pattern marks the position of the overfold. © Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation Archive, Nafplion, Greece</em></p>\n\n<strong>The basis is formed by two types of garments</strong>: the dress from Kassos (Greece, Dodecanesse) and Karpathos (Greece, Dodecanesse), a three metre long dress with a fold. The fold recalls the kolpos of the Ionic chiton and the loose pleated dress of Crete (Greece) which seems to have been taken its shape in Italy during the Renaissance.

        title: 'Looking Back: Europeana Fashion''s Second International Conference'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">Last week saw the second in our series of three international conferences, themed \"Made in Italy: re-use of fashion heritage and new digital perspectives\". Speakers and attendees flocked to beautiful Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London to discuss fashion and digital from a particular Italian perspective, tying into the museum's latest exhibition on the glamour of Italian fashion.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4307\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/20140409_eurfashion-va-conf_img1180-665x451.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion conference victoria albert london 2014 italian fashion digital\"><em>Photo: Erwin Verbruggen. CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\nAfter an introduction on the background of Europeana Fashion by Alessandra Arezzi Boza and \"The Glamour of Italian Fashion 1945-2014\" exhibition by Sonnet Stanfill, Jane Reeve was the first speaker to kick off the conference. Reeve, CEO of La Camera Internazionale Della Moda Italiana, stressed how <strong>digital has opened up new opportunities of communication for fashion, but how the message would always stand or fall with a good story behind it.</strong>\n\nLapo Cianchi, Head of Communication and Special Events and Pitti Discovery Foundation, emphasised how digital has created new venues for Pitti Immagine. Digital lets Pitti reach buyers who cannot physically attend its tradeshows, but it also <strong>allows visitors to explore the floor of the physical tradeshow with more ease.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4311\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/20140409_eurfashion-va-conf_img1200-665x451.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion conference victoria albert london 2014 italian fashion digital jane reeve\"><em>Jane Reeve from Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana presenting on fashion heritage and digital. Photo: Erwin Verbruggen. CC-BY-SA</em></p>\n\nFor Missoni, digital represented another opportunity. Luca Missoni explained how the house's archive originally started out as a family collection, including collage, clipping and 8mm film. That collection now plays an important\_role in Missoni's <strong>branding and creating and sustaining the brand's \"digital self-portrait\"</strong>.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4312\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-04/20140409_eurfashion-va-conf_img1228-665x451.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion conference victoria albert london 2014 italian fashion digital luca missoni\"><em>Luca Missoni. Photo: Erwin Verbruggen. CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\nEqually fascinating archives were represented by Isabella Campagnol from Rubelli Textiles,\_Federica Fornaciari of MaxMara and\_Amanda Triossi of Bulgari. While the Rubelli and MaxMara collection grew along with the brand, the Bulgari Heritage Collection was reconstructed by the house through buying back pieces from the past. <strong>Digital not only allows these collections to be archived for company use, but also to show what normally cannot be seen by the public or to show in new ways. </strong>For example, a Bulgari emerald or the details of a Rubelli textile up close.\n\nAll lectures have been recorded on video and will become available shortly.\nAll photos are available on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.705192106208996.1073741843.373193579408852&amp;type=3\">Facebook</a>.\nThe full programme is available <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/whatson/media/uploads/files/Made_in_Italy_Programme_FINAL_edit_27_March_SM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>."

The display areas are divided by transparent screens in the spirit of the exhibition which deals mainly with the revealed and the hidden in clothing. The exhibition, designed by Lilach Chitayat is pristine and airy, creating a unique atmosphere. “<strong>I feel that whoever sees the exhibit will be surprised by its relevance and modernity.

        title: 'A Short History of Fashion Illustration'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">For the past centuries, fashion illustration has been the major source for fashion information. Before photography, fashion was documented through engravings, paintings and drawings that were eagerly sought after world over. Fashion illustration offers a unique visual account of the history of fashion.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4362\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-06/2010ec5180_jpg_l-665x584.jpg\" alt=\"fashion plate 1800s victoria and albert museum\"><em>Fashion plate showing women&#039;s costume. Hand-coloured etching, Paris, 1787. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, London. CC-BY-SA. http://bit.ly/1oN6FKD</em></p>\n\nDuring the 1500s and 1600s, two centuries of exploration and discovery, there was a strong desire to know about the costume of other nations. <strong>Costume books with engravings, but also painting became important sources of information.</strong> By the end of the 1600s it was even in fashion to collect fashion engravings! Around the same period, fashion for the first time became a topic in periodicals and in the 1700s <strong>pocket books</strong> with small and uncoloured fashion illustrations enjoyed a wide circulation. By the end of the 18th century, the first fashion plates appeared in <strong>periodicals dedicated to fashion only.</strong>\n\nThe 1800s were the heyday of the fashion plate and saw the emergence of a large number of fashion magazines. There were even lower priced black-and-white and more expensive hand-coloured versions of the same magazine. Another development in fashion illustration were <strong>plates that not just showed the clothes, but depictions of women wearing them in social contexts</strong>, illustrating the appropriate circumstances for the clothes to be worn. The late 1800s saw the beginnings of experimentation with fashion photography, but even then magazines copied photographs through engravings.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4364\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-06/2009bx0663_jpg_l-665x445.jpg\" alt=\"fashion plate 1800s victoria albert museum europeana fashion illustration\"><em>Fashion plate, published in &quot;Le Monde Elégant&quot; and &quot;The Ladies Gazette of Fashion&quot;, England, ca. 1855-1868. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, London. CC-BY-SA. http://bit.ly/1uX4dDe</em></p>\n\nIn the early 1900s, fashion photography became a more dominant medium. The large circulation of fashion magazines had led to a decline in the artistic quality of fashion plates. It was <strong>Paul Poiret who reinvented the fashion plate by commissioning artists</strong> to depict his designs. From the 1920s onwards, fashion illustrations were often featured on magazine covers. They did not necessarily reflect the content of the magazine, but were seen as <strong>work of arts</strong> by themselves.

        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (S&amp;V) \_is one of the largest audio-visual archives in Europe. The collection totals over 800.000 hours of television, radio, music and film and continues to grow every day. For the Europeana Fashion Tumblr, S&amp;V curated fashion newsreels from the 1920s until the 1970s.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4403\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-06/51834-587-800.jpg\" alt=\"ANP sound vision nederlands instituut beeld geluid mode europeana fahsion\"><em>1 January 1967. Photo: ANP Foundation. Collection ANP Foundation. CC-BY-NC-ND.</em></p>\n\nThe newsreels come from S&amp;V's Polygoon collection. Founded in 1919, Polygoon produced bi-weekly and later on, weekly newsreels to be shown in Dutch cinemas. The <strong>emphasis in these newsreels was always on objectivity and reliability of the news</strong>, but at the same time Polygoon was careful not to alienate the cinema going audience. Therefore, Polygoon tried to focus on subjects that yielded attractive images and \_that were not too difficult to understand.\n\n[youtube_sc url=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/sQiReUnLfG0\"]\n\nCameramen employed by Polygoon had to fill their reels, no matter what. This led to a very varied collection of newsreels with more important and <strong>serious news events, but also reels showing common everyday life</strong>. At its glory days after World War II, Polygoon newsreels were shown in more then 400 cinemas in the Netherlands, but the introduction of television in the fifties led to its decline.\n\nThe news programs on television were much more up to date and topical then Polygoon and in 1989 Polygoon finally ended its activities leaving an enormous archive of material; the pre-war period alone covers over <strong>191 kilometers of film</strong>.\n\n[youtube_sc url=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/zBODmz5E4hs\"]\n\nS&amp;V has made part of the Polygoon archive available through their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/BeeldenGeluid\">Youtube</a> channel and through portals like <a href=\"http://www.openimages.eu\">www.openimages.eu</a>. For the Europeana Fashion Tumblr, \_S&amp;V curated a collection of<strong> fashion related newsreels that show what fashionable men and women were wearing in the 20th century</strong>.\n\nThe curation covers fashion from the 1920s until the 1970s and explores a variety of subjects and designers. Dutch designers like <strong>Frank Govers</strong> and <strong>Dick Holthaus</strong> present their collections in their own unique ways. In Paris, French designers like <strong>Pierre Cardin</strong> and<strong> Marc Bohan (Christian Dior)</strong> show their respective collections on the runway. <strong>Mary Quant</strong> and her revolutionary London fashion opposed Parisian fashion rules \_and German designers predicted what we would be wearing in the year 2000.\n\nSee the curation on our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a>."

        title: 'A History of 20th Century Swimwear - Part I'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">To celebrate summer and the fashion that goes along with it, we will talk about the history of swimwear in the 20th century in two parts. This week, we will look at swimwear from the 1910 until the 1950. A period in which women went from wearing complete attires to curve emphasing two-pieces.</span></strong></span></h2>\nBefore the 20th century, nobody really “went swimming”. People did bathe in seawater, but mainly \_for medical reasons. Even \_at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, <strong>swimming still was not acceptable for women</strong> and their heavy corsets and petticoats certainly did\_ not allow them.\n\nWWI changed all that, with the men gone to war, women took up physical work. Their lifestyle and fashion changed accordingly. In 1914, Vogue first published an editorial on bathing suits, but <strong>throughout the 1910s bathing suits were conservative</strong> and covered a lot of skin. They were made of fabrics like wool and silk, were full of detailing and were heavily accessorised, the parasol being a favorite.\n\nThe one-piece was first introduced in 1918, but was still considered very <strong>avant-garde</strong>. It reached down to the knee and was only meant to be uncovered right before the swimmer entered the water.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4460\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/73587.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion 1920s swimwear nordiska museet\"><em>Two models in swimsuit during swimwear fashion show in Saltsjöbaden, 1929. Collection Nordiska Museet. CC-BY-NC-ND.</em></p>\n\nIn the<strong> 1920s travelling became fashionable and going to the beach became a stylish pastime</strong>. The popularity of sports also made swimming a favourite activity. The beach became a place to bo seen during glamorous holidays in Palm Beach, Deauville and the Cote d’Azur. Fashion responded with swim suits that were more tailored, slim and bare.\n\nThis trend continued and was pushed further in the 1930s. <strong>Fitness was a craze, the body had to be tip-top shape</strong>in order to show it off in back-baring, low-cut, tight one pieces that allowed for maximum sun exposure and comfortable swimming at the same time. The two-piece, baring the midriff, also entered the stage at ths time, but was still considered daring.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4461\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/62386.jpg\" alt=\"nordiska museet swimwear 1930s europeana fashion\"><em>Woman in swimsuit, 1930s. Collection Nordiska Museet. CC-BY-NY-ND.</em></p>\n\nThe <strong>bare midriff and a great sun tan became the look <em>du rigueur</em> in the 1940s</strong>. Due to wartime fabric shortages, accompanying garments were ditched, but the bathing suit itself became more dressy. The one-piece had now become mainstream and the bottom of the two piece was cut higher on the leg.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4490\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/fo0003802b-665x715.jpg\" alt=\"emilio pucci swimwear 1940s europeana fashion\"><em>Cotton swimsuit by Emilio Pucci, 1949. Collection Fondazione Archivio Emilio Pucci. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe<strong> midriff continued to be more and more exposed during the 1950s</strong>. While the decade started with looser more girly bathing suits, they soon become tighter and more curve-emphasizing. Tops were strapless for a bare neckline or boned to increase the body-hugging effect. It was all about the waist and the bosom.\n\nThe 1960s represented a huge change in society and culture which was, of course, reflected in fashion. Next week we will look at swimwear from the 1960s onwards.\n\nNext week, we will continue with the history of swimwear 1960s-1980s.\n<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/search.html?term=swim\" target=\"_blank\">Discover more swimwear in Europeana Fashion.</a>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4466\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/fo00409b-665x669.jpg\" alt=\"swimwear pucci 1950s europeana fashion bathing suit\"><em>Emilio Pucci, 1956.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">This week we continue our exploration of women's swimwear. In this second part, we will look at swimwear from the 1960s until the 1980s. The body cult that started in the 1930s did not wane. Nevertheless, the 1960s marked a huge change in society and thus in fashion.</span></strong></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4496\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/11895706894_2d92d9dd81_o-665x517.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Actress Claudie Lange in Fellini&#039;s 1965 Film &quot;Juliet of The Spirits&quot;. Published in Life magazine, August 27, 1965 - Vol. 59, No. 9. CC BY-NC.</em></p>\n\nLast week, we ended with the 1950s. A period that was all about curves. This look continued into the early years of the next decade with <strong>curve-enhancing two-pieces, boy shorts and tops that enhanced the bosom.</strong>\n\nHowever, the revolutionary 1960s turned society, and consequently fashion, upside down. This was best seen in swimwear near the end of the decade when the bikini became the norm.<strong> Bikini shorts hit the thighs and the top became small and less constructe</strong>d. One-pieces with cut-outs made their appearance too.\n\nThe 1960s had started off with the mature curvy woman as the ideal of femininity and ended with the <strong>sharper edgier young female</strong>, symbolised by models like Twiggy. An ideal that has not changed much ever since.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4500\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/fo0107302b1-665x914.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion emilio pucci archive pearl bikini 1970s\"><em>Bikini made out of pearls by Emilio Pucci, 1972. Collection Fondazione Archivio Emilio Pucci. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe <strong>young and edgy trend continued into the 1970s</strong>. Bikinis became mere strips of fabrics covering a body that was toned, tanned and ready for maximum exposure. The daring even started to take their bikini top off. Colours were bright and shiny, fabrics were tight. The body underwent an exercise regime of dance and fitness.\n\nThe trend for exercise did not diminish in the 1980s, it turned into a fitness craze. The <strong>1980s body was muscled, ready for action and adventure</strong>. The high-cut bottom entered the scene, exposing the hipbone. Swimwear became an artificial skin that served to enhance the sculpture-like qualities of the body.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4498\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/6a00d83451ccbc69e2019b007944f5970d.jpg\" alt=\"europeana fashion 1980s swimwear cole\"><em>1987 advertisment for Cole swimsuits. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAfter the 1980s, <strong>the trend for more exposure continued</strong>. The 1990s saw the string bikini becoming omnipresent. The daring few even donned a thong, previously only worn by erotic dancers.\n\nOverall, swimwear in the 20th century grew <strong>more and more bare</strong>. The female body went from being completely covered to nearly <strong>completely exposed</strong> as women started suntanning and swimming. Along with it grew a culture that put a heavy emphasis on maintaining <strong>a fit body</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/search.html?term=swim\" target=\"_blank\">Discover more swimwear in Europeana Fashion.</a>"

Jules Hirsch was the nephew of German-Jewish emigrant Leo Hirsch, founder of Hirsch &amp; C.ie.\n\nAlready before WWI American department stores like <strong>Macy's and Saks copied the designs of Bernard et C.ie</strong>. The Fashion house was hit hard by the world economic crisis of 1929 and was legally closed in 1934.\n\nThe <strong>drawings were made by the house itself</strong> and showcase the different models on offer. Many of the drawings also include a list of cost calculations. <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/search.html?term=bernard%20et%20c.ie\" target=\"_blank\">Discover the Bernard et C.ie drawings in Europeana Fashion</a>.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4520\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-07/reverie-et-nuit-bleue-665x442.png\" alt=\"europeana fashion kunstbibliothek state museums berlin Staatlichen Museen bernard cie hirsch paris 1920s\"><em>Evening dresses &quot;Reverie&quot; and &quot;Nuit Bleue&quot; by Bernard et C.ie, 1927-1928.

Each nation has a different story of the degree to which the industry played a role in the war economy, and the extent to which cultural representations of fashion and dress contributed to shaping national identity.

The conference will explore <strong>how fashion was affected by war economies and how it played a role in shaping national identities</strong>.\n\nOverall and possibly unexpectedly, the period of <strong>WWI proves to have been a time of amazing vitality and modernity in fashion</strong>. The attractive dresses with half-length skirts, black as a fashion colour and comfortable suits of silk jersey are only a few of the stylistic innovations presented during this conference in Paris.\n\nThe National Museums in Berlin will also explore the topic with the exhibition <a title=\"Wardrobes in Wartime\" href=\"http://www.smb.museum/en/exhibitions/detail/krieg-und-kleider-modegrafik-zur-zeit-des-ersten-weltkriegs.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"Wardrobes in Wartime: Fashion images during the First World War\"</a>\_at the \_Kulturforum in Berlin (25 September 2014 - 18 January, 2015).\_Overshadowed by Art Nouveau and the so-called Golden or Roaring Twenties, <strong>the period of WWI has all too often been overlooked by fashion historians.</strong>\n\nTo further illustrate the history of the Great War through the culture of fashion, Europeana Fashion has created a <a title=\"Fashion | 1814 - 1918 Pinterest\" href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/eurfashion/fashion-1914-1918/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a> with a selection of images from the Europeana Fashion portal and other sources that give<strong> a sense of how people dressed during the Great War</strong>.

        title: 'La Camicia Bianca by Ferré on Tumblr'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">This August, our Tumblr is dominated by the white shirts of Gianfranco Ferré. It is this simplest of pieces that the designer took and reinvented endlessly, resulting in extraordinary reincarnations. His masterpieces can now be enjoyed on our Tumblr.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-4640 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-08/10.1_1-665x716.jpg\" alt=\"ferre gianfranco artista leonardo salvini europeana fashion\"><em>GIANFRANCO FERRÉ | ARTISTA | F/W 1993. Photo: Leonardo Salvini</em></p>\n\nTo honor his work, the Gianfranco Ferré Foundation set up an exhibition around the white shirt specifically, aptly named <strong>\"The White Shirt According To Me. Gianfranco Ferré\"</strong>. This exhibition was first hosted by <a href=\"http://ferre.museodeltessuto.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museo del Tessuto in Prato</a> earlier this year.\n\nFor the exhibition and the catalogue, photographers Luca Stoppini and Leonardo Salvini photographed the best of Ferré's white shirts. Stoppini's images show the shirts in <strong>movement</strong> on the model, while Salvini's x-ray-like photos unveil the <strong>technical detailing</strong> of the shirts. It is the work of these photographers that is now on our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a>.\n\nNevertheless, <strong>white shirts were not the initial hallmark of Gianfranco Ferré</strong>. Trained as an architect, he made his first steps into the fashion world in the early 1970s when the jewellery he was making for friends and classmates was picked up by influential fashion buyers and editors.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-4641  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-08/01-665x856.jpg\" alt=\"gianfranco ferre sailor glam luca stoppini europeana fashion\"><em>GIANFRANCO FERRÉ | SAILOR GLAM | S/S 1982. Photo: Luca Stoppini</em></p>\n\nThroughout the seventies he worked for various Italian companies, designing accessoires, clothes and swimwear. His work for the\_San Giorgio Impermeabili clothing company based in India turned out to be most influential, as it gave him the chance to<strong> explore India's local craftmanship and culture of aesthetics\_</strong> that later resurfaced in his own work.\n\nBy 1978, he set up his own label for womenswear, adding menswear and Alta Moda over the course of the 1980s. In the same decade, he taught fashion in Milan and became creative director of Dior. Ferré left Dior in 1996 and continued working on his own house until he passed away after suffering a brain hemorrhage in 2007.\n\nThroughout his career, it was the <strong>white shirt that revealed his mastership of creativity in construction and shape</strong>. In \_the white shirt, Ferré reinvented structure, proportion and volume, drawing from his training as an architect and his travels.\n\n<a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Discover Ferré's white shirts on our Tumblr.</a>\n\n<em>The Gianfranco Ferré Foundation was established in 2008 and is dedicated to preserving the legacy of Gianfranco Ferré. The foundation is also an associate partner in the Europeana Fashion project.</em>"

These personal treasures are the subject of this month’s V&amp;A curation for the <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion tumblr blog</a>.\n\nSpanning the last 300 years, this <strong>6000 piece collection</strong> embodies the stories of childhood from birth to the formative teenage years. I like the idea of exploring fashion heritage to discover childhood; rather than dressing for success, following a trend or using fashion to seduce a crowd, these collections reflect the age of youth against a backdrop of social, cultural and political change.\n\nOne of my favourite collections is the <strong>children’s clothing that was made under the Utility Scheme during World War Two (1939-45)</strong>. This was an initiative by the UK government to control manufacturing and for people to be as resourceful as possible in a time of austerity. It is fascinating how today this culture of ‘make do and mend’ has been embraced by a new generation of fashion and design enthusiasts who aim to keep traditional skills and crafts alive, whilst also being inspired to create something innovative and new.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4659\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2008bu0150_jpg_ds_utility-red-coat-332x332.jpg\" alt=\"1940s utility scheme girl's coat russet wool england europeana fashion victoria and albert museum childhood \"><em>M.18-1985 Girl&#039;s coat and hat of russet wool, made in England under the Utility Scheme 1941-1948 ©Victoria and Albert Museum, London</em></p>\n\nThe Museum of Childhood collections mainly represent childhood from the UK. We do however hold some <strong>wonderful examples of European pieces</strong> including this 16th century Italian swaddling band, the oldest work in the collection.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4657 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2006aa5420_jpg_ds_swaddling-band-332x332.jpg\" alt=\"swaddling band italian 1600s victoria and albert museum london europeana fashion baby childhood\"><em>B.878-1993 Swaddling band; probably Italian, late 16th century © Victoria and Albert Museum,London</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4663\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/bonnet-hungarian-249x332.jpg\" alt=\"bonnet baby embroidered embbroidery pink silk lacy hungary 1920s victoria albert museum london europeana fashion childhood\"><em>B.382-1993 Baby&#039;s bonnet of embroidered pink silk trimmed with lace; Hungary, 1920-1929 ©Victoria and Albert Museum, London</em></p>\n\nThis ornate <strong>1920s Hungarian baby’s bonnet</strong> was bought by the donor in a baby’s clothes shop in Budapest as ‘antique’ when she was expecting her first child in 1943, and baby clothes were in short supply. Other highlights include a <strong>nappy made from fabric printed with the Union flag design</strong>, as a souvenir for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2002,\_and a <strong>Victorian swimming costume</strong> worn on trips to the seaside, a popular form of entertainment by the 1890s thanks to improvements in travel to English coastal towns.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4658\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2008bt9636_jpg_ds-union-jack-nappy-332x332.jpg\" alt=\"nappy cotton hemp union jack flag scotland ella's house 2002 victoria albert museum childhood london europeana fashion baby\"><em>B.8-2003 Cotton and hemp nappy with Union Jack flag design, made in Scotland by Ella&#039;s House in 2002 ©Victoria and Albert Museum, London/Ella’s House</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4664\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/tumblr_nb9nrmmbix1s0n7o6o1_400-332x332.jpg\" alt=\"1870s victorian swimming costume calico pin-stripes victoria albert museum london europeana fashion chilhood\"><em>MISC.102-1986 Victorian swimming costume made of white calico with printed red pin-strips, made in England between 1870 and 1880 ©Victoria and Albert Museum, London</em></p>\n\nFor me <strong>photographs provide a glimpse into the lives, experiences and memories of who we are or once were</strong> both in front of the lens and behind it. As I have been exploring the Museum of Childhood collections, I have been moved by the wonderful social observations of photographer John Heywood. He donated his collection entitled ‘My Family and other Children’, a photographic study of childhood spanning 40 years.\_The photographs perfectly capture the passage of time from birth to the formative teenage years, with clothing serving as an important part of our cultural heritage.\_Discover more about John Heywood's photography at the\_<a href=\"http://www.museumofchildhood.org.uk/collections/collecting-childhood-blog-2012/2013-year-collecting-childhood-blog/november-2013-cc-blog/photographers-childhood\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Childhood</a>.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4661\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2013gk1984-b.11-2003-a-new-cousin1-241x332.jpg\" alt=\"1980s new cousin baby john heywood card photograph victoria albert museum europeana fashion childhood\"><em>B.11-2003, ‘A New Cousin’ Black and White photograph mounted on card by John Heywood, 1987 ©Victoria and Albert Museum/John Heywood</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4656\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2013gk2563-b.65-2013-family-dwellings-332x227.jpg\" alt=\"photograph card john heywood family dwellings 1980s victoria albert museum london europeana fashion childhood\"><em>B.65-2013, ‘Family Dwellings ‘ Black and White photograph mounted on card by John Heywood, 1986 ©Victoria and Albert Museum/John Heywood</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4662\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2013gk2047-b.2802013-332x263.jpg\" alt=\"riviting stuff photograph card john heywood 1980s victoria albert museum london europeana fashion childhood\"><em>B.28-2013, ‘Riviting Stuff’ , Black and White photograph mounted on card by John Heywood, 1982 ©Victoria and Albert Museum/John Heywood</em></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4660\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-09/2010ed1316_jpg_ds_john-heyward-on-way-to-school-332x332.jpg\" alt=\"way to school photograph card john heywood 1980s victoria albert museum london europeana fashion childhood\"><em>Misc.1086-1992 On the Way to School, Black and White photograph mounted on card by John Heywood, 1982 ©Victoria and Albert Museum/John Heywood</em></p>\n\nWe hope you enjoy the V&amp;A’s curation and that it inspires you to flick back through your albums, reminisce about those forgotten fashions (including the ones you chose to forget!) and memories that shape who you are today.

CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\nTo take its 11-language fashion thesaurus to the next level, Europeana Fashion commissioned Hungarian fashion student David Ring to make an illustration of each object type in the thesaurus hierarchy. The goal: to create the <strong>first open digital visual thesaurus on fashion</strong>.\n\nEuropeana Fashion partners <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">MoMu – Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kmkg-mrah.be%2F&amp;ei=h18tVN3VG-Td7QbrrIHACg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnI9oo9SxEGhGvaHVltcQYQ98igw&amp;sig2=-rJ2P5eRgorqQZZXXL51Mw&amp;bvm=bv.76477589,d.ZGU\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels</a> teamed up with the newly founded <a href=\"http://be.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Belgium\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Belgium</a> to take the illustrations even further. They are working to digitise and release each of the approximately <strong>250 beautiful ink-on-paper illustrations under a CC0 license on Wikimedia Commons</strong>, before the end of October 2014.\n\nThe illustrations, basic in black-and-white and rich in detail, will not only serve to enhance searching Europeana Fashion content through visual classification or to support Wikipedia articles, but they could play an instrumental role in Europeana's goal to <strong>promote and enable greater re-use of cultural heritage resources</strong> by creative industries.\n\nDo you want to <strong>help us present this special project</strong> at the annual Europeana conference in Madrid on 30 and 31 October, then please vote before 8 October. \_It will only take 2-3 minutes of your time.

Trying to encompass the history of European fashion design, this month's selection shows the results of the work done by the partners in the Europeana Fashion project over the past two and a half years.\n\nSee the highlights on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> or explore of our collection in the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion portal</a>\_and let us know what your highlights are with #eurfashionhighlights."

This is important because fashion information on Wikipedia still needs a lot of improvement and that is why Europeana Fashion organises a series of fashion edit-a-thons. To help the volunteer editors, local Wikimedians help out and teach participants how to edit Wikipedia and the hosting museum makes available sources for participants to use.\n\nThe fashion edit-a-thon at <a href=\"http://www.mpu.rs/english/\" target=\"_blank\">MAA </a>on 18 October attracted 40 participants, from design students and their professors to Jelena Karakaš, topics editor of ELLE Serbia, and designers Ashok Murty and Valentina Obradović.\_Such a mix of particpants also made the event a great opportunity to exchange knowledge and network!\n\nTogether, the new editors worked on improving and adding nearly 20 fashion-related articles in Serbian under the guidance of <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Serbia\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Serbia</a>! For an overview of all the participants and articles, check out the <a href=\"https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0:%D0%A3%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE/%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0,_18._%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80_2014./\">Wikipedia page about the event</a>. To take a break from writing and to thank participants for their time and energy, MAA also offered a lunch and a tour of the museum.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-4793\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-11/ivanamadzarevic-d0-a1-d0-be-d0-bf-d1-81-d1-82-d0-b2-d0-b5-d0-bd-d0-be-d0-b4-d0-b5-d0-bb-d0-be-ccbysa-665x372.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Editing fashion on Wikipedia in Belgrade.

However, since they are on Wikimedia Commons, these images are now available for re-use to everyone! Have a look at the images <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion_Editathons\">here</a>.\n\nOn behalf of Europeana Fashion, we would like to thank the Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade and Wikimedia Serbia for organising such a fantastic edit-a-thon.

        title: 'Yves Saint Laurent’s Berber Cloak at Museo del Traje Madrid'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\">One of the collection highlights of Madrid’s Museo del Traje, which opened in 1925 with the aim of preserving and researching regional and historic costume, is a dark brown woolen cloak. At first glance, its traditionally dyed fiber, semi circular cut and peaked hood with dramatic fringed tassel could be of a study selection of ethnographic dress. However, upon closer inspection, it turns out that this garment was created in the shadow of the Eiffel tower, by none other than Yves Saint Laurent. It is lined in black taffeta and features delicate black silk embroidery. This garment is definitely a result of Yves Saint Laurent’s fascination with Morocco.\nArriving in the North African country in the late 1960s, Yves Saint Laurent and partner Pierre Bergé enjoy its rich culture, oriental mystique and comparatively liberal mindsets. Morocco during the 60s and 70s welcomes a cast of glamorous explorers. Ghettys, Agnellis and Rothschilds refurbish traditional mansions into the glittering meeting point of a Jet setting society; sun seekers framed by the country’s bountiful vegetation. Their life is beautifully portrayed in Pierre Berge’s 2014 book, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: A Moroccan Passion’ (Abrams).\nAfter a short stay at famous Marrakech hotel La Mamounia, Saint Laurent and Bergé purchase their first own Moroccan property in 1967. Located in the historic medina of Marrakech, ‘dar el Hanch’ – the House of the Serpent- offers ample space for the pair’s growing collection of traditional Berber art. Seven years later, the pair choose interior designer Bill Willis to turn ‘dar es Saada’, a house bordering the tranquil garden of painter Jacques Majorelle, into their new home. Willis signature is a combination of different orientalist styles with French colonial furniture last seen in 1920s Morocco. His combination of influences is similar to Yves Saint Laurent’s interpretation of far flung cultures for the Parisian catwalks.\nAfter Bergé’ and Saint Laurent move into ‘Villa Oasis’, Majorelle’s former studio, interior designer Jacqueline Froissac is to update the house to accommodate the designer’s guests. Meanwhile, at the newly appointed home, Jacques Grange and Willis collaborate on rooms celebrating separate epochs of Orientalism. These include dark woodcarvings, stencils and tapestries in ornate gold tones opposed to Grange’s 1930s inspired furniture, placed in the visually uplifting ‘Salon Vert’. Other rooms use colours found in Matisse’s modern masterpieces, from ’Still Life with Blue Table Cloth’ (1909) and the 1912 to 1913 finished ‘Moroccan Café’.\nThroughout their changes of homes, Bergé and Saint Laurent invest in traditional Berber art. The collection, spanning numerous artifacts from jewelry to woven fabrics, has recently been exhibited at the Fondation Pierre Bergé in Paris. The exhibition ‘Berber Women of Morocco’ (March to July 2014) focused on traditional crafts, skills and the sharing of stories through handiwork.\nTraditionally, the Imazighen, or singular Amazigh women cared for family and home, while men followed the natural graze cycle, supplying raw materials such as wool and plants for dyeing. Continuing the tradition of highly skilled crafts, objects such as Kilims display regional weaves, symbols and designs. The fringes adorning this Yves Saint Laurent cape, preserved at Museo del Traje, are a typical emblem of Morocco. An earlier exhibition, this time staged at Jardin Majorelle in 2011, collated Saint Laurent’s designs inspired by the country, stage set in the garden refurbished by the pair. A staggering 50 000 visitors reveled in a kaleidoscopic displays of saffrons, burned reds and light pinks, marveling at Turkish trousers and heavy embroideries.\nCloaks and capes can be traced throughout Yves Saint Laurent’s collections, acting as a canvas to different inspirations. A regal 1967 version is made of silver woven brocade and trimmed in white mink. A yellow faille de chine design with billowing Watteau sleeves and matching bow, one examples was in the wardrobe of Nan Kempner, could come straight of the pages of Saint Laurent’s well thumbed copy of Proust ‘À la Recherche du Temps Perdu’. Adorned with doves, scrolls and the word ‘ G Braques’ a 1988 cape pays homage to another icon. The Moroccan cloak, of which there exist other examples made of burgundy and cream wool or androgynous grey on grey pinstripe, offers a glimpse inside one of the Oran, Algeria native’s most enduring inspirations – the Maghreb.</p>\nReading List\n\nArticles:\nHazel Lubbock, ‘Yves Saint Laurent’s Moroccoan Legacy’ Condé Nast Traveller (link:http://www.cntraveller.com/news/2010/september/yves-saint-laurents-moroccan-legacy)\nMichael Kimmelman, ‘Art View: How the Spirit of Morocco Moved Matisse’, The New York Times 18.03.1990 (link: http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/18/arts/art-view-how-the-spirit-of-morocco-seized-matisse.html_\n‘Moroccan Interiors…Bill Willis Style’ on Eye for Design (link: http://eyefordesignlfd.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/moroccan-interiors-bill-willis-style.html)\n‘La Zahia: Villa Oasis’ on The Art of the Room (link: http://theartoftheroom.com/2013/02/la-zhahia-villa-oasis/)\nBooks:\nLisa Bernasek, ‘Artistry of the Everyday: Beauty and Craftsmanship in Berber Art (Peabody Museum Collections Series) ‘, Publisher: Peabody Museum Press (2009)\nLaurence Benaim, ‘Yves Saint Laurent’, Publisher: Librarie Generale Francaise (2010)\nPierre Berge, ‘Yves Saint Laurent, Les Derniers Jours de Babylone: Les Adieux a l’appartement d’Yves Saint Laurent et Pierre Berge’, Publisher: Editions du Regard (2013)\nPierre Berge, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: A Moroccan Passion’ , Publisher: Abrams (2014)\nHamish Bowles, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: Style’, Publisher: Harry N Abrams (2008)\nRobert Murphy, ‘The Private World of Yves Saint Laurent’, Publisher: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd (2009)\nAlice Rawsthorn, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: A Biography’, Publisher: Harper Collins (1997)"

Staatliche Museum zu Berlin, Photo: Stephan Klonk</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Fashion-Art-Works” is the title of the newly opened fashion gallery at the Berlin Kunstgewerbemuseum. For the first time, a Berlin museum is featuring three centuries of European Fashion history in a permanent exhibition, with 130 men’s and women’s dresses and just as many accessories from hat to shoe.</p>\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">A requirement for this project, unique not only in Berlin but in all of northern Germany, was the purchase of the Kamer/Ruf collection named after the two former owners. Its acquisition in 2003 allowed the Kunstgewerbemuseum to replace its rich inventory of garments that was almost entirely destroyed by the end of World War II. This extensive accession documents 300 years of European fashion history with exceptional objects from the arts of textiles and clothing. In all it contains 1572 items, among them 720 pieces of women's, men's and children's apparel and 852 accessories, from hat to shoe, including men's and women's undergarments.</p>\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The tumblr selection characterises the masterful quality of each object, be it a unique specimen or a piece of clothing produced in a small-scale series. It is always an item distinguished by a trend-setting concept, executed with the highest artisanal prowess.</p>\n\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">See the complete selection on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" title=\"Tumblr\">Tumblr</a>.

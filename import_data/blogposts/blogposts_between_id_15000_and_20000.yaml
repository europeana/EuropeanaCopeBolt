We are still presenting the fashion-and costume collections from European museums and institutions (over 540.000 items by now!), but you can now explore the collections in a completely new way. Let us fill you in on what is new.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2014/12/16/the-all-new-europeana-fashion/theme/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5038\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5038\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-12/theme-665x352.png\" alt=\"europeana fashion theme new fashion illustration\" width=\"665\" height=\"352\" /></a>\n\nThe first new feature is the theme section on top. You can <strong>discover items from the collections curated around a specific topic</strong>, such as prints or fashion illustration. The themes will be regularly refreshed, but you can still browse all previous themes via the theme menu on top. Immediately below the theme section, you can <strong>browse even more items gathered around more generic topics</strong>, such as sketches or couture.\n\nThe Europeana Fashion Tumblr is also part of the new website. For nearly two years, museums and brands around Europe have used our Tumblr as a platform to <strong>showcase content that has never been published online before</strong>. You can now see the latest posts on Tumblr directly on the website.\n\nSearching the collections in Europeana Fashion has also been altered. Items are now presented in a visual way, similar to Pinterest or Tumblr, letting your <strong>browse items more intuitively</strong>. However, when hovering over an image you can see a description of the item. You can still rely on the\_<strong>trustworthy information</strong> provided by the museum or institution hosting the item.\n\nAt Europeana Fashion, we continue to make improvements to make <strong>discovering Europe's best fashion-and costume collections an even better experience every time you visit</strong>. Do let us know your thoughts via communication@europeanafashion.eu or #eurfashion."

        body: "<h2><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">For the past two-and-half years, over twenty fashion museums and private institutions have been working on the Europeana Fashion project.Together, they are making their collections available online right here at Europeana Fashion.One special challenge when bringing all those collections together in one place is making them searchable and findable for everyone.\_After all, not all museums write information about their collection in the same language.</span></strong></span></h2>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2014-12/afbeelding2.png\" alt=\"\"><em>CC-BY-SA MoMu – ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen / Monica Ho</em></p>\n\nTherefore,\_all partners in the project worked \_together to make a <strong>fashion\_<a title=\"Thesaurus\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesaurus\" target=\"_blank\">thesaurus</a>\_in 11 languages</strong>. This thesaurus works in Europeana Fashion\_and automatically translates the keywords of the user. So if you type “skirt”, you automatically search for “rok” in Dutch, “falda” in Spanish and so on.\n\nHowever, Europeana Fashion wanted to take the thesaurus one step further and <strong>make a drawing of as many concepts in the thesaurus as possible</strong> . If you could search by selecting a picture of a skirt, it would not matter which language you spoke, because anyone can recognise a skirt!\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2014-12/afbeelding1.png\" alt=\"europeana fashion momu thesaurus gabrielle de pooter\"><em>CC-BY-SA MoMu – ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen / Monica Ho</em></p>\n\nTwo partners in Europeana Fashion worked on making this happen. The\_Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels and\_MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp asked\_<strong>Hungarian fashion student David Ring from the Antwerp Fashion Department\_</strong>to make these drawings.\n\nThe drawings turned so beautiful that Europeana Fashion did not want to keep them just for the website. We wanted\_everyone to \_be able to enjoy and re-use these drawings. Therefore, the project is working together with Wikimedia on making <strong>more than 350 of these drawings available on\_<a title=\"Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>\_under a Public Domain license</strong>, so anyone is free to use and edit the drawings.\n\n<strong>View the drawings on <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion_-_MoMu_-_thesaurus_drawings?uselang=nl\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>.\_</strong>"

        title: 'Yves Saint Laurent’s Berber Cloak at Museo del Traje Madrid'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px\">One of the collection highlights of Madrid’s Museo del Traje is a dark brown woolen cloak. At first glance, its semi circular cut and peaked hood with fringed tassel could be of a study selection of ethnographic dress. However, upon closer inspection, it turns out that this garment was created in the shadow of the Eiffel tower, by none other than Yves Saint Laurent.\_This garment is definitely a result of Yves Saint Laurent’s fascination with Morocco.</span></strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5092\" src=\"/files/fashion/2014-12/mtfce105050_r1-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"yves saint laurent ysl brown clock morroco europeana fashion museo del traje madrid\"><em>Yves Saint Laurent Berber Cloak. Collection Museo del Traje. CER.ES: Red Digital de Colecciones de museos de España. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Arriving in the North African country in the late 1960s, Yves Saint Laurent and partner Pierre Bergé enjoyed its rich culture, oriental mystique and comparatively liberal mindsets. <strong>Morocco during the 60s and 70s welcomed a cast of glamorous explorers.</strong> Ghettys, Agnellis and Rothschilds refurbished traditional mansions into the glittering meeting point of a jet setting society. Together with his childhood in Algeria, <strong>Yves Saint Laurent's stay in Morocco and experience with Maghreb culture would heavily influence his designs.</strong></p>\nAfter a short stay at famous Marrakech hotel La Mamounia, Saint Laurent and Bergé purchased their first own Moroccan property in 1967. Located in the historic medina of Marrakech, ‘dar el Hanch’ – the House of the Serpent- offered ample space for the pair’s <strong>growing collection of traditional Berber art</strong>.\n\nSeven years later, the pair chose interior designer Bill Willis to turn ‘dar es Saada’, a house bordering the tranquil garden of painter Jacques Majorelle, into their new home. His combination of <strong>influences is similar to Yves Saint Laurent’s interpretation of far flung cultures for the Parisian catwalks.</strong>\n\nAfter Bergé’ and Saint Laurent moved into Majorelle’s former studio, interior designer Jacqueline Froissac \_updated the house to accommodate the designer’s guests. The rooms were decorated in an Orientalist style with <strong>dark woodcarvings, stencils and tapestries in ornate gold tones opposed to 1930s furniture</strong>. Other rooms use colours found in Matisse’s modern masterpieces.\n\nThroughout their changes of homes, Bergé and Saint Laurent invested in traditional Berber art and this together with his <strong>North-African surroundings has strongly influenced Yves Saint Laurent's signature, exemplified by this cape in the Museo del Traje collection.</strong> The fringes adorning this Yves Saint Laurent cape, preserved at Museo del Traje, are a typical emblem of Morocco.\n\n<strong>Cloaks and capes can be traced throughout Yves Saint Laurent’s collections</strong>, acting as a canvas to different inspirations. The Moroccan cloak, of which there exist other examples offers a glimpse inside <strong>the Maghreb culture that surrounded Yves Saint Laurent throughout his life, from his childhood in Algeria to his adult life in Marrakech and Paris.</strong>\n<p align=\"justify\">Contribution: Felix Bischof</p>\n<strong>Further reading:</strong>\nHazel Lubbock, <a href=\"http://www.cntraveller.com/news/2010/september/yves-saint-laurents-moroccan-legacy\" target=\"_blank\">‘Yves Saint Laurent’s Moroccoan Legacy</a>’ Condé Nast Traveller\n<a href=\"http://eyefordesignlfd.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/moroccan-interiors-bill-willis-style.html\" target=\"_blank\">‘Moroccan Interiors…Bill Willis Style’</a> on Eye for Design\n‘<a href=\"http://theartoftheroom.com/2013/02/la-zhahia-villa-oasis/\" target=\"_blank\">La Zahia: Villa Oasis</a>’ on The Art of the Room\n\nPierre Berge, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: A Moroccan Passion’ , Publisher: Abrams (2014)\nLaurence Benaim, ‘Yves Saint Laurent’, Publisher: Librarie Generale Francaise (2010)\nHamish Bowles, ‘Yves Saint Laurent: Style’, Publisher: Harry N Abrams (2008<em>)</em>"

        title: 'Exhibition: "From Matrix to Sleeping Beauty"'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\">Costume, set designer and artist, António Lagarto (Trafaria, 1948) is the author of a vast work that includes photography and cinema, design and illustration, exhibition design and interior architecture. Graduate in Sculpture with a Master degree in Environmental Media, António Lagarto first began by exploring the fields of performance and installation. In 1978, after conceiving the set design for Ninguém (an adaptation of Frei Luís de Sousa by Almeida Garrett), he begins a path of over 30 years in which he has been creating set designs and costumes for theatre, dance, ballet and opera, in collaboration with Ricardo Pais, Jorge Lavelli, Robert Cohan, Fernanda Lapa, Cucha Carvalheiro, João Grosso, Nuno Carinhas, Paulo Ribeiro, Olga Roriz or Vasco Wellenkamp, among many others.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">From Matrix to Sleeping Beauty gives the opportunity to known the work of António Lagarto as a costume designer, presenting a selection of almost 300 pieces (clothing, hair props, jewellery and shoes) that have been worn by some of the most important actors, actresses and dancers to embody several characters of the national and international dramaturgical universe. To adequately visualize the aesthetic universe of António Lagarto and the way he works space, matter, body and light, he also signs the curatorship and exhibition design. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">For more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/exposicoes/from-matrix-to-sleeping-beauty_7.html\">MUDE - From Matrix to Sleeping Beauty.</a></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>This January, our Europeana Fashion Tumblr has been curated by Biblioteca Luigi Chiarini, Rome, featuring a selection of costume sketches from their collection! </strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-01/13_caro-bugiardo-230x332.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5468\"><em>Collection Biblioteca Luigi Chiarini. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The \"Luigi Chiarini\" Library contains a large section dedicated to Fashion and Costumes, which consists of over a thousand bibliographical documents and a wonderful collection of original  sketches for costume-designs for cinema, television or theatre of over two thousand drawings. It was originally set up to provide educational material to meet the specific needs of students on the Costume and Scenery course at the National Cinema School. However, over the years, the section has also been increasingly used by costume designers already established in their professional field. The Section contains many richly-illustrated books and a large collection of fashion magazines representing this wonderful form of illustration, many of which are very rare and date back to the mid-1800s. It is composed of bibliographical and documentary material, in particular we remember the costume and fashion designers’s  Adriana Berselli,  Marisa D’Andrea, Vera Marzot, Gino Carlo Sensani, Piero Tosi and Alberto Verso collections. These make up a rare collection, related not just to theatre and film costumes and fashion over the centuries, but also to the history of art, to furniture, to the decorative and graphic arts, and to photography.</p>\n\nVisit our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/tagged/lccuration\">Tumblr</a> to see the complete curation and more!"

        title: 'Report on the Fashion Edit-a-thon in Athens'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation organized along with PostScriptum, the company which implements the ESPA program \"The PFF in the digital era\", Wikipedia (Edit-a-thon) on fashion and Greek  costumes last week. The event was organized in tandem with volunteers from Wikimedia Greece and the company PostScriptum, who works with the foundation on the programme “The Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation in the digital era\".</strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-02/10408629_10152646884017405_6178669836473278251_n-332x284.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5497\"><em>A picture of the Edit-a-thon in Athens. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The theme of the editathon, with <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Collection_of_the_Peloponnesian_Folklore_Foundation\">rich materials from Greek costume tradition</a>, inspired fashion designers, folklore experts, costume designers, fashion historians and museologists to engage and enrich Wikipedia with entries relevant to the subject. The event took place on Saturday, February 7th at Harokopion University, which was an excellent host.Its students responded with great interest and compiled exceptional articles on the world’s free encyclopedia.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The event started with the welcoming speech from Ms. Ioanna Papantoniou, President and Founder of the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation and Mrs. Georgitsoyanni, Vice Rector of Academic Affairs and Personnel of Harokopio University. They were followed by a brief presentation from Hercules Varlamis, Deputy Representative of  Harokopio in the Greek Free/Open Source Software Society (GFOSS), which fully supports open culture efforts in Greece. Kostas Konstantinidis, owner of PostScriptum, Angeliki Roumeliotis, Head of Collections at PFF and Wikipedia editors Manos Kefalas and Paul Stamou followed suit with explanations about their involvement with Greek fashion culture and Wikipedia. Of great interest was the speech of Mr. Yannis Tseklenis, a well-known designer, who honored the event and riveted the audience with his talk about Greek Fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-02/10953291_10152646883532405_2898296412400542825_n-332x221.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5498\"><em>A picture of the Edit-a-thon in Athens. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The crowd was a varied one. Fashion designers, costume designers, dramaturgists, academics with expertise in folklore, textiles etc., museologists, computer science instructors, art historians, historians, fashionistas and teachers attended the talk. Sixteen participated in writing articles and, as they assured us, will continue to do so, in order for Greek Wikipedia to be enriched in relation with knowledge about Greek fashion.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The participants had online sources available, as well as books provided by Harokopion University and the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation. Moreover, the organisers uploaded a unique selection of images in <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Collection_of_the_Peloponnesian_Folklore_Foundation\">Wikimedia Commons</a> in order for the participants to have materials available for the illustration of the articles.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In addition, three Wikipedia editors were present to solve any question that arose. Furthermore, the two days that preceded, training sessions in article writing had taken place, organized by the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation and PostScriptum under the ESPA framework, and were combined with the Edit-a-thon as a supportive action.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Coffee and lunch breaks accompanied the event, while sangria and a toast to everyone who participated in the action completed the happening.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In brief, organizers and participants left very content, promising to continue this effort over time.</p>\n\n\n<em>Report by Vasia Pierrou, PostScriptum</em>"

        title: 'Madrid Hosts its Very First Fashion Edit-a-thon'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The capital of Spain is home to a range of renowned museums and classy inhabitants. One of these museums is dedicated to fashion and costumes: Museo del Traje. This Europeana Fashion partner, together with enthusiasts from Spain’s Wikipedia volunteers, organised our ninth Fashion Editathon on the premises of DIMAD Central de Diseño at Matadero Madrid.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Almost three years ago, Museo del Traje joined Europeana Fashion, a major European project aiming to increase fashion and costume collections' visibility online. The initiative includes  the most important museums of fashion and costume in Europe. By the end of the project, in February this year, Museo del Traje will have contributed almost 17,500  pieces from its collections.  700 of these digital objects come from the museum’s extensive fashion library.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">One of the key aims for the museum is to present the fashion and historical evolution of clothing in Spain. It aims to enhance research tools in this area and therefor the idea of hosting . An edition of the project’s series of edit-a-thons fell onto fertile ground. For those who haven’t followed the blog: ‘editathons’ are events in which bloggers, writers, students and curators come together to improve articles on Wikipedia.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Spanish fashion community had already expressed its disappointment with the lack of quality information available  in Spanish online. The edit-a-thon meant a step forward and wanted to change the current situation by improving Wikipedia articles related to fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-02/editat-c3-b3n_europeana_fashion_madrid_2015_-_150124_150131-332x221.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5490\"><em>Photo: Edit-a-thon Europeana Fashion, Madrid 2015. By Barcex. Available under license CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The fashion edit-a-thon took place in Madrid on 24 January. It, attracted 53 participants, almost 20 of which followed the activity online. Participants included students, designers, fashion bloggers, professors and people who simply love fashion. </p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.es/wiki/Portada\">Wikimedia Spain</a>, whose volunteers had recently organised <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.wikimedia.org%2F2014%2F10%2F17%2Ffirst-editathon-on-the-spanish-language-and-literature-in-madrid%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzyFo5xWUCJWRTxo9cAiAYfAxyEQ\">a massive editathon at the National Library of Spain</a>, made sure Wikimedians were there to explain how Wikipedia work. Most participants had no previous experience with uploading content to or writting for the online encyclopedia. As we’ve seen with other fashion edit-a-thons, the topic is especially attractive to female writers, a trend that sets them apart from many other so-called GLAMwiki events.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Due to technical reasons, the activity could not be hosted at the Museo del Traje itself. Thanks to the hospitability of the Central de Diseño (DIMAD) we were able to develop the activity as scheduled. The museum’s collections department worked on a list of articles proposed to be edited and its library offered more than 90 sources to consult related to theose articles.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It was an incredibly successful event, which gathered new participants, brought together shared interests and helpful feedback from the editors. Thanks to this fashion edit-a-thon, today there is more than 32 % new fashion-related content on Wikipedia in Spanish, and this figure is going to be increasing progressively because editors promised to continue working on their own. To get an overview of all that was accomplished, check <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fes.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWikipedia%3AEncuentros%2FEditat%25C3%25B3n_Europeana_Fashion%23Usuarios&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEObiLQHxb7_n9OlbEFeEzWY4CzaQ\">Wikipedia event’s page</a> or take a peek behind the scenes with this <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion_Editathon_in_Madrid\">collection of event photos</a>.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-02/editat-c3-b3n_europeana_fashion_madrid_2015_-_150124_165303-332x249.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5491\"><em>Photo: Edit-a-thon Europeana Fashion, Madrid 2015.

Available under license CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">From the Museo del Traje we want to thank Wikimedia whose, volunteers who work on the idea of spreading the free knowledge. Their mission inspired uss is to organise similar events in the future.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">We also want to express our gratitude to the organisers of the edit-a-thon at Biblioteca Nacional who shared their experiences with us, and finally to DIMAD Centro de Diseño for making available their location. We encourage other institutions to carry out this activity!</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion International Conference 2015 Antwerp: Digital Fashion Futures (Day 1)'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Tuesday 24 February\_simultaneously marked the start of the\_<em>Digital Fashion Futures</em>\_conference and the end of the three year run of the Europeana Fashion project. </strong>\n\nThe first conference day started off with some reflections by Europeana Fashion’s team leader, Dieter Suls. Suls explained the technical aspects of the fashion heritage portal, but also talked about the development of the collaboration between all the different European partners. In the course of the day many subjects were touched upon, and many questions were raised. Below, a summary is given of all keynote lectures, panel discussions and relevant questions that were raised by the audience.\n\n \n\n<strong>Development of the Europeana Fashion Project</strong>\n\nOver the last three years, the Europeana Fashion project has become more than an aggregator of the digitized content and metadata of the existing fashion collections of its partners. Today the project not only encourages and supports collaborations between institutions, it also promotes user participation and contribution to the expanding content of Europeana Fashion. Although the collaborating institutions had to review their performance in an increasingly digitized world due to the targets of this project, all participating partners have decided to open up their archives to Europeana Fashion, and, in doing so, to the rest of their international network.\n\n<a title=\"Europeana Fashion team leader Dieter Suls' Opening lecture by Europeana Fashion, on Flickr\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeana-fashion/16446227500\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-03/16446227500_a8fa4e562a_z.jpg\" alt=\"Europeana Fashion team leader Dieter Suls' Opening lecture\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /></a>\n\n \n\n<strong>Digital Fashion and Academia</strong>\n\nIn the panel discussion ‘Digital Fashion and Academia’, chairman Caroline Evans focused on the influences the digital world has had, and will have, upon the different educational practices relating to the field of fashion, and the\_ different ways in which scientific research has changed due to the expansion of this digital world. The panel concluded that due to the quality of the digital to enable the image of fashion to be distributed internationally at enormous speeds and in a wide variety of formats, it has impacted all aspects of fashion and its related academic practises. For example, fashion websites have not only changed fashion journalism, but the rest of fashion academia as well. For the first time in history fashion brands publish photographs of their whole collection online. Although fashion journalism and photography in itself is nothing new, the status of the image has changed as a result. One of the remarks made during the panel discussion is that the <strong>digital image nowadays should be considered as more than just a representation of the tangible.</strong>\n\n \n\nAnother conclusion was that since it is possible to deposit all recorded files online, there is a need for a certain focus; currently an overload of information is found on the internet. Therefore, decisions have to be made concerning what to collect and how to represent these collections in a clear manner. One overall observation by the panel was that the web has had an enormous impact on our media, on the academia and on the way we perceive fashion. Although in the past some have worried about the disruption the digital media would create with respect to print, it has become clear that it is an evolution rather than a revolution.\n\n<strong>\_</strong>\n\n<strong>Engaging Communities</strong>\n\nIn the following lecture, keynote speaker Tamsen Young from the Museum at FIT in New York spoke about how the FIT is changing the way it represents its exhibitions online. In the past, all exhibitions at the museum had a personalised website. However, one of the technological difficulties the FIT faced were the many different kinds of screens their website had to adapt to. Therefore, it was necessary for Young to develop a standardized format for the websites so they could be displayed on all digital devices. Young also mentioned in her lecture that the museum is aiming at an interactive communication with its visitors through the use of digital media: <strong>‘In the age of digital reproduction everyone is a potential broadcaster; and these days museums are opening their doors to these different voices.’ </strong>\n\n<strong>\_</strong>\n\n<strong>The Digital Future of Academic Fashion Publishing</strong>\n\nAnna Wright, senior commission editor of Bloomsbury Publishing, spoke about the\_<strong>changing role of publishers in the age of the web</strong>. Fashion research can thrive online. Bloomsbury is aiming to serve researchers by providing everything they need on just one platform. Although the prospect of resources becoming fairly easy to find, the discussion afterwards posited some concerns among researchers. Wouldn’t the resources be tainted by the ones who provide them, because of too little critical evaluation on the website itself?\n\nAnna Wright, senior commission editor of Bloomsbury Publishing, spoke about the <strong>changing role of publishers in the age of the web</strong>. Due to the abundance of images and information online fashion research is able to thrive. While Bloomsbury aims at providing a platform (Bloomsbury Fashion Central) containing a large amount of information concerning fashion, the audience raised the question whether or not this is a favourable option. In order to do a critical scientific research, students and academics are accustomed to consulting a variety of different sources. If the information is provided by one organisation, how could one be certain the information on this platform is critically evaluated, and therefore, useful for scholars?\n\n<a title=\"Kaat Debo and Karen Van Godtsenhoven from MoMu in the audience by Europeana Fashion, on Flickr\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeana-fashion/16633380565\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-03/16633380565_05b8589fd3_z.jpg\" alt=\"Kaat Debo and Karen Van Godtsenhoven from MoMu in the audience\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" /></a>\n\n \n\n \n\n<strong>The Future of Fashion Journalism in the Digital Age</strong>\n\nRepresentatives of various fashion magazines, that publish in print, online or both, elaborate on the goals and perspectives of their magazines. The main focus lay on the perceived dichotomy between the romanticism of print media and the commercial necessity of digital. Questions were raised concerning the gains and the losses in printed versus digital media. One of the advantages of publishing online is that the financial cost is considerably lower compared to publishing in print, since printed magazines are in need of certain amounts of sponsoring. A concern raised by Karen Van Godtsenhoven is that there seems to be a need for speed in the publishing of information: <strong>‘There seems to be a pressure in fashion journalism causing the need for everybody to cover the newest of the newest.</strong> For instance, publishing about previews of exhibitions. Then who covers the <em>real</em> exhibition?’ It was decided that online media is able to cover this speed, although the panel signalled that this speed could become problematic. It was questioned whether or not there is any room left for the in depth coverage of fashion.\n\n \n\n<strong>Walking Dinner at MoMu</strong>\n\nA fruitful day filled with discussion and relevant questions was brought to an ended with a wonderful walking dinner in the MoMu. During a stroll down the beautiful exhibition <em>Dries van Noten: Inspirations</em> we were able to discuss our findings and the sentiments expressed and explored during the day. The conclusion of the day would be: <strong>Just experiment, develop by doing.</strong>\n\n \n\nOn behalf of Europeana Fashion,<strong> thank you all for such an inspiring day!</strong>\n\nText contributed by Modemuze"

        body: "<strong>After a first day of speeches and lectures it was time to put all information of day 1 into practice on the second day of the Europeana Fashion Conference ‘Digital Fashion Futures’. </strong>\n\n<strong>Through workshops and panel discussions about intellectual property, <em>usage of the Europeana Fashion platform</em>, <em>prosumers and fashion online</em> and what <em>skills and competences are needed in a digital fashion era</em>, the audience became an active participant during these sessions. The aim was to motivate, inspire and hand out tools to everyone for their journey of sharing historical costumes and collections in an online database.</strong>\n\n \n\n<strong>New chances for the future</strong>\n\nIn her opening lecture Mila Ernst, project leader of Modemuze connects the themes of the day to the development of the project. Modemuze is an online platform initiated by seven Dutch museums and aims to connect their fashion and costume collections and present them as a source of inspiration to a broad audience of fashion lovers and professionals.\n\n“Years of knowledge can be shared with the general public!”, says Mila Ernst. “<strong>It is an age where consumers become prosumers.</strong> There is so much knowledge amongst us.” Ernst described a subculture of people who have a fascination for historical costumes and are called re-enactors. They design their own dresses and wear them for historical dancing and accompanying soirees. There is a lot of knowledge hidden there.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-03/16436268517_645b1963b1_z.jpg\" alt=\"Mila Ernst introduces ModeMuze on the second conference day\"><em>CC-BY-SA Erwin Verbruggen/Europeana Fashion</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left\">And what about the costume pinners on Pinterest who yearn for more historical clothing online? Through Modemuze and Europeana Fashion, they will be able to access databases filled with items from their favorite times.</p>\nIn order to achieve this, it is clear that collaboration with other parties is the key. As such, Modemuze works together with Europeana Fashion. The goal of Modemuze is to have more interactions with the general public.\n\nFor example, a group of fashion students got the opportunity to visit the archives of the Dutch Rijksmuseum to see the amount of treasures that are stored there. ”<strong>Online presence is a must. Interests are merging. The digital world opens up new chances for the future!</strong>”, says Mila Ernst.\n\n \n\n<strong>Interacting with your audience</strong>\n\nIn her lecture, Kaat Debo Director of MoMu (Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp) couldn’t agree more. \_But she expresses that <strong>analog and digital can coincide and complement each other</strong>. Kaat Debo explains that awareness and a digital strategy were needed in every department of the museum in order to become interactive with their public and digitalize their collections.\n\nTogether with the Artesis University College Antwerp they started the project ‘Open Fashion’. This is a<strong> database of the collections and library of MoMu, student portfolios from the Royal Academy of Arts and the Contemporary Fashion archive</strong> – an information network on the fashion industry set up through a cooperation between five European institutions.\n\nArchiving and structuring their database seems to be a tough task for MoMu. “Not all the images can be uploaded due to intellectual property”, explains Debo. They try to solve this by making <strong>as much agreements with designers as possible</strong>. Another issue that occurs, is having an easy access digital management system comes with a price. Funding is needed.\n\nOn a positive note, however, MoMu receives many compliments on the way they interact and communicate with their audience through Facebook and Instagram. They notice that<strong> these mediums have a higher speed and reach a larger audience</strong>.\n\nBut it does not stop there. Building <strong>a 10 square meter interactive wall at the entrance of the museum</strong> was another stepping stone in their digital adventure. Visitors and people who walk by can swipe and press on fashion images related to the museum and get information about them.\n\nWhat is next for this museum? For the future Kaat Debo sees an opportunity of<strong> uploading images from the archives on your smartphone</strong>. She also feels that having a shared donations tool gives the future an interesting perspective. Maybe it is even possible to donate an euro by using your fingerprint in an app? Who knows.\n\n \n\n<strong>Influence of online developments, a workshop hosted by Modemuze</strong>\n\nClearly, <strong>online developments influence the professional attitude of everyone working in the fashion sector</strong>. In the workshop ‘Virtually Everyone’ – headed by Rachid Naas – a wide variety of the sector’s opinions were represented and dicussed.\n\nPanel member Branko Popovich for instance, who is co-director of FASHIONCLASH and a freelance reporter, feels that online developments in terms of social media give him more creative freedom. “In the past we only had social networking sites such as Hyves and Myspace. There are so many new websites now. <strong>Borders disappear</strong>. Designers out of different countries come and join FASHIONCLASH. It gives more creativity.” FASHIONCLASH connects talent, various disciplines, cultures and a broad audience through fashion events and projects such as the annual FASHIONCLASH festival.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-03/16642579832_48e7ac17ae_z.jpg\" alt='The panel of the workshop Virtually Everyone: \"Prosumers\" and Fashion Online'><em>CC-BY-SA Erwin Verbruggen/Europeana Fashion</em></p>\n\nJonathan Chippindale of Holition hopes that this discussion about digitalisation does not occur in the future anymore. ‘<strong>Your digital and business strategy should be the same. There are new challenges</strong>. We are experimenting, fear, risk but also huge opportunities. Which are difficult but exciting!’, he says enthusiastically. His company Holition, based in the UK, uses emerging technology to create digital experiences that bridge the gap between technology and retail.\n\nSteven Dahlberg, who is the Fashion Director of men’s magazine JFK, feels that their magazine cannot be replaced by a digital version. ‘We make a magazine to be something people want to keep and save. <strong>Internet cannot replace the feel and smell of paper</strong>.’\n\n \n\n<strong>Intellectual property and using the Europeana Fashion platform</strong>\n\nSharing collections from archives of museums online is a great and innovative idea, but some of the images are copyrighted as Kaat Debo mentioned in her lecture. The panel discussion “handling intellectual property in fashion images”, chaired by V&amp;A’s Roxanne Peters, gives some directions for where to look for answers. Know the rules of intellectual property of the country you are in! Right management of intellectual property is everything. <strong>Be practical, protect yourself and manage your risks.</strong>\n\nLuckily there is always an opportunity to use the Europeana Fashion platform to your advantage. In the workshop “Using the Europeana Fashion platform. Tools, best practices and user cases”, panelists described their experiences in using the platform by providing their digital content to it. <strong>Even if abbreviations such as ‘API’ or ‘HTML’ scare you, you will be able to join the Europeana Fashion content pool</strong> and learn all about how to do this, explains Ykje Wildenborg from Centraal Museum Utrecht.\n\nAnd it is true, with so much information on new trends and developments one can feel lost and uneducated on these topics. Although it did not become quite clear how to overcome the challenges of the internet from the workshop ‘Skills and competences for the Digital Fashion Era’, there was<strong> a lot of space for experiences and information from some of the panelists</strong>.\n\nVirtual Fashion Designer Jacob Kok for instance gave the audience the opportunity to experience virtual reality in a fashion environment by placing a virtual reality 3D device on their heads.\n\n \n\n<strong>The End</strong>\n\nIn the closing session ’Europeana Fashion: Communicating Fashion Heritage Online’ communication director at Europeana Fashion Allessandra Arezzi Boza focused on the project’s Tumblr. They share never seen before collections for users to get inspired and share online. On their Tumblr they came up with a curation idea called: ‘SHOWCASE’, where participants have been asked to select some images from the Europeana Fashion database to illustrate what fashion heritage means to them.\n\nThis Europeana Fashion conference marks the end of three year collaboration between the initiating partners of the project and partners that have joined the project along the way. The road towards the online fashion database has been paved and many challenges overcome, but as the conference experiences indicate: there is still a lot to be achieved also. <strong>Both Europeana Fashion and Modemuze will continue to research and adapt their presence on the web and the way they connect to the larger fashion and costume domain</strong>."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>The American Alliance of Museums Media and Technology Professional Network awared the Europeana Fashion series of Fashion edit-a-thons for a <!-- [gold] [silver] [bronze] [honorable mention] --> 2015 bronze MUSE award in the \"Open\" category!\_</strong>\n\n \n\n<strong><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2015/04/27/muse-award-for-europeana-fashions-edit-a-thons/fashioneditathonlogo/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5608\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-04/fashioneditathonlogo-332x73.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"332\" height=\"73\" /></a></strong>\n\n \n\n \n\nThe award was announced yesterday at the MUSE Awards champagne reception, which took place at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. Earlier winners of the award include the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, who received a silver MUSE award for their use of digital media to enhance the museum experience and engage audiences.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5612\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-04/muzejirade.files_.wordpress.com-dsc_0103-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Image taken at the Belgrade Fashion edit-a-thon. Photo credit: Tina Kaplani.</em></p>\n\nEuropeana Fashion organized <a title=\"List of Fashion Editathons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Fashion_Edit-a-thons#List_of_Fashion_Edit-a-thons\" target=\"_blank\">twelve edit-a-thons in nine countries</a> in collaboration with local Wikimedia chapters and volunteers from the community. Some of the edit­a­thons were supported by third-party organizations.\n\nThe work in all of them focused on asking museum partners to open their doors to invite in would-be editors of Wikipedia, attract Wikipedia volunteers to help organize the event, add media from Europeana Fashion content partners to the Wikimedia Commons platform and subsequently use these images for relevant articles on Wikipedia.\n\nWhen after the first few edit-a-thons we felt comfortable with the formula, we also attempted a parallel set of edit­a­thons that shared the same theme with an additional online challenge, and explored the possibilities of hosting a GLAM-Wiki collaborative event in the framework of a larger cultural or fashion-related festival.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5611\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-04/muzejirade.files_.wordpress.com-dsc_0105-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Image taken at the Belgrade Fashion edit-a-thon. Photo credit: Tina Kaplani.</em></p>\n\nThe events were organized in order to reach specialists from the fashion domains, students and existing Wikipedia editors, with the stress on a particular target group shifting from event to event. We look back on the series having learned a lot from all the different people that took part and attended and look forward to continuing working to improve and share fashion knowledge on the world's free and collaborative encyclopaedia!\n\n<strong>For the full story on our Fashion Edit-a-thon series, read our project report\_<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2015/04/27/muse-award-for-europeana-fashions-edit-a-thons/d6-6_wikipedia-report-ii_final/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5592\">D6-6_wikipedia-report-ii_final</a> [PDF] or, alternatively, browse the images we've made openly available on <a title=\"Commons Category: Europeana Fashion\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Fashion_Edit-a-thons\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2015/04/27/muse-award-for-europeana-fashions-edit-a-thons/dia07/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5656\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5656\" src=\"/files/fashion/2015-04/dia07-665x498.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"665\" height=\"498\" /></a>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Have a look at this month Tumblr curation featuring ethnic and ethnic inspired fashion and costumes from Europeana Fashion Archive!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Fashion always had a fascination with the exotic. It is not only as a source of inspiration, but is a way through the otherness, the foreign. It can be a travel in the Persian inspired world of Paul Poiret’s “Thousand and Second Night” ball, or in the fierce  Africa of Yves Saint Laurent’s 1967 collection, or into the frozen Russian-Balkan folklore of John Galliano’s AW 2009/10 show.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-06/john_galliano_aw09_044.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5695\"><em>John Galliano&#039;s FW 2009/10  Russian and Balkan inspired collection.  Photo by Etienne Todoir. Collection Catwalkpictures. All rights reserved. </em></p></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sometimes a synonym of wealth and lush, with its rich embroideries and bright colored details, or that of a dogmatic reverence to a rigid monochromatic spiritualism, ethnic costumes got through the history of fashion and still they are present in nowadays catwalks. It’s never about copying, it’s always about a feeling or a way to see things, which is translated in the designer collection to bring freedom, freshness and a break up with traditional aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-06/b73_1076_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5696\"><em>Man’s hooded cape, Morocco, late 19th century - early 20th century.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<b><p align=\"justify\">“Give a girl the right shoes, and she can conquer the world.” said Marilyn Monroe.</p></b>\n<p align=\"justify\">Shoes play an important role in common imagery: they talk about the wearer’s social role and attitudes. They also rouse people fancy as an object of desire, a symbol of power and feminine seduction. Fairy tales and folklore talks about shoes as a magic object with special qualities in fast travelling or social climbing, as we learned from Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz” and in Cinderella’s story.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-06/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5708\"><em>&quot;Invisible Naked Version&quot; von Andreia Chaves, 2011 Photograph by Andrew Bradley © Courtesy of Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Europeana Fashion partner Victoria and Albert Museum hosts the exhibition “Shoes: Pleasure and Pain” from 13th June 2015 to 31st January 2016.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Europeana Fashion Archive is full of object with a story. Explore the one behind these amazing shoes from Australia belonging to the Shoes Or No Shoes Museum collection! </strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Commonly – and improperly – named Kurdaitcha, the actual name of this particular pair of shoes is Interlinia in North Australia or Intathurta in South Australia. They belong to a ritual which was in use in Australian Aboriginal culture and they were worn by a ritual executioner called Kurdaitcha.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/15.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5778\"><em><em>Kurdaitcha shoes, Australia, middle 20th century. Collection SONS. All rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Made of woven emu feathers, stitched with human or camel hair and blood, these oval shaped shoes have an opening in the center that allows the foot to enter. In order to be worn, the Kurdaitcha should undergo a particular ritual which consisted in dislocating the ball of his small toe of either foot with the application of a heated stone. Full of a spiritual and ritual meaning, when not in use, the shoes should be wrapped in kangaroo skin or hidden in sacred place.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The figure of Kurdaitcha belongs to the tradition of the Aboriginal beliefs, for which death is usually brought by the magic influence or a curse of some individual. When the alleged murder was discovered, a council of old men belonging to the group to which the dead man was part might have been organized and, if it decided that the avenge should take place, a Kurdaitcha, the avenger, was chosen among the group.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/1467.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5779\"><em><em>Aranda tribe Kurdaitcha shoes, Australia middle 20th century. Collection SONS. All rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The ways this could be performed were different, but the most peculiar one was that of the bone pointing. A bone, charged of spiritual and magical energy, was pointed to the designated victim, who eventually died after few time. His death, induced by the belief of the curse, was inevitable, and that way the avenge was accomplished.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Explore thousands of other interesting objects in<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=sons#dataProviders%3DShoes%20or%20no%20shoes\"> Europeana Fashion</a> and visit our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> to have a look at this month curation featuring ethnic and ethnic inspired fashion and costumes!</p>"

        title: 'Calcio Storico at Pitti Uomo 88!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>On the eve of the latest edition of Pitti Uomo, Florence’s streets were stepped again by “Guelfi” and “Ghibellini”, historical factions of the city, ready to face themselves in match of “calcio storico”. </strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The 540 figurants first marched through the city to later meet in Piazza Santa Croce. There an arena was staged to reenact the match which took place the 17th February 1530, when the city of Florence was sieged by the imperial ranks of Carlo V and the inhabitants, to show their disregard to the situation, held the game which is now part of the city eternal history.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/calcio-storico_18-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5800\"><em><em>Photo: studioquagli.com Courtesy of Pitti Immagine. All rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Traditionally played by the aristocrats wearing their house’s livery, “calcio storico” is a form of football that was popular in Italy during the 16th century, from which the current football game evolved. Appallingly violent, the match, which lasts 50 minutes, features two opponents teams composed by 27 men whose aim is to score a point, called “caccia”, into the opponent’s net.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The colourful liveries worn by the figurants, each perfectly conserved or recreated, show the importance of the recovery of historical tradition and costumes, an issue supported by different Italian designers, who are frequently inspired by Italian history and customs. Indeed Emilio Pucci designed some of its iconic prints inspired by the effigies and liveries of “calcio storico”.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/fo03533b-665x936.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5801\"><em><em>Emilio Pucci models with prints inspired by &quot;calcio storico&quot;.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>An artwork is great as it suits to every era, so we can evaluate the preciousness of haute couture products in the measure they are continuously showed in exhibitions and museums. This month <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> curation of Europeana Fashion is about haute couture as a celebration of beauty.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Discover Fashion Exhibitions currently showed in international museums in <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventoverview.html\">Europeana Fashion Events</a> area.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Ever since the extravagances of the court of Louis XIV (1638-1715), French fashion trends have been an inspiration for the rest of Europe. Later on in the 18th century Rose Bertin, who was Minister of Fashion to Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), was the first celebrated French fashion designer. From then the inimitable Parisian elegance established the reputation of French couture throughout the world.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/mude.m.0597.01-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5814\"><em><em>Silk evening dress embroidered. Christian Dior, 1954. Courtesy of MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Haute Couture as we now know it these days originated in the 19th century. It was Charles Frederick Worth, the Father of Haute Couture, who can be called the first modern couturier. In 1858 he introduced some important innovations such as showing his dresses on live models, which pleased his aristocratic clients immensely.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In the early years of the twentieth century, Paul Poiret started a change introducing dresses and fragrances production for wide distribution. The couture had its pick after the second world war with the popular appeal of Christian Dior's \"New Look\" in 1947. This innovation was successful due to Dior's knowledge about history of costume.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The couturiers produce dresses like works of art, it ensures that the outfit you are wearing is absolutely unique and the excellence of craftsmanship is the added value. Extensive work goes into the creation of an haute couture garment. About 100-150 hours of manual work go into the making of a day outfit such as a suit. Evening dresses with embroidery can require several 1000 hours of work.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Have a look to haute couture dresses selection from Europeana Fashion Archive on our <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>!</strong></p>"

The Origin of Fashion Magazines” is held from 12 June to 27 September 2015 in the Philips Wing of the Rijksmuseum. The exhibition, designed by designer and co-curator Christian Borstlap, in collaboration with fashion illustrators Piet Paris and Quentin Jones,  collects in more than 300 prints the change in women's and men's fashion from the year 1600 up to and including the first half of the 20th century, and the development of the fashion magazine into the fashion glossies we know today.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/2012fpdd4032_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5831\"><em><em>&quot;Voici mes ailes!&quot;;.

Magazines collected colored figures of models wearing fashionable clothes, often pictured in tableaux and reporting a short description. While most illustrators engraved every model with detailed precision to illustrate the garment paying attention to the reality, some others artists developed a personal style that made them recognizable. George Lepape, Erté and Paul Iribe were in fact usually involved by the great couturiers of their time to represents their creations.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Europeana Fashion collects a wide selection of beautiful fashion prints. Some of them belongs to the collection of Lipperheide Costume Library, that collects the prints of the fashion magazine printed by Franz and Frieda Lipperheide, which they generously donated to the Royal Museums in Berlin in 1899, Germany.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/emuseumplus-1-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5826\"><em><em>Illustrated Fashion Magazine, Franz Joseph Lipperheide. © Anna Russ.

        title: 'Goodbye Micol Fontana'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Micol Fontana, the Italian couturier loved by Hollywood Divas, died on the 12 of June at the age of 101. The designer, that in 1958 was called with her sisters to represent the Italian style in a conference at the White House, always used to talk about herself as a simple seamstress.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was the 1936 when Fontana sisters, supported by Micol herself, decided to move from the little town of Traversetolo to the city, looking for an opportunity in fashion. They chose Rome, instead of Milan, because of the magical air of inspiration of the Eternal City.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/00001775n-665x1003.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5839\"><em><em>Black silk evening dress, embroidered with white crochet and paillettes. Casa di Moda Sorelle Fontana. ’50. Courtesy of Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti.</em></em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At the beginning they made little works as seamstresses at home or in ateliers, earning money for fabrics and working hard to gain the trust in their work environment. In 1943 they inaugurated their first atelier “Casa di moda sorelle Fontana” in Palazzo Orsini and started their brilliant career. Gioia Marconi, daughter of Guglielmo Marconi, has been their first important client.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1957 the success arrived for the three sisters by the commission of a wedding dress for Linda Christian, in occasion of her marriage with Tyrone Power. Then an undeniable talent made the atelier Fontana becoming famous by word of mouth in international aristocracy and jet-sets.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Among the others, the most loyal customer was Ava Gardner.  She used Fontana’s dresses in many films, as \"The barefoot contessa” in 1954, \"The sun also rises” in 1957 and \"On the beach” in 1959. Also Fontana’s sister realized for the actress the “Pretino” dress, that inspired Fellini so much as he wanted Anita Ekberg wearing it in “La Dolce Vita”.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/pu1992006r00090.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5840\"><em><em>Exhibition “La Sala Bianca: nascita della moda italiana”, Pitti Uomo 42, 1992 - Sorelle Fontana - &quot;Pretino&quot;.

Courtesy of Pitti Immagine.</em></em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1994 Micol Fontana created a Foundation with her name, to preserve the Atelier Fontana patrimony, composed of dresses, drawings, embroideries, fashion accessories and photographs as a memory from the past making available for future generations of fashion designers. So with the Foundation’s activities, Micol Fontana spent her time work around fashion until the end of her life. We will always remember her as the humble seamstress with a smart talent.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Browse on Europeana Fashion Fontana Sister’s dresses.</strong></p>"

        title: 'Emilio Pucci''s Collezione Siciliana!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Italian history has been, and still is, an immense source of inspirations for various designers!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As a statement of this relationship stands out Pizzia Armerina, in Sicily and its stunning Roman mosaics, which has been an inspiration, among other Italian beauties, of Emilio Pucci, who in 1956 designed the Iconic S/S “Sicilian Collection”, inspired indeed by the beautiful architecture and decorations of the Mediterranean region. More recently, in 2013, Dolce &amp; Gabbana unveiled a breathtaking F/W 2014 collection inspired by the mosaic of the building.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/fo0040901b-665x664.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5865\"><em><em>Designs by Emilio Pucci for his &quot;Siciliana&quot; collection, 1956. Collection Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Villa Romana del Casale is a Roman villa built in the first quarter of the 4th century in Sicily, not far from Piazza Armerina. The villa saw the occupations of different cultures and peoples, as it was first built by Roman, and then destroyed during the domination of Vandals and Visigoths, while some of its buildings that endured were still in use by later occupations od Byzantine and Arabs.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/11214280_946080202120184_5622358528940367428_n-665x665.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5864\"><em><em>Bikini designed by Emilio Pucci, 1956. Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The excavations to bring the Villa back to light began in 1929 and concluded only thirty years later. It was in 1956 however, when Emilio Pucci and photographer Elsa Haertter had the opportunity to picture the designer’s swimwear in the beautiful surroundings of Piazza Armerina, where mosaics depicted a group of roman girls wearing a kind of underwear resembling a modern bikini. Called subligaculum, it was a an underwear piece whose name translated from Latin means “to tie underneath”.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Have a look to our <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=siciliana#searchTerm%3Dsiciliana\">webpage</a> to find more beautiful designs of Emilio Pucci Sicilian collection!</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A fashion industry pioneer, Fiorucci brought the style of the Swinging London to Milan when in 1967 he opened his first boutique and conquered the world of fashion with his brilliant, vivacious revolutionary taste.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Elio Fiorucci passed away at the age of 80 in his home in Milan, where he was found this Monday morning. A fashion revolutionary, Elio Fiorucci opened his first store in Milan in 1967, bringing the style of the Swinging London to the traditionalist and conservative Italian city. His clothes broke the rules and his skinny jeans, that he designed after a trip to Ibiza where he was impressed with the way wet jeans fit and showed women’s body and curves, became a desirable garment for every girl  in the world during the 70s.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/ea5f91e8-beb1-4aef-8d5b-bd9c8de101e7-1352x2040-665x1003.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5904\"><em><em>Fiorucci posing with his 1972 shoe collection The platform.

It hosted Keith Haring and Andy Warhol’s events and was frequently visited by Madonna, Cher and a fifteen years old Marc Jacobs that skipped summer school to pass his time in it.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Its bold commercials, that featured controversial artists like Divine, where directed by Oliviero Toscani with the help of Terry Jones, later founder of i-D Magazine. Collecting around him the most interesting people of the moment, Fiorucci and his store were indeed a reference point in New York City. From his store  Warhol’s first issue of Interview Magazine as well as Paper Magazine where launched. Besides  the Milan’s flagship store, was completely re-styled by Keith Haring in 1984.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/divine-fiorucci.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5906\"><em><em>Divine starring in a Fiorucci campaign.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Fashion brands archives offer to their  designers intimate inspirations for their collections. </strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/ddd1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5913\"><em><em>Photo: Maison Margiela F/W 2015 show. Picture: Maison Margiela. All rights reserved. </em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">For this A/W 2015 Artisanal collection, John Galliano designed for Maison Margiela an engaging duvet dress, whose fabric twisted and bundled partly covered in plastic sheeting. The design, which was shown beside a collection that strongly reaffirmed the historical codes of the Maison and which recalled its unconventional past, does not just place itself in the memories of the old days. A celebration of the founder genius, it refers to a previous Maison Martin Margiela design from A/W 1999, the duvet coat.</p>\n \n<p align=\"justify\">The coat, which was rectangular shaped to resemble once folded a proper duvet, was made in cotton and filled with down feathers. It featured two detachable arms and could also be paired with covers in different material and plastic sheets to customize it. Designed to be, oddly, multifunctional, the coat could be also worn as a dress, a waistcoat or a wrap. Produced by an Italian factory that actually realizes duvets, this piece perfectly embodied the spirit of what was the soon-to-be-established Artisanal line.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/sese.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5912\"><em><em>Duvet coat designed by Maison Martin Margiela, F/W 1999. Collection MoMu – ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved. </em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The different ways the coat could be worn were all shown in a video that Martin Margiela directed and showed in his showroom in 1999. A small cinema, all painted in white, was infact installed into the building and also popcorns and softdrinks were served to those invited to attend the screening. The video featured two models wearing the clothes and the accessories from the collection which included, along with the duvet coat a series of lining dresses and skirts, menswear designs and a series of artisanal garments reworked by hand.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Browse through <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=margiela#searchTerm%3Dmargiela\">our archives</a> to find more inspirational pieces from Maison Martin Margiela!</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Ten years has passed since the birth of the special fragrance branded by Viktor&amp;Rolf!</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The idea was born from their belief in fascinating power of perfumes, and in 2005 it finally became reality with Flowerbomb. At that time the product has been launched giving the same name to the spring/summer collection: an explosion of ribbons and colors, with the surreal sight of a woman with her head tied in a florist's bag. The successful fragrance, created by Olivier Polge, Carlos Benaim e Domitille Bertier, has been celebrated last 8th of June at the Trianon in Paris.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/wwwopac-639x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5936\"><em><em>Evening gown in silk with ribbons designed by Viktor&amp;Rolf for the Fashion Collection &quot;Flowerbomb&quot;. 2005.

After degree they decided to move to Paris and work together. In the same year they won three prizes at the Salon Européen des Jeunes Stylistes in Hyères during the International Festival of Fashion and Photography. Later in 1998, after four collections exhibited in several experimental art spaces, they turned out on official fashion scenes with their first haute couture collection.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/wwwopac-1-665x920.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5935\"><em>Evening gown designed by Viktor&amp;Rolf for international contest in Hyères, France. 1993. Courtesy of Centraal Museum</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In their last collection “Wearable art” the duo used a mingling of fashion and art as a means of expression. Composed by dresses transformed into an artworks, the collection has took the stage at the Mezzanine of the Palais de Tokyo and transformed Golden Age paintings with the rawness and spontaneity of action painting. The painterly gesture is achieved through trompe l'oeil techniques: each artwork is executed in a layering of laser-cut jacquards, embroideries and appliqués.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-07/11693842_10153465377607863_2776049214906252705_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5934\"><em><em>Fashion Show at Palais de Tokyo.

Every silhouette is then explained by the designer himself in texts and personal notes which offer the visitors an insight on Lacroix creative process, learning about his ideas, stories and inspirations.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/nac_exposi-c3-a7-c3-a3o-christian-lacroix_mude-4200-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5958\"><em><em>“Kaleidoscope.

Heir to a rich tradition, he also brought back in his designs tournures, puffs and fichus, also enhancing the preciousness and importance of the ornament, long forgotten during the minimalist fashion era. Being ispired by movies, art and traditions, he reinvented fashion history to make it suitable to his rich and colorful vision.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be held at <a href=\"http://www.mude.pt/\">MUDE</a> until August 30th 2015.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Visit <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=lacroix#dataProviders%3DMUDE%20-%20Museu%20do%20Design%20e%20da%20Moda%2C%20Colec%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Francisco%20Capelo%26searchTerm%3Dlacroix\">Europeana Fashion</a> to browse through MUDE couture collections in our Archive!</p>"

        title: 'Emilio Pucci: Landing on the Moon!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Apollo 15 mission, whose logo patch was designed by Florentine designer Emilio Pucci, landed back on earth this day in 1971.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fashion designer Emilio Pucci was an eclectic. He showed his talent in many different fields, he had been  captain and pilot during the war, high level athlete and in 1971 he also designed the logo for NASA Apollo 15 lunar mission.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/c3-b9-665x888.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5964\"><em><em>Apollo XV mission&#039;s logo designed by Emilio Pucci for the Nasa. 1971. Courtesy of Pucci Archive.</em></em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The fourth mission that brought humans on the moon, who landed on the satellite surface on 30 July 1971 to take pictures and set up scientific experiments, it returned to earth on 7 August 1971.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As it was told by Alfred Worden, who took part to the mission in the Command and Service Module that orbited around the moon, Emilio Pucci was contacted through a mutual friend to help the crew with the design of the mission patch, after they had examined 540 other designs which were found or too mechanical or too distant to the idea of flight. Pucci experience with aviation was indeed fundamental for the assignment. The logo, originally square shaped and in Pucci’s traditional blues, purples and greens, features three stylized birds which indicates the three astronauts taking part to the mission. Their formation, one on the top and two closer to the background, shows who actually landed. The birds were later coloured in white, red and blue and a background was added to represent an artist concept of the surface of the landing site.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/fo0190701b-319x332.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5963\"><em><em>Apollo 15 logo designed by Emilio Pucci for the Nasa. 1971. Courtesy of Pucci Archive.</em></em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Emillio Pucci did not ask for any reward for this work, he only asked the astronauts to bring three gold medals to the moon and back. He then gave two of these medals to his daughter and to that time reigning Pope, Paul VI, while he kept the third one as a memory of that once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Find more examples of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=pucci#dataProviders%3DPucci%20Archive\">Emilio Pucci</a> aeronautical experience in his designs in Europeana Fashion Archive!</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The exhibition organised with special collaboration from Palais Galliera, musée de la Mode de la Ville de Paris, and Paris Musées, recreates the years in which glamour and couture dominated over fashion.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Covering a period in time that was decisive for France to establish itself as a fashion country, entitling Paris as the international capital of fashion, “The 50s: Fashion in France 1947 – 1957” retraces the evolution of the female form from the birth of the New Look to the death of Christian Dior and the advent of Yves Saint Laurent.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/3a88eea7-baf3-4b8a-8493-adc68a8ffcc9-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6049\"><em><em>The Fifties.

It was the New Look created by Christian Dior in 1947 that acted as a turning point. At first mildly criticized, it became soon desirable for every woman worldwide. Together with other designers such as Pierre Balmain, Cristòbal Balenciaga, Jaques Fath and Jean Dessès, Dior shaped fashion imposing his own, glamorous taste.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition, that was on view from July to November at the Palais Galliera Museum of Fashion in Paris, features now one hundred remarkable models and accessories from the Palais Galliera collection selected by museum's director Olivier Saillard. Miren Arzalluz, expert in fashion and costume history, is associate curator for the Bilbao exhibition.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\"The 50s: Fashion in France 1947 – 1957\" will be on through the 31st of August.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>While fashion industry accelerates its pace, a new exhibition raises the awareness on the side effects of fast fashion and mass production.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Are we really conscious of what we wear? “Fast Fashion. The dark side of fashion” aims to answer this question exposing the results of a wrong, unaware behavior. Images of seamstresses on the brink of exhaustion and collapsed factory buildings with hundreds of dead are not the only shades of a glamorous lifestyle, but also its ecological impact harms the environment and mankind permanently.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/mkg_fastfashion_timmitchell_1_720x480-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6059\"><em><em>Tim Mitchell, Clothing Recycled, 2005, © Tim Mitchell</em> | www.timmitchell.co.uk</em></p>\n \n<p align=\"justify\">Sustainability and consciousness are however a topical issue for many designers now: a well-known example is, for instance, Bruno Pieters’s “Honest By”, that offers products with complete transparency in price and manufactory. In addition, news have announced a partnership between Kering and London College of Fashion to encourage sustainable fashion design among its students.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">For German speaking readers, “Fast Fashion. The dark side of fashion”’ blog http://stilbrise.de/ collects reports, information and news on the accompanying program, regular interviews and impressions from Instagram and Twitter. It also broadcasts addresses for fair fashion and DIY ideas along with special looks and original ideas on topics such as secondhand buying, upcycling and transformation, collected from the visitors of the exhibitions.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibiton will remain on until the 25th of October.

        title: 'History of the Hand Fan'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The origin of the hand fan is quite uncertain. Thanks to artistic representations we know that, around 3000 b.C. fans were used by Egyptians. Egyptian fans were big, fixed, and semicircular shaped, made with feathers and with long handles. They had double function: blowing air and scaring away insects. Also it was a sacred instrument, used in religious ceremonies. Greeks and Romans used fans, too. The most famous was the \"Flabellum\" that in the middle Ages was used during the Christian liturgy.</strong></p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/672434.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6071\"><em>Ball accessories. 1876. Courtesy of Wien Museum. CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The folding hand fan is recognized as being invented in Japan or China, modeled after the folding wings of a bat. In the 1500s the device was taken to Europe by way of trade routes and became a stylish symbol of wealth and class. Its big success is due to Caterina De’ Medici, who carried some of them in her trousseau at the French Court. Made in precious materials, the fan was painted on thin leather that was cut as Italian laces. While in Japan they were made in iron and used by men in war, to spread messages or, sometimes, as a weapon.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/2006ah0688_jpg_l-665x534.jpg\" alt=\"Fan\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6069\"><em>Box renter&#039;s fan for the 1787-1788 season, printed with plans of the Kings Theatre and subscribers&#039; boxes. Printed paper leaf with ivory sticks. Made in London, 1787. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">During XVIII and XIX century, fans became integral part of court etiquette. The aristocrat women had one for any occasion: to proclaim an engagement, to be included in the trousseau, to be introduced in court society, for the birth of children and for mournful happenings. In 1700s there were also fan to be used in church, or with theater’s and geographical maps. In the same period women developed a secret language, to make signals with fans, that was codified in XIX sec and was used to engage secret dates.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/2010eb1169_jpg_l-665x497.jpg\" alt=\"Fan\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6070\"><em>Bridesmaid&#039;s miniature fan, gilded and lithographed with pastoral 18th-century scene of shepherdess and suitor. Lithographed paper, hand-painted wood. 1850. Courtesy of Vicoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The design of the screen fan is a fixed handle, most often made out of exquisitely turned wood, fixed to a flat screen. The screen could be made out of silk stretched on a frame or thin wood, leather or papier mache. In China they used to insert little porcelain details on the silk screen. The surface is often exquisitely painted with different kind of scenes. The most beautiful fans were produced in Italy, France and England.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>After 80 years of inactivity the fashion house Paul Poiret will have its revival.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Following Vionnet, Schiaparelli and Charles James, another illustrious brand from the past will be brought back to life. Recently acquired by Korean company Shinsegae International, the brand Paul Poiret will be the next one on the list of illustrious fashion revivals.</p>  \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/emuseumplus1-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6102\"><em><em>Evening dress &quot;Ver Luisant&quot; designed by Paul Poiret in 1922.

Collection Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC-BY-NC-SA</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Originally founded in 1903 by Paul Poiret, the Maison got its success for its innovative creations, whose loose fitting liberated women from the constriction of corsets. Fairly influenced by the feeling for Orientalism that pervaded Paris since the first performance of Ballets Russes in 1909, Poiret’s designs reflected the sumptuousness of the exotic costumes and his “One Thousand and a Second Night” ball is still remembered as one of the most famous ball of the 20th century. Infamously outrageous, his culottes were also denounced by Pope Pio X in 1911.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-08/m-0001-101-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6103\"><em><em>Ensemble designed by Paul Poiret in 1911.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Dresses and porcelains gather the rooms of MET Museum in the exhibit “China. Through the looking glass.”</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Close to them there are old and new patterns, traditional clothes and their contemporary interpretations: something old and something new, in a perfect marriage between East and West. A selection coming  from The Costume Institute and the Department of Asian Art collection as costumes, paintings, porcelains, and art “other” including movies, revealing enchanting reflections of Chinese imagery. Of course something blue was not forgotten….</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-09/80027332_01_l-665x665.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-5805\"><em>Photo: Roberto Cavalli (Italian, born 1940). Evening dress, fall/winter 2005–6. Courtesy of Roberto Cavalli.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Cavalli’s haute couture dress, symbol of the exhibition, is an example of the impact of Chinese aesthetics on Western fashion and how China has fueled the fashionable imagination for centuries. Through the looking glass of fashion, designers conjoin disparate stylistic references into a mix of Chinese aesthetic and cultural traditions.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition features more than 140 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear alongside Chinese art. Filmic representations of China are incorporated throughout to reveal how our visions of China are framed by narratives that draw upon popular culture, and also to recognize the importance of cinema as a medium through which to understand the richness of Chinese history.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more about the exhibition in <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventdetail.html?event=exhibition-china-through-the-looking-glass\">Europeana Fashion Event area</a> and give a look to Orient Inspired Selection on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a>!</p>"

        title: 'Givenchy, Challenging Fashion Habits'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>After moving the location from Paris to New York, Givenchy opens up its Spring 2016 show to the public.</strong> \n\n<p align=\"justify\">When in 2009 SHOWstudio.com streamed online McQueen “Plato’s Atlantis” show, the world was for the first time invited to what was before an exclusive event addressed to an exclusive audience. From that time on, influenced by the arising power of social media and the internet, fashion opened up its doors and rapidly changed to adapt itself to the rules of the brave new world of the web.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-09/givenchy_ss11_068.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6161\"><em><em>Givenchy, Spring-Summer 2011. Collection Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It can be considered a consequence of these changes that Givenchy, last week, has announced that their Spring 2016 show will be open to the public, with 820 tickets obtainable free of charge from their website, other 100 reserved for those who live near the set location and 280 offered to the student of the city’s fashion schools.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Even though Givenchy is not the first one to open its show to a real public – just consider Maison Martin Margiela S/S 1990 show, with children running among models in the catwalk set in a children playground – its gesture is significant in this time and age. Differently from recent habits, people attending to the fashion show are not invited for their influence, instead they are for their interest or love for the brand.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">If a public show is going to be the custom for fashion, this is yet to be seen. However, Givenchy’s action is the perfect response to a more and more democratized fashion environment and its impact will of course leave its mark.</p>"

        title: '"DIOR, THE NEW LOOK REVOLUTION" at Musée Christian Dior, Granville'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>In Dior's childhood home Villa \"Les Rhumbs”, an exhibition tells the story of one of the most important fashion silhouettes.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">When in 1947 Christian Dior presented in Paris his first haute couture collection, a revolution arose in fashion. Held at Musée Christian Dior in Granville, the exhibition “DIOR, THE NEW LOOK REVOLUTION” explores the couturier’s innovative “New Look” from its conception in 1947 and throughout the years until 2015.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The “New Look” may be considered the Manifesto of Christian Dior aesthetics. Symbol of this Manifesto is the “Bar” outfit, whose recognizable silhouette is celebrated in the exhibition, showing how it still influences contemporary creations. Its sculpted volumes and wide skirt were indeed revolutionary in the age in which it was created, and for its femininity it was loved by the women which were before constrained, because of the war, in squared and manly shape.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-09/m-0001-193.jpg\" alt='The \"Bar\" outfit designed by Christian Dior, 1947. Collection Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.' class=\"size-full wp-image-6169\"><em><em>The &quot;Bar&quot; outfit designed by Christian Dior, 1947. Collection Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The display, that covers the almost sixty years history of the Maison, features eighty haute couture garments from Christian Dior to Raf Simons, along with photographs, documents, “New Look” memories, manuscripts and original sketches, including Miss Dior perfume bottles, a mini-replica of the “Bar” suit, “New Look” dolls and “suit” patterns and toiles.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition runs until the 1st November 2015.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Conquer the space with a astral selection of Europeana Fashion items perfect to reach to the stars!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Space Age is a time period that encompasses the activities related to the Space Race, the space exploration and the cultural and technological developments influenced by these events. This era began with the launch of the Sputnik in 1957 and since then it has been a great inspiration for moviemakers, music producers, artists and fashion designers.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-09/2006av6272_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6175\"><em><em>Man&#039;s ensemble designed by Pierre Cardin in 1967. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum.

Even today it inspires shows, catwalks and runways.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-09/paco_rabanne_caw99_0045.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6174\"><em><em>Paco Rabanne A/W 1999 collection.

The landing of Apollo 11 was watched by over 500 million people around the world and it is widely recognized as one of the most defining moments of the 20th century.

Coco Chanel introduced masculine elements in women’s fashion and Jean Patou designed, in addition to his collection, successful sports and leisurewear and dressed the sports stars of his time. Moreover, new technologies and the development of synthetic fabrics made fashion accessible to everyone and major department stores bought or copied the models shown in Paris couture salons, distributing the latest styles throughout the growing mass market.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/thumbnail-3-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"Photo “Jazz Age.

As seen in international fashion shows, designers often get their inspirations and reach back to elements from that fascinating decade, and it is no accident that 1920s laid the foundations of today’s fashion.</p> \n\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information about the exhibition, please visit <a href=\"http://www.modemuseumhasselt.be/\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a>.

        title: 'Uniqlo discovers the Fashion Side of Neuroscience'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Earlier this week, a Uniqlo shop in Sydney, Australia, presented to its customer a new technology called “UMood”. The technology implies neuroscience to help customers to find their the perfect T-Shirt.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It consists in a headset using a single sensor on the forehead to measure brain activity while people watch seconds-long video clips. Each clip represent up to 10 moods such as \"dandy\" and \"stormy.\"</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/uniqlo-665x373.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6328\"><em>“UMood” technology. Courtesy of Uniqlo. All rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The series of videos includes a woman reading in a forest, a kitten, cherry blossoms and a man dancing. Then an algorithm analyses each responses the customers’ brain had while their watching and the machine offers the t-shirt that in Uniqlo selection perfect fits their mood.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It is no wonder that in a time in which fashion and mass production push new designs almost every day, someone may feel confuse about what to buy and what to wear. But is technology the right solution to help customers accomplish their needs? Fashion still waits for the algorithm to calculate this answer.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Read also on <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/blogdetail.html?post=when-fashion-meets-the-future-jessica-minh-anh-at-gemasolar\">Europeana Fashion</a> how a technological catwalk can be sustainable by implying solar power!</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>As announced this Tuesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art new exhibition will explore the relationship between fashion and technology!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">“Manus x Machina. Fashion in an Age of Technology” will be the next Costume Institute exhibition. It will focus on the dichotomy between handmade haute couture and machine-made fashion, a distinction that has become increasingly blurred in the years.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/iris_van_herpen_caw11_277.jpg\" alt=\"Iris Van Herpen, Autumn-Winter 2011 Couture collection.

Photo Etienne Tordoir., collection Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved. </em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">This distinction between haute couture and prêt-à-porter, as explains Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Costume Institute, was traditionally based on the handmade and the machine-made, but is now less clear since both disciplines have embraced the practices and techniques of the other.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/mude.m.0443-665x930.jpg\" alt=\"Dress designed by Issey Miyake, Autumn/Winter 1999.

Photo by Luísa Ferreira, collection MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In the exhibition, the theme will be analysed by featuring more than one hundred pieces of fashion, both haute couture and ready-to-wear, including the designs by Alexander McQueen, Hubert de Givenchy, Coco Chanel, Issey Miyake and Raf Simons, covering over 130 years history. In addition, the exhibition will have several “in process” workshops to let the public know how these technologies work.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be open to the public on 5th May 2016.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The 140th anniversary of the iconic store is celebrated in London with an exhibition that shows the store’s distinctive textile prints and creations!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition “Liberty in Fashion”, held until the 28th of February 2016 at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, is the first major Liberty retrospective of the 21st century, featuring more than 150 of the store’s ensemble and accessories.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/liberty-constantia-print-001-665x904.jpg\" alt=\"Art Nouveau fashion using the Liberty print ‘Constantia’, 1961 – traditional prints were reinterpreted by a new generation of fashion designers.

Its unique printed fabrics were also used by designers Yves Saint Laurent, Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood in their collections, and the enduring relationship between Liberty and fashion designers also brought to collaborations with high profile brands like Nike.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/3e7a4de3-5597-47db-bca5-85a20e3bf2a4-2060x1998-665x644.jpg\" alt=\"A feather-patterned Liberty fabric.

        title: 'The Pocket Watch'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Ever since its development in 16th century to the World War I in 20th century, pocket watches represented an integral part of male fashion.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The history of pocket watches started in early late 1400s when German inventor Peter Henlein, thanks to the new innovation of the mainspring, was finally able to create watches that did not require falling weights as the source of their power. This invention gave birth to the first kind of small portable watches, which were in the beginning worn as a pendant on a chain around the neck. The first recorded wearable watch maker was Julien Coudray, who worked at the court of Louis XII of France.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/h9197.jpg.800x800_q50_upscale-665x440.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6387\"><em>Men&#039;s watch in copper and crystal. 1650 - 1700. Courtesy of Centraal Museum.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1675 a new fashion emerged along with pocket watches that were small enough to be worn in pockets. The first to wear the watch this way was Charles II of England who popularized this fashion across entire Europe and North America. Then glass protection was introduced and pocket watches became luxury items, receiving many attention from fashion designers and innovators.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/2007bm5614_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6386\"><em>Enamelled gold watch signed &#039;Adamson et Millenet A Paris&#039;, on a chatelaine with watch key and seal. Paris mark for 1775-76. Enamelled gold. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The only downside of the watches made before 1750s was their lack of accuracy, since they often lost several hours during one day. The introduction of lever escapement and minute handle changed that, enabling watches to lose just a minute or two during one day.\nAfter 1820, levers became standard in manufacturing all clocks mechanics and in 1857 was created the first pocket watch with standardized parts. Powered with the industrial revolution and overflowing the public of Europe and Americas, this innovation enabled everyone to buy cheap, durable and accurate watches.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/1998.21.0001-665x489.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6385\"><em>Gold watch with blue enamel and diamonds by Bourvoisier Freres. Paris, Late 19th c.  Courtesy of Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Its diffusion grew between 1880 and 1900, with the first attempts of standardizing time due to ever increasing need of precise time measurements in many scientific experiments and public transportation systems. Born as a masculine accessory, it became a common use object, since punctuality gets marked as a morally elevated thing, and, in the first years of 1900 women used to wear the watch “Cylindre Remontoir”. However, by the time of World War I, pocket watches went out of fashion after highly miniaturized wrist watches became famous.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover our selection of pocket watches on theme section on <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themedetail.html#20\">Europeana Fashion</a>!</p>"

Although many designers were already presenting their collections before, it was back in the Sixties when for the first time they came out with the own distinctive style, characterized by lots of black-and-white, a keen eye for line and shape, and also explosions of colour and idiosyncratic touches, that still influences Dutch fashion today.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/20120402_41.jpg\" alt=\"Ensemble designed by Frans Molenaar in 1986.

        title: 'From the Archive: Elizabeth Handley-Seymour'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Read about the interesting story of this English dress maker’s sketches collected in Europeana Fashion!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Elizabeth Handley-Seymour was an English dress maker and fashion designer, who worked between the 1910s and the 1940s. She designed the dresses and gowns for the English Court and Society, including the wedding dress and the Coronation dress for the Duchess of York, later the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/2013gp3518_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Madame Handley-Seymour. One of 4863 fashion designs. London, Spring 1926. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-NC.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6424\"><em><em>One of 4863 fashion designs by Madame Handley-Seymour, London, Spring 1926. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-NC.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">What is interesting about Madame Handley-Seymour wonderful sketches, collected in Europeana Fashion and provided by Victoria and Albert Museum, to which they were given by her daughter Mrs. Joyce Whitehouse, is not just that they offer a perspective on her work but also that they let us give a glance at what were the favourite Parisian designs of her time. This is because some of her sketches were designed after those of the Parisian couturiers, with their name accurately written beside the drawings, as it was common for London clientele to request copies of the creations of the most fashionable designers from Paris.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/2013gp8435_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Madame Handley-Seymour after Balenciaga, Paris. White organdy dress with wide red leather corselet belt. London, Spring-Summer 1936.

London, Spring-Summer 1936. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-NC.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Though it is not certified that Madame Handley Seymour actually realized the copies she sketched, it is sure that the business of copying was quite diffuse at that time. In fact those of Paris couturiers were considered to be the most avant-garde creations, with a great disadvantage to non-Paris based designers and dress makers. This custom has been also documented by American fashion designer Elizabeth Hawes, author of the book “Fashion is Spinach”,  who started her career as a copyist replicating Paris designers’ creations for the American market.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-10/2014gx0915_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Madame Handley-Seymour after Molyneux.

Red evening dress with ruched front and self-fabric roses at bust and matching cloak. London, 1934-35.

        title: 'Fashion History: Sonia Delaunay'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Sonia Delaunay Terk, the first avant-garde representative in fashion of the 900s, was born in Ukraine in 1885. After having studied art in Saint Petersburg, she moved to Paris in 1906 and started to paint under the influence of the works of Van Gogh and Gauguin.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1910 she married the painter Robert Delaunay and co-funded with him the Orphism art movement. The two artists henceforth worked in close association doing experiments with colors in art and design. Their research around shades of colors were inspired by the optical effect of simultaneous contrast, which occurs when one design, when placed next to another, affects both.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/2011d0197.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6475\"><em>Scarf in printed silk twill by Sonia Delaunay, 1925 - 1930. Courtesy of Modemuze</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first simultaneous design opera is dated 1911 and consists in a patchwork quilt made by multicolored geometrical cuts of fabric sewn together. Since then, Sonia Delaunay started the production of sartorial works in simultaneous style and worked in the field of fashion, connecting her practice to the painting. The Simultaneous dresses she designed focuse on color’s impact and have simple shapes to underline the geometrical patterns. Her opera has influenced fashion trends during 20s and 30s and the style of the 60s.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/m-2008-0510-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6477\"><em>Wool jacket with Simultaneous motif by Sonia Delaunay, 1924. Photo by Jean Tholance. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1917 she designed the costumes for the Cleopatra ballet, directed by Sergei Diaghilev, who helped her to open a string of shops in Bilbao, Madrid and Barcelona, selling clothing, fabrics and homeware. Later in 1927, during a lecture at the Sorbonne titled \"The Influence of Painting on the Art of Clothes\", she explored the rhythmic relationship between colours in her fabrications and the reasons behind the move towards ready-to-wear during a time where couture was the norm.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/2012-48-1624-ph1-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6476\"><em>Wood button painted with geometrical motif by Sonia Delaunay, 1925/1930.

        title: 'Crinolines: underwear at the time of Queen Victoria'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The steel-hooped cage crinolines, first patented in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and by their agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular across the Western world,  where they were worn by women of every social standing and class.</strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/imageproxy.jpg\" alt=\"Crinoline in cotton and metal, 1860/1870.

The stiffened or structured petticoat was designed to hold out the woman's skirt and by the 1850s, the ladies wore it up in order the widen skirts to achieve the illusion of a tiny waist.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/2006bb1093_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Crinoline, 'A Favorite Of The Empress', spring steel frame covered with red wool and linen, probably made in Great Britain, 1860-1865.

Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">By then, the term crinoline was more usually applied to the fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them. In form and function these hoop skirts enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/2013fy9210_jpg_l.jpg\" alt='\"Le Salon\", uncoloured fashion plate from \"Moniteur les Modes Parisienne\" showing three women in a furnished interior wearing large crinoline skirts, two in mantles.

Their features, and their width, made the crinolines dangerous if not worn without due care and this widespread media scrutiny and criticism. Many caricatures and illustrations refigured fashionable ladies wearing impossible and exaggerated  version of the cage in ridiculous scenes, but this however reflected a true and less funny reality. Thousands of women died in the middle 19th century as a result of their hooped skirts catching. In addition to fire, their hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/imageproxy-1.jpg\" alt=\"“La Crinoline.

His style was ironic, and along with surrealistic elements, the designer was used to decorate his garments with humorous statements like “waste your money”. His shows, which he eventually replaced with private presentations, were memorably defined outrageous and the designer used to leave tomatoes and flowers on editors’ chairs for them to express their displeasure or happiness with his collection.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/t00772vd.jpg\" alt=\"“Whaam!” dress, designed by Franco Moschino in 1993.

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Winter is coming and temperature lowers… so why don’t you browse Europeana Fashion’s collections of warm socks?</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Socks are among the oldest item of clothing ever worn. The words comes from the Old English “socc”, which means “light slipper”. It evolved from the Latin “soccus” that indicates a “light, low-heeled shoe” which was worn by Roman comic actor, deriving from the Ancient Greek “sykchos”. \n</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/2006am5231_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Socks, machine knitted wool with a chequered pattern of black, red and yellow plaid, London, ca. 1851.

Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Those worn by Ancient Greeks in the 8th century BC were made from matted animal hair for warmth, but since then the socks evolved in form and uses. Romans, in fact, used to wrap their feet with leather and other fabrics instead. These clothes also got different symbolic meanings. By the 5th century AD, socks called “puttees” were worn in Europe to symbolize purity, and by 1000 AD, for the high value of this item of clothing, they became a symbol of wealth among the nobility. However, the invention of knitting machine in 1589 revolutionized the production of socks, which could be knitted with the machine far more fast than by hand.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/1713.jpg\" alt=\"Children’s quilted socks 'Bosan', Korean, early 20th century.

        title: 'History of a couturier: Pierre Balmain'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Pierre Balmain was born in 1914 in St. Jean de Maurienne. His father owned a wholesale drapery business and his mother worked at a boutique.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">After a childhood spent playing with fabrics in the shop where his mother used to work, Balmain started to study architecture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, but did not complete his studies. He used his spare time designing dresses and when decided to present them to somebody, he turned out a trial at Molyneux’s, where he worked for five years, from 1934 to 1939.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-11/20140327_1331.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6541\"><em>Fashion illustration by Renè Gruau for Pierre Balmain. 1948.

The Maison Lelong launched the trend of the long bell-shaped skirts with small waists, a line which later became popular as New Look.

        title: 'Christmas cards to enjoy Christmas time!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Europeana Fashion presents December’s Tumblr Curation by Rossimoda shoe museum with a huge collection of Christmas Cards.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Since the middle age the habit to send greeting cards to the acquaintances has been quite common. In China people used to write them by hand on rice paper, and the cards were as bigger as great was the person they were addressed. In the Christian world, instead, upper classes people started around 1400 to send greeting cards, writing them by hand, until 1700, when they were replaced by printed cards.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/imageproxy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6582\"><em>Christmas postcard. Paper. 1910, Great Britain. Courtesy of MoMu</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">With the invention of litography, in 1976 by the Austrian writer Aloys Senefelder, undreds of cards were introduced on the international market for a huge distribution. In 1840, when the first postage was printed, sending cards for holidays became a custom. The first official greeting card was realized in 1843 by the English painter John Calcott Horsley. At that time just upper classes could buy them, but the lower classes soon developed the way to realize them at home.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/cartolina_01-665x419.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6581\"><em>Christmas card representing a boy and a girl on a shoe-shaped sleigh, France, 1919. Courtesy of Museo Rossimoda della Calzatura, all rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1860 Louis Prang, a German immigrant, opened a lithography laboratory in Boston, popularizing greeting cards in North America. In 1885 he had the idea to draw Santa Claus with a red dress on cards, finding a great success through the public and making it the official dress of Santa. After the 1950 greeting cards overflowed North America and Europe and people started to use them to celebrate any occasion, as births, birthdays, easter, weddings. Some multinational market as Hallmark quickly understood the profits they can take from a mass trade of greeting cards and built real empire, producing a great variety of new and original cards, for everybody.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Follow Rossimoda Shoe Museum’s December curation on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a> and enjoy other <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=cards#searchTerm%3Dpostcard\">Postcards</a> from our Archive on Europeana Fashion Portal!</p>"

        title: 'Gentleman of Fashion: Oscar de la Renta'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Celebrated this year with two monographic exhibitions, Oscar de la Renta was a world renowned fashion designer, whose life intertwined with the most successful stories of fashion history.</strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/files/2015/12/ODLR-SCAD-VIP-Preview_1-665x442.gif\" alt=\"Evening dress designed by Oscar de la Renta set at SCAD FASH.

SCAD FASH, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Oscar de la Renta was born in 1932 in an aristocratic family of Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic. He left the city at the age of 18 to move to Madrid, where he studied art at The Academy of San Fernando. It was when one of his gowns - that the wife of the U.S. Ambassador to Spain commissioned him to design for her daughter - appeared on “Life” magazine, that the designer decided to focus himself on fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/oscar_de_la_renta_ss11_274.jpg\" alt=\"Oscar de la Renta S/S 211 collection.

Collection Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In his first formative years, de la Renta did an apprenticeship at Cristobal Balenciaga, the country's most succesful couturier at the time. He then travelled to Paris to became assistant designer to Antonio Castillo at Lanvin, until when in 1963, mentored by Diana Vreeland, the then American Vogue editor, De la Renta moved to New York to work for Elizabeth Arden. Two years later, in 1965, he founded his own label.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">His designs were influenced by his Dominican and Spanish heritage, and to exotics silhouettes he accustomed a personal use of colours and prints, which provided him an instant success. Among the great personalities he dressed during his long career as a designer, De la Renta is known for dressing every first lady since Jacqueline Kennedy. Also from 1993 to 2002, De la Renta designed the haute couture collections for Balmain, actually becoming the first American designer to be commissioned by a French haute couture house.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/m-2008-0167-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"Tailleur designed by Oscar de la Renta for Balmain, 2001.

Now on view there is an exhibition at <a href=\"http://www.scadfash.org/\">SCAD FASH</a>, in Atlanta, and next March will open the exhibition “Oscar de la Renta” at The Museum of Fine art of San Francisco.</p>\n\nBrowse Europana Fashion collection to find the beautiful creations by <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=oscar+de+la+renta#searchTerm%3D%22oscar%20de%20la%20renta%22\">Oscar de la Renta</a>!"

The definition of this kind of party and the costume habits are strictly connected, in fact the word “Gala” comes from the old French Gale.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Evening dress is the prevailing style prescribed by fashion to be worn in special occasions, with surprisingly complex expectations related to appropriateness of the outfit. Regardless of the era, it is intricately connected to fashions of the day, with specific characteristics that distinguishes it from everyday dress. The evening gown especially amplifies a woman's femininity, intensifying her desirability.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/m-0001-189-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6633\"><em>Mexique. Evening dress designed by Christian Dior. 1951. Photo by Jean Tholance. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Evening wear for women, also known as court dress in the past, has its origins in the 15th century with the rise of the Burgundian court and its fashionable ruler, entitled Philip the Good. Rich fabrics and bright colours were used by the nobility as a signifier of social status. During the 16th and 17th centuries a vibrant court life allowed fashionable ladies to showcase their finery, making Italian Renaissance courts a landmark of style and elegance in Europe. Later in the Baroque era, the focus began to shift to France and the court of Louis XIV.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/2009bx0644_jpg_l-665x409.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion plate.

By the 1820s, fashion had been fairly democratized. Additionally, Parisian and American fashion magazines has gained popularity among women in the United States and Europe. Godey's Lady's Book and Peterson's Magazine used to publish fashion plates with captions of dresses illustrated according to explicit activities or time of day. From these labels, it seems the evening dress was born.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/00000192n-1-665x884.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidered red velvet gala dress. 1902.

Limited to formal or semi-formal events, women's gowns vary drastically from black garments to revealing objets d'art, drawing attention to a woman's body, establishing her as an object to be gazed upon by her audience.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2015-12/212179.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6632\"><em>Model on catwalk wearing an evening long dress by Chanel. 1990.

        title: 'The White Wedding Dress'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The first Europeana Fashion's Tumblr curation of the year is dedicated to wedding gowns. Every day on our Tumblr it will be posted a picture selected from our collection to unveil the history of the white wedding gown!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Though white is today the colour mostly associated with Western wedding traditions, the white wedding gown became popular only after the second half of the 19th century, when the picture of the marriage of the Queen Victoria to Albert Saxe-Coburg was published in the most fashionable magazines of the time. The dress, that also dripped with orange blossoms, was white to incorporate some lace the Queen Victoria prized.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/queen_victoria_albert_1854-665x832.jpg\" alt=\"Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Buckingham Palace, 11 May 1854 (after a Drawing Room), Roger Fenton, 11 May 1854. The Royal Collection © 2010, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, via Wikimedia Commons. \" class=\"size-large wp-image-6648\"><em><em>Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Buckingham Palace, 11 May 1854 (after a Drawing Room), Roger Fenton, 11 May 1854. The Royal Collection © 2010, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, via Wikimedia Commons.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Queen Victoria wasn't however the first queen to wear white in history. Before her, Philippa of England wore a tunic with a cloak in white silk in 1406, and Mary, the Queen of Scots, wore a white wedding gown in 1559 when she married Francis Dauphin of France, even though at the time white was the mourning colour for French queens. In spite of that, before the case of Queen Victoria made white a popular colour for weddings, it was usual for brides to wear colourful dresses at their marriage, and to use the dress again after the event. The choice of the dress then depended on the wealth of the family, elaborate dresses and expensive fabrics were used to show the bride's social standing, while less privileged girls used to wear their best dress - usually in dark colours - at their wedding. A popular colour was blue, which was the colour originally associated with purity and virginity as it was connected to the Virgin Mary.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/20141030_16.jpg\" alt=\"Dress in brown cotton with woven silver stripe motif and floral pattern in brown, worn as wedding gown, 1820-1830.

Collection Gemeentemuseum den Haag via ModeMuze, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">White, instead, didn't have anything to do with purity. The colour was a synonym of ostentatiousness, not only because of the expensiveness of white fabric, but also because the white dress couldn't be worn a second time in a different occasion, showing that the bride could afford to buy a dress she would only wear once. Even after the second half of the 19th century, it was common for many women to wear different colours at their wedding, especially during War period, when the tight circumstances required women to find different solutions.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/tumblr_o0atdydlgb1s0n7o6o1_500.jpg\" alt=\"Wedding dress consisting of a silk gauze and lace bodice, skirt, satin sash, collar, cape and silk fragment, probably made in Great Britain or France, ca. 1872-1874.

        title: 'A Special Headgear: the Crown!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Crown, a special headgear to designate a ruler, exists in many civilizations around the world. Made of precious metals and often decorated with precious stones, it represents power, glory, immortality, royalty and sovereignty.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Precursor of modern crowns was the diadem, which was adopted by Constantine I and was, after him, worn by all rulers of the later Roman Empire. Roman Emperors also used the radian crown, as part of the cult of “Sol Invictus” before the Roman Empire converted to Christianity. The oldest Christian crown in Europe is probably the Iron Crown of Lombardy, used also during the coronation of Kings of Napoleonic and Austrian Italy and as a symbol of the united Italy after 1861.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/2008br4237_jpg_l-665x473.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6661\"><em>Silver bridal crown, partly gilded. Sweden, 1750-1870. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In European countries which are based on Christian tradition, monarchic power is given from the power of the Church. Crowns, belonging to European tradition, are strongly connected to christian tradition too. When a new monarch was elected, the crown was placed on his head by a church official and most Holy Roman Emperors traveled to Rome to be crowned by a Pope. But royalty is not the only range in which this particular kind of headgear has been used in history.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/51430-665x541.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6663\"><em>Bridal crown in silver, precious stones and glass. Sweden, 1600-1699. Courtesy of Stiftelsen Nordiska museet. CC BY NC ND</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In Sweden tradition, the crown is associated to the wedding as a common bridal accessory. Worn for the marriage ceremony, this accessory comes from the earlier maiden’s ringlet which consisted of a wreath with ribbons down the back, and has seen another version in circular headdress or tiara with colorful ribbons. The Bridal Wedding Crown, was fashioned out of metals such as brass, gold or silver which may also have had some wreathes of myrtle, and used to be worn on top of the veil.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/29009-665x532.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6662\"><em>Bridal crown with heather flowers made of paper. Sweden. Courtesy of Stiftelsen Nordiska museet. CC BY NC ND</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">This tradition, dates back to the Catholic times of the Middle Ages, comes from the iconic representation of Virgin Mary, who was always illustrated carrying a crown in earlier churches. For this reason the church requirement for bride to wear the Bridal Crown was that she must be a virgin. According to ethnologists, this tradition was an early way for church and society of controlling women's sexuality. But it was in some cases possible to convince the priest to overlook a premature pregnancy with a bribe or sometimes by atoning for the sin by paying for a new gilding of the crown. Then, in the first decades of the 20th century, the use of  wearing a crown started disappearing.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/205060.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6664\"><em>Marriage between the crown’s princess Victoria and Daniel Westling.

        title: 'André Courrèges'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>One of the leading figures of the introduction of the miniskirt in fashion and the designer of the famous boots, André Courrèges was the fashion designer who brought modernity into the world of French couture.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Born in 1923 in Pau, in the French Pyrenees, André Courrèges studied at the École Nationale des Ponts-et-Chaussées in Paris, as his father wanted him to become an engineer. However the civil engineer André Courrèges, who became a pilot in the France Air Force in World War II, decided after the war to change profession. In 1950, at the age of 28, he joined the house of Balenciaga, where he stayed for ten years, eventually becoming Critòbal Balenciaga's First Assistant.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/10409_1037436309651239_288512950022186179_n.jpg\" alt=\"Dress designed by André Courrèges, 1967. Collection\_Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. \" class=\"size-full wp-image-6679\"><em><em>Dress designed by André Courrèges, 1967. Collection\_Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">It was in 1961 when Courréges and his future wife Coqueline, with the help of Balenciaga himself, founded their own house. At the time, Courrèges courageously revitalized the world of French haute couture by importing elements of the “youthquake” which invested London in the early 1960s. He was, along with Mary Quant, a leading figure of the introduction of the miniskirt, to which he paired, in his collections, his trademark white kid boots.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/2007bp4382_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Pair of leather ankle boots, designed by André Courrèges, Paris, 1965.

Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-NC.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The influence of the designer's background as engineer and his ten years spent working at Balenciaga were already visible in Courrèges early creations. His clothes, sharp and somehow minimalistic in style and construction, showed his sartorial knowledge, which improved the effect of his innovative creations. He also experimented with new materials, usually involving plastics in his designs.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/2010.0003.00-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"Ensemble designed by André Courrèges, Paris, 1965 – 1970  ca.

Collection ModeMuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">His programmatic collection, which would have defined his aesthetic, was shown in 1964. Entitled “Space Age”, it made the designer fortune - British Vogue declared 1964 “the year of Courrèges”.  His debut in couture was in 1965, and two years later he presented “Prototype”, a made-to-order line. Courrèges entered the spirit of the Seventies with “Couture Future”, a luxury prêt-à-porter collection, along with a men's ready to wear line in 1973. In order to reach a wider market, the designer also launched the lower-priced \"Hyperbole\" line in the early 1980s, and sold his company in 1985 to the Japanese firm Itokin, to solidify his brand name. Courrèges also designed some of the looks for the character portrayed by Audrey Hepburn in \"Two for the Road\" in 1967, and in 1972 he created the uniforms for the Olympic Games in Monaco.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/12020058_990810137647190_4991377378428540672_n.jpg\" alt=\"Ensemble in dark brown wool designed by André Courrèges in 1972.

In 2002, Coqueline began developing the project of an electronic car – the first version of the car appeared in 1969 - which prototype named “Zooop EV” was well received by critics in 2008.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The designer died Thursday 7th January 2016 in Paris, at the age of 92, after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.

        title: 'New Board on Europeana Fashion Pinboard: Sportswear!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The new board now on Europeana Fashion's Pinterest features the sportswear creations in Europeana Fashion's collection!</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the twenty-first century, the word “sportswear” describes a broad category of garments developed for sporting activities. The history of sportswear, however, dates back to the 18th century, in which the hunt, horse riding and shooting were considered the main sports and were played by the aristocracy and by privileged people in the countryside. To take part to these activities, men wore more comfortable suits than those worn in the cities. These suits quickly became fashionable through the young gentlemen too, such as the redingote, which later become a fashionable dress for both men and women.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/b7d29ef7c5ca24dd15c003ac00c2715d.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6710\"><em>Riding habit shirt of linen, England, ca. 1750. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, all rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The popularity of sportswear grew in the early 20th century, a period in which sports were democratized and mass production and technical innovations made the ready-to-wear sportswear affordable to everyone. Migrants from Europe arrived in the States bringing their own sports, and American Clubs influenced fashion with the introduction of new practical garments for sports.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/210eb0b1aab47509578a8193c6fdbd81.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6709\"><em>Tennis ensemble by Nordiska Kompaniet, 1928. Collection Nordiska Museet, CC-BY-NC-ND.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">But it was only after World War I that sportswear became a fashionable choice also for women. In 1922 Jean Patou introduced sportswear in high fashion, as did Elsa Schiaparelli, when she designed her light sweaters with trompe l'oeil bows. Cinema helped to promote sportswear styles, and many female celebrities – not only actress, but also many athletes -  wore their sportswear attires in public occasions or posed with it in magazines.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/6fb74ec5c0b362a6c9e31b980a4eb14c-665x802.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6708\"><em>&quot;Capsula&quot; with the print &quot;Ibis&quot;, designed by Emilio Pucci, 1986. Collection Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the 1930s, many American designers, like Bonnie Cashin, Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell, Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, and Emily Wilkens turned into sportswear and contributed to shape an “American Look”, opposed to the French Couture. The “American look” was characterized by practical and democratic clothes and it became typical of American fashion through the 1990s.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Visit our <a href=\"https://it.pinterest.com/eurfashion/fashion-sportswear/\">Pinterest board</a> to some of the most interesting example of our sportswear collection, and browse <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themedetail.html#21\">Europeana Fashion Theme area</a> to see more unique sportswear records!</p>"

        title: '“Fairy Tale Fashion” at The Museum at FIT'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>“Fairy Tale Fashion”, on show at The Museum at FIT through the 16th April 2016, is a highly imaginative exhibition which displays high fashion in the traditional settings of the most famous fairy tales.</strong></p> \n<p align=\"justify\">Dress plays an important role in fairy tales, it could be the magical instrument through which the hero overcomes the struggles, or a symbol of power, status and vanity. The dress is used to portray the qualities of the characters, and similar characters from various fairy tales wear similar clothes.  The fairy godmother, the misterious old lady, the beggar, the prince, the sorcerer, all are characterized by  their particular looks. “Little Red Riding Hood” and “Cinderella” are maybe the most known examples, but in many other tales, such as “The Little Mermaid”, “The Beauty and the Beast” or “The Wizards of Oz” dress plays an important role.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/24461063546_e793e97b6a_o-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6727\"><em>Fairy Tale Fashion, installation view. Photo by Eileen Costa. Courtesy of The Museum at FIT</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition features more than 80 objects dating from the 18th century to the present, including the work of many 21st-century designers, whose creations distinguish themselves for their magical allure or oddity, like Thom Browne, Christian Louboutin, Dolce and Gabbana, Tom Ford, Giles, Mary Katrantzou, Marchesa, Alexander McQueen, Rick Owens, Prada, Rodarte, and Walter Van Beirendonck, among others. The exhibition is organized in thematic areas, that act as sets and are named “Forest”, “Castle”, “Sea” and “Parallel Worlds”. Every section displays the clothes representing the different tales.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-01/fit-fairy-tale09-1-665x996.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6718\"><em>Manish Arora, dress, 2010, illustrating Alice in Wonderland. Courtesy of Museum at FIT, all rights reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the exhibition’s introductory space are also displayed the artworks which have played a role in shaping the fairy tale aesthetic. These include illustrations by renowned early 20th-century artists such as Edmund Dulac, Arthur Rackham, and A.H. Watson, alongside recent, large-scale photographs from Kirsty Mitchell’s award-winning Wonderland series, which are shown for the first time in the USA in this exhibition.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information about “Fairy Tales Fashion”, visit <a href=\"http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/fairy-tale-fashion.php\">The Museum at FIT</a>.

        title: 'La mode retrouvée de la Comtesse Greffulhe at Palais Galliera'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>For the first time ever, the Palais Galliera is displaying the fabulous wardrobe of Élisabeth, Countess Greffulhe, the cousin of French dandy and poet Robert de Montesquiou, who was born at the end of the Second Empire, who saw two Republics and two world wars.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the years that followed her marriage to the Count Henry Greffulhe  in 1878, she became one of the leaders of fashion in Parisian society. Several articles has been wrote to talk about her style and in 1891, from a pen portrait published in the Figaro, we learn that she was “beautiful and pretty, very elegant.”</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/contessa-665x973.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6742\"><em>Otto (Otto Wegener), Portrait of Élisabeth Greffulhe wearing an evening gown and coat lined with Mongolian lamb, circa 1886-1887 Albumen print © Otto/Galliera/Roger-Viollet</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">She was the most beautiful woman in Paris, as Proust wrote to Montesquiou : ‘There is no single part of her to be found in any other woman, or anywhere else for that matter. The entire mystery of her beauty is in the glow, above all in the enigma of her eyes. I have never seen a woman as beautiful as she. Then he immortalised her for posterity as the Duchess of Guermantes in the famous novel In Search of Lost Time. Also she had a beautiful mind. As founding president of the Société des Grandes Auditions Musicales, she turned charity work into public relations, producing and promoting operas and shows, which included Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde and Twilight of the Gods, Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, and Isadora Duncan.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/senza-titolo-3-665x790.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6744\"><em>Worth, evening gown known as “La Robe aux Lis”, circa 1896. Black velvet, ivory silk appliqués in the form of lilies embroidered with beads and metal sequins © L. Degrâces et Ph. Joffre/Galliera/Roger-Viollet</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In addition to this, she was involved in politic and a she was passionate sponsor of science. But, first of all, Countess Greffulhe was the epitome of elegance. She used to wear glorious outfits, made by the most important couturiers. Her public appearances were highly theatrical, with a sense of their being rare, fleeting and incomparably fascinating, with outfits chosen to emphasise her slender figure.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/m-2008-0516-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6743\"><em>Manteau du soir designed by Vitaldi Babani. 1915/1920.

        title: 'Gold and Silver in Europeana Fashion''s Tumblr!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>This month Europeana Fashion’s Tumblr explores the use of gold and silver in fashion history through a curation of selected items from Europeana Fashion’s collection!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Gold and silver are two colours and materials which are present in fashion and costume history since their very beginning and thus their use, values and meaning have evolved in time. Europeana Fashion’s curation focuses on the techniques designers and couturiers use to feature gold and silver in their creations from the 20th century to nowadays. These techniques are different and they reflect the various new references these colours got in mainstream culture. In contemporary fashion, in fact, they not only represent the splendour of the old ages, but they are also attributed more unconventional meaning. Gold, for instance, has become synonym with hip-hop culture, while silver has become a modern, sidereal colour.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/2-665x934.jpg\" alt=\"Boots designed by Paco Rabanne, 1965 ca. Collection\_MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6786\"><em><em>Boots designed by Paco Rabanne, 1965 ca. Collection\_MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The curation therefore features the creations of different designers and couturiers, from Mariano Fortuny and Paul Poiret, for whom gold bore the fascination of the Orient, to Pierre d’Alby, Courrèges and Paco Rabanne, who preferred silver for their space inspired suits and dresses, and the masters of the Eighties, who made these colours celebrative synonyms of excess.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/16-665x1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ensemble designed by Popy Moreni in 1983.

Collection Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Moreover, the curation includes the Nineties' and the contemporary designers which eventually challenged gold and silver, bringing these colours cultural references to their extremes.

        title: 'The Dutch Fashion History on show at Rijksmuseum!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>For the first time, Rijksmuseum displays a great part of its fashion collection in an exhibition which brings together the history of Dutch fashion.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Opened the 20th of February, the exhibition “Catwalk” is set six galleries of the Philips Wing of the Rijksmuseum. It is designed by the world-renowned photographer Erwin Olaf, whose works have been already featured in many fashion magazines and who has collaborated with many great names in art and architecture.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/shoot2-665x668.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: Erwin Olaf | Cocktail dress, Cristóbal Balenciaga (1951-1952). Rijksmuseum, all rights reserved.\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6799\"><em><em>Photo: Erwin Olaf | Cocktail dress, Cristóbal Balenciaga (1951-1952). Rijksmuseum, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Dedicated to Dutch fashion from 1625 to 1960, “Catwalk” sets the occasion for the Museum to show some of the amazing pieces from its 10.000 items collection, which includes men’s, women’s and children’s attire, and also let the Museum reflect on the ways fashion is diffused and its history is told. The role of the wearer is central as she or he makes choices that result in making her or him a follower or a trendsetter. These choices, which depend on various factors, convey a message that eventually influence the history of fashion. Same wise, the Museum made a final selection, deciding which pieces would have been shown in the exhibition.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-02/shoot3-665x423.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: Erwin Olaf | Full evening dress: dotted (ca. 1850-1856) and a full evening dress: striped (ca. 1850-1856).

Rijksmuseum, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Among these pieces are the widest dress in the Netherlands, the mantua worn by Helena Slicher (1737-1776) at her wedding with Aelbrecht baron van Slingelandt in 1759, a precious and fragile dress of blonde silk bobbin lace from the 19th century and a silk taffeta cocktail gown by Cristóbal Balenciaga. \nIn addition, the earliest Dutch costumes worn in the seventeenth century by the Frisian branch of the Nassau family and by the Stadtholder and King William III will be exhibited too. Owned by the History Department of the Museum, they include a unique pair of underpants belonging to Hendrik Casimir I, Count of Nassau Dietz (1612 – 1640). \n</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be on show through the 16t May 2016.

In the 15th century floral fabrics were considered in Europe a synonym of superiority and social prestige, since only few could afford buying the delicately ornate fabrics imported by the traders. In the last decades of the 20th century, however, flowers and other natural elements started to be associated with equality and acceptation.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/1.jpg\" alt=\"Detail of a men’s attire with coat and waistcoat in embroidered silk, made in France around 1785.

        title: 'Designers’ Signature Flowers'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>This March, Europeana Fashion is exploring the use of flowers through fashion history, curating <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a> with a selection of pictures from its partners' collections.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">There are many designers in fashion that are recognized for their charachteristic use of flowers in their creations. The flowers these designers include in their creations are often associated with many meanings, drawn from history, popular culture and art. However, sometimes the game changes and some particular flowers becomes heralds of the designers' styles and aesthetics.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/iribe_les_robes_de_paul_poiret_p.17.jpg\" alt=\"Fashon Designs by Paul Poiret, 1908. illustrated by Paul Iribe.

Les Robes de Paul Poiret, p.17. Source: Internet Archive. Wikimedia Commons, public domain.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The stylized rose which was featured in many of Paul Poiret pieces is one of the earliest examples of fashion’s signature flowers. It was designed by the illustrious fashion illustrator Paul Iribe and it became, for its unicity, an emblem of Poiret’s style.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The two most notable instances are however Christian Dior's lily of the valley, the couturier's favourite flower, and Coco Chanel's camellias. Both the creators used to have their flowers pinned in their lapels or adorning their personal stationery and effects. They also used them in their collections. Dior dedicated to the lily of the valley his 1954 collection, while Coco Chanel used cammellias as a recurrent detail in his clothes, may it the be a pin, a button or an application.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/mtfce101248_seq_003_p-332x220.jpg\" alt=\"Camellia shaped pin, part of Chanel Fall-Winter 1990-91 collection.

        title: 'A Cena da Krizia'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A group of friends remembers the Italian fashion designer Krizia with an intellectual dinner at the famous Spazio Krizia in Manin street, Milano. </strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Passed away last December, Mariuccia Mandelli – she took the name Krizia after Plato’s  dialogue on Vanity - was one of the greatest Italian designers, who achieved many successes during her long career in fashion. Her debut took place in 1957 at the SAMIA fair in Turin where she showed an ante-litteram minimalist style that impressed public, buyers and press. During the Sixties she presented her creations at Sala Bianca at Palazzo Pitti and was the first woman to get the prize “Critica della Moda” in 1964 - a prize only assigned before to Emilio Pucci - but was among the first designers to choose Milan as the new fashion scene in the early Seventies. In 1982 she was invited by the Cambridge's MIT to show her creations at the exhibition “Intimate Architecture: Contemporary Clothing Design” along with Gianfranco Ferré and Issey Miyake, among others.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/pu1992006r00037-258x332.jpg\" alt=\"An ensemble designed by Krizia, exhibited in “La Sala Bianca: La Nascita della Moda Italia”, at Pitti Uomo 42, 1992.

Collection Pitti Immagine, all rights reserved. </em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1984 she opened her headquarters, in the  totally renovated Palazzo Melzi d’Eril in Milan that comprehended Spazio Krizia, a place designed to host cultural activities, such as shows, exhibitions, concerts. A place, to “do fashion speaking about other things”. For more than 20 years, Spazio Krizia has been the one of epicentre of Milanese culture: the mood and important legacy of this place and of the group of intellectuals that gathered around Krizia, is re-invoked in the video \"A Cena da Krizia\" directed by Tomaso Pessina.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/2013gk2401_jpg_l-332x249.jpg\" alt=\"Knitted jumper with animal motif, designed by Krizia, ca. 1985, Italy. © Krizia.

Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-NC.</em></em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The same Spazio Krizia is a witness of a renewed multidisciplinary approach: the dinner, brings back together old and new protagonist of the Milanese cultural and fashion scene. Beppe Modenese, Mariuccia Casadio, Gillo Dorfles together with Angelo Flaccavento, Antonio Mancinelli, Carlo Capasa  share their memories on the Italian designer, retracing  the brand's DNA, hosted by Zhu ChongYun, the Chinese fashion designer and entrepreneur who acquired the brand Krizia.</p> \n\n<p align=\"justify\">The video “A Cena da Krizia” can be watched on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO7PSVhhzaM\">Youtube</a>.To have a look at <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=mandelli#dataProviders%3DPitti%20Immagine%26searchTerm%3D%22krizia%22\">Krizia creations</a>, browse Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: '"Game Changers. Reinventing the 20th Century Silhouette"'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Through the 2oth century, the female silhouette changed radically many times in fashion over the influence of legendary createurs and designers. MoMu celebrates these innovators with its new exhibition, “Game Changers. Reinventing the 20th Century Silhouette”!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Focusing on the figure of Cristóbal Balenciaga, the master couturier, the MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp’s exhibition offers the occasion to reflect about fashion as a medium to design the body, exploring its architecture and volumes through the work of the many ground-breaking designers who, like Balenciaga, revolutionized the female silhouette over the 20th century.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/12718150_10154036547806737_4222497787776874642_n-665x453.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6928\"><em><em>The exhibition &quot;Game Changers – Reinventing the 20th century silhouette&quot; at MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp. Photo: © MoMu Antwerp/ Stany Dederen</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The female silhouette has always been shaped by fashion in many astounding and sometimes bizarre ways. It was only in the 20th century, however, that again a certain freedom was given to women by the couturiers like Poiret, Vionnet and Chanel who abandoned the corsets, introducing soft and less constrictive lines. During that last century, designers experimented with increasing freedom and their results changed the rules of the game of fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/gc-13-665x675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6929\"><em><em>Issey Miyake, 1990-2015, Photo: Francis Giacobetti.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition therefore brings together one hundred years of fashion history, showing - alongside the breath-taking creations and the patterns of Balenciaga - pieces designed by Paul Poiret, Madeleine Vionnet and Coco Chanel, but also the iconic work of more contemporary designers, like the lumpy outfits of Comme des Garçons “Body meets Dress, Dress meets Body” S/S 1997 collection, Issey Miyake pleated designs and Maison Martin Margiela’s highly conceptual garments, including pieces by Ann Demeulemeester and Yohji Yamamoto.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be on show through the 14th August 2016.

        body: "<strong>Belonging to Modemuseum Hasselt's beautiful collection, these dress and coat designed by Zimmermann are a beautiful example of the way art and fashion contaminate their worlds. </strong>\n\nIn his memoirs, Paul Poiret wrote “Am I a fool when I dream of putting art in my dresses, a fool when I say dressmaking is an art?”. Indeed, in this ensemble, Paul Poiret put the art of the Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy (1877-1953), who designed the floral fabric of which are made the dress and the jacket's lining. \n\n\n\nRaoul Dufy designed this silk fabric for the textile company Bianchini-Férier in Lyon, who collaborated with a long list of great fashion Houses and designers, like Worth, Poiret, Vionnet, Lanvin, but also Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, Hussein Chalayan, Dries van Noten. Dufy signed a contract with the company in 1912 and for them produced no less than four thousands designs until 1928. \n\nPoiret was therefore not the only who created garments with Dufy's fabrics. The French fashion House Zimmermann, set in 10 Rue des Pyramides, was another one. The Kyoto Costume Institute collection has a dress designed by Zimmermann in 1922, which used the same fabric used for this dress, but in a different colour! http://www.kci.or.jp/archives/digital_archives/detail_139_e.html\n\nBrowse the incredible collection of Modemuseum Hasselt and find other beautiful fabrics by Bianchini-Férier on Europeana Fashion!"

        title: '"HAIR! In Fashion and Art" at Centraal Museum'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Human hair is a quite wide subject in fashion and art, which has never been the subject of a comprehensive research. Centraal Museum focused on the theme in its new exhibition, “HAIR! Human Hair in Fashion and Art”!</strong>\n\nOn show through the 29th May, “HAIR! Human Hair in Fashion and Art” provides an insight on the topic by exploring its historical and contemporary aspects, as a result of a cultural-historical research conducted by Centraal Museum. There are many examples of human hair in fashion, Alexander McQueen used to put a lock of his hair in its creations, and Walter van Beirendonck printed a trompe l’oeil bare man’s top on a t-shirt. \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/m-2012-0033-jt.jpg\" alt=\"Walter Van Beirendonck for Wild &amp; Lethal Trash (W.&amp; L.T.), tee-shirt printed with a trompe l'oeil bare man's top, 1996-1997.

Facial and body hair then are subject to fashion themselves. The exhibition will display the work of many contemporary visual artists and international fashion designers who have been inspired by this material, such as Charlie Le Mindu, Julien d’Ys, Christiaan Houtenbos, Zoran Todorovic, Bob Recine and Silvia B. \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/zhu_tian_babe_2013_rubber_human_hair_pigment_courtesy_of_the_artist1.jpg.630x378_q85_crop-1_upscale-1.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: “Babe”, rubber, human hair, pigment, Zhu Tian, 2013. “HAIR!

The main subject of the symposium is how human hair is used as a textile.

        title: 'From the collection: a Fauvist''s Design!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Belonging to Modemuseum Hasselt's beautiful collection, these dress and coat designed by Zimmermann are a beautiful example of the way art and fashion contaminate their worlds.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A contemporary of Zimmermann, Paul Poiret wrote in his memoirs “Am I a fool when I dream of putting art in my dresses, a fool when I say dressmaking is an art?”. Indeed, in this ensemble, Zimmermann put the art of the Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy (1877-1953), who designed the floral fabric of which are made the dress and the jacket's lining.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/1989.0252.021.jpg\" alt=\"&lt;em&gt;The ensemble designed by Zimmermann, made of the fabric designed by Raoul Dufy for Bianchini-Férier. Collection Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.&lt;/em&gt;\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6949\"><em><em>The ensemble designed by Zimmermann, made of the fabric designed by Raoul Dufy for Bianchini-Férier. Collection Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Raoul Dufy designed this silk fabric for the textile company Bianchini-Férier in Lyon, who collaborated with a long list of great fashion Houses and designers, like Worth, Poiret, Vionnet, Lanvin, but also Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, Hussein Chalayan, Dries van Noten. Dufy signed a contract with the company in 1912 and for them produced no less than four thousands designs until 1928.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-03/1989.0252.001.jpg\" alt=\"The ensemble designed by Zimmermann, made of the fabric designed by Raoul Dufy for Bianchini-Férier.

Collection Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The French fashion House Zimmermann, set in 10 Rue des Pyramides, was therefore not the only which created garments with Dufy's fabrics. Among the many designs created with these textiles, in The Kyoto Costume Institute collection there is <a href=\"http://www.kci.or.jp/archives/digital_archives/detail_139_e.html\">a dress designed by Zimmermann in 1922</a> with the same fabric, but in a different colour!</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Browse the incredible collection of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DModemuseum%20Hasselt\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a> and find other beautiful fabrics by <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#searchTerm%3DBianchini-F%C3%A9rier\">Bianchini-Férier</a>!</p>"

        title: 'From the collection: Melissa Shoes by Zaha Hadid'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Great architect Dame Zaha Hadid recently disappeared leaving a vast heritage which goes beyond architecture and includes experimentation with accessory and footwear design.</strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/mude.m.0713.01b-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"The shoes designed by Zaha Hadid Studio for Melissa in 2009.

Collection Mude - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda holds in its collection a pair of the shoes Zaha Hadid's studio designed in collaboration with the Brazilian shoe brand Melissa in 2009. Inspired by the organic contours of the body, the shoes express the studio's characteristic sense of fluidity through their seamless, liquid shape, referencing Hadid's signature buildings.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/mude.m.0713.02-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"The shoes designed by Zaha Hadid Studio for Melissa in 2009.

Collection Mude - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Developed through advanced digital modeling techniques and employing plastic injection moulds and rapid prototyping technologies, these shoes are as a result a testimony of the collaboration of two great innovators in the world of architecture and design. The signature aesthetic of the studio was also translated in the form and details of the packaging for the shoes.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Hadid, the first woman to receive the Royal Institute of British Architects Gold Medal in recognition of her work, set up her own studio Zaha Hadid Architects in 1979. Over her long and prolific career, she was commissioned many buildings all over the world, the Vitra Fire Station in Weil am Rhein in Germany, the MAXXI Museum in Rome, the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London, the  Guangzhou Opera House in China and London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, used for the Olympics and Paralympics. Her experience with fashion does not limit to footwear design. Hadid and her studio collaborated also with Atelier Swarowski, creating a collection of beautiful crystal jewelry, and with Louis Vuitton, reinventing the iconic bucket bag.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Changes are part of the radical nature of fashion. Not only periodically fashions changes, but its structures, rules and practices do it continuously. From couturiers and createurs it turned to designers and art directors, from hand-made, to machine-made, from couture to prêt-à-porter. </strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">But this doesn't mean that fashion does not cross and mix these worlds, taking inspirations and introducing in contemporary prêt-à-porter the craftsmanship, luxury and extravagance of the haute couture. Modemuseum Hasselt's new exhibition “Haute-à-Porter” focuses on this theme to explore the practices of the last 30 years of fashion.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/02_haute_a_porter_yamamoto_-e2-94-ac-c2-ae_rene_habermacher_hd-665x859.jpg\" alt=\"A contemporary crinoline dress by Yohji Yamamoto SS1999.

        title: 'Barbie at Les Arts Décoratifs'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Protagonist of an exhibition in France for the first time, Barbie will be the guest star at Les Art Decoratifs in Paris from the 10th of March to the 18th of September.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Born Barbara Millicient Roberts, from Wisconsin, the famous doll was created by Ruth Handler, one of the Mattel’s founders, who wanted to replace her daughter’s (Barbara) paper doll with a three-dimentional doll, which had to be like a mannequin. Ruth was so determined to innovate the young girl’s entertainment, to convince an entire male working group to create Barbie. Since that moment her story has been written, overlooking her age, to let her identify with a teen ager as well as with a young girl.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/barbie-665x612.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6969\"><em>Andy Warhol, Portrait de Barbie, 1985 © Mattel Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Maybe nobody in the team  in 1959 would have imagined  the huge  success Barbie would have acheived . Across the years, the famous doll has been a schoolgirl, a nurse or an hostess, and these are just three of more than 150 professional roles she played. She has been a veterinarian more than once, a paleontologist, a computer technician, a racer, a teacher, a doctor, a police-woman,  for four times a candidate for Presidential elections  and an astronaut in 1965, to celebrate the Armstrong’s moon landing. Barbie’s has an history of successes, marked by amazing outfits, from the strangest to the most glamourous, sometimes designed by big names of fashion. With her pop charm she has kept the attention of Andy Warhol too, who dedicated one of his iconic paintings to her.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/sc01044b-665x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6971\"><em>The Marquise Emilio Pucci and Barbie wearing a dress by Pucci. 1986. Courtesy of Pucci Archive</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The tradition of the \"poupée de mode\" has its origins in the 18th century, when this term referred to three different objects: the little girl's doll, the miniature of the dress which had to be realized in real measures and the mannequin used in the boutiques. In that period the fashion industry was quite important in the French economic system and it played an essential role in culture. The dressed doll's mission was to be sent all around the world to export French's fashion trends. Queen Marie Antoinette herself used to send some dolls to her sisters to share with them the beauty of the fabrics made in Lyon.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/barbie_runway_show_aw09_142.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6970\"><em>Barbie Runway Show, Season Autumn-Winter. New York, 2009. Photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy of Catwalk Pictures</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The difference between the \"poupée de mode\" and Barbie is that the American doll has always been the only protagonist with a strong identity, while the French doll played just the role of mannequin to show and sell magnificent dresses around the world. Anyway both of them have been a marketing phenomena.No other toy until today has had such a strong influence in girl's education: in fact, Barbie has inspired tastes and habits of many generations of girls since her launch on the market.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=Barbie#searchTerm%3DBarbie\">Barbie</a>’s items from our archive on Europeana Fashion Portal</p>"

        title: 'Stephen Jones and the art of Millinery'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Born in 1957 in Cheshire, Stephen Jones studied at Saint Martin’s School of Art where he was the sole male student in his year.</strong></p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/imageproxy-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6984\"><em>Triple Vision: hat designed by Stephen Jones. 2011. Courtesy of MoMu Antwerp</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1979 he left the punk scene to embrace the New Romantic movement when he became a regular attendee of London's Blitz nightclub in Covent Garden. As one of the “Blitz Kids” he used to meet Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran, Isabella Blow and Jean Paul Gultier. Also he shared a house with Boy George and Grayson Perry. Many of the Blitz Kids became his first clients and Jones created outlandish hats for them to wear to the club.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/imageproxy-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6982\"><em>Hat with feathers designed by Stephen Jones. 1998. Courtesy of MoMu Antwerp</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the same year, Jones designed a line of hats for Fiorucci. The next year the Blitz’s owner Steve Strange decided to invest on his talent and made him open his first millinery salon, in Covent Garden. After this first success, in 1982, Jones had his debut at Paris fashion week and Princess Diana became a regular costumer. Also he started a lucky collaboration with Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, which began with one hat commissioned for their newly refurbished Costume Court and culminated in 2009 with the Hats: An Anthology exhibition.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/imageproxy-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-6983\"><em>Catalogue of the exhibition &quot;Hats: An anthology&quot; at the V&amp;A in collaboration with Stephen Jones. 2009. Courtesy of MoMu, Antwerp</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Through his career Jones has created hats for the catwalk shows of many leading couturiers and fashion designers, such as John Galliano at Dior and Vivienne Westwood. An ambitious style, his inventiveness and the high level of technical expertise with which he realises his ideas are the reason he is now considered one of the world's most important milliners of the late 20th century.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/m-0003-233-4-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-6985\"><em>Ensemble designed by Jean Paul Gaultier and hat by Stephen Jones, 1985.

Inspired by the goods he imported, Babani did that too, reproducing these costumes with luxurious fabrics and materials, such as precious silks and velvets.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Alongside his creations and oriental goods, Babani was also a licensed seller of Liberty textiles and - together with Paul Poiret in Paris - of the designs of the Venetian based couturier Mariano Fortuny, whose aesthetic was also reminiscent of a certain Orientalism.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/emuseumplus-665x739.jpg\" alt='\"Delphos\" dress, designed by Mariano Fortuny, 1920 ca.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris celebrates the 30th anniversary of its fashion collection displaying three hundred years of fashion in its new exhibition, on show through the 14th August 2016.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Consisting of three hundred pieces of menswear, womenswear, childrenswear and jewels meticulously selected from the Musée des Arts Décoratifs’ s collection, which counts more than 150,000 pieces, the exhibition “Fashion Forward, Three Centuries of Fashion” has set the occasion for the Museum to conceive an ideal museum of fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/20160406_132107.jpg\" alt=\"Mariano Fortuny’s “Delphos” dress, on the left, and two creations by Charles Frederick Worth on the right, on show in “Fashion Forward, Three Hundred Years of Fashion”, at Les Arts Décoratifs.

It offers a chronological overview of the history of fashion, including some of its most emblematic pieces.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/20160406_132117.jpg\" alt=\"An embroidered Kimono by Babani, on show in “Fashion Forward, Three Hundred Years of Fashion”, at Les Arts Décoratifs.

Moreover, Musée des Arts Décoratifs entrusted to the British dancer and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon, who transformed every stage of the exhibition into a word itself, together with the help of the scenographer Jérôme Kaplan assisted by Isabelle Vartan. Exploring in this way the indissoluble connection between fashion and body, the Museum also collaborated with the dancers of the Opéra de Paris, whose choreography enlightens how silhouette, body and posture evolved along with fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/20160406_1350121.jpg\" alt=\"An overwiew on the 20th century fashion, including iconic pieces from the 1980s, on show in “Fashion Forward, Three Hundred Years of Fashion”, at Les Arts Décoratifs.

Such an extensive collection is the result of the blend of the collection of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, started on 1864, and that of the Union Française des Arts du Costume (UFAC), founded in 1948 and currently presided by Pierre Bergé, which is preserved by the Museum.</p>\n \n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition “Fashion Forward, Three Centuries of Fashion” is on show at Musée des Arts Décoratifs through the 14th of August.

        title: 'Callot Soeurs'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>During April, Europeana Fashion will explore the history of couture, dedicating each week to a different couturier. The second issue focuses on Callot Soeurs, a Parisian fashion House ran by three innovative sisters, quoted as one of the greatest in Marcel Proust novel “À la Recherche du Temps perdu”.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">One of the most influential and successful Parisian fashion houses of the 20th century, Callot Soeurs had shops in Paris, London and Buenos Aires and an exclusive clientele all across Europe and United States. Although their work was immortalized in the art of Giovanni Boldini and in the nostalgic novel of Marcel Proust, they were almost forgot in a mainstream fashion history. Only in 1990s their reputation was revived through the display of their works in fashion and costume exhibitions and museums.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/00000250n-665x912.jpg\" alt=\"Evening gown designed by Callot Soeurs, 1907-1910 ca. Collection Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti.\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7009\"><em><em>Evening gown designed by Callot Soeurs, 1907-1910 ca. Collection Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Callot Soeurs founded their business in 1895 and were initially four, Marie Gerber, Marthe, Regine and Josephine, the youngest who sadly committed suicide in 1897. Descending from a family which dealt with art and textiles - their father was a painter and antiquarian, their mother a lace-maker descending from a lace-makers family - they were accustomed to precious fabrics, lingerie and laces their family shops were renowned for. Lace, indeed, was one of the fabrics that most characterized the sisters’ work, Marcel Proust himself noted in his novel that the Sisters used “a little too much” of it! Their couture gowns were realized with hand-made lace, usually reconstituted 18th century lace. However, they also introduced more innovative fabrics such as gold and silver lamé and a more elastic gabardine for their sport couture.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/2010ee7962_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Silk damask tea-gown trimmed with lace, designed by Callot Soeurs, Paris, ca. 1905.

Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A business ran by women for women, they were also among the first to abandon the corset for less constrictive silhouettes. Marie Gerber, the elder sister, had a design talent besides having  trained herself as a premiere in the atelier of Raudnitz &amp; Cie. Inspired by the Orientalism and avant-garde arts, she eventually designed also Cubist dresses, made of laces and embroideries resembleing collages. She used to drape fabrics on models and let her toile-makers to execute the design. One of these toile-makers was, from 1901 to 1906, Madeleine Vionnet. In future, she would have recognized Callot Soeurs as being those who inspired her to became the great couturier she was, by saying that “without the example of the Callot Soeurs, I would have continued to make Fords. It is because of them that I have been able to make Rolls Royces”.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/emuseumplus1-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"“Le Style Parisien”, Ice Skating outfits by Chéruit, Premet, Callot, Jenny, Lanvin and Paquin.

However, the economic crash of the 1929 had a great impact on the business, who eventually closed in 1937.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Stay connected to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaFashion/\">Europeana Fashion’s Facebook page</a> to learn more about Callot Soeurs and through a selection of pictures from Europeana Fashion’s collection!</p>"

        title: 'Maria Monaci Gallenga: a printing revolution.'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Daughter of academics and grown up surrounded by famous writers and artists of her time, the fashion and textile designer Maria Monaci Gallenga has innovated the fashion industry, introducing a special printing technique.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The invention consisted in using wooden moulds to apply glue on textiles in order to decorate the motif with gold and silver metallic pigments. Her particular way to combine the colours made the motifs look like painted instead of printed. Inspired by the past and the Renaissance period in particular, her hand-stenciled designs have been often compared to the ones of Fortuny.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/0000027803n-665x846.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7013\"><em>Detail of a cape in velvet and chiffon, hand-printed in gold with Gallenga&#039;s method by Sartoria Tirelli. Collection Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, all rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">She started to show her interior design works in 1913 through the Roman Secession exhibition and later in 1915 she conquered the US market, presenting a womenswear collection of 22 printed fashion objects at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco, where she achieved such a great success that some of her works are still conserved by Metropolitan Museum of New York. Thereafter, she expanded  her laboratory into a factory able to supply the American market demand, revealing a strong entrepreneurial attitude.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/20110902_156-665x885.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7014\"><em>Printed black velvet evening cape designed by Maria Monaci Gallenga. 1920/1925. Courtesy of Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. All rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In the same year Maria Monaci Gallenga started to work in partnership with Vittorio Zecchin, participating to several exhibitions around Europe. In 1924 she worked with Antonio Maraini for the Biennale of Venice. Since then she often worked in collaboration with the most famous artists of her time, as  Galileo Chini, Gino Sensani, Romano Romanelli, who provided the patterns for her printed fabrics. Sensitive and engaged in the cultural debates of her time, she also founded an association to promote the Italian craftsmanship in the world.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/mtfce112113_seq_001_p.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7015\"><em>Gold printed black velvet coat designed by Maria Monaci Gallenga. 1918/1919. Courtesy of Museo del Traje. All rights reserved.</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">After showing her creations in her own pavillion decorated by the Italian artist Antonio Maraini at the Exposition International des Arts Deoratifs in Paris in 1925 her succes was so wide that she opened  a boutique in Paris with Bice Pittoni and Carla Visconti di Modrone. The shop, called Boutique Italienne, showed the best Italian works of art, until 1934, when she decided to close it and come back to Rome.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more Gallenga’s printings on <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=Gallenga\">Europeana Fashion Portal</a></p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>On 20th of April, Europeana Fashion held in collaboration with Platoniq a co-creation workshop in the wonderful venue of the Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">On Wednesday 20th of April, 35 professionals from different institutions gathered together to attend the Co-Creation workshop organized by Europeana Fashion with the team of <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/en/\">Platoniq</a>, open culture developers and social innovators, to brainstorm,  propose and discuss innovative  ideas for the promotion of  digital fashion heritage. Among the 35 participants, we had representatives of museums and archives, like MoMu Antwerp, Israel Museum, Rossimoda Shoe Museum, ModeMuze, SPK Berlin, PFF Nafplio, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and Rijksmuseum, professionals of brand archives, Iike the Benetton Group, academics from the Central Saint Martins school, the College of Arts of the University of Edinburgh and the IUAV University of Venice, and various professionals and creatives, like UX designers, curators and developers.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7023\"><em>M<em>auricio O&#039;Brien giving a welcoming speech at the Co-Creation workshop at Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Photo by Europeana Fashion,CC-BY-SA.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The participants were welcomed by staff of the Rijksmuseum that co-organised and hosted the workshop. After a welcoming speech by Marco Rendina, Technical Director of Europeana Fashion International Association, Mauricio O’Brien and Olivier Schulbaum from Platoniq introduced the aims of the workshop and the way they would have been achieved during the day. \nAt their arrival participants were asked to identify themselves as curators, designers and producers and to divide in groups: the first task for each group was to identify an interesting or useful  app, website or project related to fashion heritage and analyze which were the valuable and weak points of the product.\nThe next step was to fill out a chart with new possible scenarios in which specific users, such as students, researchers, scholars, curators or just fashion enthusiasts, had to complete a specific task, and inventing for them an instrument to solve their problems or fulfil their needs More than 25 interesting ideas were proposed, voted and ranked to end up with a final selection of five\nThese five ideas evolved, through fast prototyping, into wireframes. “Spot it”, for example, is an update on a classic-style mobile app using Europeana Fashion's dataset, where a user can shoot or upload a photo, and perform a synthetic search for similar items in the Europeana database; while “Fashion Pockets” has been conceived to allow users to select, group and store different items together. “Accessory Search” offers curators of historical costume exhibitions the possibility to find all the information they need about special accessory objects. “Fashion Time Machine” will give instructions and patterns for the re-creation of historical fashion objects; “Pattern Finder” for vintage clothing, knitwear and craft enthusiasts, who can search this site for re-usable, public domain, shareable patterns for tailoring, knitting, crocheting and “Europeana Research”, a search tool, through which one could perform very detailed searches and receive excellent results with many related items which could be offloaded to a personal space.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-04/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7024\"><em><em>The participants sharing ideas, comments, evaluations at the Co-creation workshop with Platoniq at Rijksmuseum, in Amsterdam.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Functional or decorative, bows are a recurrent element in fashion. Among all the ones collected in its digital archive, Europeana Fashion has selected the most interesting and stunning to share them this week on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaFashion/timeline\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeanafashionofficial/\">Instagram</a>!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The origin of the bow as a decorative element is quite uncertain. It became a fashionable ornament in jewelry-making and goldsmithing during the 17th century, inspired by the ribbons that usually tied the jewels. These ornaments, in gold or silver enamelled with precious stones, were used as pins and applied on row on the corset and were named <em>Sévigné</em> after the woman that made them popular, Madame de Sévigné.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/2b.jpg\" alt=\"gold breast or hair ornament, enamelled in blue and white and set with table-cut diamonds in the form of a bow and jabot, was made in France.

        title: 'Curation by Rijksmuseum on Europeana Fashion Tumblr!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Rijksmuseum is curating Europeana Fashion Tumblr with a selection of pictures and looks from their latest exhibition “Catwalk Fashion at the Rijksmuseum”, curated by Erwin Olaf, which displays for the first time ever the costume collection of the Museum.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Since the 1870s the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam has collected costumes. The fashion collection totals 10,000 items, with men’s, women’s and children’s attire and accessories spanning the period from 1700 until 1960. In addition, the History Department owns the earliest Dutch costumes, worn in the seventeenth century by the Frisian branch of the Nassau family and by the Stadtholder and King William III. Being the oldest costumes collection in the country, acquisitions initially emphasized on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but over time gradually expanded to include the first half of the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/28-bannerfacebookb-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"“Catwalk” fashion at the Rijksmuseum, Room 3, “Catwalk”. Photo: Carola van Wijk. \" class=\"size-large wp-image-7038\"><em><em>“Catwalk” fashion at the Rijksmuseum, Room 3, “Catwalk”. Photo: Carola van Wijk. All rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">All of the garments come from the wardrobes of upper-class Dutch men and women, but they were not necessarily made in the Netherlands. Foreign fashion houses and fabrics from all the leading textile-manufacturing countries around the world are amply represented. Acquisitions for the collection are based on historical significance, such as a post-war dress made of silk RAF pilots maps; design relevance, such as Yves Saint Laurent’s 1965 “Mondrian dress”; and costume-historical importance, such as a silk taffeta cocktail gown by Cristóbal Balenciaga dated 1951-1952. Most items were donated or bequeathed, supplemented with purchases. Because of the frailty of the material these are no permanently on show. The exhibition “Catwalk Fashion at the Rijksmuseum” explores the riches of the collection. The design was done by photographer and artist Erwin Olaf, who also made several works especially for the exhibition, wherein are featured costumes from the collection.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/09-room6b-665x471.jpg\" alt=\"“Catwalk” fashion at the Rijksmuseum, Room 6, “Party!”.

All rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">This curation shows a selection of about 25 costumes that are currently on show. Prior to the exhibition all objects were photographed by the museum and ascostumes are 3D objects a single shot will not do them justice, hence a picture of the back and side as well as some details were always taken, showing the garments from other angles or in more detail.  Visit every day <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion's Tumblr</a> to find a new picture of this curation!</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition will be on show through the 22nd of May.

        title: 'Europeana Fashion unveils the Underwear'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Underwear, originally created for practical purposes, like preserving women’s modesty and for hygiene reasons, evolved lately in structures desinged to change the woman’s silhouette depending on fashion trends across fashion history.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The historical evolution of lingerie reveals a lot about women’s changing role in society: how they perceived themselves and how they were viewed by others. Women have worn rib-crushing corsets, bondaged their chests to get an androgynous silhouette and burned their bras as a statement of liberation.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7052\"><em>White linen drawers, England, ca. 1850. Linen. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">During the Roman Empire the undergarments were the same for both women and men: a sort of pants, called subligaculum, which women matched with a band of leather around their chest, called the strophium.\nLater, in the 13th century, men started to wear linen shorts called braies, while women did not wear knickers until the 19th century. The only kind of underwear used , was a long linen garment called shift, worn under their dress, later tightly wrapped around their chest by corsets made with whalebone, introduced since the 16th century.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7053\"><em>Chemise, short sleeves in cotton with crochet trimming, crinoline and corset. England,  1850-1860. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Since then, corsets and petticoats haves shaped differently the women’s silhouette until the beginning of 20th century. From the pannier in the 18th century, to the crinolines in the 19th century, the feminine underwear became a real structure under the dress. To shape their body according to the fashion trends, women forced themselves in the most tighter corsets and carried the weight of the ever bigger gowns.\nIn the 19th century, women begun to wear drawers, while men used to wear a combination of vest and pants in one garment.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7051\"><em>Man&#039;s linen undergarments. Great Britain, 1775-1800. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">At the beginning of the 20th century the corset trend arrived to the extreme point: women used to shape their body with such tight corsets that their waist could measure 10 centimeters in circumference, causing deformations and diseases.\nIn 1910 knickers e stockings were produced in rayon for the first time and in 1913 Mary Phelps Jacob invented the first bra, made with two handkerchiefs joined by a ribbon. These were probably the first steps toward a modern concept of underwear.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7054\"><em>Pink corset made by Le Grandukor.

His famous guepiere wore by Madonna has left a mark in contemporary history of costume.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/16-665x828.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7055\"><em>Girdle dress designed by Jean Paul Gaultier. 1987.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Victoria and Albert Museum’s latest exhibition, which will be on show through the 12​th March 2017, explores the history and the evolution of lingerie.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">A kind of garment usually worn under the clothes, lingerie is today a worth element of debate which highlights different topical issues concerning gender, sex and morality. Visiting Victoria and Albert Museum’s latest exhibition “Undressed: A Brief History of Underwear​”, one can immediately understand the close link which bounds fashion to underwear, underwear to the body and the body to fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/2006ag4304_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"Corset of satin with hand­made bobbin lace, possibly made in England, 1890­1895.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7068\"><em><em>Corset of satin with hand­made bobbin lace, possibly made in England, 1890­-1895.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Museum displays in the venue more than 200 objects, from the late 18th century to contemporary designers’ creations, to show a chronological evolution of lingerie on a timeline that is not free of flash­backs and flash­forwards.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/2010ee7998_jpg_l-665x544.jpg\" alt=\"Satin strapless bra with net inserts, Au Fait Foundations, Great Britain, ca. 1935.\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7067\"><em><em>Satin strapless bra with net inserts, Au Fait Foundations, Great Britain, ca. 1935.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">However, in the exhibition are not only featured extraordinary examples of undergarments worn by extremely customized mannequins, but also the advertisement, packaging and other paraphernalia which accompanied them. Including both menswear and womenswear,the items displayed contribute to tell the history of the evolution of the ideal body and the way it was envisioned by fashion during more than three hundred years’ time.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition “Undressed: A Brief History of Underwear” will be on show until the 12 March 2017.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><strong>Known now primarily as the traditional cooks’ hat, the toque is a type of headwear which was in use from the 13th to the 16th century in Europe, distinguishable for the lack of brims.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The name of this kind of hat may have two different origins. It is the Breton for “hat” and the Arabic for “round”, a term which was known in English since 1505. It probably came through the Medieval French “toque”, probably derived from the Spanish “toca”, the long wig worn by the Spanish and French nobles since the 15th century.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/uf-54-37-bis-16-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"Toque hat designed by Caroline Reboux, 1932/35.

The sources for the articles have been gathered both online and in books provided by the University library.\nTwo members of Wikimedia Italia supported the students in solving operative and methodological issues related to the editing of new entries on Wikipedia.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/edit-a-thon-4-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7096\"><em>Erica Marigliani presents Europeana Fashion. &quot;Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon / La Moda digitale al Campus di Rimini&quot;.

Wikimedia Italia believes that there is a small distance between them and the education system and they are sure they should start to collaborate with each other to take advantage of the digital divulgation capacity, today possible through the web. In addition, with this kind of events Wikimedia is trying to bring into Wikipedia new content, which has not a widespread attention as others.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/edit-a-thon-2-665x499.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7094\"><em>Students working during the event. &quot;Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon / La Moda digitale al Campus di Rimini&quot;.

Proud of the results and satisfied with the outcomes of the day, the University of Bologna has announced its interest in organizing a follow-up event. Stay tuned for more news on our forthcoming edit-a-thons.</p>"

        title: '"Anatomy of a Collection" at Palais Galliera'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The exhibition, which will be on show until the 23rd October, questions the value of a fashion collection and the parameters which defines it. </strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In a fashion museum’s collection the most valuable items are not always the most expensive or decorated. Many factors play a role in defining the value of a dress, may they be the name of its creator, the condition in which they were created, the function they covered, or the name of their wearer.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-05/givenchy_robe_daudrey_hepburn-665x314.jpg\" alt=\"Givenchy, day dress worn by Audrey Hepburn, 1966 - Collection of the Palais Galliera - Photo : © Eric Poitevin/ADAGP 2016 - See more at Palais Galliera http://www.palaisgalliera.paris.fr/en/exhibitions/anatomy-collection#sthash.TFCceR8W.dpuf\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7116\"><em><em>Givenchy, day dress worn by Audrey Hepburn, 1966 - Collection of the Palais Galliera - Photo : © Eric Poitevin/ADAGP 2016 - <a</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Anatomy of a Collection\" focuses on this last aspect, drawing from Palais Galliera collection for a hundred garments and accessories, which cover four century of fashion and costume history. The pieces on show include Napoleon’s waistcoat, a nurse’s suit, a dress belonging to George Sand, Sarah Bernhardt’s cape, Audrey Hepburn’s outfit, Elsa Schiaparelli’s overcoat, a dress worn by the Duchess of Windsor, Tilda Swinton’s pyjama suit designed by Haider Ackermann.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The importance of these pieces is bound to that of the person they were intended for or to the one that wore them. Made by more luxurious or less precious materials, they reflect the cultural significance of their wearer and therefore acquire a different worth inside a museum’s collection and a different light under the eyes of the one who beholds them.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition \"Anatomy of a Collection\" will be on show at Palais Galliera until the 23rd October.

        title: 'Across art and fashion at Palazzo Spini Feroni'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Inaugurated on May 18 2016, the new exhibition promoted and organized by Fondazione Ferragamo and Museo Salvatore Ferragamo explores the relationship between art and fashion.</strong></p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/1-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7132\"><em>Décolleté shoes &quot;Tirassegno&quot; by Salvatore Ferragamo, inspired by the paint by Kenneth Noland. 1958. Photo by Erica Marigliani. Courtesy of Museo Salvatore Ferragamo. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The concept of the exhibition draws directly from the life story of Salvatore Ferragamo, whose fascination with twentieth century avant-garde art movements led him to seek for inspiration in the art world. It presents various case histories, analysing the ways in which these two worlds have interacted, through contamination, overlap and collaboration.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/3-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7134\"><em>Rosa Genoni, &quot;Pisanello&quot; court cape (1906) inspired by one of Pisanello&#039;s watercolours (Un homme et une femme en habits de cour, c. 1450). Photo by Erica Marigliani. Courtesy of Museo Salvatore Ferragamo. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition encompasses a diverse range of movements and experiences: from the work of the Pre-Raphaelites to that of the Futurists and from the complexities of Surrealism to those of Radical Fashion; as well as showcasing inspirations, it allows to reflect on the ateliers where artists met and studied during the 1950s and the 1960s and on the birth of celebrity culture.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/5-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7136\"><em>Elsa Schiaparelli with Salvador Dalì, &quot;Lobster&quot; evening dress. Elsa Schisparelli with Jean Cocteau, evening coat. 1937. Photo by Erica Marigliani. Courtesy of Museo Salvatore Ferragamo. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The display also explores the artistic experimentations of the 1990s and ultimately asks whether art and fashion, both part of today’s cultural industry, are separate and distinct, or are rather intertwined in a fluid role-play.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/2-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7133\"><em>Maison Vionnet, &quot;L&#039;Orange&quot; model, 1922, dress. Photo by Erica Marigliani. Courtesy of Museo Salvatore Ferragamo. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Conceived and curated by Stefania Ricci with Maria Luisa Frisa, Enrica Morini and Alberto Salvadori, the exhibition was developed in collaboration with other cultural institutions active in Florence and nearby, such as the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, the Gallerie degli Uffizi (the Galleria d’arte moderna, the Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti), Museo Marino Marini, Museo Salvatore Ferragamo and Museo del Tessuto in Prato; these institutions have provided both pieces from their own collections and spaces where to exhibit them. This diverse network brought together the clothes with their original sketches, or allowed to show them alongside the artworks which inspired their creation.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/4-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7135\"><em>Germana Marucelli, Two-piece woman&#039;s dress, 1963, printed with drawings by Paolo Scheggi.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>From the 25th to 27th May, Palazzo Mocenigo in Venice hosted the International Conference on Venetian Textiles.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The role of textiles has been central in the culture, economy and history of Venice, in the past as in present days. The fabrics produced in Venice were traded in and outside the island as luxury goods; they became characteristic of a typically Venetian artistic environment and crucial in the definition of a Venetian fashion in clothing and interior decoration.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/img_4185-665x374.jpg\" alt=\"Doretta Davanzo Poli's lectio magistralis at &quot;History, Production, Trafe and Use of Venetian Textiles&quot; conference, Palazzo Mocenigo, Photo Palazzo Mocenigo, all rights reserved.\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7186\"><em><em>Doretta Davanzo Poli</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Centro Studi di Storia del Tessuto e del Costume di Palazzo Mocenigo, home to one of the largest collections of ancient textiles, recently hosted a conference on ‘History, Production, Trade and Use of Venetian Textiles’, in which international experts, historians and other scholars were invited to share their knowledge on the topic.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/img_4356.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7179\"><em><em>The visit at the archives of Palazzo Mocenigo. Photo Palazzo Mocenigo, all rights reserved.</em></em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The aims of the conference were to frame Venetian fabrics in the wider histories of textiles and trade, and to create a network of the most important textiles’ collections around the world; the informations gathered and discussed during the event will lead to a thorough publication, focusing on production techniques, trade and diffusion of Venetian textiles, as well as on their collections and relations to fashion.</p>\n \n<p align=\"justify\">During this week, from the 4th to the 13th June, Palazzo Mocenigo is engaged in the “Biennale del Merletto”. The international event features installations, talks and workshops on the art of <em>merletto</em>, and is hosted in different locations around the islands of Venice, Burano and Pellestrina. During these days, it is possible to visit the “Scuola del Merletto” in Pellestrina and to have a tour of the Museo del Merletto in Burano, as well as taking part in other relevant cultural events. Have a look at the complete <a href=\"http://mocenigo.visitmuve.it/it/eventi/eventi-in-corso/biennale-del-merletto-2016/2016/05/16792/programma-attivita/\">list of the events</a> to learn more about the conferences, concerts and lectures.</p>\n\nTo learn more, visit Palazzo Mocenigo or take a look at their <a href=\"http://mocenigo.visitmuve.it/en/il-museo/layout-and-collections/itinerary-renewed/\">website</a>.\n\nTo find out about other fashion events happening now all around the world, visit the Europeana Fashion <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/eventoverview.html\">events area</a>."

        title: 'Crowdheritage Workshop at MoMu'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Will the heritage of tomorrow be financed and curated by the crowd?</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">On Tuesday 14th June, MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp is hosting a workshop on crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. Addressed to cultural heritage professionals, the workshops aims to teach how to engage users to let them make contributions to cultural heritage collections through crowdfunding and co-creation.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/st80030_2015dederenformomu-665x972.jpg\" alt=\"Stany Dederen for MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp, CC-BY-SA\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7190\"><em>Stany Dederen for MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Crowdfunding and crowdsourcing are two popular practices in museum management, consisting in the involvement of large number of people in raising contributions and in obtaining informations, typically via the Internet. In 2014, more than 16 billion dollars were raised via crowdfunding worldwide.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The case study for the workshop will be MoMu’s Study Collection, which is being set up by the museum in collaboration with the University of Antwerp. This collection will offer the opportunity to initiate a new dialogue with the Museum’s users; in fact, the main aim is for the collection to be usable and reusable in all its aspects and potential. To support this main idea, the museum is also working together with Goteo Foundation to build a hybrid crowdfunding and crowdsourcing framework, in order to set up a ‘usable’ fashion museum.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The workshop will investigate the ways crowd engagement can help open standards for collaborations and how this collaboration could help design a comprehensive, educative lab context. Moreover, the session will try to define how it is possible to integrate the entire process of conception, design, prototyping and financing for the development of new projects. Will the crowd bring more social innovation to the long-term planning required to determine the future of the common cultural heritage?</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The workshop is organized with the support of the Europeana Foundation.

        title: 'Pitti Archive: “The Fourth Sex. Adolescent Extremes”'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Starting today, Pitti Uomo 90 will present during the week various events, among those “Florence Calling: Raf Simons”.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The event, to be staged in Stazione Leopolda in the evening of Thursday 16th June, celebrates the return to Florence of Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The designer, creative director of Christian Dior from 2012 to 2015 and of Jil Sander from 2005 to 2011, was invited following a series of successful collaborations with Pitti Uomo and Fondazione Pitti Discovery; these include the exhibition “The Fourth Sex - Adolescent Extremes” in 2003, the retrospective “Raf Simons 1995-2005”, the presentation of the book “Raf Simons Redux” with a fashion show and video installation in 2005, and the Jil Sander s/s 2011 runway show.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/pu2003001r00107-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7195\"><em>The exhibition “The Fourth Sex. Adolescent Extremes”, staged in Stazione Leopola during Pitti Uomo 63. Photo by Carlo Fei. Collection Pitti Immagine, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In particular, the 2003 exhibition gives a meaningful insight in Simons’ world. Co-curated by Francesco Bonami, then artistic director of Fondazione Pitti Discovery, and Simons himself, the exhibit reflected upon a central figure in the work of Simons, the teenager; seen as a cultural phenomenon, that of adolescence was explored as a territory defined by very specific tastes, tendencies and interests, although being chaotic in its state of continuous formation.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/pu2003001r00105-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7196\"><em>The exhibition “The Fourth Sex. Adolescent Extremes”, staged in Stazione Leopola during Pitti Uomo 63. Photo by Carlo Fei. Collection Pitti Immagine, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">These ‘adolescent extremes’ have been explored, in the exhibition and in its catalogue, by the work of a multitude of artists, directors, fashion designers and musicians who, since the 60s, have been investigating, getting inspired or inspiring teenagers. They include, among others, photographers Andreas Gursky, Larry Clark, Wolfgang Tillmans, artists Vanessa Beecroft, Gilbert&amp;George, Takashi Murakami and fashion designers André Courrèges, Pierre Cardin, Bernhard Willhelm, Comme des Garçons, Helmut Lang and Fiorucci.</p> \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/pu2003001r00016-665x436.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7197\"><em>The exhibition “The Fourth Sex. Adolescent Extremes”, staged in Stazione Leopola during Pitti Uomo 63. Photo by Carlo Fei. Collection Pitti Immagine, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Installed at Stazione Leopolda by the architect group ‘Cliostraats’, the exhibition drew inspiration from these diverse languages and media to outline teenagers’ grammatics and codes. The value of the exhibition stands in the representation of adolescence as an aesthetic category, serving not only as an inspiration but also as a strong influence in fashion, art, music and cinema.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Pictures of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=%22il+quarto+sesso%22#searchTerm%3D%22il%20quarto%20sesso%22\">“The Fourth Sex.

        title: 'Karl Lagerfeld - The Photographer at Pitti Uomo 90'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Palazzo Pitti inaugurates a three-year program dedicated to the culture of contemporary fashion with a through-the-lens view of Karl Lagerfeld’s photographic works.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition “KARL LAGERFELD - Visions of Fashion”, curated by Eric Pfrunder and Gerhard Steidl, opened yesterday, 14th June, in Florence at Palazzo Pitti, during Pitti Uomo 90.; It shows the designer’s photographic production and includes many unpublished pictures.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/1b-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7204\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Karl Lagerferld - Visions of fashion&quot; at Palazzo Pitti. Photo by Europeana Fashion. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The pathway starts from the grand staircase, Scalone del Moro, and continues through the rooms of the Galleria Palatina, the Sala Bianca and the two rooms of the Appartamenti degli Arazzi. The artworks are placed to the edges of the space, drawing a neon-enlighted path through the rooms of Palazzo Pitti and culminating in the Sala Bianca, where Italian fashion was first shown in 1951. For this room, the curators have decided to print the photos on lightweight paper, to make them flutter from the ceiling, recalling the ethereal movements of the models gliding on the runway.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/21-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7205\"><em>Sunlight in Vermont. Chanel 2009. Exhibition &quot;Karl Lagerferld - Visions of fashion&quot; at Palazzo Pitti. Photo by Europeana Fashion. CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibit is a special anthology celebrating Karl Lagerfeld’s diverse and elegant approach to photography. It unveils images from editorials published in the world’s most widespread fashion magazines, such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Numéro and V Magazine, as well as other original projects, as the ones inspired by classical mythology.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/31-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7206\"><em>Lesson of elegance.

CC BY SA</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">Karl Lagerfeld, fashion designer, photographer, publisher, designer, as well as film director, has begun his photographic production creating the visuals for his fashion shows and the ads for his collections; then his photography ventured also into other territories. At his studio in Rue de Lille, one of the last still shaped as the iconic ones of the nineteenth and early twentieth century,  he has been capturing all the world’s most well-known personalities onto a white paper cyclorama, contributing greatly to contemporary visual culture. His capacity to observe and perceive the world with a very peculiar eye forms a continuum with his work as fashion designer, and fits perfectly within his creative process.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/41-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7207\"><em>Sala Bianca.

The exhibition will be on show from June 15th to October 23rd .</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Learn more about it in the Europeana Fashion event area!</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion meets Paul Van Riel'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The latest update of Europeana Fashion Archive has seen the publication of the photo archive of the Dutch fashion photographer Paul van Riel, who has recently joined the portal as new content provider.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Amsterdam-based, Dutch freelance photographer with an international career in travel and corporate photography, Paul van Riel has dedicated part of his career documenting fashion shows around the globe. In order to present him and his work, we have asked him to share some memories about his past, his practice and his take on fashion. Here is what he told us.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7227\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/11-665x986.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion show of Kansai Yamamoto winter 1981-1982 women&#039;s ready-to-wear collection. Model: Sayoko Yamaguchi. Photo by Paul van Riel. Paris, 1981. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>As we learn from your biography, you have produced photo essays on a wide range of topics and you have travelled a lot. How do you consider your work for fashion, compared to that focused on other subjects?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Fashion photography entered my career only after having been in the business for about 7 or 8 years. In 1974 I tugged along with a friend from Amsterdam, who was a fashion-trade journalist on assignment in Paris, visiting the Salon du Prêt-à-Porter, which was entirely new to me. What started as a nice outing in Paris, quite thoroughly changed my life. I stumbled into a show by Kenzo at the Vieille Bourse and I was approached by various people then and there wanting to buy the rolls of film I had shot. Back home, I contacted a weekly news/lifestyle magazine to shoot a reportage on this Paris fashion scene and within a year, with lots of new contacts, I found myself shooting a growing number of défilés for more than one publication. Till then, my work had mainly been about travel and music photography, the occasional news assignment and some product photography; but between 1975 and 1990 my work schedule was (partly) organized around the fashion show calendars.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7228\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/22-665x454.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion show of Kenzo spring-summer 1982 women&#039;s ready-to-wear collection. Applause at end of show. Photo by Paul van Riel. Paris, 1981. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>You are usually recognised as a photographer, but in your work - even in the catwalk pictures - there is a strong creative element, that makes you an 'image maker' - or 'artist' - in a wider sense. How would you describe yourself and your work, both in general and in relation to the fashion system?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The scene at the Salon and the Kenzo show opened my eyes to a whole new world. I was, and still am, much more interested in the ambiance of these affairs, the social and economic aspects, than in the actual ‘fashion’. Many of the mostly Dutch and Belgian ladies and lifestyle magazines which published my catwalk images, soon asked me to shoot in studio. But to be honest…I preferred to shoot these productions on site; the background, the setting of these shoots were, for me, as important as the clothes themselves. There, I could combine my ‘eye’ for outdoor situations - often without any people in them - with a growing feel for clothing and beauté. It is no surprise that I love the creations of designer Issey Miyake; his work echoes my interest in architecture, sculpture, product design.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1989 I decided to bid farewell to the Paris fashion ‘circus’, after fifteen hectic years. It had become too crowded and ‘commercial’. In October of that year, instead of shooting fashion on stage, I shot a twelve page full colour photo essay for the important Dutch opinion magazine Vrij Nederland, focusing on backstage and on the ambiance around the shows; there were models, buyers, aficionados, photographers, journalists, makeup artists and so on.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7229\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/32-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion show of Issey Miyake spring-summer 1978 women&#039;s ready-to-wear collection. Model: Sayoko Yamaguchi. Paris, 1977. Photo by Paul van Riel. Paris, 1981. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>What made you decide to organise an archive of your work? What does the act of archiving mean, to you as an author?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">I always held on to almost all the material I photographed over the years, fashion and otherwise, as well as hundreds if not thousands of my published pages of photography; I also kept the full correspondence with clients and organizations, and stacks of notebooks, accounts of travel expenses etc...not very much is being thrown away here. Europeana Fashion gave me the final push to start digitizing all of that, systematically. As it costs too much time to make a representative selection out of all the more than 1.000 shows I photographed in Paris and Milan, I decided to reproduce each entire collection.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7230\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/42-665x975.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion show of Jean-Paul Gaultier spring-summer 1983 women&#039;s ready-to-wear collection. Queen Elizabeth look alike. Photo by Paul van Riel. Paris, 1982. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>You have enriched the Europeana fashion portal with an amazing selection of images. Could you give us an idea of the kind of material you decided to share, and why?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Looking back at the Prêt-à-Porter work – some of it is 42 years old – it tells a great story of changing tastes, the influence of various cultures on the global face of fashion (e.g. the Japanese entering the stage in the late 70’s, early 80’s). It really testifies the passage from simple catwalk shows with models holding a card with a number on it, to the outrageous multi-media presentations attended by thousands of people.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7231\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/51.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion show of Jean Paul Gaultier. Paris, 1989. Photo by Paul van Riel. Paris, 1981. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>As a photographer, in which way would you make use of a resource as Europeana Fashion?</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For me, as a photographer now just interested in fashion ‘on the side’, the Europeana Fashion database does offer a lot of information when doing research for future, design related stories.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Search the amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html#dataProviders%3DPaul%20van%20Riel\">Paul van Riel</a>'s collection on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.paulvanriel.com\">Paul van Riel</a></p>"

        title: 'Let’s Dance!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A new theme available now on Europeana Fashion portal: Let’s Dance! A gathering of fashion objects linked to the world of dance.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Well-known to the collective imagination, the ballgown has long been considered the culmination of fashion trends, in many epoques and different geographies.\nDance is a form of expression that has naturally developed in different societies: the research and use of rythm, the excercise of both free and controlled movements, the performative potential of the body are all phenomena examinated by disciplined dealing with human behaviour, such as sociology, ethnography and antropology.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/1d6438f2b98742c877a41cb16a9c2b34.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7246\"><em>Fashion plate by Georges Barbier: Falbalas et Fanfreluches. Almanach des modes. Mlle Sorel au bal du grand prix. Paris, 1923. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert museum CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">While being often regarded as a moment of freedom, dance has indeed been translated in well-constructed and ‘designed’ events, such as balls and receptions, which were - and still are - occasions for men and women to meet. The birth of society system saw the development of balls as the occasions for young ladies to debut and hopefully find the right partner; the actual dance was the ground where pairs were made, according to the ability to lead and follow, that was considered to mirror the capacity to be a good husband and wife. Still now, the dancefloor is supposed to be one of the best places for couples to meet, being a sort of shared space where people with the same tastes get together and move following the same beat.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/fb7a0c17bb78d59204985b5d97dc342f-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7248\"><em>Illustration by Franz Joseph Freiherr von Lipperheide, Hesse &amp; Becker: two ballgowns. 1895.

From the court receptions to the more recent proms, passing through the folkloristic balls, usually performed wearing traditional costumes, and the disco, the ‘dance attire’ has always been about visibility and appearance, arousing in both men and women the desire to appear at their best, in line with the evolving standards of beauty of each time.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/pff12.19.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7250\"><em>Folk costume.

On a more personal level, they visually translate the ambition to appear, to sound, to fly like a bird to the beat of the music: once worn, dance gowns become sort of magic objects, transforming the wearer from duckling into swan and boosting his or her confidence. In any case, they are not only worn to be seen, but above all to be noticed and to be remembered.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Visit Europeana Fashion themes area to see more images and get inspired to discover more about the fascinating links between fashion and dance.</p>"

        title: 'New theme: ‘Monochromes’'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>For this new theme, Europeana Fashion explored its collection through its multitude of hues, selecting a bunch of beautiful pieces for which just one colour is enough!</strong>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Colour is a constitutive element of fashion and design. It is not possible to conceive a dress, an object or an accessory without considering its color or hue. As colours bring into fashion influences taken from art, history, economy and politics, it is right to consider the choice of a specific colour as important as the shape or cut of a garment itself.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/m-2008-1039-pg-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7260\"><em>Bodice and skirt, designed by Madeleine Vionnet, 1921. Collection Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The history of fashion is intertwined with the history of colours. In the past as in the presents, different cultures and traditions have used colours to mark or stress distinctions, may those be social or class related; different meanings were - and are - attributed to different colours, according to their rarity, origin and diffusion, and colours were used accordingly to the ‘role’ the clothes had to perform. Some colours have been associated to precise moments or events in people’s life, becoming inappropriate when worn in other occasions.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/b63ce47a777e1afa89082f9996d705af.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7259\"><em>Bodice and skirt of Jaquard-woven silk trimmed with satin and lined with glazed cotton, Great Britain, 1862. Collection Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As for contemporary fashion, not only many designers have their signature colours, like Elsa Schiaparelli’s ‘Shocking Pink’, Emilio Pucci’s ‘Blu Emilio’ and ‘Rosa Pucci’, or the ‘Quattrocento Blu’ of Lanvin; particular colours have been also associated with the work of a designer, as red for Valentino or black for the radical creations of Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo; in other cases, colour becomes an essential feature of specific fashion object, as for the famous “petit robe noir”.</p> \n\n<p align=\"justify\">From this kaleidoscopic universe, Europeana selected from its collection some of the most interesting examples of colour blocks, presenting them in the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themedetail.html#26\">new theme: ‘Monochromes’</a>!

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A new theme unveils original items from the Europeana Fashion Collection: an ideal ‘zoo’ gathers a selection of clothing and accessories where animals - in all their forms - are absolute protagonists.</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\">\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/0000029501n6-665x538.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7293\"><em>Detail of ivory silk blouse embroidered with giraffes, palm trees and cactuses, Italian manufacture, 1936, Courtesy Galleria del Costume Palazzo Pitti</em></p>\n\n</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">the fascination fashion has had with the animal world doesn’t stop at the use of prints and patterns of animal skins. Even though the first association that comes to mind when thinking about animals and fashion is the use of animalier patterns - and thus the idea of 'second skin’ - to create illusions and interesting juxtapositions, animals are the actual and unexpected protagonists of many of the items in the Europeana Fashion Collection.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Every society has interpreted animals in different ways, according to the mythologies linked to their behaviour and appearance. Animals have long been associated with well-defined features that identify them with precise characters. Allegorical representation of animals to signify force, beauty or grace are a common practice in many languages, visual as well as written and spoken; actual animals have been transformed by imagination in fantastic entities, such as dragons, and populated legends and magical stories.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/727a85107e5d154903718f6fe484479b3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7294\"><em>Brooch-pendant in the form of a honeycomb in gold, diamonds and fire opals, made by John Donald, London 1969. Courtesy Victoria&amp;Albert Museum</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Animals are often associated with fortune or misfortune, and it is no surprise that they have been used as inspiration to create jewels and amulets. They are also often used to define personalities, and both art and fashion have used them as inspirations, metaphors to layer different meanings on objects and artefacts; the ‘amazing creatures’ populate skirts and waistcoats, forming intricate patterns or occupying the whole surface of jumpers and dresses, and have sometimes represented the encounter of different expertise and disciplines - not only art and fashion, but also illustration, biology and botany.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The motifs from the natural world have been translated into true-to-life decorations for clothes and accessories, but there is also a ludic element linked with the appearance of animals as ‘friends’ which makes them suitable for children-wear; the ‘cartoonisation’ of animals is a common practice not only in these kind of clothes, but also in the work of contemporary designers incorporating the idea of playfulness in their creations.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Travel through times and spaces and discover some of the uses of animals in fashion on the\_<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themedetail.html#27\">Europeana Fashion Portal</a></p>"

        title: 'Exhibiting Dress: Enganging with the Past and the Present'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>On Saturday 28th May, the Hellenic Costume Society held a symposium to reflect on the practice of exhibiting dress. </strong>\n\nThe symposium was organised in collaboration with the Netherlands Institute at Athens, and was part of the celebrations in Athens of the International Museum Day 2016. ‘Exhibiting Dress: Enganging with the Past and the Present’ - the title of the event - invited many experts to investigate the approaches and current trends in exhibiting dress in museums, aiming to find innovative ways to pursue the practices of display and exhibition making.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/13307265_10154168813443890_8412680057036018381_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7322\"><em>Sofia Pantouvaki, Sjouk Hoitsma, Amy de la Haye, Flavia Loscialpo at the symposium </em></p>\n\nProminent international figures from both museums and academia took part in the conversation, providing interesting insights and case studies to both reflect on the past and think how to move forward. These personalities came from a variety of institutions, and among them we can count Amy de la Haye (London School of Fashion), Sjouk Hoitsma (Museum Rotterdam), Flavia Loscialpo (Southampton Solent University), Sofia Pantouvaki (Aalto University), Monica Titton (University of Applied Arts Vienna); the curatorial teams of many Greek museums holding collections of historical dress were also present, as the Museum of Greek Folk Art, the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation and the Museum of the History of the Greek Costume.\n\nNew and interesting ideas and projects were presented during the sessions; the general direction seemed to consider the audience of fashion exhibitions as active agent in the shaping of the exhibits themselves: most paper featured videos, art and performances designed to engage with materiality and embodiment, trying to provide sensorial as well as visual experiences. \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/20160528_170654-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7323\"><em>Sjouk Hoitsma from Museum Rotterdam is presenting the digital platform created through the Europeana Fashion project at the symposium &#039;Exhibiting Dress: Engaging with the Past and the Present&#039;, in Athens. All rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe use of new technologies and communicative techniques was discussed as well; in this sense, Sjouk Hoitsma, curator of Museum Rotterdam, presented a digital platform created in the context of Europeana Fashion project, giving a good example of how beneficial the cooperation between different institutions can be in the context of museum and fashion practice.\n\nMainly focused on the involvement of the public in fashion exhibitions, the symposium analyzed initiatives that invited residents in exploring their sartorial and national heritage; in this context, many projects that challenged the very meaning of exhibition and “exhibiting” were presented, stressing on how various the meanings of this practice have become and unveiling the potential of further explorations in the field of fashion exhibitions."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>At MUDE and MACE, the exhibition Abaixo as Fronteiras! Vivam o Design e as Artes challenges the hierarchies and reflects on the intersections between design and art.</strong></p>\n\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/20160520_lf_dsc4945-665x474.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7361\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Abaixo as Fronteiras! Vivam o Design e as Artes&quot;. Photo by Elvas. Courtesy of MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda. All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibit explores the links between design and art in a broad sense, trying to understand what defines the frontiers of two disciplines, and possibly proposing to overcome these boundaries in order to get a richer picture of the connections between two fields so intertwined. This reflection becomes material in the display, which presents objects that stand on the blurred line that divides the disciplines. Drawing from the wide collection of the museum archive, the exhibition puts on stage a dialogue, where the object themselves serve as the main actors.</p>\n\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/20160520_lf_dsc4951-665x996.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7366\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Abaixo as Fronteiras! Vivam o Design e as Artes&quot;. Photo by Elvas. Courtesy of MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda. All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The role of fashion in this dialogue is, at the same time, complex and essential; fashion itself can be considered a case study to understand the fluidity of the relationship between function and contemplation, innovation and craftsmanship, reproducibility and uniqueness. For this reason, the exhibition features designs by the likes of Alexander McQueen, Ana Salazar, Azzedine Alaïa, Christian Lacroix, Comme des Garçons, Dirk van Saene, Dries van Noten, Gianni Versace, Issey Miyake, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Maison Martin Margiela, Vivienne Westwood and Walter Van Beirendonck alongside other names from the industrial design, architecture and art scenes.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In presenting different styles, chronologies and angles, the exhibition asserts the role of fashion as catalyst in the comprehension of the contemporary value of the concepts of ‘design’ and ‘art’ and, above all, in the interdisciplinarity of the two. The Lisbon display focuses on creators and authors, and fashion designers have historically been pioneers in questioning any static definition and giving material shape to ideas concerning the encounter of personal feelings, the body and the environment.</p>\n\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-06/20160520_lf_dsc5046-665x996.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7363\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Abaixo as Fronteiras! Vivam o Design e as Artes&quot;. Photo by Elvas. Courtesy of MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda. All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The exhibition serves also as a reflection on the value of collecting fashion; the destitution of the hierarchy between fine and applied art underlines the value of fashion objects as storytellers, whether they are unforgettable icons of an era, or material memories of everyday and mundane experiences. Fashion in fundamental in museum collections because of its social value, and clothes and accessories are a tangible document of the historical changes in attitudes, tastes and opinions.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Discover more about the exhibition on MUDE Website and explore the MUDE Fashion collection on the Europeana Fashion Portal.</strong></p>\n\n<div></div>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR’S COLUMN - Paper Fashion'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>This month, the Europeana Fashion Blog will focus on the many ways fashion has been represented in prints, drawings and photographs.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Fashion stands between the material production of clothes and accessories and the construction of myths and stories around these objects. That's why the Europeana Fashion portal is dedicating this July to what we decided to call ‘paper fashion’: a journey throughout the materials hold in all the collections of our partners, crossing boundaries and proposing a new insight into these precious files that build up the Europeana Fashion collection.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7349 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/mude.g.19851.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The cover of Paris Match n 621, 4 March 1961, presenting the latest fashions of 1961, Courtesy MUDE Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Illustration is an umbrella term that collects different experiences related to the depiction of fashion: from sketches and drawings, to plates, real and utopian scenes: all these different techniques were employed in order to communicate within a certain network of people and convey messages and ideas. In this sense, Illustration is a language, capable of giving informations when the material object cannot be moved - or has not even been made yet.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Not always linked just to small circles of experts - as designers, pattern makers and fashion illustrators - fashion and its eccentricities were also, very often, the favourite subjects of caricatures and satire, which played on the effects the changes in silhouettes, apparel and appearance had on social interactions in urban scenarios. These plates help us understand how fashion was perceived by the public and how its significance has been mediated via its portrayal.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7348 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/0d8b79df22b5704bcf03ad228867ba18.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion plate, &#039;The Newest Fashions for April 1860&#039; from The Ladies Gazette of Fashion, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Photography also plays a big role in the representation and circulation of fashion; this is true not only for editorials and catwalk pictures, but also for private photographs, where the protagonists choose carefully how to present themselves - and thus how to be immortalised.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The force of all these various kinds of depictions lays in the collaborations between different personalities, in the use of various styles and, above all, in the power of these images to create a whole new world around an object. Therefore the potential of these ‘paper fashions’ is immense. Each mode of representation tells a different story about fashion and unveils its various meanings, and this is our aim this month: to present some of , and give sparks to reflect on the meaning of these kind of material within a fashion collection.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Get ready to discover more about how fashion has been represented, and to listen to some of the stories these images tell: find your favourites this month on the Europeana Fashion portal.</strong></p>\n\n<div></div>"

        title: 'Revisiting ‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion’ exhibition at MoMu'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>In 2009 MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp hosted the exhibition ‘RRRIPP!! Paper Fashion’ that investigated the use of paper in fashion design and the historical importance of the paper dress.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Paper is the material of the ephemeral, the physical support where fashion is usually sketched, represented and through which it is diffused. Realm of the bidimensional,  paper flattens fashion in photographies, drawings and illustrations or explores it through words. However, in the 1960s the relationship between paper and fashion went beyond the two dimensions, and paper dresses became a craze which would have made history.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/paperfashion_scenografie_-c2-a9kortekaas-48-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"The exhibition ‘RRRIPP!!

Paper Fashion’, hosted at MoMu in 2009.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/paperfashion_dirkvansaene_-c2-a9kortekaas-18-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"Paper dresses designed by Dirk Van Saene at the exhibition ‘RRRIPP!!

Sophia Kokosalaki, Michael Cepress, Yiorgos Eleftheriades, Johanna Trudzinski, Bas Kosters, Angelos Bratis, Deux Hommes, Marcus Tomlinson, as well as the internationally renowned stage designer Bob Wilson participated with their creations to the exhibition, together with Dirk Van Saene, John Galliano, Issey Miyake, A.F. Vandevorst, Hussein Chalayan, Kosuke Tsumura, Walter Van Beirendonck, Ann Demeulemeester.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/paperfashion_scenografie_-c2-a9kortekaas-45-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"The exhibition ‘RRRIPP!!

They were first released in America, as a mean to promote the products of a paper manufacturing company. These light, disposable dresses soon captured the vibrant atmosphere of the 1960s and became a big phenomenon; they were sold in major department stores and printed with bold and whimsical pop-art patterns. Their popularity though was ephemeral as their materiality: by 1968 they almost disappeared from any market.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Revisit the exhibition through these pictures by Boy Kortekaas and browse <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=%22paper+dress%22#searchTerm%3D%22paper%20dress%22\">Europeana Fashion collection of paper dresses</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Tumblr curation by the Israel Museum'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Discover the traditions and costume regarding children and childrenswear in the Jewish culture around the world this July on the Europeana Fashion Tumblr!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, is the new curator of the Europeana Fashion Tumblr. During this month, the Museum will focus the Tumblr on children and childrenswear: a photographic journey unearthing the cultural traditions that offers interesting perspectives on the latest directions of contemporary fashion.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/tumblr_o9tukgx2om1s0n7o6o1_1280-651x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7379\"><em>Rosie, Margit, and Arjie Fischer, in Temesvár, Hungary (now Timişoara, Romania), 1910. Collection of Tehiya and Harry Sapir, Jerusalem, Photographic Archive of the Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.imj.org.il/en/</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The pictures are selected from The Photographic Archive at the Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life, house to an extensive collection of rare photographs documenting the daily life of Jewish communities around the world. Its tens-of-thousands items include images of synagogues, cemeteries, and ceremonies, as well as various aspects of everyday life – costumes, jewelry, homes. Many photographs date from the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century, and constitute culturally, historically, and ethnographically valuable testimonies of a world now forgotten. Often these are the only surviving images from a once-thriving community that no longer exists.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/326-50053851-665x451.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7380\"><em>Ester Talkar and her family, Bene Israel Community, Bombey, India, early 20th century. Photographic Archive of the Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.imj.org.il/en/</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The pictures show how many children’s garments looked like miniature versions of adult clothing, as children in traditional societies were considered adults-in-the-making from an early age; this testifies how the idea of ‘childhood’ as a distinct period of life  only emerged in Europe in recent centuries, eventually spreading to other cultures. In the Baghdad Jewish community, for example, the outfit worn by an eight-day-old baby boy at his circumcision resembled the coat worn by a bridegroom.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/tumblr_o9sa69bwug1s0n7o6o1_1280-657x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7381\"><em>Boy wearing an embroidered outfit in the style of Aqra, Iraqi Kurdistan, 1979. Photographic Archive of the Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.imj.org.il/en/</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Important additions accompanied many of the adult-looking clothes of babies and toddlers: special amulets to protect them from harm, at a time when child mortality was widespread. Since traditional societies placed a higher value on male children, in some communities an attempt was made to confuse the evil forces intent on harming young boys by dressing them in girls’ clothing. Later on, the Western idea of using color to distinguish between boys and girls also exerted an influence.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Learn more about these traditions or let yourself be fascinated by this visual history in black and white in the <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a>.

        title: 'George Barbier'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>George Barbier, born in 1882 in Nantes, was only 29 years old when he mounted his first exhibition in 1911. The exhibition immediately led him to start a lucky career as dessinateur, with commissions to design theatre and ballet costumes, to illustrate books, and to produce fashion illustrations for Haute Couture.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">His graphic style was typical of the Art Deco school, visibly influenced by Orientalism, Indian miniatures, Ballet Russes and Parisian Haute Couture. His very precisely-illustrated fashion vignettes are evocative of the upper-class lifestyle of the 1920s.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/07d8330a3b90d1bb9934ec8de90f896d.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7384\"><em>&quot;L&#039;Orgueil&quot;.

Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. ©George Barbier CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">After his studies at the Excole des Beaux Arts, Barbier was at the head of a group of artists, nicknamed by the magazine Vogue ‘The Knights of the Bracelet’, because of their fashionable and flamboyant mannerisms and style of dress. This élite circle also included Bernard Boutet de Monvel, Pierre Brissaud, Paul Iribe, Georges Lepape and Charles Martin.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Among many other collaborations, Barbier worked closely with the fashion designer Erté, firstly designing sets and costumes for Le Folies Bergère and later, in 1929, writing the introductory text for Erté's acclaimed exhibition.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/21953-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7386\"><em>Silk fabric designed by Georges Barbier for Bianchini-Férier. 1920. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Apart from his artworks, Barbier was also a skilled journalist, writing stories and society news for a variety of magazines. He worked with some of the best writers and journalists of his days, contributing to ‘La Gazette du Bon Ton’ and ‘Le Vie Parisienne’, where he pioneered the use of pochoirs or stencils for the publication of his color-plates.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Although his career lasted only about twenty years - he died at the very pinnacle of his success in 1932 - George Barbier has been one of the most prestigious French artist and illustrators of the early twentieth century; he is also a central figure to understand the relationship between art and fashion in Paris in this key moment for the development of couture as ‘the world of dreams’.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/ee0ece8ff810098792b4af794acbda68.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7388\"><em>Title-plate by George Barbier, colour process engraving, Falbalas et Fanfreluches.

The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, for instance, holds a copy of Falbalas and Fanfreluches, and the images of it are part of the Europeana Fashion portal. Falbalas and Fanfreluches was one of Barbier’s most succesful publications, and also one of the several luxury magazines designed exclusively for the collector’s market by popular illustrators and artists during the 1910s and 1920s; It consists of a series of pochoir-printed portfolios, which developes as a catalogue of various liaisons and amours.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Browse George Barbier and discover more amazing items by the illustrator on <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=barbier#searchTerm%3Dbarbier\">the Europeana Fashion Portal</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Dress to Disguise and Play: The Masquerade'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>The performative quality of clothes is so strong that it also create the space to become someone else, even just for a little while. Masquerades have been, for centuries, events designed especially to play this game, and costumes were its absolute protagonists.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7397\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/9e5e4cec00aa63e69a51a542d13681c91.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Queen of Clubs’, watercolour drawing by Jules Helleu of a masquerade ball dress, probably for Charles Frederick Worth. Paris, 1860s, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The existence of masquerades - as designed social gatherings where the participants had to wear a costume - can be dated back to the 15th century; they started off as occasions organised in Europe to celebrate royal entries, marriages or dynastic events, then, from 16th century, they were popularised as public festivities. Far from being events reserved to the higher strata of society, these kind of festivals were to take place on the streets of the city and all the population could dress up, participate and perform a self other from their own.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">For their allowed extravagance, masquerades were one of the favourite themes for plates and satirical prints, which usually took the fancy attires of the participants to the extremes, depicting grotesques scenes, funny accidents and nearly absurd misunderstandings happening during these times of joy and folly.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7400\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/fceccfb76e87ff74b342ea8808165e171-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Philip Dawe, &#039;The Macaroni. A real Character at the Late Masquerade’, caricature, London, photo Dietmar Katz, Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC-BY-NC-SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Infact, women and mens used these occasions to put on the most marvellous and bizzarre ensembles, disguising their aspect as well as their identity - in some occasions, even crossdressing was tolerated. Playing with clothes functioned as a sort of social pleasure, allowing a degree of freedom that was unusual in society governed by wide differences between classes. Left aside for a day their ‘daily uniform’, everyone could disguise as someone else, helped by the possibility to accessorise the extravagant outfit with a mask, usually as elaborated as the dress itself.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The very nature of masquerades as more or less exclusive social events changed over time. With the birth of couture in the second half of 19th century, the name of some well-known designers became associated with some of the most exquisite example of dress chosen by society ladies to take part in these events and ‘steal the scene’. The images illustrating this article show some designs by Charles Frederick Worth, who collaborated with famous desinnateurs to produce these drawings; these sketches had to be incredibly detailed and well-done, to tackle the curiosity of his demanding clients.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7398\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/f8f1c287118e205ff215cc3521c3f6f2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Eve and the Serpent’, watercolour drawing, by Leon Sault of a masquerade ball dress, probably for Charles Frederick Worth. Paris, 1860s, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Worth’s designs for masquerade were especially appreciated by Empress Eugenie, who used to commission her ‘fancy’ outfits to the couturier - usually with very short notice and great expectations. Empress Eugenie held numerous masquerades during the 1860s, and all the society ladies of Paris followed her ‘fashion leadership’, also turning to Worth for their own attires.</p>\n<strong>We can live the memory of these marvellous events through the drawings of these dreamy dresses: discover some of these designs on the Europeana Fashion portal.</strong>"

        title: 'Strike a Pose. Fashion in portraits'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>‘Strike a pose’ is a very common expression in fashion, referring to the idea of ‘posing’ in front of the objective of a photographer. However, posing is not something we find just in fashion editorials; it is a sort of acting, performed by people in many portraits and photographs.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7412\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/8f57b7e9224b10619a26906ec74cfab6.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Group portrait of three girls in an outdoor environment in Lima, Dalarna, 1925-35, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">These ‘representations’ are less directly linked to the fashion system; nevertheless, they have the capability to convey information about the complex and ever-changing relationship between people and their dress, identity and sartorial choices. Photographic portraits are fascinating as they are enigmatic. They are testimonies, incredibly valuable sources to study, understand and appreciate fashions and styles of the past, as they were interpreted and lived by people in their everyday.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7413\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/maa_19354.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Portrait of Mina Hadzi Paskovic dressed as a gipsy woman, 1931, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Looking at these materials, we can analyse customs and manners, even the personalities and attitudes of the people ‘captured’ in the shoots; why are they wearing those clothes? How did they pick them, and what do they mean for them? What do the clothes say about the time in which the photograph was taken, and about class, social status, history more generally? Every photograph tells a particular story, freezes a moment and allows us to actually see the way in which clothes were used and styled in real life: dresses and accessories are like props, and their very use, shown in the photos, becomes the material memory.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7414\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/af82b46a558cdf4806ce96da94638ec2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Portrait of a couple in the countryside of Lima, Dalarna, 1925-35, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Most of the times though, it is very difficult to be able to grasp the full story just by looking at a photograph. The relationship between a person and the clothes chosen for that photo is so intimate and linked to personal experiences, that it is hard to tell the real reason why that particular dress was selected to be immortalised in the photograph. Under this respect, the photograph in itself is a designed object, controlled in every part; it speaks about the character of the sitter, his or her way to be presented and to be remembered, and this is its most beguiling characteristic.

        title: 'Pedro Rodriguez'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Born in Valencia in 1895, Pedro Rodriguez became apprenticed to a tailor when he was just ten. While still a teenager, he was already designing on his own and, in 1919, he founded his fashion house, which was the first to be opened in Spain.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">His work became very popular after a showing at the Barcelona Fair in 1929, making him especially known for his beaded evening gowns. With his elegant and classic style, Pedro Rodriguez seduced the high class of Barcelona and, during his career, he managed to gain international success, establishing himself as a reference in Europe’s Haute Couture.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/76f26a1ea618b4d2eb09bed970682678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7426\"><em>Fashion plate by Pedro Rodriguez.

All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Like his compatriot and friend Cristobal Balenciaga, Rodriguez moved to Paris at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. While Balenciaga remained in Paris after the end of the war in 1939, Rodriguez decided to go back to his native country and quickly started opening new boutiques, in San Sebastian and Madrid. In 1940 he also founded the Cooperative of Haute Couture, of which he remained president until his death; during his mandate, he worked hard for the promotion of Spanish fashion abroad. Unfortunately, the Spain that Rodriguez returned to was ruled by the authoritarian government of Francisco Franco, who caused a relative cultural and political isolation; this is probably the reason why Rodriguez's reputation was largely confined to Spain.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/b982f308666d7cd0cc92695f9bf5d98a.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7427\"><em>Model wearing a dress by Pedro Rodríguez.

The festival, which featured the work of Pedro Rodriguez and four other Spanish design houses, was the first attempt to market Spanish fashion to an international audience; Rodriguez was described as the preeminent Spanish designer working in Spain.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/e06b1f6ff770506c68bdfc49bfe5368f.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7428\"><em>Figurine: pencil drawing by Pedro Rodriguez.

        title: 'The Paper dolls of Anne Sanders Wilson'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Paper dolls are two-dimensional figures representing a vast variety of subjects, as people, animals or objects. Printed or hand drawn, paper dolls were widely used throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as toys for children, or as a funny entertainment for wealthy adults.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1832, Anne Sanders Wilson used paper dolls to illustrate the tale of redemption of a ‘fashion-stricken’ young lady, Miss Wildfire. The paper dolls came each with a hat and eight different outfits, from a maid&#039;s dress in blue with a striped apron to a fancy dress in &#039;Vandyke&#039; style, all in watercolour on card.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/4bab9fc16447884a862d32c4e54a75e7.jpg\" alt=\"Paper doll's head, watercolour on card, made by Anne Sanders Wilson, London, 1832.

Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">These came alongside a manuscript called ‘The History of Miss Wildfire’, and were used to visualise the misadventures of the protagonist; she used to dress with fancy clothes, then she descended into poverty after the death of her father and was forced to earn her keep as a lace-maker. Eventually, she managed to ‘redeem’ herself with marriage and conversion to Quakerism.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/60171637a792d20dd0123a0f0015ebae.jpg\" alt=\"Paper doll's costumes, watercolour on card, made by Anne Sanders Wilson, London, 1832.

Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Anne Sanders Wilson’s paper dolls constitute a recollection of costumes from the second half of the 1820s to the early 1830s; they range from fancy, fashionable clothes to working class and occupational dresses. Despite their recreational purpose, these dolls, manufactured in London in the first decade of the nineteenth century, became a far-reaching mean to create fashion stories and contribute to the diffusion of styles.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/5219e1cf3b5cacd5a8818505067c547f.jpg\" alt=\"Paper doll's costumes, watercolour on card, made by Anne Sanders Wilson, London, 1832.

Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In fashion, in fact, paper dolls covered an important role in the diffusion of the latest trends. In this sense, paper dolls were used since the second half of the eighteenth century in fashion cities like Vienna, London or Paris. They were sometimes created by dressmakers to show current styles not only in clothes, but also in coiffures and accessories. For the speed with which printed fashion images could be distributed, paper dolls became a favourite medium to spread information about fashion, characterizing the period from circa 1825 to 1850.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Browse the Europeana Fashion portal to find other beautiful paper dolls by Ann Sanders Wilson or discover more examples of fashionable paper dolls!</strong></p>"

        title: 'Parades: Identity on display'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Parades are celebrations filling the streets of a city with people marching together, for the most various reasons. They are highly designed events, in which costumes play a fundamental part in defining the tone and overall image of the celebration itself.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7443\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/2000.16.0142-665x448.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Parade with local costumes from Messologhi, Greece, 1936-1939. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Parades, above all official or military ones, represent the encounter with the necessity to give a ‘face’ to power and the interest in using the ‘spectacle’ to produce consent. For this reason, from the parades originated various ‘bidimensional’ materials that had the role of portraying an ephemeral performance, to record and remember it; these materials are what we use today to know more about these performances. In fact, the most direct and immediate source to get to know something about parades of the past are prints and, where possible, photographs; these materials, together with actual garments and props that survived in museum collections and archives, are for us documents of past practices and also fascinating postcards showing the different ways in which people used to colonise the streets of their city and shape their common national or group identity.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7444\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/2000.16.0082.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Tinted photo of men with costume from Pontus and a man with military uniform. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Even though it is excessive to say that parades can be read as quasi-fashion events, the similarities are hardly deniable. They are both highly controlled, from the timing and choreography to the dresses and walk, and serve to present something, be it a collection or a set of military values, and convey meaning. Fashion historian Caroline Evans has underlined the common features between the first fashion shows held at the beginning of twentieth century and military parades, highlighting the link between the two events, in which dress is central. The design of parade attires is very precise, and each detail has a role in producing the spectacularity of the march: the factors taken into account were multiple, from the sound of medals in movement, to the dimensions and look of accessories and insigna, to the effect of light on the different colours and textures.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7445\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/eb658ff69ab3c2ffbc1ea63fcc021ba4.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Portrait of two hussarl soldiers in their military uniforms, 1843, Courtesy Centraal Museum</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Plates depicting uniforms and ‘parade attires’ are very important, not only to understand how the outfit were composed and what details differentiate roles and positions; they also give us information about the way each garment had to be styled and what kind of pose and ‘posture’ they requested, in order to perform in a successful way.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>March to our collection and seek new stories about fashion and uniforms on the Europeana Fashion portal.</strong></p>"

        title: 'Constance Wibaut'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>The Dutch fashion illustrator Constance Wibaut (1920 - 2014) once said that the hardest part in fashion drawing is ‘how to get chic on paper’. </strong>\n\nIn an interview filmed for the exhibition ‘Modepalezein in Amsterdam: 1880-1960’ held at Amsterdam Museum in 2007, she talked about her practice, explaining what she learned during her career (you can view the interview <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CHnT_3hiWk\">here</a>). Constance Wibaut, who studied sculpture at the Nieuwe Kunstschool and at the Rijksacademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, moved to New York with her husband just after the Second World War. There, In 1946, she found a job as fashion illustrator for the magazine Women’s Wear Daily.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/2d3de74c729bd5a1051307d759c12498-665x866.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion illustration by Constance Wibaut, 1955.

Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag via Modemuze, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAt WWD she developed her signature style, drawing ready-to-wear clothes on a hanger for the magazine. The need to be precise and to include all the details, from the buttons to the stitchings - as they were important for sales – would have influenced her future illustrations, which were characterised by elegance and easy legibility.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/edb92944889759f4498d7e77852ad759.jpg\" alt=\"Three evening ensembles by Dior in a fashion illustration by Constance Wibaut, 1956.

Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag via Modemuze, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn 1953, Wibaut moved back to her native Amsterdam and started working as fashion illustrator for Elsevier Weekblad, later becoming fashion editor of the same publication. In Europe, Wibaut illustrated the creations of many of the greatest couturiers of the 1950s and 1960s, including Pierre Cardin, Cristobal Balenciaga and Christian Dior. Many of these drawings and illustrations, often sketched in the designers’ ateliers right after the shows, are now collected in the archive of Gemeente Museum den Haag and are part of Europeana Fashion collection.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/b198ca43aae4f7c2d5bb075ba9612d0a-665x931.jpg\" alt=\"Chanel, Dior, Jacques Fath and Madeleine de Rauch in a fashion illustration by Constance Wibaut, 1956-57.

Since the 1950s, she taught fashion illustration in Universities and academies in the USA and the Netherlands and gave lectures on Costume History, Costume Drawing and Stage Design; she worked as lecturer until 1985, when she left fashion to focus on sculpture.\n\n<strong>Browse the Europeana Fashion collection to find many of her illustrations depicting creations by Christian Dior, Cristobal Baleciaga, Nina Ricci and Pierre Cardin, to get a unique insight of a feminine point of view in the golden age of Couture.</strong>"

Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<strong>The outfit is a summer ensemble composed by a dress and a bodice. The dress is made in linen and cretonne; it was designed in 1907 by french couturier Paul Poiret. The french word ‘évêque’ means ‘bishop', recalling the proportions and overall look of the cassock used by members of the clergy.</strong>\n\nThe bodice is white, with small pleats on the front and flouncy sleeves that narrow from under the elbow to the wrist, and also presents some pleats. The skirt is composed by a belt, a first part with vertical stripes and a second with horizontal stripes, that hits the floor; the textile is printed with a particular technique, called planche de bois, which consists of a printing with a wooden board carved with the motif.\n\nIn 1907, Poiret launched the ‘colonne’ line, beginning his experimentations in alternatives to the current proposals for women clothing. The designs belonging to this line were characterised by a long and straight skirt, to which was attached a belt in gross grain; this belt was not only an aesthetic choice, but allowed to wear the dress without the need of a corset. In fact, in his autobiography En Habillant L’Epoque, the couturier declared to have ‘freed women from the tyranny of the corset’.\n\nThe object is part of Les Arts Decoratifs Archive.

        title: Femina
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Subtitled ‘The perfect review for women and girls’, the illustrated magazine created on 1st February 1901 by Pierre Lafitte took its name from the Latin word femina, meaning ‘woman’.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Femina was the first French magazine targeting a female audience, consisting mainly of readers belonging to the middle class; central for the magazine was the support to Parisian fashion in the early twientieth century, which was advertised thorugh the pages as the most fashionable option for intelligent and refined women caring about their appearance.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/fem-jaargang-02-19020701_016-665x814.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7469\"><em>Dress worn by Queen Alexandra for the coronation ceremony. Fashion print published on &#039;Femina&#039;. July 1902. Courtesy of ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The illustrations represented the main attraction of the magazine. On May  1st, 1903, Femina titled \"Women Artists at the 1903 Salon\" and dedicated three pages to the illustrations of Louise Abbéma, Louise Catherine Breslau, Camille Claudel, Maximilienne Guyon Louise Clément-Carpeaux, Laure Coutan-Montorgueil  and Juana Romani. After a few years, the magazine cover, which had previously been mostly a reproduction of a photograph, started to be accompanied by a cartoon illustration in bi-chroma.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/fem-jaargang-03-19031101.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7470\"><em>Femina - issue Nov. 1, 1903. Courtesy of ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Anne R. Epstein, in her review of the book by Colette Cosnier, The Ladies of Femina, described a mystified feminism in the editorial direction of the magazine. Indeed, Femina was not born to be a feminist magazine but rather a woman's magazine. The editorial strategy of Pierre Lafitte, the publishing director, was inspired by The Ladies’ Magazine, a successful English publication.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">He envisioned a luxury magazine dealing with fashion trends, society and family. However, feminist topics of the time -  including the claims of the suffragettes in England and the acquisition of voting right by the Danish women - were treated and discussed in the journal. Moreover, Lafitte used to give great prominence to leisure and sports in practiced by women and, from 1906, he launched The Femina Cup, a sporting competition.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/fem-jaargang-02-19020615.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7468\"><em>Femina - issue June 15, 1902. Courtesy of ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1909, the French Academy raised the question of the election of female members: immediately Femina asked its readers to elect 40 writers, to fill an imaginary female academy and published on a double-page an illustration showing the 40 elected seats in the institution's dome. After being suspended in 1917, Pierre Lafitte sold the journal to Hachette; the publishing house then merged Femina with another magazine called “The Happy Life”.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Visit Europeana Fashion portal to see more <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=femina#dataProviders%3DModeMuseum%20Provincie%20Antwerpen%26searchTerm%3Dfemina\">Femina</a>’s images from our archive.</p>"

Depending on the object proposed, the focus will shift between interesting facts about style and use of clothes and other fashion objects, and about those personalities - designers, illustrators, photographers - constructing the mythologies of fashion.</p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Together with the ‘main’ object, the newsletter will suggest objects similar for various reasons to the one on which the newsletter is centered, in order to provide a wider overlook on the Europeana Fashion collection and tackle the curiosity of all the people interested in discovering something more about the history of dress and fashion, as told by museum and archival collections.</p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Of course, information about the projects of the Europeana Fashion International Association and its partners will be featured as well, so the subscribers will always be updated on the latest news.</p>\nJoin us in our journey through the collection and subscribe to the Europeana Fashion newsletter."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Both an international research library and the world’s largest museum collection of graphic works on the history of clothing and fashion, the Lipperheide Costume Library constitutes a milestone for fashion research.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Lipperheide Costume Library is part of the Kunstbibliothek, founded in Berlin in 1868. Its collection comprises now more than 40,000 books and magazines, from the sixteenth century to the present day, as well as paintings, manuscripts, over 100,000 drawings, prints and photographs. It encompasses literature on fashion from all over the world and of different eras, including magazines from the 18th century to today. In addition, the collection comprehends original prints and illustrations, as well as reproductions of artworks important to the study of costumes.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/e53f6c8c31425414836a439690804560-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7490\"><em>Plate from &#039;Illustrirte Frauenzeitung&#039;, 1894.

A trained bookseller, he had previously worked for a fashion publisher that issued, among others, the magazine ‘Der Bazar’. His publishing house printed the magazine ‘Modenwelt’, focused on women’s fashion, which had great success and was eventually even distributed abroad. His wife Frida later undertook the direction of the magazine, which in 1974 included also news about entertainment, and was renamed ‘Illustrirte Frauenzeitung’.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/28fb2d4dab3ded0e2815ca387f7a8fc0-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7491\"><em>&#039;Les Coulisses de l&#039;Opéra - Le Corps des Ingénus&#039;, coloured lithograph created by Joseph Bettanier, ca 1860.

        title: 'Lorenzo Mattotti'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Illustrating fashion is a very peculiar act; while sketching is the earliest stage of the design process, when the idea gets the form of some lines on a sheet, fashion illustration calls for a completely different context and then, a different meaning. It is about retracing the idea behind a real dress, imagining a set and visually writing a story.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7496\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/0139ls-665x867.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Illustration by Lorenzo Mattotti, on Vanity, 1985, Courtesy Missoni Archive</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">It is not necessary to come from inside the fashion world to be able to capture the intrinsic nature of fashion; Lorenzo Mattotti exemplifies the fact that what is needed is instead a good eye and an open mind. Mattotti started to illustrate fashion when the ‘Valvoline’ group, a collective of comics illustrators founded between 1982 and 1983 with, as members, Igor Tuveri (Igort), Giorgio Carpinteri, Marcello Jori, Jerry Kramsky, Daniele Brolli, Charles Burnes e Massimo Iosa Ghini, started participating to the pages of Vanity, the avant-garde illustrated fashion and style magazine founded by Anna Piaggi at the beginning of the 1980s.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7497\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/0144ls-665x867.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Illustration by Lorenzo Mattotti, Vanity Cover, 1985, Courtesy Missoni Archive</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Of the whole group, he is the one who has established the longest relationship with fashion; this, probably because it allowed him to explore some themes - above all the relationship between identity and performance - that are central for him as artist and for the mythologisation of fashion itself. He has recently declared, in an interview to the <em>Newyorker</em>: “Doing fashion illustrations is part of my work, but for me it’s all about women. When I look back at my work, I see images of women. It’s all about women—very pictorial women putting on dresses, putting on a show.”</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Mattotti’s provenance from the world of comics shows in his approach to the actual clothes in the illustrations made for fashion. Clothes are, for him, a pretext to reflect on the formal composition of images, and on the possibility to build narratives around the encounter of a body, a personality and a dress. The worlds he portrays do not want to be true-to-life, nor his personnages are immediately recognisable as ‘humans’, as it is clear in the illustration made in 1985 for Vanity, featuring Missoni clothes.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7498\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-07/0141ls-665x867.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Illustration by Lorenzo Mattotti, on Vanity, 1985, Courtesy Missoni Archive</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">His interest in the body and its materiality goes together with the necessity to portray the materiality of clothes and textiles. All his works show his great attention to prints, embroideries and textures, together with his will to place clothes in an imaginary setting, establishing interesting links between what is visible and what is imagined, between reality and utopia.</p>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: Leisure'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>In line with the much awaited arrival of August, this month’s theme for the Europeana Fashion Blog will be Leisure, in its many forms and definitions.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7507\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/sc01864b-665x473.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>‘Golf’ sketches by Emilio Pucci, 1974, Courtesy Pucci Archive</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sociologist Thorstein Veblen has defined leisure as the non-productive consumption of time. In being directly related to acts of consumption, leisure has called for a whole set of goods and situations precisely designed to produce leisure time, and make it productive.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Designing for leisure means, once again, to design a well-defined lifestyle, made of various activities and very precise looks linked to the occasion they are thought to ‘fit in’. Amongst the activities connected to the idea of ‘free’ time - even though the concept is in itself rather diverse - two are the most direct: sport and travel.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sports act on the very form of the body, and since the goal is a good performance, both the body and the clothes have to serve this purpose; many designers have bounded their name to one or more sport activities, applying a method that is different from that of couture. In sport, ‘function over form should’ be the norm, but this idea has been overturned by designers themselves, who have often played with the stereotype - and won. The ‘use’ of sport as a motif for fashion design has even historically led to the differentiation of a ‘national’ fashion - most notably the patriotic american fashion of the 1930s, which sought to emancipate from paris by concentrating on leisure-wear.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7508\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/56329787-665x971.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Kenzo, spring-summer 1982 women&#039;s rtw fashion show at the Jardin d&#039;Acclimatation, Borte des Sablons, Bois de Boulogne, photo courtesy Paul Van Riel</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">From a very patriotic act to the will to enlarge views and know other places, travel holds a special place in the world of leisure. ‘Travel time’ in itself may not be considered leisure, but it is still a ‘suspended’ moment of transfer that was exploited by creators, who made it a fashionable event in its own right; and clothes as well, in their very design, can represent a journey, recalling, with the inspirations they hold in their construction and decorations, places and memories - real or just dreamt.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Leisure as a concept has become more and more democratic as the times have changed the social structure Veblen based his writings on, and more precisely its diversification played a major role in the definition of new social groups. In fashion, leisure-wear is a wide and quite muddy concept that gathers many different sectors of the fashion system. Each activity is analysed and, in some ways, celebrated with dedicated events, publications and other ephemera. This month the Europeana Fashion Blog will unveil some of these materials and tell their stories: stay tuned.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Museo Salvatore Ferragamo discloses the contents of its current exhibition ‘Across Art and Fashion’ on Europeana Fashion Tumblr, exploring the relationship between artists and fashion designers!</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The concept of the exhibition draws directly from the life story of Salvatore Ferragamo, whose fascination with twentieth century avant-garde art movements led him to seek for inspiration in the art world. It presents various case studies, analysing the ways in which these two worlds have interacted, through contamination, overlap and collaboration.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/1-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7518\"><em>Maison Vionnet, ‘L’Orage’ model, 1922, dress in taffeta, inlaid with rectangular motifs in a geometric progression.

        title: 'Sportswear. Shaping the American Look'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>In the Thirties, a group of American fashion designers turned to sportswear to meet the needs of the modern American woman. Their easy, utilitarian looks, far from those of the French couture, gave new shape to the American look.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Beryl Williams wrote in ‘Fashion is our Business’ (1945) that the American designers were ‘the sensitive, intelligent reflectors of what American women want them to be, creating what American women want to wear.’ What American women wanted to wear were, at the time, practical and versatile clothes. American designers started to design them when, during the 1930s, they decidedly distanced themselves from French fashion and turned to sportswear.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/m-0001-119-665x972.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7527\"><em>Dress designed by Claire McCardell, 1949. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag via Modemuze, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sportswear was then leading the campaign of emancipation from Parisian fashion, whose influence was, in fact, strongly felt overseas. Well before the 1930s, most of American designers used to produce ready-to-wear copies of the creations showcased on Parisian catwalks, a reality well described by Elizabeth Hawes in her book ‘Fashion is Spinach’. Elizabeth Hawes herself was, along with Bonnie Cashin, Claire McCardell and Vera Maxwell, one of the designers who turned to sportswear, creating democratic, affordable ready-to-wear clothes for the American market.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/m-0001-136-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7528\"><em>Dress designed by Claire McCardell, 1949. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag via Modemuze, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Sportswear and its ‘straightforwardness’ met the economic and practical needs of the American women. The clothes were easy to be washed and ironed at home, accessible to women which could not be helped by housemaids. Their materials and accessories were simple, even before of the restrictions of the War-years.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Dorothy Shaver of Lord &amp; Taylor coined the term ‘American Look’ when in 1932 he launched a series of off-stores presentation featuring the newest looks from American designers. Between 1932 and 1939, her presentations featured the practical sportswear creations of more than sixty designers. On another front, PR pioneer Eleanor Lambert promoted the use of the new American fashion on magazines and publications, spreading the consciousness of an American fashion identity.</p>\n\n<strong>Browse Europeana Fashion to find the creations of the pioneer designers that shaped the American Look! </strong>"

        title: 'Exhibition Archaeology: ''Human Game. Winners and Losers'''
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>To celebrate the beginning of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, we recall 'Human Game. Winners and Losers', an exhibition held at Stazione Leopolda in Florence in 2006.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The olympic circles are five, each one of a different colour, and they represent the world continents. together, they form the symbol of the Olympic games, not only the biggest and most comprehensive sporting event, but also the occasion in which all countries come together to celebrate unity through fair competition. The Games are a good metaphor to represent what international relationships should be: a balanced mix of patriotism and togetherness, of the specificities of each country and the universal effort put in pursuing a common objective.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7536\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/84e33e79abb61f706bbb0edeefcec89d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Human Game. Winners and Losers, Photo by Francesco Guazzelli, Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Clothing is a very important part of the performative activities that go under the rather generic name of ‘sport’; at the same time, fashion has been influenced by sport in many ways, above all because of the innate power of sportswear to convey at once strength and casualness. Focusing on attire to tell something about the role of sport in art, design and life more generally was the goal of the exhibition ‘Human Game. Winners and Losers’. An initiative within the Florence 99% Contemporary, it opened in Florence on 21 June 2006, during Pitti Immagine Uomo 70. It was produced by the Fondazione Pitti Discovery and curated by Francesco Bonami, Maria Luisa Frisa and Stefano Tonchi.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7537\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/72d46ddeab2d0608b1dd8f9ca49b4a02.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Human Game. Winners and Losers, Photo by Francesco Guazzelli, Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The exhibition celebrated the ability of sport to built mythologies, something at which also fashion excels. the link between the two disciplines is played on the aesthetic value of sport, its ‘deep superficiality’, where everything is measured on the qualities - technical as well as apparent - of the surface. The exhibition was thematic, focused on five ‘devices’ used to disentangle the meaning of sport within culture and society: Limit; Games; Mutation; Tradition; Freedom. The display was organised as a spiral in gilt metal netting and the path was articulated in containers with different coverages: grass, asphalt, wooden boards, exercise mats.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7538\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/d45d6d38ff0c57923dfd2642670ab689.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Human Game. Winners and Losers, Photo by Francesco Guazzelli, Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">As immersive as a real match, the exhibition wanted to be a sensorial experience, and all the elements contributed in building a very precise atmosphere - the agonistic and charged-up air of a crowded stadium; this, together with the many designs and relative ‘definitions of fashion’ showcased - from Beene to Puma + Alexander McQueen, from Patagonia to Prada, spanning from leisurewear to proper ‘competition’ attire - contributed to validate the underlying concept of the whole exhibition: how the complex encounter between fashion and sport influences behaviours on different levels, generating a lifestyle.</p>"

        title: 'The Emilio Pucci’s Hostess Collection at the Osaka Expo ‘70'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Marquise Emilio Pucci di Barsento, founder of the Maison based in Palazzo Pucci in via de’ Pucci, in the heart of Florence, was driven in his work as fashion designer by the desire to produce clothes that gave women the possibility to move freely, enjoying every activity they were up to.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Coming from a noble and influent family of Florence, he discovered his passion for fashion design in Zermatt, Switzerland, where he spent his time giving ski lessons, after a career as air force pilot during WW2. Trying to find a way to simplify movements during ski performances, in 1947 he designed a streamlined ski outfit, initially for himself and then for his learners and friends. The outfit was photographed by a fashion photographer and published on Harper’s Bazaar USA - and in this way Emilio Pucci came out on the fashion scene!</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/fo01192b-665x690.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7560\"><em>&quot;Hostess&quot; collection designed by Emilio Pucci for Expo &#039;70 in Osaka. Uniforms for Braniff International. 1970. Courtesy of Emilio Pucci Archive. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">With the aim to create a wardrobe for women made of weightless and more comfortable clothes, he started to collaborate with expert fabric manufacturers in Italy; he succesfully pioneered and patented revolutionary stretch fabrics that replaced the heavy and rigid fabrics that were commonly used at the time. The culmination of his work arrived in 1950s, when he began developing his peculiar style with signature prints. Graphic, abstract designs and geometric patterns inspired by cities and monuments were printed on his fabrics and used to create a very peculiar and original style. His modern sportswear design with an elegant allure, gained him the big international success and the title ‘Prince of Prints’.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/fo0119303b-665x548.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7561\"><em>&quot;Hostess&quot; collection designed by Emilio Pucci for Expo &#039;70 in Osaka. Uniforms for Braniff International. 1970. Courtesy of Emilio Pucci Archive. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Following his will to design clothes that were at once functional and striking, in 1965 he happily started collaborating with Braniff International Airways to design the staff uniforms. The US major airway company Braniff Airways, Inc., part of Braniff International Airways, was up and running from 1930 to 1982, flying in the Midwest and the south-west of the US, Panama and, in its latest years, also in Asia and Europe.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Brightly colored and absolutely original, the Braniff uniforms created by Emilio Pucci, with their ‘futuristic’ appeal, were certainly innovative in the range of international uniform. Emilio Pucci was in charge of the uniforms of the company from 1965 to 1977, time in which he produced more than one iconic collection. 1970 was the year of Expo ‘70, a world’s fair held in Suita, Osaka, whose theme was “Progress and Harmony for Mankind”; at the time, Braniff International had already started to work with Asia. Emilio Pucci took the opportunity to participate to the event and presented the Braniff uniforms with a brand new design, showing simple shapes decorated with his peculiar prints. The result was utterly glamourous, thanks to the magnificent color mix and unique cut of the ensembles.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more pictures of the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=osaka#dataProviders%3DPucci%20Archive%26searchTerm%3Dosaka\">“Hostess” Collection at the Osaka Expo</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: 'Scoring the Set. Jean Patou and the tennis court'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>In and out of the game field, Jean Patou was an innovator, shaping his definition of modernity with designs for sport and leisure.</strong></p>\nTennis, in its modern form, developed in the second half of nineteenth century, when Harry Gem and Augurio Perera founded the first tennis club in Lemmington Spa in 1872. Around the same time, two other people developed similar ideas: Army officer Major Walter Clopton Wingfield patented a similar game, called sphairistikè or ‘the art of playing ball’, at a garden party in his friends’ estate in Wales; Mary Ewing Outerbridge, coming home to the US from Bermuda, brought a sphairistikè set and laid out a tennis court at the Staten Island Cricket Club.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7570\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/m5051_b5_99_100r-665x881.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sport ensemble by Jean Patou and Muguette Buhler, ca. 1934, Courtesy Les Arts Decoratifs, all rights reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The game gained a certain popularity, and as its rules evolved, many fashion designers engaged in creating dedicated ensembles. Jean Patou was one of them. Born in 1880 in Normandy, he opened his first atelier ‘Maison Perry’ in 1912 in Paris, closing it in 1914 to serve France during WW1. He reopened his boutique in 1919 and, similarly to his contemporaries Coco Chanel and Lucien Lelong, he became attracted to the new ‘active lifestyle’ fashionable in Europe and the US. Being an active person himself, the designer understood the need to study athletes and their movements to design clothes that would help them in their performances. So, in 1922 he entered the market with a line of sport and activewear, which he continued well into the 1930s.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">One year before launching his activewear line, Jean Patou already ventured into sportswear, designing an innovative tennis uniform for the French athlete and Wimbledon player Suzanne Lenglen, to whom he was introduced by his brother-in-law Raymond Barbas, member of the French national team. Lenglen was a talented player; she won Wimbledon and the French Open six times each, setting a record that remained untouched for almost fifty years.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7569\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/2015.0012.00-665x996.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Ensemble for Suzanne Lenglen by Jean Patou, ca. 1920, Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The ensemble Jean Patou designed for Lenglen allowed her to leap towards the ball and swing her racket with a full range of motion. Made of a white, pleated, knee-length skirt, a white, sleeveless cardigan and an orange headband, the outfit was considered quite a dare. The length of the skirt was seen to be socially inconvenient, as it was replacing the hat with a headband and exposing her nude arms. However, Suzanne Lenglen was not one to stick to the rules. With her emancipated flair and charismatic personality, she challenged the norms, values and restraints of ‘femininity’ within society as tenaciously as on the tennis field. A liberated and active woman, the clothes designed by Patou reflected her spirit both in and off the court.</p>"

        title: 'On Cities on Clothes: Moschino ''Cruise me Baby'' collections'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Cities hold a pivotal role in the fashion system. Not only because of their position as catalysts in the production, promotion and distribution of fashion; also, in their being the places where fashion, as a social phenomenon, blossoms, being shaped by the identity of the city itself and by that of its Inhabitants.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The specificities of each city allow to consider its active role in the creative process, and most of the times the stereotype becomes the basis on which to work in order to reinvent itself without forgetting the roots. The central importance of the city, as a set of special features and history, is clear in the words of the storyteller as well as in the mind of the image-maker, who builds an aesthetic on the glimpses and perspectives that can be encountered while wandering around.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7579\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/0000023701n-665x657.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Jacket from Moschino &#039;Cruise me Baby&#039; collection, S/S 1993, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sometimes, cities are de-materialised - and then re-materialised again - during the creative process, and end to become messages inscribed on the clothes. Many are the designers who used cities <em>on</em> their clothes, rethinking them as embroideries, prints, patterns; the cities used to ‘inspire’ the designs are never chosen without a real reason: most of the times, it is for the kind of atmosphere they evoke, and for the bond the designer has with that particular place. This is what happened with Moschino and the ‘Cruise me Baby’ collections of the first half of the 1990s.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Moschino launched its ‘Cruise me Baby’ line at the beginning of the 1990s. Between 1991 and 1994, the collections were dedicated to some of the most important Italian cities; Naples, Venice, Florence, Pisa and Rome became flat patterns, or were sublimated in symbols to ornate jackets, waistcoats, shirts and dresses; Florence, for instance, was both represented as a landscape, displaying the sublime architecture of the city and its amazing panorama, and as sign, the lily, historical symbol of the city, multiplied as a quasi-geometric pattern, next to black and white squares and dreamy clouds.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7580\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/00000237n-665x657.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Jacket from Moschino &#039;Cruise me Baby&#039; collection, S/S 1993, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The style of the collections was true to the identity of the brand: a familiar cheekiness, refined in its being overtly tacky. The designs were also a love letter to Italy, celebrating the many faces of a Country that made of its regional diversities its strength, playing on the differences to build a varied international recognisability.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The clothes Moschino designed can be considered like postcards: they can be seen as patriotic banners to be preserved and showcased, or they can be a more intimate object, whose material qualities can hold memories and recall sensations. In both ways, the city itself becomes the message, and the use of the object comes after the meaning the wearer gives to the city he or she has decided to wear.</p>"

        title: 'Luggage: a travel through history!'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Even in the quite small time of its 120-year history, the development of luggage is surprisingly articulate and full of implications with the improvement of the social lifestyle.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Starting from the steamer trunks of bygone eras to the sticker-covered, double-locking suitcases of the 1950s and ’60s and the four-wheeled spinners of today, the development of the design and production of luggage is part of the history of human movement, reflecting how we travel and revealing what we value as travelers and human beings.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7592\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/1dcb925a1099978343f8119676de97a3.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Luggage. A suitcase and a trunk. 1930. Courtesy of Stiftelsen Nordiska museet. CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first model of suitcase appeared around the mid-to-late 19th century, replacing the travel trunks. It was born as a massive, cumbersome box, made of wood and leather, with a heavy iron base, in order not to be crushed during travels in steamships and stagecoaches, and a covering in canvas. even though suitcases began as an afterthought in the luggage and leather goods business, in the late 19th century the beginning of mass tourism made it the very symbol of travel.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7594\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/4727530fe6e7793080bf057cff4d3dd5-665x440.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Brown suitcase for toiletries: comb, shoe horn, hand schoenoprekker, button hook, hair brush, clothes brush, toothbrush, soap box, sweeper, two boxes for jewelry, hand mirror. 1930/1935.

At first it was Louis Vuitton who, in the mid-1850s, introduced his pioneering slat trunk, with a canvas sheath, well-designed drawers and a flat top that made stacking much easier.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7595\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/nma.0072356-665x546.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Woman in plaid skirt and heels reflected in the mirror on the street with two suitcases. 1949/1951. Courtesy of Stiftelsen Nordiska museet. CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the early 20th century, the ‘dress-suit case’ was only one of countless styles of container that travelers could buy, as steamer trunks, club bags or everyday portable wardrobes. Tourism was a decidedly upper-class phenomenon and rich people, who used to travel with their servants, could rely on an army of hired hands to carry luggages. When trunks went out of style, suitcases took on practical and cultural significance, becoming a literary symbol for both mobility and mystery.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7596\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/paar-nylonkousen.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pair of nylon stockings in packaging. &quot;Voyage&quot;. 1955/1965.

All rights reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">With the rapid expansion in automobile travel during in the 1920s, and a more gradual expansion of air travel a couple decades later, they had to get lighter and cheaper and cardboard and plastic models were launched on the market, emphasizing ‘modern’ materials and convenience. But they were still far from the most recent products.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7593\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/0389dmr-665x910.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Bags by Missoni.

All rights reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The modern suitcases feature large pieces of hard plastic and are built with synthetic materials and fabrics; zippers have replaced clasps and few of them are specifically waterproof. Last but not least, the most of them have wheels. All these developments came in the last half-century, with the onset of mass aviation. The suitcase had to adapt to fit the requirements of flying travels, which comprehend half a mile of walking during check-in, layovers and arrival and specific proportions and size limits of the storage areas. During the 2000s luggage manifacturers released new lightweight models with the latest tech recoveries to stay competitive. The ultra light and highly durable polycarbonate, the ergonomically designed bags and backpacks, GPS-enabled technology and luggage that charges and protects tech gadgets, just demonstrate that the improvement of luggage features evolves with changes in lifestyle, paying attention not only to the content but, interestingly, to the container as well.</p>\nDiscover more amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=luggage#searchTerm%3Dresv%C3%A4ska\">suitcases and luggage</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!"

        title: 'To dress à-la-plage: Designers and Resorts'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>As early as it became popular to travel to fashionable seaside resorts, fashion designers and couturiers found their way in dictating the trends by the sea, not without being moved by the different landscapes and lifestyles.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Since the Roman times, the coast and seaside have been regarded as places dedicated to leisure: Julius Caesar, Nero and Hadrian were hosted in the licentious Baiae by the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy. more recently, from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century onwards, the European aristocracy populated the resorts towns across the old continent, spending their holidays in search for recreation and health, and making these places the stages where to perform an utterly fashionable way of life.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/fem-jaargang-03-19030815_021-665x801.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7612\"><em>&#039;Le soir à Deauville&#039; print from &#039;Femina&#039;, 15th August 1903. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As a result, resorts became the places where the wealthy, international high class used to meet once away from the city centres. In these hubs, different families had the opportunity to confront their social costumes, traditions and, of course, fashions.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/702c9730bf98009987bdd65ecea92412-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7616\"><em>Model &quot;Deauville&quot;, sketch for a summer day dress by Bernard et C.ie, 1914. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC-BY-NC-SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Unsurprisingly, firstly tailors and later couturiers and designers opened there their boutique and ateliers, attracted by the exclusive clienteles that frequented these beaches and the opportunities, both promotional and economical, they may provide. For instance, Jean Patou and, more remarkably, Coco Chanel, set off their boutiques in Deauville, Normandy, during the 1910s and 1920s. Later, in the early 1950s, Marquis Emilio Pucci opened his famous boutique in the prestigious resort ‘La Canzone del Mare’ in Capri, which was then the meeting point of the international jet set.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/fp00051b-665x888.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7613\"><em>The designer Emilio Pucci in Capri, ca 1952/1953. Courtesy Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">However, these places did not just offer a fashionable clientele to the designers that ventured to the resorts. Instead, they had been a profound source of inspiration for their designs and creations. If Emilio Pucci notoriously took his daringly bright colours from the vegetation and the waters of the isle of Capri, Coco Chanel owned to Normandy fishermans’ her striped knitted sweaters and sailor pants. Both fascinated by the sporty lifestyles of these resorts towns, so distant from the strictness of the city, designers took from these holiday places the influences that determined their modern styles.</p>"

        title: 'The sailor suit'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The sailor suit, as a fashion trend, begun in the Victorian Age, developing at first as a children costume phenomenon; worn as school uniform and then for sport performances, it has kept its popularity until today.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like many naval-inspired designs, the sailor suit originated with the British navy and was then copied into other navies. The uniform, in its most traditional form, was worn by enlisted seamen in the navy and other government funded sea services. It is also known as “Number One” uniform, its first use is for ceremony, taking this name from the old working rigs of Royal Navy sailors. Since its first introduction in 1857, it has changed continuously, to adapt to the costume evolutions of each period, but always keeping some details, and precisely the blue jean collar, as its most recognisable items.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7646\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/b.143-19951.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&quot;The Royal Navy of England and the Story of the Sailor Suit&quot; Trade pamphlet on children&#039;s garments issued by Wm Rowe of Gosport, Cowes &amp; London. England, ca. 1900. Printed paper. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert museum. CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was the 1846, when Queen Victoria was delighted, during a cruise off the Channel Islands, by seeing her four-year-old son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, wearing a scaled-down version of the sailor suit of the Royal British Navy. His portrait was painted at the same time, right when the British Navy was the most powerful naval force in the world and its uniform had recently been standardized. So the portrait, as well as a series of engravings, made the sailor suit became popular among the British public; later it was introduced as a normal dress for both boys and girls all over the world, with some variations through different nations, according to the specific naval uniform of each country.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7647\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/uf-92-12-2-abc1-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Gymnastic uniform. Sailor suit. 1910. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The sailor suit became the first popular children’s fashion trend by the 1880s, when advertisers began marketing it. For boys it consisted in a middy top with shorts or long trousers, replaced by a skirt in the feminine version. The two models had in common typical marine designs as stars, anchors or eagles, sewn on as badges. Ready-made or sewn at home, they closely resembled actual naval uniforms and used to change togheter with the development of the official ones. They were usually made of washable, sturdy fabrics like wool serge and allowed relative freedom of movement. Probably depending on this, sailor suits have soon been adopted for a variety of social situations, helping to strip away the class distinctions, a prominent aspect of British culture. Also sailor suits were frequently worn as school uniforms, probably due to their military origins and to an association with order and discipline.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Born as a thought-for-men ensemble, the sailor suit has anyway influenced women's style in more than one way. In May 1904, Harper's Bazaar called a sailor suit 'the most serviceable all-around frock a girl can have'; a female version of the sailor suit, the sailor dress, was popularly known in early 20th century America. Since then, women's fashion picked it up as casual seaside wear and it became associated with sport, summer and leisure. Elements of nautical style were absorbed into adult dress, including blue and white stripes, square sailor collars and wide, loose trousers, which are enduring elements of spring and summer dress.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more sailor suits on the Europeana Fashion portal and follow @Europeanafashionofficial on Instagram to discover the sailor suit's curation of this week!</p>"

        title: 'I See Red: Fox Hunting Attire'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">The value of tradition in sport is linked not so much to the performance in itself - improved by new techniques and exercises, pushing the limits of body and mind - but, more often, to the presentation of both the athletes and the event as a whole. Then, the sportive act becomes a ritual, in which the form is valued as highly as the substance, and whose presentation ends to develop into a custom.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7652\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/6b2ad295d252358959ad70dc47042bf2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Riding and hunting clothes, Illustrations from Le Progrès, 1851, Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sports, especially the ones with a history strongly linked to the definition of society, show their reverence to tradition in the substantial immutability of their organisation and norms. Fox Hunting is one of these sports. This kind of hunting, in its most known form, was developed by Hugo Meynell between 1753 and 1800. Etiquette was very important since the very beginning, and clothing held a central role in the outline of the ‘surface’ - that is to say, the visual identity - of the sport itself.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7653\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/826ea755c21dcd902ef2585990ca8bbc.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Hunt coats in red and blue wool with velvet collars by Johns &amp; Pegg UK, ca. 1910-20, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The attire consists of the traditional red coats worn by huntsmen, masters, former masters, whippers-in. Curiously, the traditional red coats are called \"pinks\". The derivation of the term is uncertain; one theory speaks about the colour of a weathered scarlet coat, but the most widely accepted links the etymology to the name of a London tailor - called Pink or Pinke - who was said to be the best at making perfect attires for hunting. The Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, E. Cobham Brewer, 1894, gives an explanation linked to the status of the sport itself: ‘The red coat in fox-hunting (or scarlet) is a badge of royal livery, hunting being ordained by Henry II. a royal sport.’ Given the meaning of red as the colour identifying roles within the participants to the hunt, it is the master who holds the power to allow his guests to wear colours; they do this in sign of appreciation for their involvement in the hunt. For those not entitled to wear colours, a black hunt coat with simple black buttons are the rule.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7654\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/78dde6d95a2456e1b562a55d7ea2e6a6.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Three men hunting habits, 1910 ca., Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The number of buttons of the coat has a meaning as well: the Master usually wears a scarlet coat with four brass buttons, while the huntsman, the whippers-in and other staff members wear five. The colour of breeches may vary, but they are generally monochrome. Boots\_for the red jacket are classic English dress boots with no laces: they are either black with brown leather tops, while Butcher boots, plain black without tops, are worn with jackets of other colours. The professional staff wear the ribbons of their hunt cap down, while amateur staff and members of the field wear their ribbons up.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The Europeana Fashion portal holds many fine example of attire for fox hunting, as well as many prints and drawings depicting hunting as both a sport and a social practice. Browse the collection to have a glimpse of the clothes and accessories building the identity of this fascinating sport - and of its players.</p>"

        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The sailor suit, as a fashion trend, begun in the Victorian Age, developing at first as a children costume phenomenon; worn as school uniform and then for sport performances, it has kept its popularity until today.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Like many naval-inspired designs, the sailor suit originated with the British navy and was then copied into other navies. The uniform, in its most traditional form, was worn by enlisted seamen in the navy and other government funded sea services. It is also known as “Number One” uniform, its first use is for ceremony, taking this name from the old working rigs of Royal Navy sailors. Since its first introduction in 1857, it has changed continuously, to adapt to the costume evolutions of each period, but always keeping some details, and precisely the blue jean collar, as its most recognisable items.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7646\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/b.143-19951.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&quot;The Royal Navy of England and the Story of the Sailor Suit&quot; Trade pamphlet on children&#039;s garments issued by Wm Rowe of Gosport, Cowes &amp; London.

CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was the 1846, when Queen Victoria was delighted, during a cruise off the Channel Islands, by seeing her four-year-old son Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, wearing a scaled-down version of the sailor suit of the Royal British Navy. His portrait was painted at the same time, right when the British Navy was the most powerful naval force in the world and its uniform had recently been standardized. So the portrait, as well as a series of engravings, made the sailor suit became popular among the British public; later it was introduced as a normal dress for both boys and girls all over the world, with some variations through different nations, according to the specific naval uniform of each country.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7647\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/uf-92-12-2-abc1-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Gymnastic uniform.

For boys it consisted in a middy top with shorts or long trousers, replaced by a skirt in the feminine version. The two models had in common typical marine designs as stars, anchors or eagles, sewn on as badges. Ready-made or sewn at home, they closely resembled actual naval uniforms and used to change togheter with the development of the official ones. They were usually made of washable, sturdy fabrics like wool serge and allowed relative freedom of movement. Probably depending on this, sailor suits have soon been adopted for a variety of social situations, helping to strip away the class distinctions, a prominent aspect of British culture. Also sailor suits were frequently worn as school uniforms, probably due to their military origins and to an association with order and discipline.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Born as a thought-for-men ensemble, the sailor suit has anyway influenced women's style in more than one way. In May 1904, Harper's Bazaar called a sailor suit 'the most serviceable all-around frock a girl can have'; a female version of the sailor suit, the sailor dress, was popularly known in early 20th century America. Since then, women's fashion picked it up as casual seaside wear and it became associated with sport, summer and leisure. Elements of nautical style were absorbed into adult dress, including blue and white stripes, square sailor collars and wide, loose trousers, which are enduring elements of spring and summer dress.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more sailor suits on the Europeana Fashion portal and follow @Europeanafashionofficial on Instagram to discover the sailor suit's curation of this week!</p>"

        title: 'Modest and Practical: Dressed to Travel'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Since travelling became an accessible activity in the nineteenth century, travellers have been in search for a special attire designed to accompany them on their fares, eventually promoting new trends and customs.\n</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Today travelling is an ordinary action that occupies much of everyone’s daily routine. By private or public means, people travel short or longer fares not only for leisure, but for work or study resons. If nowadays travelling has become an ordinary practice not requiring much more effort than to make the luggage fit the size restrictions, not that long ago travellers had the need to wear particular clothes designed precisely for travels.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/d68af5b81e02a236d827b9d7951e092a.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7691\"><em>Man&#039;s buff coloured travelling coat with blue plaid lining. Paris, 1825, for the Petit Courrier des Dames. Hand-coloured engraving. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY NC.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The ‘travelling dress’ made its appearance in the nineteenth century, when the Industrial Revolution cut the costs of textile and clothes production, and people could afford specialized dress conceived to be worn only in specific occasions. Before this time, to travel was an occupation affordable only by the few and both higher and lower classes used to wear, in many cases, their best and most protective outerwear; from this time onwards, the improvement in the means of transport and the renovation of travel fares democratized travelling, letting more people embark on longer journeys.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/82b020c4e289dedcc222722df98665f1-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7692\"><em>Travelling dresses, summer toilettes and an ensemble for a young girl, from the &#039;Illustrirte Frauen-Zeitung&#039;, Franz Joseph Lipperheide, Steyrermühl. © Anna Russ. Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The key-words were now modesty and practicality. The ‘travelling dress’, in fact, did not only serve to protect the wearer from dust and dirt, but, whether people were travelling by train, ship or steamboat, they also needed a dress which allowed comfortable movements in a public transport - especially because the space for toilette was usually restricted or shared. In addition, it was essential for the dress to be appropriate for appearing in public among strangers.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-08/m-2011-1125-jt-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7693\"><em>&#039;Ensemble de voyage&#039; in wool and taffeta, designed by Siebenmann, 1895/1900. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The development of the travelling dress moved along with the development of the travelling system. As the public means of transportation evolved, becoming overall more comfortable, and new means, such as cars and later airplanes, appeared, the travelling dress gradually lost its functionality. Instead, a precise etiquette arose, indicating what dress to wear during a particular fare or while on a precise mean of transport.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">If the ‘travelling dress’ lost its popularity in recent times, the research for the ‘ideal dress for journeys’ led fashion creators to design the most diverse and peculiar clothes.

Geleyns | RO SCAN.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The Flemish Post-Impressionist painter Rik Wouters, whose paintings enchanted for their sense of sanctity and interiority, is the protagonist of MoMu – Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp new exhibition ‘Rik Wouters &amp; The Private Utopia’, that inaugurates on the 17th of September 2016. Realized in collaboration with the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, the exhibition commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of the painter.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The artist depicted in his paintings simple domestic scenes with his expressive brush strokes, unfinished style and emphasis on lighting and colour, capturing on his canvases a harmonious sense of intimacy. It is this particular sense that continues to inspire contemporary artists and designers to challenge the hectic pace of today, in search for a ‘private utopia’. This research represent the encounter of the painter and his work with some topical themes for fashion and design, which will be explored through the works of various Belgian fashion designers.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Among others, Dirk Van Saene, Bruno Pieters, Christian Wijnants, Walter Van Beirendonck, Ann Demeulemeester, Dries Van Noten, Veronique Branquinho, Martin Margiela, Marina Yee and Jan-Jan Van Essche will be featured in the exhibition, showing how they relate to the topic; they will express their particular point of view through the selection of fabrics and ‘slow’ techniques or by affirming their outstanding position in the fashion world. Alongside their creations and the works of Rik Wouters, the exhibition will display the works of many contemporary artists, bridging the gap between the outputs of fashion and that of art.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">MoMu’s curation of Europeana Fashion Tumblr will start on Thursday 1st September.

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: UNIFORM(S)'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>This month the Europeana Fashion Blog dedicates its entries to the many forms and definition of ‘uniform’, reflecting on the intricate relationship fashion establishes with power, representation, identity.</strong></p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7733  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/fo03925b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Hostess uniform for Braniff International Hostess with &quot;Bolla&quot; space helmet designed by Emilio Pucci, 1971, Courtesy Pucci Archive</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Uniform is an adjective, characterising something as ‘not varying or changing: staying the same at all times, in all places, or for all parts or members’. It thus refers to those practices that are not affected by the time passing, and stay loyal to their original format. Uniform, as a noun, defines a particular kind of clothing worn by all the members of a group: uniforms delineate the ‘visual space’ of a community, while layering meanings on individuals, who get recognised by what they wear, both if they are in or out their environment.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7735\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/724c38e828439b1c357c08b32440a782.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Designs of uniform for Royal Harmony by Eppo Dove, Courtesy ModeMuze</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The most direct image that comes to mind when thinking about ‘uniforms’ is surely the military; but many more are the context in which the uniform defines a job, a position, a role. The social value of uniforms as tools is bi-folded: on one hand, they are used by the wearer to state or dissimulate his or her identity; on the other, they are the first element used by the viewer to ‘sketch’ the life and personality of the person wearing it. Many contemporary designers have used the theme of the uniform as starting point to develop an aesthetic that builds on conformity and discrepancy, distorting the values universally linked to some items of clothing.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7734 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/871110607baa0631dd971d9acaf3caa7.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sailors smoking, 1955, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Apart from the more ‘classic’ examples, there are many objects that can be considered as metonymy of a uniform. Badges, pins and other insignia are worn proudly on more ‘socially accepted’ pieces of clothing; and also more ‘ephemeral’ things, as particular hair-dos and make-ups, have sometimes the aggregating force to unite people and create a community. Some artefacts and trends are created especially with the purpose to define the identity of a group, while some others become signs in the agency they get from how they get used.</p>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">This month, we will search into the collection to find the most interesting and unusual examples of uniforms, not only to unveil some undisclosed treasures, but also to challenge the very definition of uniform as ‘never changing’; to prove that change in clothing - and, most of the times, change in itself - is both subversion and adaptation, is a dialogue between the precepts of tradition and the will to innovate and go further.</p>\n\n<div></div>"

        title: 'The Marinière, a Parodic Parader'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>In 1983, Jean-Paul Gaultier debuted his first ready to wear menswear collection, entitled ‘L’Homme Objet’. The collection featured the designer’s own take on the ‘marinière’, the French seaman shirt, which soon became an essential element of his design grammar.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Uniforms hold a special fascination for fashion designers. Designers can borrow from them a plethora of values, consciously or unconsciously associated to uniforms, as well as use them to legitimize their visions or to wreck their usual codes. Jean-Paul Gaultier borrowed the ‘marinière’, the striped knitted shirt, to make it the epitome of his own vision on menswear.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/m-0003-197-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7748\"><em>Ensemble designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, 1985. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The ‘marinière’ became a constitutive element of the French Navy uniform in 1858. Worn by seamen and quartermasters, the knitted cotton shirt was characterized by its white and blue striped pattern. By rule, the number of stripes is set at 21 white stripes alternated at 20 or 21 blue stripes. The sleeves instead present 15 white stripes and 14 or 15 blue stripes. It is sad that each of the 21 stripes represent a naval victory by Napoléon Bonaparte; however, on a more pragmatic base, its particular design makes it easy to seamen’s to be spot if they fell overboard.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Jean-Paul Gaultier was although inspired to adopt the ‘marinière’ in the 1983 collection by the movie ‘Querelle de Brest’ by Rainer Fassbinder (1983). The movie followed the handsome Belgian sailor Querelle, portrayed by Brad Davis, in his erotic adventures in the seedy places and the brothel of the port of Brest. Gaultier found in the film the portrayal of his ideal man, who he homaged in his show featuring a cropped version of the top, cut-out in the back and short enough to expose the bare hips of the model, playing with homoerotic connotations and a highly sexualized idea of masculinity.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/56671310-665x975.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7749\"><em>Jean-Paul Gaultier at his women&#039;s s/s ready to wear fashion show in 1983. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In his playful takeover, the designer made the ‘marinière’ an element of the parodic ‘French uniform’. As a result, he featured the shirt in many other collections of his, transforming it in various range of garments - from tank tops to couture gowns. Gaultier also made the white and blue stripes a consitutive element of his own personal style: the striped shirt soon became the designer’s own uniform, which he has worn in much of his public appearances and portraits.</p>"

Courtesy MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<strong>This sweater in knitted wool was designed by Belgian fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck for his ‘Dare Devil Daddy’ A/W 1987-88 collection. Its trompe l’oeil design reminds of the typical look of the ‘strongest man on earth’ character from twentieth century freak shows.</strong>\n\nThe sweater is oversized and presents an asymmetric pattern. On the left, a one-strap tank top in black and blue stripes, with a belt and a crocheted white flower appointed on the top, is reproduced. The right side and the sleeves are in pinkish wool, recalling bare arms and a naked chest, showing a nipple crocheted in wool. The right arm is decorated with a ‘knitted’ tattoo.\n\nWalter Van Beirendonck graduated from the Fashion Department of the Royal Arts Academy in Antwerp in 1980, and he has presented his own collections since 1983. He is now the director of the department, leading students of one of the most prestigious institution for fashion-designers-to-be. He is, along with Marina Yee, Dirk Van Saene, Dirk Bikkembergs, Ann Demeulemeester and Dries Van Noten, one of the ‘Antwerp Six’: a group of fashion designers formed in Antwerp who made great sensation in the international fashion scene between the 1980s and 1990s, imposing their innovative views to the system.\n\nVan Beirendonck's\_collections, whose names are usually characterized by playful alliterations, such as ‘Dare Devil Daddy’ take their inspiration from art and literature, and point out the designer’s outstanding view on fashion. This collection laughs at the ultimate fitness craze, presenting 'cuddly' kind of men wearing comfortable oversized clothes with extra padding. These lovely ‘daddies’, with their sweaters embroidered with words like ‘Hug Me’ or decorated with crocheted flowers, dared to sport pieces inspired by circus and freak shows’ artists and clowns. A second part of the collection, called ‘Rabbit Virility’ instead, seemed to be directed to the ‘Macho-Bunnies’ with rabbit ears and puffy tails.\n\nThe object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DModeMuseum%20Provincie%20Antwerpen\">MoMu – Fashion Museum Antwerp Archive</a>.

        title: 'Private Uniforms: The Banyan'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Uniforms are usually conceived for public appearances; in the semi-private space of the house, however, people - and especially men - still wear a uniform, but of another kind: what happens here is another kind of performance, where to balance authenticity, self-construction and awareness, and the message to communicate to the people coming to visit. In both cases, the home becomes a stage, where dresses especially designed for the house are the essential props for the success of the act.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7759\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/f6a7c4105cd7ade7af9e075b0355417c.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Banyan of Chinese blue silk damask, ca. 1720s, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Banyans - nightgowns or, to use the fashionable french expression, Robe de Chambre - \_became very popular in the second half of 17th century; they were used by rich merchants and by members of the aristocracy, and very soon acquired a highly emblematic value, becoming the uniform of the intellectual. In fact, many authors refer in their writings to their ‘dear robe de chambre’. Not only mentioning them in writings, men of letters often decide to be depicted in portraits wearing their banyans. The robe de chambre is regarded as a tool for the exercise of intellectual faculties, and as a tool it has to be comfortable, allowing movement, and large enough to favour the freedom of the body – as well as of the mind. Banyans seem to go out of fashion around 1870, this being confirmed by the quantity of caricatures portraying men of letters in their excessive and lavish nightgown.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The changing nature of the intellectual goes hand in hand with the change in shape of dressing gowns. The rigorous son of the Enlightenment is replaced by the tormented soul of the romantic and followed by the disillusioned and ‘deeply superficial’ dandy. Born between the avenues and the mirrors of the new metropolis, the new intellectuals are extremely interested in their appearance, which has become both their otium and their negotium, and this undoubtedly weighed on the direction taken by men’s fashion from the beginning of the nineteenth century onwards. This is true also for the shape and construction of banyans and home attire in general.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7760\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/b289c0783e934dd3e19afd09fdbdb5c8.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion plate depicting two men in casual home-wear, a smoking jacket and a dressing gown. English, ca. 1873, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The beginning of the nineteenth century has been appointed as the period of the so-called ‘Great Masculine Renunciation’. Even if greatly problematic, this definition is useful to understand the higher degree of separation between private and public spaces, and the different frames of consumption of these spheres. In this period, the adoption of the three-piece suit in plain colours for public life is opposed by a freer consumption of fashion inside domestic spaces. While conforming to the fashionable cut of popular redingotes, banyans kept being made in colourful and rich textiles, either velvets, printed silks or cottons, demonstrating the underlying need for men to experiment with prints and textures.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7761\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/4c774597a0abffecf4f1d600c00648d5.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Banyan and waistcoat made from a Chinese dragon robe, Italian, 1780-1810, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Instead of talking about a ‘renunciation’, it is more suitable to talk about a move to a subtler way of experiencing fashion, both in the shaping of the self and in the social performance, that was to delineate a new masculinity. Even home is then a place in which to negotiate an identity in definition, responding to growing anxieties coming from the outer world. Banyans, in their construction and design, speak of a changing relationship between identity and appearance, conveyed by the shape of the body, which had to be effortlessly perfect in every place and at every degree of privacy.</p>"

        title: 'Between Creativity and Socialism: Aleksandar Joksimovic'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Fashion in the era of socialism and the example of the creator explains how the political power, the economic forces and fashion were inevitably connected. After World War II, the Eastern European socialist regimes embraced early Bolshevik ideology, and decidedly rejected Western style of dress. The regimes then had to establish a new dominant style which included practical, simple and classless clothing intended for the working woman.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7765   \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/maa_24071_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Photograph of the Stained glass (Vitraž) collection, 1968, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Dissatisfied with the domestic industry and unfashionable clothes they had been imposed, people turned to private tailors, homemade clothing or to the black market. Soon the country struck a discrepancy between production and consumption. The situation improved in the early 60s, thanks to shopping tours in Trieste, commercial advertisements and, above all, the rise of a new middle class fascinated with Western consumer habits. In all the Yugoslavian territory the desire for individualism was strong, as testified by the articles appeared on the Belgrade newspaper Bazar. The first fashion designer in the Yugoslav territory who directly addressed the need for a change in fashion was Aleksandar Joksimovic.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7766\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/maa_24021_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Drawing for the Stained Glass (Vitraž) collection, 1968, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Aleksandar Joksimovic is one of the most widely known designers in Yugoslavia, not only for his designs, but above all for his ability to conjugate, in his designs, traditions and innovation. \_Joksimović graduated in 1958 in textile design from the College of Applied Arts in Novi Sad, after a short period studying scenography. After working as designer of work uniforms for the City of Belgrade Institute for Household Improvement, In 1963 he designed his first evening wear collection. His designs received appraisal by the critics, who valued above all his creativity, and this made him a prominent personality in the Yugoslavian fashion system. Joksimović was one of the founders of the National Salon within the institute. In 1964, he started working with the Centrotekstil, Yugoslavia’s export-import giant, but kept his role as ‘couturier’ within the National Salon: his designs were appreciated both by the market and by the political power, since they came from the encounter of fashionable cuts and shapes with traditional motifs and decorations. Joksimović was successful in understanding the social change that was happening in Yugoslavia — and precisely, the needs of the rising middle class - \_while paying respect to the state ideology, including details from folk costumes in his creations.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7767 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/maa_24087_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Photograph of the Damned Jerina (Prokleta Jerina) collection for the Serbian issue of Elle magazine, 1969, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">His most successful collection were three, presented between 1967 and 1969: Simonides, Stained Glass and Jerina. They were featured on many western fashion magazines, and marked a radical change of the concept of high fashion in socialist Yugoslavia.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7768\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/maa_24026_1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Drawing for the Damned Jerina (Prokleta Jerina) collection, 1969, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Simonides was the first ‘haute couture’ collection of socialist Yugoslavia. It was presented to the Belgrade audience on 7 March 1967. The collection featured pearls, complicated embroidery and prints and simple, neat cuts, with more constructed ‘bell' sleeves, inspired by medieval Byzantine clothing and serbian traditional attire. Stained glass and Landscape took inspiration from the coloured glass windows with Orthodox and Catholic monasteries. The collection was showcased at the luxurious fashion Feast of the Leningrad and the exhibition hall of the Belgrade Fair, and it was also screened in Zagreb and Ljubljana. Jerina, presented in 1969, included reference to the latest designs presented in paris by the Pierre Cardin, but was described as an ode to the legendary construction of the city of Smederevo, demonstrating how the designer was alienating aligning the meaning of his collections to the general promotion of the state put in action by the regime.</p>"

        title: 'La Petite Robe Noire: a timeless uniform'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>In 1926 American Vogue published a picture of a short black dress designed by Coco Chanel with the name of ‘Chanel’s Ford’. Simple and accessible for women of most social classes, Vogue also wrote that it would become \"a sort of uniform for all women of taste\".</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">After its launch in the 1920s as an unavoidable object in a woman’s wardrobe, the little black dress was largely adopted during the Great Depression from women across different social classes, thanks to its affordability and elegance. In fact, it required only two yards of fabric, as opposed to the ten or more yards necessary to fashion bustles; also the darker shades were more practical to work outside the home, not fearing the dirt of the industrial world. For the same reasons,  it became a common uniform for civilian women entering the workforce during WW2, when the rationing of textiles was established.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/8a2e8a73e82295c9fc3b18d7a07f289f.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7790\"><em>Little black dress designed by Madame Handley-Seymour from a model of Coco Chanel. mid 1920/late1920. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert museum. ©Elizabeth Handley-Seymour CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Hollywood's influence on fashion in North America opened the way to the success of this particular dress. The Chanel’s baton was picked up by Christian Dior, who the petit robe noir as a landmark model for the development of his famous Corolle line, in 1947, demonsrating how the model was prone to modifications and updates. It was Audrey Hepburn who made the garment famous in its original design, wearing the one designed by Hubert de Givenchy in the iconic movie Breakfast at Tiffany in 1960s; Hepburn - and the movie itself - translated the petite robe noir into an icon of popular culture, making it the uniform of choice for women, mo matter the occasion, the space or the time.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/6444f6d85073f99572cc0694eac9ed39-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7791\"><em>&quot;Artemise&quot; Little black dress designed by Yves Saint Laurent. Collection Fall/Winter 1959. Courtesy of Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">However remaining a staple of wardrobes throughout the 1970s, it was the popularity of casual fabrics and the rise of business wear to fully bring back the little black dress into vogue in the 1980s with some ‘twists’: broad shoulders, peplum cut or other embellishments. Due to its being a symbol of glamourous and mysterious women with a strong character, it was adopted later in 1990s by the grunge culture in combination both with sandals or combat boots. In the late 1990s the new glamour trend led to new variations of the dress, culminating with the reemergence of the ‘original’- simple and, of course, full-black -  version in the late 2000s.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Until 1920s women used to wear black dresses while mourning, but the simple-yet-elegant design kept by the little black dress through the years has signed the transition of black from a symbol of grief to a statement of high fashion. While it totally disappeared from funerals, it turned into the colour of official occasion, becoming a sartorial staple for most contemporary women.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more glamourous samples of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=%22little+black+dress%22#objectType%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fthesaurus.europeanafashion.eu%2Fthesaurus%2F10005%26searchTerm%3Dblack\">little black dress</a> on the Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: 'The Vivandières: female protagonists of a men’s world'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">When we think about the army, what usually comes to mind are images of male soldiers dressed in uniforms, indicating their country, their political affiliation or ideological beliefs. However, the army is a community and, as a diversified and complex community, it is - and was - made up by representatives of both genders, who work together and share spaces, time and, interestingly, style.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7808 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/2b67d53473f705800c1df578f9fe7b9f.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Hand-coloured lithograph depicting a soldier and, on horseback, a cantinière of the French Army, Fortune after a drawing by Hippolyte Lalaisse, ca. 1855, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Vivandières - or cantinières - were originally associated with French regiments, but they were present in many different countries as fundamental part of the army. They had several tasks, not only carrying food and drinks to soldiers on the battlefield, but also acting as nurses and supporters of the troops. They were accounted as important members of their regiment, as underlined by historian Thomas Cardoza, who has researched extensively on the topic. Their importance within the environment of the regiment is in some way proved by their ‘official’ appearance - their uniform - which made them more than mere camp-followers, not only participating in the every-day activities of the army, but living the experience as protagonists.</p>\n\n<div>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7809\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/0e829d17ae2f3139decab15df4a5951d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Hand-coloured lithograph of a vivandière of the French Army, ca. 1850-70, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n\n</div>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Vivandières’ uniforms were modelled after those of the regiment they served; this tells a lot about how they considered their role, as ‘soldiers’ belonging to the army, whose identity was constructed not only through their occupation, but also through their attire. Their outfit was usually composed by a jacket and a blouse, which could be tight or loose- fitting depending on the regiments they belonged to; trousers could also be either straight legged or full and wide legged, gathered at the ankle or below the knee; a knee-length skirt was usually over the trousers. As for the accessories, they had great importance in completing the look: the most iconic accessory is for sure the brandy barrel, called <em>tonnelet, </em>which was a unifying element in defining the cantinières across different regiments. Vivandières also used to wear hats, either ‘kepis’ or brimmed. Their uniform fulfils two main aspects required to army clothing - and uniforms more generally: it serves as ‘sign’, defining the identity of vivandières as members of a precise regiment, and it is also practical, allowing them the possibility to move and ride more freely than they would do wearing ‘civilian’ female clothing.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7810\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/3a5d87d1f38b9383cefe2eb4b9b45875.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Hand-coloured lithograph of a vivandière of the French Army, ca. 1850-70, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">At the end of nineteenth century cantinières were forced by regulations to replace their attires with plain grey dresses and metal identification plaques. Despite their popularity, they were banned in 1906 by the French War Ministry. Vivandières’ image anyway remained strongly present in popular culture, theatre, opera and advertising. The Victoria &amp; Albert museum holds a collection of coloured lithographs depicting vivandières\_in different attires; Browse the Europeana Fashion portal to discover more about this - too often forgotten - feminine presence in what is usually considered ‘a men’s world’.</p>"

        title: 'School Uniforms'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>The historical origins of school uniforms are to be found in 16th Century England, when uniforms were first instituted at a charity schools for poor children, in part to recognise them and also because it was easier and cheaper then to buy standardised clothes.</strong>\n\nIt was not until the nineteenth Century that the great English public schools began using uniforms. School uniforms have been less common in the rest of Europe, where for many years they became associated with children from ealthy families attending exclusive private schools. There are a lot of documents suggesting that school uniforms were worn in the nineteenth century in other European countries, but there are few information on these uniforms and how widely they were worn. Many of them were based on military styles.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7821\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/eur24-665x413.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>A photo of &#039;Athena&#039; high school students in the national-day parade. Athens, Greece, 1952. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation.</em></p>\n\nIn Greece, the school’s costume codes were primarily dictated by the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs, through a series of circular decrees sent to all public schools as internal measures of civil organization. Even before War World II, and until the 1970s, the individual boards of Greek high schools held frequent sessions to further discuss these decrees and formulate decisions on the costume and social behaviour of the students.\nDuring this period, school uniforms for female pupils consisted mainly of plain cotton pinafore, while boys were obligated to wear a hat called pilikion, characterized by blue color and an emblem of a owl. Similar to a Police Cap and worn even outside school, it was the most important boys' school garment for many years.\nElementary school children, both boys and girls, wore smocks for many years as a national requirement, although actual enforcement varied. The smocks were mostly blue with wide white collars.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7822\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/eur13-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dark blue felt cocked cap banded with blue ribbon with embroidered &quot;Κιλκίς&quot; (Kilkis) and two Greek flags. Two bands with free edges at one side with embroidered emblems. Cotton fabric lining and brown leather sweatband. Tripolis, Greece, twentieth century. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe costume code rules were more rigorous in private schools from the 1950s onwards: the school uniform became a sign of severity and status. The colours were usually blue and white. The white detachable collar was another indispensable component of the school dress, which was not mass produced, but sewn at students’ home. Girls in public schools, on the other hand, wore black uniforms. Every students wore the emblem of their institute in a form of a cockade or as embroidery.\n\nThe school uniforms, seen as emblems of modesty, virtue and external equality among pupils by the past generations, has been abolished from public schools in Greece since 1982. However, even after the fall of the dictatorship similar decrees were issued by the Ministry and addressed to the female students, who were invited to adopt ‘non eccentric hairstyles and use of blue knee lenght uniforms with a white collar’.\nDuring the late 1970s, famous fashion designer Yannis Tseklenis created special school uniforms designs for the more affluent students.\n\nThe pictures in this post belong to the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation.

        title: 'Teddy boy - wearing a uniform to be different'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Teddy Boys -dressed with long, narrow lapelled, waisted jackets, narrow drainpipe trousers, ordinary toe-capped shoes and a fancy waistcoats - were one of the first youth groups to differentiate themselves as teenagers, weighing in the emergence of a youth market.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It was the late 1940's when Savile Row Tailors attempted to revive the styles of the Edwardian era (1901-1910) into men's fashion, shaping a new style, which was primarily addressed to the young, aristocratic ‘men about town’. Additionally, barbers began offering individual styling. Around 1952 this style spread out and reached young working-class males who, despite their gentleman appearence, quickly became associated with trouble on newspapers and by media in general.\_As a result, the middle class felt that they could no longer share the style with its new adherents.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7828\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/cce8e10a79f139b5154ef3f92e71e7b7-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Group of Teddy boys - Southend on Sea&#039;, 1974.

These fashionable young men, descending at the same time from the upper-class Edwardian dandies and the older delinquent subculture of South London, initially simply known as Edwardian's, would later be called Teddy Boys.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7827\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/2118ec2a0bfb7cf4a2d9206bf37a7f0a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Woman&#039;s trouser suit in red and black velvet, Teddy Boy styling, designed by Lee Bender for Bus Stop in 1972 and made in 1993.

It is also known that the girlfriends of working class Edwardian's were referring to them as Teddy Boys before. Less known then Teddy Boys, Teddy girls were working class teens as well, who would dress up in their own drape jackets, rolled-up jeans, flat shoes and tailored jackets with velvet collars.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1958 a huge Italian influence on fashion signed the begining of the end of the Teddy Boy as a mainstream style. However, there continued to be a genuine revival of that style through the 1970s, even if the movement lost its roots and the trend started to be associated with Rock’n’Roll and the emerging interest in Rockabilly music. During this period the look was adopted by Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren through their shop 'Let it Rock' on London's Kings Road and it was a mid step to move on to other styles such as the Punk and Rocker styles.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more interesting pictures on <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=%22teddy+boy%22#searchTerm%3D%22teddy%20boy%22\">Europeana Fashion portal</a>!</p>"

        title: 'Neat and Tidy: the Housemaid Uniform'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>That of the housemaid was the second largest category of employment in Victorian England. A position developed in the rigid and articulated structure of domestic work, it was defined by strict rules, customs and a proper costume.</strong>\n\nIn its commonly recognized version, composed of a dark dress, a white collar, apron and headband and dark shoes, the housemaid uniform finds its origin in the Victorian era. Before, it was not common for maids to wear a particular uniform and, while male servants used to wear a livery, girls often wore their mistresses’ old clothes. This sometimes led to embarrassing confusions between the maid and the mistress, a common theme in the 18th century drama.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7837\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/50bf381295464cd6e87cd61e78ee38a6-665x467.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Le Nettoyage&#039;, a maid and a servant cleaning up a room; 1876/1920. Courtesy MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIt was in the Victorian era in England, a period characterized by a strict class differentiation, that housemaids were first assigned a distinct uniform, that helped to recognize her position and role in the house. Since the maid represented the household, neatness and tidiness were the keywords of her costume. Precise rules were set that imposed the maid to change twice a day and, even though the dresses were often handmade or purchased by the maids themselves, they respected shared norms and trends, dictated by fashion and, of course, by the mistresses as well.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7838\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/9070e9666c47cf2a017678378ec4f0b3-665x441.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Apron, headband, cuffs and collar, part of a housemaid uniform, 1920/1930. Courtesy MoMu - Fashion Museum Antwerp, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn the morning, when the maid was supposed to do the harder jobs, she would wear a plain gown in washable materials with a white bib apron and shoulder straps, while during the afternoon she should wear a black woollen dress with white linen collar and cuffs, and a withe apron. All through the day her hair would be protected by a white headband tied with black ribbon.\n\nEven if housemaids were depicted in paintings and illustrations, it was only in the 1920s that garments manufacturers started to produce 'fashionable' housemaids’ dresses in a variety of fabrics; uniforms even started being featured in advertisement on ladies’ magazines. It is through these paper materials that the memory of the housemaid dress survived, as its practical nature mainly prevented the dresses to be preserved; the remaining examples, now kept in museums and archives, still are important witnesses of a wider dress - and social - history."

        introduction: ''

Both pieces are in cashmere wool, and present different patterns, recalling traditional Indian designs; the finishings are in coyote fur. It was part of autumn/winter 2000/2001 collection by japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The jacket is short and fitted, with no collar, and closes on the front with a safety-pin. The sleeves are made of a single layer of fabric, and on the left sleeve is a label with an Indian motif. For the jacket two materials have been used: a wool fabric with woven cashmere motifs in salmon, gray, green and red, and a silk twill in plain beige-gray. A silk and cashmere hood, lined with coyote fur, is attached to the jacket with four buttons. The full, A-line skirt is made from the same cashmere fabric of the jacket, and lined inside with silk twill. Between the two layers of fabric there is an inner layer, made of polyester, which makes the skirt flared. The waist is also trimmed with coyote fur.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The outfit was designed by Yohji Yamamoto, as part of his A/W 2000/2001 collection. The japanese designer joined together suggestions from different populations, reflecting on their clothing habits, linked to traditional techniques and materials; from India to Mongolia and North America, the influences draw trajectories and reflect on how people in different countries and contexts respond to the environment, keeping up with nature and its variations. The collection fits coherently in the creative view of the designer, who favours oversized volumes, thick fabrics and unexpected materials; it also seems to show how clothes can protect and, at the same time, be a symbol, declaring the identity of the wearer through patterns and cuts; these elements together recall peculiar traditions and customs of a precise place, and associate people, in their instinctive behaviours, across the world.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DCentraal%20Museum\">Centraal Museum</a> Archive.

        title: 'Small but full of pride: pins and badges as uniforms'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">In the rush of everyday life, most people may refer the act of dressing\_‘unconscious’, considering it a routine activity that does not require a high level of attention. Surprisingly enough, the details - and thus \_the smallest objects - are the one requiring the biggest effort, since they have the power to become ‘wearable statements’ - which\_makes them real uniforms.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7866\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/34635a698c9a04055cbb9fb2775849e2.jpg\" alt=\"Lapel pin made for the Stockholm Pride 2008, Courtesy Nordiska Museet\"><em>Lapel pin made for the Stockholm Pride 2008, Courtesy Nordiska Museet</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">This is true for those objects that were created\_especially to signal some kind of belief, political affiliation, or support to a\_cause. Badges, pins and insignia have the power to subvert the meaning of a dress, becoming themselves a uniform on their own right; they can convey messages and meanings that a whole attire would represent. Badges rely on the striking visual power of their design to separate who wears them to ’the others’. Within the military - one of the environments in which these kind of objects are more valued - pins and badges are often given as prizes, recognitions of honour and pride. The symbolic value of the badge is enhanced by ceremonies organised precisely around the act of ‘decorating’ a person with a quasi-sacred object. Badges can also offer comfort to those wearing it, because they define, to themselves as well as to the others, what they stand for, and thus serves as sign of belief and ultimately, of identity.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7867\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/40d6c86a4515775d7942637c3417b81c.jpg\" alt=\"Lapel pin made for the Stockholm Pride 2008, Courtesy Nordiska MuseetLapel pin created for the Stockholm Pride 2008, Courtesy Nordiska Museet\"><em>Lapel pin made for the Stockholm Pride 2008, Courtesy Nordiska Museet</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Maybe these senses of ‘pride’ and of ‘comfort', of which badges are usually infused, are what led to the use that the LGBT community has been doing with objects of this sort - be it badges, pins, or other ’symbols-to-wear'. The gay community has depicted its icons - the ones that formed its vocabulary and then its visual identity - on badges and pins that are worn not only by members of the community itself, but also by supporters and, more broadly, by people sharing the values of emancipation, equality and liberty. The most famous symbol is surely\_the rainbow flag, created in 1978 by the American artist Gilbert Baker as a symbol of diversity, respect and tolerance. This symbol has been translated into pins and other objects, building a common language for an incredibly diverse group of people, coming from different geographies and social classes.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The badges shown in this post were produced and used during the Stockholm Pride in 2008, year in which\_Stockholm also hosted the Europride Festival, presenting itself as the international capital of freedom and social progress. Nordiska Museet holds a complete documentation of Europride/Stockholm Pride 2008, with interviews, photographs and objects, including articles about the different social services that participated in the Pride celebrations: an amazing project of 'archiving the present'.</p>"

        title: 'Scouting for a Restyle: Designing Uniforms'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>In 1980, the uniform of the Boys Scouts of America had a restyle. Its previous militaristic look, which hadn’t received a complete overhaul in over sixty years, had been reinterpreted by no other than the infamous fashion designer Oscar de la Renta.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Founded in 1907, the Scout Movement is a youth organization that welcomes boys and girls worldwide, supporting and educating them during their youth years through a program focused on practical and outdoor activities. Outdoorsman Dan Beard and illustrator Ernest Thompson Seton were the credited designers of the first uniform of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. The uniform, ideated to promote equality among the movement members, is regarded as one of their characteristic elements, along with the handkerchief and campaign hat, the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, the badges and patches.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7886\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/7242f8c1d149511470333d73ea7e459a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Escoteiros de Portugal&#039;, boy scout uniforms, designed Ricardo Falcao and Lito Lusitana, 1936 ca. Courtesy Museo del Traje, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">It took two years for Oscar de la Renta to finalize the reinvention of the Boys Scouts of America’s uniform. When he was asked to design the uniform in 1978, the Dominican fashion designer had to confront with many rigid criteria, most importantly with those of durability and easy care. The most noticeable changes the designer introduced in the uniform regards the two-tone colour scheme for the Boy Scouts and the adult Scouters; he abandoned the khaki green for a khaki tan shirt, paired with drab green trousers, both pieces made of polyester and cotton.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7887\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/2004.16.0018.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Photo of a boy scout. Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The designer also took functionality into account: the shirts collars could be turned down when wearing handkerchief and epaulets were added to the shoulders to make easily identify the program division. Large cargo pockets, useful to store vital possessions, were added to both trousers and shirts. For thirty years, from 1980 up until 2008, the uniform designed by Oscar de la Renta had been worn by millions of American scouts.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Differently from the fashion designers’ common use of historical uniforms as references to implement or develop their collections and express their own design grammar, Oscar de la Renta blended his own point of view on fashion and clothing with the values of the movement itself; the result was a new uniform that represented the history and social values of the institution.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Uniforms can come under any form and aspect, and serve as devices to create the image of ourselves we want to put forward. This is particularly true for everyday, personal uniforms - what we decide to wear in order to ‘be’ the person we want to be. Amongst the many kinds of uniform that we might think of, surely make up holds a special place, since it sits between the idea of something ‘disposable’, which can be put on and off, and that of something so necessary to become natural - and simply unavoidable.</p>\n\n<div>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7892  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/4f24ce980650159d8e78824abca5a80a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>A model using a mascara, ca. 1955-1965, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Trends in make up - as the parameters of beauty - have shifted throughout time and space but, in the Western world, it is especially during the twentieth and nineteenth century that their popularity has grown. At the beginning of 1900, a pale complexion was a must amongst rich and educated people, because this differentiated who didn’t have to stay out in the sun to earn a living from the people who had to work. Compacts containing power were then one of the only objects associated with make up that was appropriate for women to carry around; some of them were very elaborate, as pieces of jewellery, and enriched with initials or incisions.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7893 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/a2d4320e5e46bd740f897292dd244b18.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Powder box with lipstick holder, ca. 1950-1960, Courtesy Centraal Museum</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">During the 1910s, make up was not popular, since it was associated with prostitutes; it’s probably with the rise of popular icons, whose image served as model to shape tastes and form styles, that make up really took off both on the market and in visual culture. So, together with their outfits, the make up of the likes of Greta Garbo, Ava Gardner, Audrey Hepburn, became a fixed feature of their age, necessarily weighed on the development of new items and the diffusion of different products. Mascara, for example, was firstly invented by Eugene Rimmel in 1913, while lip gloss was introduced by Max Factor in the late 1920s, but the popularity of these products came with the use by actresses on the big screen, and also by rather strong marketing campaign based on the benefits women would get by using make up regularly.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7894 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/75b3ee08e000365480bb6fef7d5fcd86.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Blue cardboard box containing a Mascara, ca. 1920-1950, Courtesy ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Interestingly, the history of cosmetics is linked to two incredibly savvy businesswomen. Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden, always depicted as opponents in the market, share the merit to have established the use of cosmetics as not only proper, but also necessary to the appearance of a woman. Helena Rubinstein marketed the mascara and made it very popular, while Elizabeth Arden used her advertising to talk to women to convince them that being beautiful - at every age or class - was synonymous with being appropriate, and thus, at least in Arden's view, powerful.</p>\n\n</div>"

        title: 'The Uniform, Irony and Eroticism'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Uniforms stand at the meeting point between fashion and power. With their ability to define roles, in particular contexts their importance reaches a different level - above all when irony and eroticism get involved, contributing to their timeless appeal. </strong>\n\nThe strong relationship between fashion and power - two defining forces of our society -\_is especially felt when considering uniforms. These garments summarise both the striving contrast of appearance and identity, in their being neat and precise; yet, they hide the wearers own identity behind a role that takes form with the shapes, the colours and the accessories constituting the uniform itself.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7900\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/cfe3dc19cf131a1ff2775dfc7b100ac2-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"'Varieté-Kostüm: Liftboy', drawing by Herbet Mocho, ca. 1925. Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.\"><em>&#039;Varieté-Kostüm: Liftboy&#039;, drawing by Herbet Mocho, ca. 1925. Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nIn this sense, these elements hold a special place in comical representations, plays and caricatures. Extremely exaggerated or reduced, they help to visually render a particular aspect or fault of what they stand for. A bigger lapel may recall the lust for badges or decorations, a looser fit a certain lasciviousness, inflated details a symptom of frivolousness.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7901\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-09/c3-b9-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"Dancer in 'Varieté-Kostüm', drawing by Herbert Mocho, ca. 1925.

Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nAs they serve to represent a precise character in society, thus in this sort of ironic and satirical representations to precise uniforms are attributed precise roles, portrayed by both men and women. In this kind of shows at varieté theatres and cabarets that the erotic connotations attributed to uniforms took form: daring costumes were worn by dancers and performers, deliberately to get the audience to laugh at them.\n\nThese connotations still complete the imaginary that surrounds uniforms and contribute to their fascination. Instead of corrupting their power, irony and eroticism help constructing their popular identity, from which fashion draws constant inspiration."

One day, after many attempts, he found a solution in a chocolate box that was given as a gift to his mother : when unwrapping one of the chocolates, he was impressed by the material and thought it could be what he was looking for.

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Borrowing the title of the infamous 1966 movie by Jean Luc Godard, this month the Europeana Fashion blog will keep on interrogating the archives on the intricate relationship between fashion and identity, telling the stories of those objects that, for their appearance, history and use, are linked to the theme of gender.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7928  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/56504513.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Daniel Hechter fashion show, autumn-winter 1982-1983 women&#039;s ready-to-wear collection, Courtesy Paul Van Riel</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Although greatly debatable, the binary relationship between the genders has been used to analyse both society and culture within many disciplines. Masculinity and femininity have both been defined by theorists as both a ‘social construct’ and a ‘performance’, opening up the interpretation of gender roles to various approaches and also to the individuation of other, more open and ‘queer’ definitions. From the perspectives of both design history and material culture - two areas in which fashion and clothing have been widely used as focus - the understanding of the meaning of dress and accessories in the definition of gender is central. Museums archives hold many testimonies of what men and women have used to form and perform their identity; these objects also tell stories about how people have interpreted them and, in many cases, made them symbols of their take on the so-called ‘gender quest’.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7929\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/bd80175d10915d67bbf7db4c0250681c.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion plate from &quot;Incroyable et Merveilleuse&quot;, engraved by George Jacques Gatine, Paris, 1814, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">This month, the blog entries will unpack the complexity of the theme showcasing the myriad of possibilities in which fashion has either followed the ‘normal’ definition of gender roles - abiding by what has been commonly interpreted as precisely masculine or feminine - or the many ways in which fashion has exercised its power to subvert the social order and ‘change the rules of the game.’</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">We will look at what are considered the ‘stables’ of men and women’s wardrobes - the more blatant being trousers and skirts, at least from our western-biased point of view - presenting notable and sometimes unnoticed exceptions; we will deal with fashion designers and creative minds who have based their aesthetic and practices on the constant redefinition of what is masculine and what is feminine, in the design and production of their pieces as well as in their representation in ads and campaign; we will look at performativity, and more precisely, at performance, as a way to visually define a ‘stage identity’ which sometimes ends up merging with the ‘real’ self (if such thing exists anyway).</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7930 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/16a_0112.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Male headdress, early twentieth Century, Courtesy The Israel Museum</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Follow us in our journey to find out if, how and in which ways objects have helped men and women in their definition and representation, ultimately acquiring a gender for themselves.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Known as cassock, it is an item of Christian clerical clothing used by the clergy of Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and Reformed churches, among others. Its name comes from the Latin term “Vestis Talaris”, which literally means \"Ankle-length garment\" and relates to habit traditionally worn by Jewish priests for first, and by christian priests starting from the IV Century.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Also called soutane and available in many kinds and different colours, depending on the level of the wearer, the cassock evolved from the tunic, which in ancient Rome was worn underneath the toga, and from the chiton, worn beneath the himation in ancient Greece. In religious services, it has traditionally been worn underneath vestments. In the West, the cassock is no more largely diffused today, except for religious services; however in many countries it has been normally worn by the clergy until the second half of the 20th century, when it was replaced by a conventional suit, generally black, incorporating a clerical collar.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/13e6dafd309c6da9516b5568d0d0f786-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-7946\"><em>European fashions Newspaper for men&#039;s wardrobe.

After the introduction of short garments as a trend through the common people in the V Century, some local councils started to ban the use of these short tunics to the priests while recommending long, minimal and dark clothes instead. Later, in 1215 during the Lateran Council and in 1312 during the Vienna Council, a universal code was established and some colours and shapes were banned. The main aim of the reform was to control the ‘relaxation’ towards which society - and ‘bad’ priests - seemed to be directioned.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/ba77bdf754bafb65967bf1edf384b402.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7947\"><em>Wax and tow figure dressed as a secular priest.

The meaning the church gave, and probably still gives, to both form and style of dresses is key; clothing, in the cases mentioned, had to visually signal that the identity of the person wearing that particular item was shaped not so much by his own taste, but by his ‘profession’, which again was not to be seen as a profession but as a undeniable choice of life.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover other amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=TALARE#searchTerm%3DTALARE\">liturgical costumes</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: '‘Gender?’: Walter van Beirendonck'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>In his over thirty-year long career, Belgian fashion designer Walter van Beirendonck questioned, through his otherworldly point of view, fashion and its paradigms – among them, gender. </strong>\n\nIn July 1999 Walter van Beirendonck featured, in his spring/summer show, guys cladded in ponchos, kite shaped clothes, heavily embroidered t-shirts, crocheted dresses worn over floral cotton pants and natural-coloured leather shoes that followed the anatomy of the feet. Entitled ‘Gender?’, the collection discussed the universally recognised aesthetic and social canons usually attributed to the distinct genders.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7963\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/3ae8a46dd4927b0826a0862c5261d7dc.jpg\" alt=\"Embroidered hemd in vichy fabric, designed by Walter van Beirendonck for his 'Gender?' s/s 2000 collection. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen.\"><em>Embroidered hemd in vichy fabric, designed by Walter van Beirendonck for his &#039;Gender?&#039; s/s 2000 collection. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen.</em></p>\n\nCommenting the collection with fashion critic and journalist Suzy Menkes, the designer said: ‘Whether clothes are for men and women is all in the head - and none of these are 100 percent’. Defined through imitation, sexual identity in fashion and clothes is usually conditioned by education and society. Reacting over this clichés, the designer presented clothes that could be questionably either for men and women, pushing not only new colours and decorations, but also shapes and constructions.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7964\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/775fb5aaa0dd7b629410232621c52761.jpg\" alt=\"Shoes in leather, designed by Walter van Beirendonck for his 'Gender?' s/s 2000 collection.

Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen.</em></p>\n\nHowever, the designer was not new to questioning gender canons. Since the late 1980s, in fact, van Beirendonck experimented with menswear, introducing new men silhouettes, drawing from the historical female wardrobe, borrowing pieces such as skirts, dresses and corsets.\n\nIn A/W 1989-1990, the designer presented “Hardbeat”, a collection where the S&amp;M influence was softened, and men were dressed with sexy and sexualized tricot clothes in bright colours. The collection invited to look at sex from a very personal point of view free of preconceptions; it also envisioned the role of men and women in society in a new form of unisex.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7962\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/c018daa7659766976de4afeba89953ef.jpg\" alt=\"Top in knitted wool, designed by Walter van Beirendonck for his  'Hardbead' a/w 1989-1990 collection.

Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen.</em></p>\n\nInspired from queer culture, from the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, Kansai Yamamoto, but also from fairy tales, literature, art and the ancient-astronauts’ theory, Walter van Beirendonck keeps using fashion to question society and its rules, expressing opinions that perfectly describe the many contradictions and surrealistic elements of contemporary culture.

        title: 'Male trend: the wig'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Wigs have a long history - they have been used since the early ages, as Sumerian, Persian, Egyptian, Greek and Roman people wore them for hygienic purposes, as part of ceremonial dress or theatrical costumes. Sometimes, in early societies, men and women used to completely shave their head and cover it with a wig to fight parasites and other diseases,\_but they soon became a trend and started being elaborate and detailed.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Fallen into disuse about 1000 years after the end of Roman Empire, wigs came back to popularity as a men trend through upper and middle classes at the end of the sevententh century in France; it was Louis XIV, the Sun King, who revived the trend: he started to lose his hair as a result of syphilis and hired 48 wigmakers to supply him with perukes. After him, all his court began to use wigs, a fashion that quickly spread to the rest of the European courts, all susceptible to French influence regarding fashion affairs. Following the great spread and success in the continent, the wig makers, then called “Coiffeurs”, obtained great consideration and specific guilds were founded all around Europe.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7969\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/0680d93b2229a952337247339d0cb1f3-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Portrait of Charles Joseph Prince de Ligne. 1700. Courtesy of Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In England the trend of wearing wigs was introduced in 1660 by King Charles II, who took back the throne after a long exile in France. This trend had a fast development and became such popular through the English court, as a symbol of nobility and middle class, that since then wigs were made essentials in society and this accessory became peculiar in the dress code of professionals, high ranking officials and, of course, in the courts. Expensive wigs were usually made from human hair, but cheaper alternatives were available made of horse hair, goat hair or wool and cotton fibers.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-7968\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/3bf5b431362eb0f671a898c64e71f89e-646x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Wig, 1780-1799, Courtesy Amsterdam Museum CC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Generally worn by men in public, to enhance and show their wealth, 'official' wigs used to be replaced at home by little ones, skull caps or embroidered night caps to cover the shaved head. Although the custom was for gentlemen to wear hats, they developed the habit of carrying a large feathered hat under an arm to not crush their wigs. From 1770, wigs were also extended to women, when Queen Maria Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI king of France, started to use them. As the years were going on, women wigs became higher and more sophisticated. By the mid-eighteenth century, white was the favored color for wigs, which used to be powdered with scenting rice flour, starch or Cyprus powder.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The habit of wearing wigs by aristocratic elites in polite society as a way to distinguish themselves from the other social classes ended with the French Revolution, as well as all the other symbols of ostentation and aristocratic power, which were all discarded because in strong opposition with the revolutionary beliefs.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover other amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=wig#searchTerm%3Dwig\">wigs</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

This fair inside the fair aims at exploring possibilities and developing ideas around new business models for creative and cultural industries.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7984\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/58c8280705b0b1a51ac18bd7e144698d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Leon Sault. &#039;Young Ladies Journal Monthly Panorama of Fashion&#039; dated July 1875, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">In this context, Europeana is hosting a series of workshops that will see the participation of twenty students from five design schools from across Europe, to think about innovative solutions and services for the exploitation of digital cultural data.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Europeana Fashion selected six participants amongst three leading fashion school belonging to its network: Polimoda,\_IUAV University of Venice and Politecnico di Milano. All the students selected have shown a strong interest in reflecting on the potential of digital content related to fashion and how to incorporate its use within their projects. This is an opportunity for students not only to work with professionals and learn about the current situation of digital data, but also to network with other creative minds and exchange knowledge and expertise.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The students will take part in different workshops, led by the Spanish commons organisation Platoniq and by the international consultancy company Media Deals, playing with the data hold in the Europeana collections and thinking creatively on how to use them for their projects. The various activities involve also developing business models and learning how to best present and promote the projects, as well as finalise them and pitch them to investors.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The most interesting projects coming out of these workshops will be promoted both on the Europeana channels and partners. They might also be eligible for crowdfunding, and can participate in the coming Europeana challenges.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Since the ongoing <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/next-challenge-2016-open\">Europeana challenge</a> is themed on fashion, we see this as a great opportunity for students and soon-to-be designers to engage with digital data for their creative and business purposes, pushing the boundaries of both their creativity and the potential of digital archives.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">We are looking forward to seeing the output of the workshops and to be impressed by the projects that will come out - stay tuned to know more.</p>"

        title: 'Giorgio Armani: Questioning Gender'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">When thinking about how fashion has contributed to the debate concerning gender identity, it is possible to pinpoint a tradition of designers who have constantly questioned the very meaning of the idea of gender, while basing their aesthetic choices on their own definition of masculinity and femininity; Giorgio Armani is surely on of the most prominent representatives of this flow.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7994   \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/00000584n1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Feminine ensemble, 1980s, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Starting his career as fashion designer in the years between the 1970s and 1980s, Mr Armani developed his aesthetic language blurring the boundaries between what was allowed to each of the sexes, redefining with his designs the very meaning of what is masculine and what is feminine. His ensembles - made iconic also by the infamous advertising campaigns, which were constructed on the very idea of gender bender and denial of stereotypes - seemed to be the natural response to to a shared feeling that permeated society in those years of political and social turmoil; women were beginning to ask recognition in the workplace, campaigning to be rightfully considered leaders; men, on the other hand, were starting to openly explore their sensibility, not being afraid to show it on the outside.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-7995 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/pu1993006r00006.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Exhibition &#039;La Regola Estrosa: Cento anni di eleganza maschile italiana’ held at Pitti Uomo 44, 1993, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Mr Armani’s replied to these changing sensibilities with two silhouettes that were coming directly from the attentive observation of the world around him, applying his innate ability to detect the requirements of a society in total revolution. Men's jacket were stripped of their structure and inner paddings, allowing freedom of movement and giving a relaxed flair to the - rather formal - classical masculine attire; while women could pick from a varied set of structured garments, mostly jackets with big padded shoulders and sharp lapels - which could either be paired with streamlined trousers or flouncing printed skirt: in Giorgio Armani’s view, women didn’t have to completely renounce to frills and to the plasure of ornamentation, but finally gained the freedom to play with different styles, juxtaposing diverse attitudes and tastes to re-create, in their outfit choices, their unique personality.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7996\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/7b04beb8c1bb54f180544d9ffb6e24be.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Ensemble by Giorgio Armani, 1980s-1990s, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY NC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">With his designs, Mr Armani has reflected on both female and male identities, developing two similar but intrinsically different ideals: in this way, he has been able to talk to a wider audience, made up of men and women who were gaining confidence in being complex and, in their complexity, not only contemporary, but more precisely postmodern.</p>"

        title: 'No Gender in Space: Unisex in the 1960s'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>The 1960s were a time of innovation and exploration: while science ventured into space with a series of missions culminating, in 1969, with the Apollo 11 touching ground on the Moon, fashion foresaw a cosmic-broad future, experimenting with new technologies and fabrics, and introducing unisex silhouettes.</strong>\n\nPredicting the woman of year 2000, the ‘Space Age’ designers Pierre Cardin, André Courrèges, Paco Rabanne and Rudi Gernreich designed sleek, colour neutral silhouettes in plastic materials, accessorised with vinyl boots, helmets and plastic googles. Though contemporary history shows that their prediction might not have been that accurate, their creations influenced fashion for the next decades.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/c6c27691f818d9be5b860ff9748204c3-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8003\"><em>&#039;Collection Overview&#039; of the models presented by André Courrèges, S/S 1965, sketches by Trude Rein. Courtesy  Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nWhile the ‘Space Age’ is considered to start with the launch into space of Sputnik in 1957, the first artificial Earth satellite, the ‘fashion Space Age’ instead is a trend that originated on the Parisian catwalks in the early-1960s; during this time, Italian-born fashion designer Pierre Cardin and French André Courrèges, off from their carriers in French couture houses, decided to launch their futuristic lines. Along with them, Paco Rabanne and Rudy Gernreich contributed to the construction of a defined imagery both with their fashion and costume designs, that include the iconic creations for ‘Barbarella’ (1968) by Rabanne and, later, ‘Space: 1999’ (1975-1977) by Gernreich.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/7917520490289d4a2dee14ed7384f92d.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8004\"><em>Man&#039;s ensemble &#039;Cosmos&#039;, designed by Pierre Cardin, 1967. © Pierre Cardin. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY NC.</em></p>\n\nInspired by the youthful wave that defined those years, these designers focused on the exploration of the new potentialities of dress, moving away from the past to look forward to a romanticized future. In 1963, ‘Cosmocorps’ collection by Pierre Cardin introduced new shapes and geometries, adopting in some cases the same cuts, colours and fabrics for the creations for both men and women. Similarly, since 1961, André Courrèges infused in his modern collections a sense of gender neutrality, drawing elements from children clothes. In addition, their shared characteristic of experimenting with new materials let their creations free of historical gender associations.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/2013.0063.00-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8005\"><em>Women&#039;s ensemble, designed by Pierre Cardin, 1965-1970. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nTheir designs, however, mostly reworked womenswear with masculine elements, sometimes even making the sex of the wearer more obvious - something that was shared also by the unisex trend originated at the same time. In fact, although they aimed to cross the gender lines, the neutral cuts of unisex clothes emphasized the body of their wearer, enhancing instead of blurring its sexual identity.\n\nDiscover more creations of the ‘Space Age’ fashion designers and of the unisex trend on Europeana Fashion."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/mude.m.0402-665x842.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8009\"><em>Swing coat designed by Jacques Fath, ca. 1950. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\n<strong>The coat is made in wool gingham fabric, in the colours of black and white. It's a typical example of the kind of outerwear that was fashionable during the 1950s, with its abundance of fabric and volume, which is a feature of the iconic silhouettes of those years. It was designed by the Parisian couturier Jacques Fath in the 1950s.</strong>\n\nThe long coat is open at the front and presents no buttons, except for two button-holes on the shawl collar, which is unfolded to show the precious black lining. The cut of the shoulders is slightly low and the wide sleeves end with black cuffs, made of the same fabric of the collar. The coat is bell shaped and its volume is given by the wide folds that go from the bust to the bottom hemline.\n\nJacques Fath was, along with Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain, one of the couturiers who reinstituted the epitomized idea of feminine beauty after the end of World War II, characteristically represented by the New Look introduced by Dior in 1947. Heir of a creative family, he was a self-taught designer who got his knowledge of the history of costume in museums and books. He opened the ‘House of Fath’ in 1937, where later he employed as his assistants Hubert de Givenchy, Guy Laroche and Valentino Garavani. After his first successes in 1940, he developed strong relationships with many illustrious clients, including Greta Garbo, Ava Gardner, Evita Perón and Rita Hayworth, who chose a dress created by him for her wedding to Prince Aly Khan. His house closed in 1957, three years after the death of the couturier.\n\nThe object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DMUDE%20-%20Museu%20do%20Design%20e%20da%20Moda%2C%20Colec%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Francisco%20Capelo\">MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda archive</a>.

        title: 'The Gender of (Fashion) Things'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Do objects have a gender? Lately, the question has triggered many of the most cutting-edge and interesting researches within the field of both history and design. When dealing with fashion - a discipline strongly related to the body, as well as to the mind of the wearer - there are many variables that are to be taken into account to try and answer that question.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8013  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/b78e67867e58aabc1087021ba392d991.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>English fashion plate depicting the Dandy&#039;s Toilette, 1820-1829, Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">One of these variables is surely history. Many historical objects are now read as associated with one gender or the other, even though a closer look might turn the perspective upside down. One of these objects is the corset: even though contemporary narratives describe the corset as a device for female seduction, corsets weren’t just used by women to shape their silhouettes. Since posture and shape were incredibly important element in men’s appearance, in nineteenth century busts and corsets for men were produced, advertised and sold - and taken up, among others, by the most fashionable dandies. Also, man's corsets show how considering different geographies can change the perception of the 'gender' of some objects.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8014 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/b00_1699.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Male bodice made of glass beads, leather and metal, Courtesy the Israel Museum, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Another aspect to be considered is the ‘look’, the appearance of the object, which associate them with a precise gender identity. Jewels and other elaborate accessories, as pins and buttons, above all the most lavish and flashy, are generally associated with women. Also bags - above all clutches and purses, which developed from the minaudiere and the ridicule - have been appointed as something ‘feminine’. Both these categories of objects seem to have a gender of their own, defining the gender identity of the user more than being defined by it. Since some objects are so linked to one gender or the other, they have been used to go against the status quo and protest the social rules of conformity: this is what happens in the 1970s, when men’s jackets and other items were worn by women to go against the patriarchy and challenge both existing social structures and roles.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8015\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/4d82191c71e347800b15a7ea24822a94.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pair of man&#039;s silver waistcoat buttons, decorated with filigree and coloured pastes, Sweden 19th century, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">To conclude this short overview, it seems that the very core of the matter can be seen in the encounter between the ‘pure’ object and the user. As Pat Kirkham points out, sometimes the apparently ‘un-gendered’ objects are added some elements in order to become gendered, and automatically signal the identity of the wearer: for example, unisex shoes as Doc Marten are ‘feminised’ with girly laces. To answer to the pending question ‘are objects gendered?’ we have to take into account the active role of the user in the process of giving meaning to an object, whose gender is not only defined by its design and function, but above all by who uses it and how - which can sometimes change the very nature of the object itself, subverting its traditional role it was given by society.</p>"

        title: 'The vest: a men''s charm'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A vest is defined as a sleeveless garment covering the upper part of the body. Its name derives from French\_<em>veste,\_</em>meaning\_\"jacket, sport coat\", Italian\_<em>veste</em>\_\"robe, gown\", both coming from the Latin\_<em>vestis</em>. Later it took the name of \"waistcoat\", derived from the cutting of the coat at waist-level.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Usually worn by men beneath a coat, it has been first introduced by King Charles II of England, who attempted to formalize men’s attire in court after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660. We learn it from a diary entry by the English naval administrator and Member of Parliament Samuel Pepys, who on October 8th, 1666, wrote \"[t]he King hath yesterday, in Council, declared his resolution of setting a fashion for clothes.... It will be a vest, I know not well how; but it is to teach the nobility thrift.\"</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/m-2011-0095-jt.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8022\"><em>Vest in embroidered silk. 1740/1750. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">However the waistcoat has not been invented in England. In fact it derived from the Persian vests seen by English visitors to the court of Shah Abbas. As John Evelyn, another famous diarist, wrote on October 18th, 1666: \"To Court, it being the first time his Majesty put himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, changing doublet, stiff collar, bands and cloak, into a comely dress after the Persian mode, with girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles... resolving never to alter it, and to leave the French mode\".</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/9d851256fcb6e28671ae3bc24198aa9a.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8021\"><em>Formal day outfit for a man.

CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">During the seventeenth century the regular army’s uniforms included waistcoats, which were the reverse colour of their overcoats. At the same time civil people started to wear elaborate and brightly-coloured waistcoats and the trend continued through the eighteenth century too, until changing fashions in the nineteenth century restricted them in formal wear.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/7ee4e471a75cdfe146037ca79ffab8bf.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8020\"><em>Waistcoat with deep V-neck collar with saving round in light gray silk. Courtesy of ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The anti-aristocratic feeling after the French Revolution in France influenced the wardrobes of men and women; waistcoats became much less elaborate and their fit became shorter and tighter. The waistcoat moved away from being the centerpiece of a man's clothing and towards serving as a foundation garment, especially from the 1820s, when elite gentlemen started to wore corsets and the waistcoat, which often had whalebone stiffeners, was used to emphasize the figure.\nThis fashion remained throughout the 19th century, with less restriction at the waist. Toward the end of the century, the so-called 'Edwardian look' made a larger physique more popular.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The waistcoat remained visible in the UK until the late 1960s; since the 1970s it became once again a fashionable and popular garment among businessmen and young people wearing it in ensemble with their suits.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=waistcoat#searchTerm%3Dwaistcoat\">waistcoats</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: 'A Madame of Couture: Louise Chéruit'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Since Charles Frederick Worth established his eponymous fashion house in 1858 and introduced the figure of the 'couturier' as it is known today, male dress-makers imposed their own idea of femininity over the female body. However, since the late nineteenth century, women's started establishing prestigious couture houses that challenged those of their male\_colleagues. Among those, the <em>couturiere</em> Louise Chéruit.</strong>\n\nThe\_Chéruit atelier, directed by Louise\_Chéruit herself,\_occupied the hôtel de Fontpertuis in Place Vendôme, the same which would have been acquired by Elsa Schiaparelli in 1935. One of the most celebrated couturiers of her time, she was also one of the first supporters of Paul Poiret, whose sketches she bought in 1898.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8031\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/m-2008-0730-665x1001.jpg\" alt=\"Evening gown by Chéruit, ca. 1900.

Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nLouise took over the seventeenth century hôtel de Fontpertuis in 1906, as a result of her and her sister Marie Huet increasing success inside the house of ‘Raudnitz &amp; Cie’, which previously occupied the building. 'Raudnitz &amp; Cie' was founded in the 1870s by Ernest Raudnitz and his sisters, who later directed the Maison when their brother left them in 1883 to open his own. There, Luoise and Marie trained themselves since the 1880s and saw, by 1900, their names sewn in the dresses labels of the maison. When they took it over, it counted one hundreed employees.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8032\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/aab34e6520d42f97eb4f2ec76a6941e9-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"Woman in a dress by Chéruit, photo by Félix, ca. 1912.

Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nRemembered in Marcel Proust’s ‘À la Recherche du Temps Perdu’, as one of Parisian greatest couture houses, the creation of ‘Chéruit’ maintained a traditional femininity. In 1911, the maison also presented the ‘pannier gown’, inspired by the eighteenth century lines and volumes. In 1912, the press acclaimed Louise Chéruit, whose figure was drawn by the most fashionable artist of her time, among them her alledged lover Paul César Helleu, signed a collaboration which Lucien Vogel, which resulted in the prestigious fashion magazine 'Le Gazette du Bon Ton', a priviledged medium of promotion of French couture.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8033\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/6efed04a18c7c2e4c4bfcdd2b37a413a-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"'La Fête Parisienne à New York' in 'Le Style Parisien', two afternoon dresses by Chéruit and one by Lanvin (in the middle), by Lucien Vogel, 1915.

The maison was acquired by Mesdames Wormser and Boulanger in 1915, after Luoise Chéruit incurred in a scandal which involved her lover, an Austrian noble and military officer, accused of being a German spy. The rumors, which also asserted that she would have been a spy herslef, impaired her celebrity, leading her to decline. Before closing in 1935, however, the maison was even mentioned in Evelyn Waugh's bestseller 'Vile Bodies', published in 1930.\n\nDiscover the creations of Chéruit in the Europeana Fashion archive."

        title: 'The Riding Attire: a history in-between the genders'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The influence riding attires have had on the development of new trends in clothing is undeniable, at least if we consider western fashions; this happened because horses have been one of the main mode of human transportation throughout many centuries; horse riding initially developed as a male setting, while women were obliged by etiquette to the sidesaddle for a long time; this division though didn't stop the two attires - masculine and feminine - to share many similarities.</strong></p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/42d5126f356175f033dabb7ba7ba795b-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8040\"><em>Woman&#039;s riding habit designed by M. Uhlendorff published in the Journal Des Dames, Paris, dated 30 April 1832. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The most important features of riding costumes were comfort, protection against any weather condition and fabrics of a good quality that assured resistance and durability - all elements that were highly valued in the male dressing code as well. A formal habit for riding sidesaddle was finally recognizable since the mid-17th century. It was composed by a more 'masculine' top and a feminine bottom: a tailored jacket with a long skirt to match, a chemisette and a hat, in the formal men's style of the day. The ensemble was completed by low-heeled boots, gloves and a necktie.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/aa54e094340e6c2b8667d8f66a885965.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8042\"><em>Riding habit shirt of linen.

Several accessories were introduced among them, giving structure to a real language and originating a sort of code: for instance a red jacket with black velvet collars signaled an experienced foxhunter. Their habits influenced other countries´ fashion, as France, which adopted the traditional frock coat cut just above the knee, changing its name from “Riding coat” to “redingote”.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/2007.6.0041.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8041\"><em>Black felt two piece riding habit, signed: &quot;Tailors to H.R.H.

All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">During nineteenth century, the general equestrian fashion toned down. Tailors started to make the equestrian clothes, for both women and men. Towards the mid-nineteenth century, riding became a common habit for the upper-middle class and the equestrian clothes became fashionable dress as well. Worn as informal day wear for traveling, visiting, or walking, they were less elaborate and the colours were darker than before. Also, for the first time pants were introduced for women to ride in, worn under skirts at the beginning. Both male and female riders used tweed jackets for hacking. In the beginning of the twentieth century women started to riding horses astride, breaking a long tradition. With a huge symbolic impact, this changed their habits in costume and society: from then on, more and more women rode without skirts and just wearing trousers.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">When the industrialization and transport revolution introduced trains and cars, the use of horses changed and riding became just linked to sports and free time; however its influence on fashion was not over. Even today the country elegance of riding attire is still inspiring fashion houses such as Ralph Lauren and Gucci, who have their own equestrian line.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Discover more amazing pictures of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=riding#searchTerm%3Driding\">riding attires</a> on Europeana Fashion portal!</p>"

        title: 'Vestirsi da Uomo: performing masculinity at Pitti'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">For its 80th edition in 2011, Fondazione Pitti Discovery launched 'Vestirsi da Uomo’ (Dress like a Man), a project focused on the exploration of the meanings and definitions of contemporary masculine elegance. To mark this event, both in 2011 and 2012 Pitti Discovery presented a reading of the theme which took the form of two highly reflective and striking performances, which played around the idea of gender being something performative and performable.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8052 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/pu2012001r00005.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Vestirsi da Uomo, performance curated by Marc Ascoli featuring students from Polimoda, Pitti Uomo 81, 2012, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">In 2011,\_Olivier Saillard was appointed as the director; as historian and curator, he gave an original interpretation of the theme and developed it ‘on the catwalk': female models - the iconic mannequins Violeta Sanchez, Amalia Vaireli, Axelle Doue’, Claudia Huidobro - were in fact walking down the runway ‘wearing’ what Saillard defined as 'masculine attitude': a way of being and dressing, which comes before the gender we commonly attach to each piece of clothing.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8053\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/pu2011007r000791.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Vestirsi da Uomo, performance curated by Olivier Saillard, Pitti Uomo 80, 2011, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The following year, in occasion of Pitti Uomo 81,\_the second edition of Vestirsi da Uomo took place. Art director\_Marc Ascoli\_staged this edition; he developed his concept on the idea of the gender game; as he himself declared: 'a game between real and surreal, between the real garment and the imagery it evokes: exuberant, filled with energy, fanciful, dreamlike and visionary.’ Ascoli decided to involve students from Polimoda to take part onto the performance, considering them as the new generation shaping the contemporary sensibility towards fashion and clothing, and how they can help in shaping identity.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8054\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/pu2012001r00009.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Vestirsi da Uomo, performance curated by Marc Ascoli featuring students from Polimoda, Pitti Uomo 81, 2012, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The two performances demonstrated how, in a society in which the very definition of gender has become fluid and evolving, contemporary masculinity can be regarded more as an attitude than an actual apposition related to men. In this scenario, fashion plays a fundamental role, not only because clothes visually gather the characteristics that we appoint to what is masculine or what is feminine, but also because clothes, and the way they are constructed, can influence postures, gestures and, consequenty, behaviours.</p>"

        title: 'The ‘Casacca’: Unisex by Emilio Pucci'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Celebrated as 'the king of prints', Florentine designer Emilio Pucci was not only a master of the decorate surface. Instead, the experimental nature that he expressed through his prints was as effective in volumes and shapes as in the bright colours and patterns he designed.</strong>\n\nSince the opening of his shop ‘La Canzone del Mare’ on the island of Capri in the early 1950s, the Marquis Emilio Pucci designed sportswear pieces for the jet set celebrities visiting the international resort during the good season.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8066\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/fo0001801b-665x705.jpg\" alt=\"The 'casacca', or short tunic, designed by Emilio Pucci, 1950. Courtesy Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.\"><em>The &#039;casacca&#039;, or short tunic, designed by Emilio Pucci, 1950. Courtesy Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThough the vibrant colours of his fabrics - inspired by the natural environment of the island and its waters – may suggest a radiant femininity, his iconic Capri pants and shirts were drawn from the male wardrobe. Exemplifying the ease of the island life, his shapes were rather linear, such as in the case of his iconic ‘casacca’.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8067\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/fo00529b-665x877.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Models wearing the &#039;casacca&#039; printed with the &#039;Riccioli&#039; design, 1957. Courtesy Emilio Pucci Archive, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe ‘casacca’, or short tunic, had since been a recurrent element in his collections. Romantic in its idea and reminding of both the simple clothes worn by the island fishermen and women and the styles of the Florentine Renaissance, the ‘casacca’ is composed by two straight panels with short tears on the sides, sleeves of variable length and a swan collar, usually worn folded.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8068\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/fo00428b-665x894.jpg\" alt=\"Two models wearing the 'casacca' printed with the 'Onda' design, 'Palio' collection.

Courtesy Emilio Pucci, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe a-gendered line of the tunic, to be worn with the narrow Capri trousers, had been thus exasperated in some rare menswear experiments of the designer. In the late 1950s, for example, male and female models were portraited wearing the ‘casacca’ in the same style and prints, with black trousers and shoes. Though a-genderism and unisex themes might have been distant from the romantic vocabulary of the designer, these designs highlight the modern sensibility that surrounded the exceptional work of Emilio Pucci.\n\nDiscover the Emilio Pucci's 'casacca' in the Europeana Fashion collection."

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8074 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-10/0a256f2ce0527f302068a4d7ac5eff93.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dress by Charles Worth, ca. 1882, Courtesy Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>The dress is made of blue velvet, with a delicate floral pattern in different nuances of yellow, and lined in honey-coloured satin silk. The front presents a cascade of lace ruffs, The collar and the sleeves are also finished with silk ribbons and lace. It was designed and produced by the Maison Worth in Paris, around 1882.</strong></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The dress is a quite typical example of 1880s fashion: the skirt is quite flat and narrow on the front, enriched by a luxurious lace garniture; the back is very voluminous and its construction is highly elaborate, with folds piled one upon the other to emphasise even more the shape of the silhouette.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The peculiar shape of the dress is commonly known as\_<em>cul de paris</em>\_(Paris Bottom), indicating the provenance of this fashion. The <em>cul de paris</em> was made possible by the <em>tournure</em>, a device that was to be worn underneath the skirt, emphasising the backside. It was very popular in the years between the 1870s and the 1880s, and its form evolved throughout the period: from a horsehair-filled cloth to a highly technological wire contraption that followed the movement of the body.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The dress was designed by Charles Frederick Worth, who is considered to be the father of Haute Couture. Born in England, he got his fame in Paris, where he established his fashion house in 1858. He contributed to the establishment of Paris as cradle and capital of couture. Amongst his clients many European royals are remembered, the most prominent being Princess Eugenie and Princess Elizabeth of Austria; he also used to dress actresses, such as Lilli Langtry and Sarah Bernhardt, both on and off the stage.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html#dataProviders%3DKunstgewerbemuseum%2C%20Staatliche%20Museen%20zu%20Berlin\">Kunstgewerbemuseum, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin</a>.\_Discover more on the Europeana fashion portal.</p>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: MICRO/MACRO'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Fashion is not a matter of size; however, it is undeniable that, in fashion, size matters. We could argue that fashion temps out when relatively ‘raw’ materials are transformed into forms and volumes; this translation is both actual and visual: clothes and accessories are devices whose very aspect is what characterises them, and therefore, their dimension might attract different kinds of attention.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8094 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/0ff2e7b978ecc1d51a64f201d172171a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Modes de 1830: Une Perfection&#039;, Courtesy Kunstbibliothek Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The dichotomy between the microscopic and the gigantic is something that has fascinated fashion on many levels; on the more practical, it has been translated in the development of different shapes, sometimes balanced on the same silhouette - as, for instance, in the 'equilibrated contrast’ between a tiny waist and a burgeoning crinoline; on a more abstract note, it encompasses the possibility to provoke great astonishment with a small thing; the power of details gets, in this case, enormous.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8095  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/maa_05305a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Silk fan decorated with a miniature painting, Courtesy Museum of Applied Art Belgrade, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">As two expressions of the ‘sublime’, the micro and the macro are often portrayed in fashion as two faces of the same coin: the strength of the binary lays in the harmonisation of the big and the small, the particular and the whole; or, indeed in the utter negation of this harmony. Given the richness of the Europeana Fashion Archive, which gathers material across time and space, we decided to dedicate this month to presenting some artefacts and exploring some of the experiences that have nuanced the definition of either micro or macro within the realm of fashion.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8096 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/a2bba1166749b73ea4f47bce55a135ae.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Mantua and petticoat of French silk, ca. 1755-60, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Moving between the two extremes, we will zoom in, putting some of the most precious examples of the ‘micro’ under our lens, to unveil their beauty and their meaning; then, we will zoom out, trying to propose a more thorough understanding of the most blatant and apparently well-known voices of the ‘macro-fashion’. Within this back-and-forth, we will also try to understand how the very idea of ‘resizing fashion' has made possible the circulation of news on style, which would have been impossible otherwise.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Follow us this month on the Europeana Fashion Blog, for a new understanding of these two fascinating and intertwined extremes.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Following the series of great collaborations started in March 2013, the Centraal Museum Utrecht is the new curator of the Europeana Fashion Tumblr!</strong>\n\nFor this November, the Centraal Museum Utrecht – supporting member of the Europeana Fashion International Association and one of the original members of the Europeana Fashion project - has selected some of the most eccentric pieces from their collection to curate the Europeana Fashion Tumblr. The images will follow the overarching theme of all the other Europeana Fashion channels: the ‘extremes’ in fashion and costume, from the too big to the too small.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/33126_001-004.jpg\" alt=\"Bas Kosters, 2014, inv. nr. 33126.

The selection well represents the museum highly experimental view on fashion, expressed throughout the years with outstanding exhibitions, such as ‘HAIR! Human Hairs in Fashion and Art’ held from February to May 2016.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/31872_001-018.jpg\" alt=\"Craig Green, 2013-2014, inv. nr. 31872.

Collection Centraal Museum; Utrecht. Image &amp; copyrights CMU/ Ernst Moritz 2013-10-28.</em></p>\n\nThe Centraal Museum is the oldest municipal museum in the Netherlands. It started its activity in 1830, on the top floor of the Utrecht town hall, thanks to the passionate amateur historian Mayor H.M.A.J. Van Asch van Wijck (1774 - 1843). It was when, after 1921, the Museum collection was merged with that of the many other peripheral private ones that it became the ‘central’ museum. In the same century, the museum also shifted its focus from antiquities to modern and contemporary fashion, design and art. Its attention to the contemporary brought the museum to collaborate with contemporary architects and designers in the renovation of the building and its interiors. Dutch designer Richard Hutton designed the Centraal Museum Chair and fashion designers’ duo Viktor &amp; Rolf designed a denim suit with a green sash that served, though for a short time, as the museum attendants uniform.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/x30036-639x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Viktor&amp;Rolf, 2005, inv. nr. 30036.

With pieces dating back to the fifteenth century, the collection is constituted both by garments, accessories and objects that document not only the history of fashion and costume, but of the wider fields of decorative and applied arts and its related practices.  \n\nBrowse the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DCentraal%20Museum\">collection on Europeana Fashion</a> and don’t miss a post <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">on the Tumblr</a>!"

        title: 'Miniature shoes'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The fascination with miniature shoes has its roots in ancient times. Miniature sandals have been found in Egyptian tombs, fashioned from ancient Persian pottery. The Romans had oil lamps shaped as a foot in a sandal and perfume containers as hob-nailed boots. Funeral jars kept in memory of the dearly departed were also made in the shape of boots.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In eighteenth century Europe, it was regarded the height of a shoe maker’s professional career  to display the ability to recreate the shoe design in miniature with all the same details and elegance of the original models. This became a necessity for most shoemakers when a trend was formed due to the upcoming wedding of Prince Frederick Augustus, Duke of York to Frederica Charlotte Ulrica Catherina, towards the end of the century. Unfortunately Frederica was not considered highly desirable, however the Prince was infatuated by her very tiny feet. During their engagement, the prince had six pairs of miniature shoes promptly made by the royal shoemaker. During that period, newspapers were unable to report on Frederica’s physical appearance, so instead made headlines based upon her petite shoes. The media interest resulted in the production of hundreds of these miniature shoes. They became one of the most sought after fashion item of the time; they were even bought despite the size of the costumer’s feet, and rather used as pin cushions or ornament for the household.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/bd8e88472fa80247cc6f933e624d6169-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8110\"><em>Miniature shoe in silver brocade. 1745/1754. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY NC</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1984, George du Maurier published the novel Trillby, the story of an Irish girl who goes to Paris and falls under the control of an hypnotist named Svengali. One of the girl’s eccentricities was to flash her bare foot in public, which was considered a rude custom at that time. The enormous success obtained by the novel encouraged the manufacture of miniature shoes and brought the trend within the reach of Victorians of all classes, who started to collect several object in the shape of shoes. Victorian gentlemen had shoes fashioned as gin flasks, umbrella handles, paper knives, ink wells, accessories associated with smoking and snuff taking; while women had pieces of jewellery, comb handles, bonbonnieres and needlework accessories. During nineteenth century, the popularity of all things oriental draw to the west miniature porcelain examples of the so-called ‘lotus shoes’, which could be found as keepsake in many European houses.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/e1a01fd122cc74f032e24d82afadb6f6.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8111\"><em>Ladies Bound feet 3-inch lotus shoes &#039;Jin Lian&#039;. Embroidered silk upper-cloth sole. Eastern Asia &amp; Pacific, China, Kwangchow. Courtesy of Shoes or no shoes. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">This leads to look for the ‘material results’ the interest in feet and their size produces outside Europe. In ancient China, for instance, women's small feet were considered a feature of beauty; foot shape and foot size were so important to become one of the standards to judge a woman's beauty. To prevent the natural growth, the custom of binding little girl’s feet at the age of 5 was introduced by the tenth or eleventh century among upper-class court dancers, and soon became popular as a means of displaying status. Whether a woman had bound feet or not, and how she bound them, it directly affected her marriageability. To re-shape the girl’s feet, a long strip of cloth was used to bind them, breaking them off and bending them into the arch of the foot, so as to form a pair of \"four-inch es golden lotuses\". This practice used to cause lifelong disabilities, but it was not until the early 20th century that foot-binding fell into disuse.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As many artifacts in museums and collections show, throughout the centuries miniature shoes became tokens of many meanings and symbolised a desire to share worldly goods; when the growth of railways allowed travel to resorts, souvenirs, often made as miniature shoes, were collected. Made in a wider variety of materials such as leather, wood and brass, when the emergence of porcelain brought the fashion to aristocratic circles, elegant and expensive porcelain or enamel versions were exchanged. Today modern, ornamental shoes made from porcelain or resin have become a collectable, proving again the glamorous appeal of these fanciful and little objects.</p>"

        title: 'Cameos: Minuscule Marvels'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">The word\_‘Cameo' refers to an engraving technique opposed to intaglio. it has become common to use the same word to define the gemstones engraved with that particular\_techniques, and the jewels made out with them.\_Their value lays in their striking beauty, which in turn comes from the intriguing relationship between small size and huge complexity.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8118\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/d06e5a7ccebb11b45bcd1fd57202b947-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Reliquary pendant made of onyx, early seventeenth century, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The production of cameos dates back to the Greek and Roman periods,\_when they were made from semi-precious gemstones,particularly onyx and agate. In more recent times, other materials, such as\_shell and glass, have been used in order to respond to the demand of consumers. These kinds of cameos\_were popular in the sixteenth century; following the revival of classical motifs\_brought\_up by Neoclassicism, between eighteenth and nineteenth centuries cameos returned to be a desirable item in Europe, causing a sort of explosion in the\_production of cheaper versions of the semi-precious ‘originals'. Of course, materials created different categories of objects, which then defined people owning the\_cameos: the most precious were also the ones\_requiring more skill and ability, and were displayed by the higher strata of society.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Cameos are made by cutting away background material to make a design in relief. The technique is really complex and the ability of the artist lays in turning the natural flaws and layers into precious details that mark the uniqueness of the piece itself. That is how the quality of a cameo is judged: by the accuracy of the design, the smoothness of its lines and the grace of the overall appearance of the object.\_In their 'artificiality' - their double essence of natural stones reshaped by skilled craftsmen - cameos can be considered an example of how human work can act on nature and, in some ways, change it according to taste and desires.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8119\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/68812509b092b04e0a3d46e4703198cd.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Golden pendant enamelled and set with an onyx cameo of Marie de Medici by Georges Bissinger, 1865, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Given the importance of the human factor, cameos developed as a techniques but turned quite quickly into an art; interestingly, the artistic value wasn’t that much in the creativity in the choice of the motif, but more in the manneristic attention for displaying the technique, made even more difficult by the size and preciosity of the gemstone. As for the motifs, many craftsmen were either copying antique pieces or reproducing popular designs selected by their clientele; one particular motif that was widely used was the portrait, which could either recall\_eminent personalities of the past, celebrate contemporary icons or indeed, acquainted and loved ones.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8122 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/2ec9e43d427e7f010b225035bd40ab5d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Brooch and earrings in agate with golden frame, Courtesy Centraal Museum, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The mannerism enclosed in such care for details takes full form into the rather minuscule space of the cameo, which from its exteriority seem to acquire at least part of its value. In terms of use, cameos, once considered pieces of art that were to celebrate events and important personalities, were also used jewels by male and females alike. Brooches, pendants and rings were the most common montages for cameos, which were donated as gifts and also bought as souvenirs of travels and Gran Tours, circulating within different nations and acquiring new meanings according to their forms and diffusion.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Thanks to our content provider, the Europeana Fashion Portal holds many exquisite examples of cameos: brows the collection and dive into the microscopic grandiosity of these objects.</p>"

        title: 'The unbelievable exaggeration: Incroyables and Merveilleuses'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Emerged in Paris in 1794 during the period of the French Directory, which followed the execution of Robespierre, the Incroyables formed a new social group among the aristocracy, setting themselves aside through to their flamboyant fashionability.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The term 'Incroyables' means 'incredibles', while their female counterparts were the Merveilleuses, roughly the equivalent of “fabulous divas”. Affected by the Reign of Terror and in a need to reconnect with other survivors, they launched an outbreak of luxury, decadence and even silliness, introducing exaggerated fashion trends in clothing and overall style mannerisms. The desire to break up with the regrettable events connected to the Revolution was so strong that some devotees of the trend preferred to be called 'incoyable' or 'meveilleuse', thus avoiding the letter R, as in 'révolution'.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/41c0f568a9271203bfee7e529c8082d3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8129\"><em>Colored engraving with the image of a man in the dress of a &#039;Incroyable&#039;. 1850/1900. Courtesy of ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The members of this group were young, the political product of an explosive time in history. They basically made their statement by dressing in outlandish fashions that mocked the luxurious styles worn in the court of King Louis XVI. The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits with large earrings, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, hats topped by so-called 'dog ears' and large monocles. The Merveilleuses instead exaggerated the Greek style and its neoclassical revival, wearing loose gowns made of almost transparent sheer fabric. The gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. With this 'naked' look they used to match small bags, enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/adfb7061b14060db5c6d08fb46c5a5d4-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8130\"><em>Caricature from the General European Journal. 1979. Courtesy of Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. CC BY NC SA</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Everything in their appearance was a comic exaggeration, which came out as an undertaken rebellion against the serious and repressed atmosphere. Their style and attitude made them look like lavish and ridiculous caricatures of the nobility before the revolution. They frequently faked a lisp, took up a stooped hunchbacked posture and used postiches as fake disfigurements. The Incroyables arrived also at pulling up their hair in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. The Marvalleuses used to have shaved heads under their blonde, black, blue or green wigs, which had been banned by the Paris Commune. The both of them wore large amounts of heavy musk perfume, which led some to call them \"muscadins”.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">This strange and 'unbelievable' trend ended at the beginning of the 1800s, when Napoleon Bonaparte rose to power: society took a more sober and modest turn, while discouraging any kind of opposition, above all the stylistic ones, conflicting with the view of the emperor.</p>"

        title: 'Fashioning fun: Jean-Charles de Castelbajac'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Since his earliest collections, fashion designer Jean Charles de Castelbajac has been a master of the divertissement, conveying in his designs a fascinating mix of fun, surrealism and counter-thinking.</strong>\n\nMarquise Jean-Charles de Castelbajac started his career in fashion designing for his mother’s brand Ko &amp; Co., with whom Chantal Thomass and Kenzo also collaborated. He presented his first collection in 1970, while working as a freelancer for other brands, like the Italian ‘Jesus Jeans’, whose controversial advertisement shot by Oliviero Toscani and featuring slogans such as ‘Thou shalt not have any other jeans but me’ and ‘He who loves me follows me’ scandalized a nation and moved the minds and pens of many intellectuals, stimulating among others the acute wit of Pier Paolo Pasolini.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8136\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/mude.m.0314-665x996.jpg\" alt=\"Jacket designed by Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Lisbon, all rights reserved.\"><em>Jacket designed by Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Lisbon, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIf his first collections were free of the bold ornaments and prints that characterized his following ones - something that still characterises his style and that has since expanded to accessories, furniture and art - they were however not free of the of his irreverent spirit. One of his first creation, and yet one of his most iconic, was a coat cut out from a blanket. The same concept he echoed later in the teddy bears coat designed for the f/w 1988-89 collection and worn by Madonna and Lauren Hutton, and also in the ‘Kermit the Frog’ coat sported by Lady Gaga in 2009.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8137\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/m-2009-0314-jt.jpg\" alt=\"'Arche de Noé', teddy bears coat, designed by Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, f/w 1988-89 collection.

Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn 1972, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac joined the ‘Créateurs &amp; Industriels’ group, founded a year earlier by Didier Grumbach, which counted among its members Issey Myake, Thierry Mugler, Christiane Bailly, Michel Klein, Emmanuelle Khanh and Adeline André. The main aim of the group was to proclaim that creativity was not just a prerogative of haute couture, or at least not anymore. Its counter-fashion attitude, frequently associated with that of Italian contemporary designers Franco Moschino and Elio Fiorucci, showed both a deep understanding of the industry and positive intent to shake it up.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8138\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/56502433-665x961.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, f/w 1982-83 fashion show.

Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</em></p>\n\nThe cartoonish and Pop-Art inspired prints that have come to identify his fashion aligned, in fact, with this position. He started featuring these themes in his designs since the 1980s, and since then they have been disseminated in his collaborations - above all, with Sportmax and Iceberg - and culminated in the collaboration with different artists in the creations of the famous painted-dresses. Crossing the boundaries between art and design, he is now still a prolific designer whose sharp eyes captures the hilarities of the contemporary.\n\nBrowse the Europeana Fashion collection to discover more Jean-Charles de Castelbajac's amazing creations."

        title: '(Small) objects of desire: Réticules and Minaudières'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Nowadays, it is difficult to imagine a woman, whatever her taste, role or occupation, without a bag. Bags allow to carry all the things we need - and want - to keep with us. In their most iconic versions, they can even be considered a statement on their own right. Interestingly, late eighteenth century popular bags were so small they were considered ephemeral, nearly a ‘joke’.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8156 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/19a48e8990efbf9a1cddf01e47172d43.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Embroidered reticule, 1920-1930, Courtesy Amsterdam Museum, CC</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">By the late 18th century, the line of women’s clothing changed: skirt and dresses were clinging to the body, the overall silhouette very fitted and the materials used were more lightweight; for these reasons, pockets were difficult to be added to patterns. Therefore women began carrying small, drawstring satchels or purses, often made of silk net, similar to the bags used to carry their needlework, but considerably smaller. These bags were used to carry a perfume, face powder, handkerchiefs, and all their portable ’beauty tools’.\nThe term used to indicate these objects was Réticules, often mangled in Ridicules: the former refers to their appearance, whilst the second is clearly liked to their small size. Irish traveller Katherine Wilmot defined Réticules in an entry on her diary dated 1801 as 'species of little Workbag worn by the Ladies, containing snuff-boxes, Billet-doux, Purses, Handkerchiefs, Fans, Prayer-Books, Bon-Bons, Visiting tickets.’ Reticule comes intact from the Latin reticulum, which means 'small net’, while Ridicule recalls the French for ‘funny’ or even ‘pointless’.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8157\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/9a49d7119ad821bddc954d40ce77f63b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>1800-1824. Ridicule in embroidered silk, 1800-1824, Courtesy Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, CC BY SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Even if considered useless by some commentators -\_the idea of women carrying their private objects was 'ridiculous' in itself -\_these items were quickly to become a fundamental feature of women's attire: their popularity improved and their design developed. Réticules often were coordinated with the outfit and makers experimented with different materials and motifs. By the mid 1800’s, the style changed: the most popular was the flat style, that could be made different shapes, either round or squared, and were generally fastened with a metal fastener, which was both functional and decorative.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8158 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/m-0001-46.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Guilded minaudière, France, 1920s, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Another example of bag characterised by its small size is the minaudière. This particular object, which stands in between the bag and the jewel, was invented - and patented, in order to avoid copies - by Van Clef &amp; Arpels in 1934. It is said that Charles Arpels was inspired by socialite Florence Gould, who used to put her makeup items into a tin box. Minaudière were deemed ‘essential’ by many accounts during the 1930s and 1940s. Although being valued mostly for its ‘outside’, In the original version the minaudière was a carefully designed item above all in the inside: small compartments were arranged, in order for women to be able to carry all the small items a social night requested.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The Europeana Fashion collection holds numerous of these ‘essential jokes’ from different periods and places: explore the archive to know more.</p>"

        title: Megastructures
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The way in which the feminine figure has been more widely represented focuses on the exaggeration of the feminine characteristics; example of this are the so-called ‘Venus’ Figurines, statuettes of women created in the upper Palaeolithic.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Whether representing a sensual meaning or an invocation of fertility, the general similarity in design and shape of these sculptures is extraordinary. All of them have a wide belly tapering to the head and legs, and their abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, vulva are often deliberately exaggerated. Despite the ongoing debate regarding their cultural significance, they offer a possible understanding of the iconic role of females in the Stone Age communities.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/pu2005001r00091-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8172\"><em>Exhibition &quot;Correspondences&quot; by Yohji Yamamoto. Pitti Uomo 67, 2005. Photo by Alessandro Ciampi. Courtesy of Pitti Immagine. All rights reserved</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">In fashion and clothing, the image of the large and flourishing hips has been transferred in the forms and shapes of the full skirt. Numerous techniques have been used throughout fashion history to extend the circumference of this female garment, including the farthingale in the sixteenth century, hoops in the eighteenth century and, in the nineteenth century, the crinoline. This set the ‘hourglass silhouette’ as peculiar of femininity, whose shape is still considered the ideal shape of a woman’s body, recalled in fairytales and in the most  traditional model of wedding dresses.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/f5f7081e7b3c5c58fe7fc2dade9b4e60.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8171\"><em>Ball gown for Lady Lamington consisting of a full crinoline skirt with puffed panniers designed by Madame Handley-Seymour. London, 1938. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. ©Elizabeth Handley-Seymour CC BY</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Historical periods, life conditions and social status have influenced exaggeration in women garments too, as the lavish and luxurious confections made by the couturier Charles Frederick Worth during the regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870. His international reputation for clothing the fashionable elite came to represent the opulence of the “Golden Age”, an era of material prosperity.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The attempt to reprise the crinoline and design the woman body with the silhouette of the dress in order to make it overlapping the ideal reemerged with Christian Dior’s New Look in 1947. One of his bestselling items was the Bar ensemble, a two-piece suit that exemplified the exaggeratedly female silhouette by means of a rigid infrastructure of wire, whalebone and cambric that imposed an independent sculptural form over the natural lines of the body.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/viktor_and_rolf_aw10_0342.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8173\"><em>Model Jac on catwalk wearing a dress for Viktor &amp; Rolf . Autumn-Winter 2010, Womenswear Collection. Courtesy of Catwalkpictures. All rights reserved</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Contemporary avant-garde designers continue to play with proportions and structures in their collections; Vivienne Westwood’s “Mini Crini” collections of 1985 and 1987 and the extreme silhouettes, opulent fabric and lavish trimmings of John Galliano are two example of contemporary use of crinoline. In the most recent use of structures in fashion an estrangement from the sensual meaning stands out in favor of a gathering between fashion, contemporary art and architecture, as in the work of Comme de Garcons’ designer Rei Kawakubo, who constructed structures in crinoline outside her garments or in that of Viktor&amp;Rolf, whose collections on catwalk bear resemblance to performances of contemporary art.</p>"

        title: 'From a Doll’s Wardrobe: Maison Martin Margiela A/W 1994-95'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>In the autumn/winter 1994-95 women’s prêt-à-porter collection designed by Maison Martin Margiela, some clothes showed unusual features. These items all reported a second label, which stated: ‘Garments reproduced from a doll’s wardrobe (details and disproportions are reproduced in the enlargements)’.</strong>\n\nDolls and fashion have tight connections. If in recent times dolls are associated with the particular image of the sassy fashionista, in the past they have been an important method of communication and reproduction of fashion. Their minute dimensions were an advantage for couturiers and textile producers, since they could use them to present their creations to a broader public with a moderate use of fabric and limited shipping expenses.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8184\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/a7a9f60835d2acb2d965151469a87c7a.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt, Maison Martin Margiela, a/w 1994-95. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen.\"><em>Shirt, Maison Martin Margiela, a/w 1994-95. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen.</em></p>\n\nHowever, their minute dimensions also represented a limit, for accessories and cuts couldn’t be reproduced in exact proportion. Looking at the clothes designed for popular dolls like Barbie, Ken and G.I. JOE, Maison Martin Margiela focused on these peculiarities, as the zippers and buttons, pockets, un-anatomic cuts and unfinished details and up-scaled them to life size, making this disproportions more evident.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8183\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/70f55fb9e65d93dc79e45e9289a4d3191.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Jacket, Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1999. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen.</em></p>\n\nThough playful in his approach, with this overturn Maison Martin Margiela explored the concept of the standardised body, highlighting its contractions and conventions, as magnified in the idealized and un-realistic features of the toy dolls; the collection also reflected on how both the female and male bodies are keen to undergo this process of standardisation by fashion and social ideals.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8181\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/568d7a26c4e55a1183d1559290431e37.jpg\" alt=\"Sweater, Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1999. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved. \"><em>Sweater, Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1999. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn the collection, odd details as oversized accessories, un-attached collars and seams left with uncut threads contributed to the atmosphere of 'unease' that was associated to the mystique of the Maison. Sticking to the overarching project, the knitwear pieces of the collection were even realized with a thicker thread, accordingly to the false proportions of the toys’ clothes. The Maison also reprised this theme for the spring/summer 1999 menswear prêt-à-porter line, which featured coats with faux oversized front buttons, chunk zippers and and huge ID tag chains.\n\nFind more pictures from this and other Maison Martin Margiela collections in the Europeana Fashion portal and learn more about Barbies and dolls in fashion exploring related entries our blog."

        title: 'The fabric of desire: indian textiles'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Objects from different, often unknown cultures have for so long cast a spell on the imagination of people in the West. Geographical distances weigh on the ‘cultural capital’ of artefacts that come from far away. Then, if these objects are something so unique they can be hardly reproduced at home, their material value combines with the meaning they acquire when they travel, in space but also in time.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8188  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/6466809a23f87594f9ac7f7a48607f67.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sari in silk and metal thread, Courtesy Heritage and Sustainability - University of Antwerp</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Indian textiles have been leading the global trade for long, from at least the seventeen and eighteenth century, when huge amounts of indian cotton started to be brought to Europe because of their quality and price. Till at least the eighteenth century, Indian textiles were\_technically much more advanced than the ones produced in Europe, and were therefore generating desire among the fashionable consumers, who were seeking to distinguish themselves by owning something as precious and finely made.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8189\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/0f0f7aa4c039628d0f90665cf49fe4e1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Embroidered cotton dress, with textile probably coming from Gujarat, 1780, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Indian textiles can be classified according to the region of production or the technology implied in their making, as different techniques have been developed within the different Indian districts. Threads made of cotton, silk, wool and even gold and silver were used to embroider on different materials, from the most ‘common’ - silk, wool and of course cotton - to less expected ones, such as velvet and leather. Many decorations are implied in the production of these textiles: small mirrors, shells, coins, gems and sequins are all used in different ways, also testifying the skill and craftmanship of the producers.</p>\n\n<div>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8190  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/58dacf64483189a4dd6d7e17b8934d58.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Kotki, 1850-1965 ca., Courtesy Stichting Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Indian textiles are known for the vivid colours, given the special natural dyes used, but what really attracted western consumers are the exotic motifs and unique decorations such as the ones these fabrics showed in their embroidery. For example, one of\_the most interesting embroidery technique is the Zardozi. It is done on different fabrics: silk or velvet are the most common,embellished with either chain stitch, stem stitch or satin stitch. The embroidery is made with some so-called\_‘zari' threads and different kind of threads, which can be twisted, untwisted and also metallic.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8192 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/7ade756143edbbf654ff2b0adbb79e9e1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Rajput wedding gown made of silk, embroidered with zardozi technique, Courtesy Stichting Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Another\_embroidery\_technique is the Gujarat,\_whose typical motifs are flowers, plants and animas, but also human figures can be found on these kind of textiles. The embroidery is done with multi-coloured threads, usually in cotton or silk. Different stitches are used depending on the style of the figures: chain stitch, herringbone stitch, satin stitch, interlace stitch, buttonhole stitch and darning stitch. Mirrors are also used to embellish the whole pattern, which can be made of forms made of scraps of other fabrics stitched on top of the basis.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Visit the Europeana Fashion portal to virtually travel to India and get fascinated by these amazing items.</p>\n\n</div>"

        title: 'Wide Stories: The Mantua'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Popular for what we now consider an exaggerated silhouette, the ‘mantua’ - a style of gown in fashion in the late seventeenth century and early eighteenth century – bears a story as wide as its volumes.</strong>\n\nIntroduced in Europe in the 1670s, the mantua was in origin a loose coat for women, with a kimono-like cut. It was inspired by the clothes and robes recently imported from India, that were worn by Western men as dressing gowns.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8201\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/1e12028799bf9f219cbac6bdfb513399.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Mantua and petticoat of silk, England, ca. 1745. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nThe name 'mantua' might refer to the Italian city of Mantova, once an important centre for the production of exquisite fabrics; or, it might be an evolution of the French term ‘manteu’, which referred to nightgowns and dressing gowns. The latter explanation makes sense, given the fact that it was worn as a kind of ‘undress’, as its earliest one-piece structure was free of the stiff boned bodice of the ‘grand habit’ that was in use in the court.\n\nThough simple in its construction, the preciousness of mantuas reflected that of the fabric of which they were made, which was usually a kind of silk damasks now known as 'bizarre silk', fashionable in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. \_The 'mantua-making' was a women's trade, as millinery was, and was officially recognized in France as the first guild controlled by women.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8202\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/a2bba1166749b73ea4f47bce55a135ae1-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Mantua and petticoat of French silk, brocaded with silver-gilt threads, made in England, 1755-60 of French silk, 1753-55. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nInitially considered too informal to be worn outside private spaces by Louis XIV, by the end of the 17th century the mantua became the formal dress worn in the courts of Europe and continued to be worn in England until 1820, when George IV suggested it should be abandoned. As in the early eighteenth century elliptical side hoops came to fashion, the shapes of the mantua changed to accommodate them. Following the crazes of the court, its width even reached, in the most extreme cases, two meters."

        title: 'The Maxi Dress'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">The Maxi Dress appeared in the 1960s, launched by high-end fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, already famous for his women's evening wear and suits.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8230\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/m-0001-174-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Maxidress designed by Dubuffet, 1973. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">By 1968, when the New York Times published a lacy cotton version made for Elizabeth Arden, millions of people started buying and wearing dresses designed alongside the lines of this famous one; the Maxi Dress then became a women's wardrobe essential throughout the 1970s. The popularity of this model is also due to the costumes designed for the movie based on Pasternak’s book Dr. Zhivago, in which Julie Christie wore flowing romantic maxi dresses, as well as maxi coats over trousers.</p>\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8231\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/4f12f39230169a436e2d12a6f7229518-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Printed acrylic jersey maxi dress by Biba, Great Britain, 1973. Courtesy of Victoria and Albert Museum. CC BY ©Biba</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The most common maxi dresses were initially slightly shorter than ankle length, and usually made of lace. It wasn’t until the 1970s - the decade in which it gaind huge popularity and became a must-have fashion item, along with similar caftan and boho-styled clothing - that it started being decorated with a wide variety of motifs, from paisley to exotic and psychedelic prints. Designers such as Yves Saint Laurent, Biba, Halston, Ossie Clark and Pierre Cardin came out with their own stunning versions of the trend.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">This peculiar design, almost completely disappeared by the 1980s and the 1990s, has recently made its comeback; today in fact, the maxi dress has become a go-to-garment for women all over the world, since its form can be adapted according to different requirements, either of style and substance.</p>"

It was designed by Paul Poiret in 1923, and made using the fabric produced by the Atelier Martine, the designer's atelier dedicated to interior and textile design.</strong>\n\nThe coat, reminiscent of the eighteenth-century banyan, has a straight line, extended shoulders width and low, kimono-like, sleeves. The wrap over neckline is embellished with a wide collar. A belt is used to tie the coat on the waist. Right under the waistline, two patch pockets are attached.\n\nInterested in the works produced in the Wiener Werkstätte, Paul Poiret opened ‘Martine’ in 1911. He named it after one of his daughters; it consisted of École Martine, Atelier Martine and La Maison Martine. The École Martine was an experimental school for working-girls directed by Marguerite Gabriel-Claude Sérusier, where the students applied themselves to sketching plants and animals at parks and zoos. The best drawings were bought by Paul Poiret and printed on the textiles and wallpapers that were produced by the Atelier Martine. The atelier was very avant-garde in terms of motifs and production, and also featured collaborations with Raoul Dufy. Eventually, Poiret sold ‘Martine’ enterprise in 1925.\n\nThe object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DModemuseum%20Hasselt\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a>.

        title: 'Wide and strong: shoulder pads'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">‘To have broad shoulders’ is a quite common idiom, meaning ‘to be able to cope with difficult situations’. As it often happens, the metaphorical meaning of the sentence is directly linked to the image it evokes; and fashion, with its ability to act on the shape of the body, has proved to have much to do with the construction of this visual metaphor.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8265  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/00000376n2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dress designed by Elsa Schiaparelli, 1946, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Although it is difficult to pin down the period in which pads for shoulders came into use - padding was something that has been quite often used in costume, for any part of the body - the shoulder pads we are familiar with are quite recent. They were in fact popularised in the 1930s, by designers such as Elsa Schiaparelli and costume designer Adrian, who dressed Joan Crawford in her iconic movie Letty Lynton. The silhouette of the 1930s reminded of a triangle with the basis on top: so, in very simple visualisation, wide shoulder line e very narrow pencil skirts.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">In terms of materiality, shoulder pads were originally semicircular pieces of cloth stuffed with different materials, from cotton to wool or sawdust. \_With the outburst of the war in 1939, feminine fashion followed a period of ‘militarisation’: jackets had to represent severity and solidity, and the shoulder, constructed by bulky pads supporting their ‘hard’ shape, seem to metaphorically bear the burned of those hard times. Even though after the war the shape of the silhouette in vogue changed completely, shoulder pads were still in use, though in smaller size, to graciously perfect the line of dresses and jackets.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8253\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/bf7016f663e3f1013498c34de80de0dd.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Ensemble designed by Gianni Versace for his Winter Collection 1983-1984, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">A decade that saw the revival of shoulder pads is that of 1980. Shoulder pads were used by designers reflecting on the link between women and power, and used them in the definition of what is now commonly known as ‘power dressing’: a sort of uniform for the up-and-coming, hard-working women that in those years were battling for equal opportunities within the working environment.\_Maybe because they remind an armour, big\_shoulders still recall a sort of strength and are associated with self confidence and power.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8254\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/2012.0005.00.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Ensemble designed by Kansai Yamamoto, 1980s, Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Interestingly, shoulder pads became also a feature of attires used in performances by musicians and artists, who also tended to wear jackets with heavy decorations on the shoulders so flashy to caught attention, often becoming the epicentre of the entire look. This is true for the 1980s, but also today: many 'big-shoulders' look are considered statement, above all when worn by female performers whose feminist activism lays primarily in their costume choices.</p>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: GALA'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">December is, by definition, a festive month. The many celebrations crowding our calendars during the last month of the year call, necessarily, for the right dress. For this month’s theme, we decided to dive into the Europeana Fashion archive and pick the best objects representing December’s party mood, concentrating around the idea of 'Gala', and its translation into clothes and accessories.\n<em></em></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8281\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/f2513fa497d3640fb328b7e2bd07ede8.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fashion plate, showing an evening dress and ball dress, from &#039;La Belle Assemblée’, 1828, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Galas are part of popular imagination as dreamlike events, where everything - from the little details to the actual design of the whole experience - concurs in the defition of the uniqueness of the moment. The architecture of these moments is as ephemeral as it is marvellous, and it it in their being rare and, most of the times, of restricted access that events such as galas, balls, and other social performances catch people's fantasies, provoke admiration and desire.\n<em></em></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8282\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/60f31e6a70206b7779ab3cc295dddf93.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Evening wrap of silk taffeta, probably made in France, 1904, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Galas have been portrayed in stories and fairytales as pivotal moments in the articulation of the narrative, and in these cases artefacts are most of the times the core devices to visualise the importance and relevance of the event: one for all, the power of Cinderella’s shoe in making the story iconic in itself. This idea has been taken up into the transposition of these stories into movies, where costume designers have the task to make garments speak.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8283 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-11/m-2008-1066-pg.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Embroidered Evening Gown designed by Vionnet, 1929, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs Paris, All rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Apart from showcasing some material examples relating to special occasions, we will look at the people who are responsible of making the ‘stuff' of which these dreams are made of: designers, but also embroidered and manufacturers responsible of the various objects populating these gilded scenarios.\_Some space will be dedicated to the 'master of ceremonies' and their role into contracting and disseminating this desire.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">So, await for some fascinating insights on the material culture of partying and gala and, please, dress accordingly.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Tumblr Curation by Villa Foscarini Shoe Museum'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Throughout December, Villa Foscarini Shoe Museum is curating the Europeana Fashion Tumblr, celebrating this month's festivities with a glamorous selection of shoes from their exclusive collection. </strong>\n\nVilla Foscarini Shoe Museum, located in Stra, near Venice, holds a collection that comprises more the 1500 shoes designed by some of the most famous fashion designers from the late 1940s to today. All the shoes in the collection were produced by ‘Rossimoda’ shoe factory, for which the Museum serves as archive and exhibition space; it was instituted in 1995, to mark the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the foundation. Alongside the shoes produced for Christian Dior, Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent and Marc Jacobs, the Museum holds a precious collection of shoes and footwear from the 18th and 19th century. A long-time partner of Europeana Fashion, part of its amazing collection can be found on the Europeana Fashion portal.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8292\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/00030-copia-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"Decolleté shoe in fabric and metal bucklet, Christian Dior, 1960. \"><em>Decolleté shoe in fabric and metal bucklet, Christian Dior, 1960.</em></p>\n\nIn this same month last year, Villa Foscarini Museum showed through the Europeana Fashion Tumblr the links between shoes and festivities in European tradition, with a selection of illustrated New Year’s and Christmas cards where the shoes, as a symbol of good luck and renewal, are the protagonists. This December, instead, this link will be expressed through the selection of some of the most dazzling shoes carefully picked from their archive.\nThe curation, in facts, reflects this month’s festive air. Selected for their enchanting looks, anecdotes or origins, these shoes come along detailed captions exclusively written by the museum, to help reconstruct their stories.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8293\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/01607-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"Sabot shoe in fabric with accessory in pearl, Christian Lacroix, 2001.\"><em>Sabot shoe in fabric with accessory in pearl, Christian Lacroix, 2001.</em></p>\n\nEvery week of the curation, from December 1st to December 31st, will be dedicated to a different colour, as it will be for the Europeana Fashion Instagram. Drawing from the colours that are generally linked to the idea of celebration and the shared-atmosphere of festivities – silver, gold, red and white - the curation will proceed alongside the Europeana Fashion Instagram, where the same model will be through these weeks, to look forward to this year’s celebrations with a glance to the past.\n\nFollow the curation on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a> and don’t miss a post on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeanafashionofficial/\">Europeana Fashion Instagram</a>!"

        title: 'Souvenirs from the Ball of the Duke of Brabant'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Many elements come together to determinate the success of a party, but just few of them can be recalled to mind with exact precision. If dress can be considered one of those, then the detailed illustrations commissioned by the Duke of Brabant depicting the\_<strong>fancy outfits of his guests\_</strong>are powerful documents, able to evoke the atmosphere of gala nights taking place in the second half of nineteenth century.\n</strong>\n\nOn the evening of the 20th April 1857, Leopold II, Duke of Brabant - a title assigned to the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Belgium - hold a fancy dress ball, to which all the high Beglian nobility was invited. As a record of the night, Jules Géruzet, a photographer, lithographer and editor active in Brussels at the time edited a series of litographs depicting the elaborate costumes donned by the guests of the Duke.\n\nMasquerades were a popular form of social gathering that required participants to challenge themselves in the research of the most out-of-the-ordinary, and appropriate altogether, dress for the evening. Although sometimes masquerades were themed, the freedom to fantasise accorded to their participants often translated in elaborate gowns, whose decorations were incredibly elaborate and of immediate visual strenght.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8299\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/be-kbr00_a-2150801_0000-00-00_0001.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Belgique et Costumes.

Women and men are illustrated wearing the nineteenth century representation of past styles and costumes, including court dresses, traditional costumes and uniforms.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8300\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/be-kbr00_a-2150951_0000-00-00_0001.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Belgique et Costumes.

        title: 'Roger Vivier for Christian Dior: the golden era of shoe design'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Among the most innovative fashion designers with whom Roger Vivier worked, his ten-year collaboration with Christian Dior can be considered as a golden era for shoe design, highlighting the importance of 'dressing' the ankle and foot to create a look.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8306    \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2011-0705-jt.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Black pumps, Roger Vivier for Christian Dior, 1955, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Born in Paris in 1913, Roger Vivier studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, until he interrupted his studies to design a collection for a shoe factory. This first appointment opened his eyes on his true vocation, shoe design, which led him to work for many major shoe manufacturers in Paris, UK and USA. In the early days of his career, his talent was especially appreciated by Elsa Schiaparelli, who included his designs in her 1938 collection.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8307  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2011-0770-jt.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Red pumps, Roger Vivier for Christian Dior, 1955, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Back from WWII, Roger Vivier was working freelance in Paris, when Christian Dior opened a shoe department in his salon. In 1953 Monsieur Dior appointed Vivier as designer of the department. From 1953 to 1963 Roger Vivier designed all the shoe collections of Christian Dior, reaching the impressive result of creations with an avant-garde look destined to become classics. Inspired by the history of fashion and looking at the innovations in disciplines of engineering and science, he created a number of new heel shapes and designed some of the most iconic shoes of the period. The designs were lavish and adorned with unique jewels decorations, revealing a sophisticated eye for line, form and decoration.</p>\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8308  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/00063.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pumps in pink crepe and laminated silver, Courtesy Rossimoda Shoe Museum CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The most relevant innovation introduced by Roger Vivier for Dior was probably the stiletto heel, obtained by increasing the height of the heel from 6 to 8 cm. The stiletto was first presented within the 1954 collection. In 1957 Christian Dior died and Vivier began collaborating with his successor Yves Saint Laurent. This collaboration produced the new square-point toe box, appeared on the pages of Vogue in 1958, where it was described as “one of the Paris details that may make fashion history.” In 1959 Vivier introduced the inward-curving schock-heel and in 1960 he was honoured with the Neiman-Marcus Fashion Award, after launching a streamlined update of the nineteenth-century d’Orsay pump, which is probably one of the most copied footwear styles ever.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Roger Vivier’s shoes may looked shocking at first, but had definitely redefined the contemporary notions of shoe design, captivating some of the most stylish and prestigious people, who became affectionate ambassadors of his style. Amongst them: Queen Elizabeth II, who wore a pair of gold kidskin studded shoes for her coronation ceremony in 1953; Marlene Dietrich, for whom Vivier designed a pair embellished with Boules; Ava Gardner, who in 1961 wore \_bright green highly polished cabochon and rhinestones created especially for her.</p>"

        title: 'Dazzling Couture: Lesage''s Embroideries'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">‘‘Embroidery is to haute couture what fireworks are to Bastille Day.’ This was the statement François Lesage made when asked about the relationship between couture and his own practice.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8324\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2008-0042.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Lesage for Balmain, 1954, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">When it comes to embroidery, Lesage is probably the first name that comes to mind.Throughout his career, he has collaborated with the most iconic maisons, establishing his reputation of highly-skilled maker and talented creator - or anticipator - of the atmospheres of French couture, and linking is name to the extraordinary details of gowns and accessories. François Lesage was born ‘in the business’: in 1924 his parents had in fact taken over the workshop of the embroiderer Michonet, famous for working, above all, with all the biggest names of French couture. After serving as apprentice in the family business, right at the end of World War II, François Lesage opened a Studio on Sunset Boulevard in 1948, working with costume designers in the film industry. However, the sudden death of his father made him decide to return to France and take the role of director of the atelier.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8322\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2008-0075-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Lesage for Schiaparelli, 1938-39, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">In many ways did Lesage highlight the duplicity of his practice: between craftsmanship and invention, technical savviness and exquisite taste. His role as ‘haute embroiderer’ led him to venture in other fields to inform his practice of innovative techniques that produced never-before-seen effects: he was also an inventor, experimenting with dyeing techniques and stitches. An outstanding number precious materials were used to create the samples: sequins, feathers, chenilles, ribbons, buttons together with unexpected materials, such as Rhodoid. , Elsa Schiaparelli and Yves Saint Laurent are said to have worked only with him, trusting not only his ability but, above all, his talent in predicting what they wanted to complement their creations.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8323\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2008-0074.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Lesage for Schiaparelli, 1938, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">François Lesage developed collaborative relationships not only in France, but across the international scene: Pierre Balmain, Cristobal Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Jacques Fath, Jacques Griffe, Jean Dessès, Hubert de Givenchy, and, from the 1980s on, Oscar de la Renta, Bill Blass, Geoffrey Beene. Karl Lagerfeld, who had just arrived at Chanel, began a professional relationship with him 1983, opening a new era for the maison: Mademoiselle Chanel in fact had never wanted to work with him before, given the strong link he had with rival Elsa Schiaparelli.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8325\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2008-0040.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Lesage for Jeanne Lafaurie, 1950s, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">At the end of the 1980s, François Lesage was celebrated with a travelling exhibition first held at the Palais Galliera in Paris, then at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, the Fashion Foundation of Tokyo, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. During his life, he received numerous awards and recognitions, such as the Medal of the City of Paris in 1984, and the Grand Prix de la Création of the City of Paris. He was made a Knight in the Order of the Legion of Honor, and was later promoted to the rank of Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters.</p>"

It was designed by Madeleine Vionnet in 1925.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The dress is sleeveless; it is composed by a basis in plain red silk, and its particularity lays in the decoration, which is applied on top of the silk basis. The way the silk threads are arranged creates a motif that reminds of ancient Greek patterns. In being loose on top and more fitted from hips downwards, the decoration itself becomes structural, moulding the entire silhouette.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The dress has all the iconic details that identify 1920s party style: lowered waistline, knee-length, flashy decoration. This style was paraded by young and emancipated women\_called ‘flappers’. The 'flapper style' was very recognisable, characterised by a boyish physique and haircut, no corsets, short-fringed skirts and dresses, in vivid colours and embellishments. The style was pioneered by French fashion designers such as Coco Chanel and Madeleine Vionnet, who provided their clientele with creations that responded to the need for a 'fresh start' in fashion after WW1.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=%22Les+Arts+D%C3%A9coratifs%2C+Paris%22#searchTerm%3D%22Les%20Arts%20D%C3%A9coratifs%2C%20Paris%22\">Les Arts Décoratifs</a>\_Archive.

        title: 'Weawing desire: the alluring fabrics of Bianchini-Férier'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>Fabric are a mindful connection of threads, composed in almost infinite combinations. Warp and weft can be woven in an almost infinite combinations, with the only exception that at least once, threads must <em>pick</em>. The ability to weave and to connect fabrics, and therefore people and situations, characterized the fascinating history of Bianchini-Férier.</strong>\n\nThe first <em>pick</em> in a list of woven connections is that of Charles Bianchini, François Atuyer and François Férier. The three, respectively a designer, a technician and a financier, founded the silk factory Bianchini-Férier in Lyon in 1888. The velvets and brocades produced by the Maison obtained immediate recognition and received a silver medal\_at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8351\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2010-0493-jt-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Silk scarf, design by René Lalique on Atuyer, Bianchini, Férier et Cie fabric, ca. 1907. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAlthough working with the forefront fashion creators, for whom the mills produced, in addition to velvets and brocades, charmeuse georgette and crêpe Romaine, its creative exchanges with artists are however what better describes the prestigious quality of these fabrics.\n\nIn 1912 in fact, Bianchini-Férier hired the Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy to design the prints for silks and toiles de Tournon. The artists one year earlier started in a wooden-block printing factory, ‘La Petite usine’, that developed from his collaboration with the couturier Paul Poiret; he continued his activity at Bianchini-Férier through 1932, designing a wide range of patterns, from colourful florals to elaborate scene inhabited by dancers. This experiment, that bound together Paul Poiret, Raoul Dufy and Bianchini-Férier, was one of the first successful collaborations between a designer, an artist and fabric producer.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8350\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/eee9ddb62e8273403b82c91024ce9059.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Troïka&#039;, housecoat designed by Paul Poiret with Bianchini-Férier fabric with print designed by Raoul Dufy. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag via ModeMuze, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAlong with Dufy, the silk factory also hired Georges Barbier, Paul Iribe, Sonia Delaunay, Robert Bonfils, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, and later Daniel Buren, among others, to design the prints for its fabrics. This collaborative nature accompanied the Maison in its expansion overseas, when in 1921 the firm opened an office in New York that prevented its recession during wartime.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8349\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/21953-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Silk fabric, print designed by Georges Barbier for Bianchini-Férier, ca. 1920. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAlthough under another name, the maison continued its activity through the twenty-first century. In the Europeana Fashion collection, it is possible to trace the history of Bianchini-Férier through the creations couturiers realized with these fabrics, ranging from the early twentieth-century designs by Paul Poiret, to a 1960s long dress by Pierre Cardin and a later design by Frank Govers."

        title: 'Documenting TheArts+: Interview with POLIMODA students'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the 19th to the 23rd of October, within the context of the Frankfurt Book Fair, Europeana hosted a series of workshops in the context of the Arts Plus (<a href=\"http://theartsplus.com/\">http://theartsplus.com/</a>). Europeana Fashion selected participants amongst three leading fashion school belonging to its network: Polimoda, IUAV University of Venice and Politecnico di Milano. The students took part in different workshops, led by the Spanish commons organisation Platoniq and by the international consultancy company Media Deals, playing with the data hold in the Europeana collections and thinking creatively on how to use them for their projects. The various activities involved developing business models and learning how to best present and promote the projects, as well as finalise them and pitch them to investors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have asked some of the participants to share their thoughts on the experience. Here is what Rachele and Elizaveta, two participants from Polimoda, told us.</p>\n<p><em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8358\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/senza-titolo-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>THE ARTS+ Fair. Courtesy Europeana Foundation, CC BY-SA</em></p></em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Fashion</strong>: <em>First and foremost, can you tell us something about yourself? How and why did you become involved with fashion?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rachele</strong>: After attending high school in my hometown, Cecina, I decided I to enroll at POLIMODA because I needed a change: I was looking for something that could take me away from normality. Then I started the Fashion Design course, which is mainly focused on techniques and practical knowledge: models, graphics and a smattering of business. I enjoyed the course above all because it allowed me the freedom to choose how to shape and develop my own project.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Elizaveta</strong>: I am currently studying at the Fashion Design course at Polimoda, an institution that I am very happy to have chosen: the environment is conducive to any kind of creative development and the teachers are always available. The courses are mostly practical, and give you the right preparation to develop a project in its entirety. There has never been a concrete reason why I chose to study fashion: maybe just the fact that I have always seen fashion as an environment where creativity has not limits. Then, in terms of possibilities, it is a field that will never die: people will always need to dress.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>Tell us your experience: how was the workshop? What are the main features of the project developed by your group?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>R</strong>: The title of the project my group developed was \"Art out loud!\": an app that would make the visual arts accessible for people not able to see. The idea was that the app could ‘show’ digital material through the comments posted by users in audio note communicate their impressions in front of a work of art. The main objection we got from the jury was that the app was completely free.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>E</strong>: With my group we have developed an App with the same layout of Tinder, but instead of having to \"match\" with other people, you have the match with art. The app allows you to easily save images and study your favorite works. It was aimed at making the use of digital data easier and more palatable for anyone.</p>\n<p><em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8359\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/senza-titolo-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>THE ARTS+ Fair. Courtesy Europeana Foundation, CC BY-SA</em></p></em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>We are curious about your general impressions on the experience: did you like? Did you find this useful? You can use it in your path of personal study?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>R</strong>: The workshop came a bit as a surprise, since I had never before come across online archives; in fact, my training does not currently include courses on digital knowledge and archives. The process was quite standard: we divided into groups, in which we discussed ideas about what kind of App we wanted to develop. Among the many ideas, we voted the one that felt more doable, and then got re-divided into new groups, based on the ideas that had received more votes. Into these new groups, we developed the idea and prepared a business plan. All this was then put into a powerpoint presentation we used to pitch our project to potential investors. Even though it was the first time I worked with digital data sharing and working with digital objects, I think that, thanks to my preparation and the courses I follow at Polimoda, I had the right tools to approach the team work. Overall, I haven’t found the experience particularly new compared to what my school offers.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>E</strong>: Although it had been difficult, at the beginning, to cope with the intricate organisation of such a complex event, I learned interesting things and had an experience that I think will be useful in the future.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>As a fashion student, how do you think you might find useful products such as those developed by the various working groups?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>E</strong>: I believe that not all the projects developed by the groups are closely useful to the field of fashion; still, doing a lot of research is definitely helpful to have a more comfortable and convenient access to all the content of Europeana Fashion.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>Do you use digital platforms in your creative practice? If so, what and how you use them?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>R</strong>: I don’t, but it was indeed very interesting to get to know Europeana Fashion and its platform.</p>\n<p><strong>E</strong>: I use a lot especially Pinterest, for more targeted research; Tumblr, for inspiration, mood and to see a bit of trends. Then there are about thirty less-known websites that I found while looking for different ideas and I like to use. I also check fashion magazines’ websites, they are really interesting.</p>"

        title: 'The bias cut - a hint of elegance'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>A bias cut garment is essentially a dress whose fabric is cut diagonally. The result of this operation gives these garments a very peculiar look: they tend to cling to a woman’s curves with a delicate, graceful - and sensual - flow.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The bias-cut technique, still in use in contemporary pattern making, initially appeared in the work of the Parisian couturière Madeleine Vionnet in 1927, who used it to introduce a new silhouette that later came to characterise the 1930s. Inspired by Classical Greek fashion, Vionnet’s aim was to create feminine and romantic gowns to emphasize the contours of a woman’s body, in contrast with the popular designs of that time, which tended to hide them. The introduction of the bias cut signified a move away from the tubular fringed and beaded chemise dresses of the 1920s.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/m-2010-0069-jt-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8367\"><em>Bias-cut evening dress by Madeleine Vionnet. 1936. Courtesy of Les Arts Décoratifs, Paris. All rights reserved</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The period between the two great wars was characterized by austerity and restraint and the trend went for unadorned garments created by the manipulation of geometric forms such as square and quadrants. The technique developed by Madeleine Vionnet consisted of cutting the fabric at a 45 degree angle, instead of on the grain. This allowed the fabric to drape easily over the woman's body with a more elegant result. Her invention arrived after various experimentations with cutting  techniques, started in 1910. Vionnet was influenced in her approach by the Callot Soeurs, where she did her apprenticeship, and later by Jacques Doucet, where she learned how to incorporate classical techniques of garment construction involving minimal cutting.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/john_galliano_aw97_0003-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8366\"><em>Bias-cut slip dress by John Galliano.

However, Its sensuous glamour was firstly appreciated and adopted by Hollywood screen sirens as Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and society elite like the Duchess of Windsor. In 1933 Gilbert Adrian, head of costume at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, designed a satin bias-cut gown for Jean Harlow for 1933 film “Dinner at Eight”. It had a big success and popularized Vionnet’s new design for an American audience.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The invention of the bias cut is completely attributed to Madeleine Vionnet, also known as the “Queen of the bias cut”, and it is considered her greatest contribution to fashion. In 1990s John Galliano revamped the technique and and introduced the lingerie-inspired slip dress, popularized by Kate Moss and surprisingly worn by Lady Diana at the Met Ball in 1996, bringing a technical innovation invented years before into the realm of popular culture.</p>"

        title: 'Documenting TheArts+: Interview with IUAV and POLITECNICO DI MILANO students'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Today we present the second round of interviews to the students who took part to the workshop THEARTS+. Here are the answers Giulia Profeta from Politecnico di Milano and Eugenia Ioppolo from IUAV University of Venice gave us.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8378 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/cwkitd8wiaagn0k.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>THE ARTS+ Fair. Courtesy Europeana Foundation, CC BY-SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Europeana Fashion</strong>: <em>First and foremost, can you tell us something about yourself? How and why did you become involved with fashion?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>Giulia:</strong> Right after high school, I was very confused: I was thinking about engineering, economic, medicine, all scientific fields which were close to my training, but that did not really interest me or made me curious. Then, in between the proposals for study at Politecnico di Milano, I found the design courses, particularly for fashion and, although I was a bit scared, I decided to give it a try, and I don’t regret it. I got my BA in fashion design with specialization in knitwear and now, always at the Politecnico di Milano, I am attending a Master in Design for the fashion industry. The course has quite a wide span, from projects for sportswear brands such as Decathlon and SLAM, which are aimed at exploring new technologies, to communication skills and marketing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Eugenia:</strong> I do not know exactly how I came to study fashion: it has always been a field that has intrigued me. I enrolled in the degree 'Fashion and costume science\" at the Sapienza. There I fell in love for the very relationship between art and fashion, and how this relationship has developed through history and according to different personalities. Two years ago I joined the graduate program in \"Visual arts and fashion\" at IUAV of Venice. There I learned to juggle theoretical courses - which cover both the fashion that art - and practical workshops - sewing, design, knitwear. At the beginning of the second year I left Venice for an exchange at Stockholm University, where I followed some courses focused specifically on research. I'm currently writing my thesis.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>Tell us your experience: how was the workshop? What are the main features of the project developed by your group?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>G:</strong> We had three days of intensive work with specialists who shared with us their professional skills. The app developed by my group is called VISUALIZE and can be defined as a library that offers daily digital images from different categories of interest: the user can choose whether to deepen the proposed theme, leafing through the tunnel and save his or her favorite pictures, or change theme. Surely there are things that can be improved, but in its simplicity I personally find it very useful; in fact, thanks to the possibility to create folders, the user can save and move on to review the contents: this is very important for a designer or a creative, because it is easy to select images to realize mood boards, concept, or perhaps find inspiration for the prints.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>E:</strong> \_The workshop was quite challenging and interesting. The first day we were introduced to the Europeana project. We started developing some individual projects, related to the Europeana Fashion contents. Then six projects were selected, we got divided into groups and each group had to develop one project and create a business plan. Finally, we presented our projects in front of the board that was responsible of selecting the ‘winning’ idea. The project chosen was 'Fantasia', the one I have been working on with two other girls: Tetiana Baran and Victoria Dubinina. The work to which I took part was born as 'Dressformer', which was a free software that would allow to create new styles of clothes. But this project has since proved very weak and so we have continued to develop it and change it until we got to 'Fantasia'. Dedicated especially to illustrators and fashion designers and interior designers, the program was aimed at creating new patterns. Clients, with a search of images made available through Europeana, could decide which ones to use and could modify them - using a special design, a color, combining multiple images - to create unique patterns. All of this, while remaining connected, thus directly creating an online portfolio, and especially having the program always at disposal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>We are curious about your general impressions on the experience: did you like? Did you find this useful? You can use it in your path of personal study?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>G:</strong> My impression is definitely positive: it was set in a very professional manner, and although we had not experience as app designers, organizers and experts have been helpful in explaining very simply how this sector works. I found particularly useful and interesting the explanation about how to make a business plan, and the final confrontation with the board; I believe that a good designer should always keep in mind the market and the limits of his or her projects.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>E:</strong>\_In general I found the experience quite positive, even though a bit tiring: times to think of new and interesting ideas and turn them into projects were very tight. The part that I found most interesting, however difficult because I have no basis in economics, has been that relating to marketing. Thinking and creating a business plan of the project and above all making a good presentation allowed me to get involved and especially to acquire the knowledge that I missed. In particular, having to work in a group with other people who I did not know, with different paths of study and ways of thinking has enriched me so much.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>As a fashion student, how do you think you might find useful products such as those developed by the various working groups?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>G:</strong> I think that Fantasia, the winning project, could be a great starting point to experience digital content. It is very simple and I think it can be both useful for creatives and designers, and fun for the general public, since it can turn the experience into a game for users who are not working in the fashion industry.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>EF</strong>: <em>Do you use digital platforms in your creative practice? If so, what and how you use them?</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>G:</strong> I mainly use Pinterest for my research, and to create moodboards. I visit quite often online shopping sites of the brands that I believe may be the main competitors for the type of project I am working on, to ‘spy’ what the market offers and to differentiate myself. Since I believe that in the fashion communication is very important, I often visit a site called ISUU, which collects magazines and publications.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\"><strong>E:</strong> In my career as a fashion student, I used a lot databases like Pinterest and Tumblr for the visual research, especially for labs and to develop my collections. I also find very interesting the work done by Academia.edu, a website for researchers, dedicated to the sharing of scientific publications and essays.</p>"

        title: 'Put it on the Top: Fancy Hairstyles'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>In the 19th century, when it came to decoration, it was usual to place fancier things on top. </strong>\n\nTo wear an hairstyle, one has to perform a various set gestures, deciding the right position and inclination of the locks, checking the folds and the weaves, adjusting feathers, ribbons and other ornaments, and then secure it on the head, to be sure that the previous work doesn’t get spoiled. Since they are worn on the most prominent position of the body – the head - to hats, jewels or even combs are reserved special duties, among them, to stress or distress others attention. \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/e74ac8e593c7c423ef3c15948197289c.jpg\" alt=\"Engraving, dress Madame Mouton, hair Monsiour Victor, 1836. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8402\"><em>Engraving, evening dress by Madame Mouton, hairstyle by Monsiour Victor, 1836. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nInspired by the nostalgic atmosphere of the Romanticism, hairstyles for women in the beginning of the 19th century got influenced by the representations and sculptures of previous centuries. As the century moved on, hair and headwear were regulated according to the general requests of modesty, as their styles were essential in formal and public self-representation and governed by a strict and wide list of conventions. In fancy occasions, however, hair was place for experimentation that resulted in finely ornate constructions.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/3867c7a17297f2b5495f1096701e5393.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8403\"><em>Silver hair pin, Rome, 19th century. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nIn the 19th century, combing harstyles for special evenings involved the contribution of many masters, from coiffeurs, to milliners, jewel makers and plumassieres. In fact, to decorate their hairdos women used jewelled ribbons, feathers, beads and even fresh flowers, that put on their hair adjusted in various fashions, in curls, waves and locks. \n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/faa41298a98c444315a6c36efaf17573.jpg\" alt=\"Engraving, 'Le Bon Ton', dresses by Madame Sédille, hairstyle by Monsieur Nardin, 1837.

Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nThese changed styles and shapes as did the crinolines worn under the wide gowns of the period and have been as well documented in plates and engravings. In some of these plates were also reported, along with accurate representations of the most fashionable hairdos for every occasion, from day to evening, the names of the coiffures that realized them. As elaborate as dress and gowns, these hair arrangements were an even bolder piece, at the top of the silhouette, they could not do less than dominate it."

        title: 'Valentino Garavani'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Standing out for his elegant and charming creations, Valentino Garavani, known to all simply as Valentino, has established himself as one of the top designers of Italian couture.</strong></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Born in Voghera, Italy, in May 1932, Valentino debuted early in fashion; in fact, he started very young as apprentice for local designers, including his aunt Rosa. His formal training took place later in Paris, where after graduating at the École des Beaux-Arts and the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, he had his professional start in haute couture working for Jean Dessès and Guy Laroche. In 1959 Valentino came back to Rome and opened his fashion house one year later in partnership with Giancarlo Giammetti. The couple in business and in life modeled their business on the grand houses Valentino had seen in Paris and developed it into an internationally recognized brand.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/mude.m.0333.02-665x988.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8390\"><em>Red dress designed by Valentino. 1971. Courtesy of MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo. All rights reserved</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Valentino based his work on the desire to accentuate a woman’s sensuality with his clothes; his debut in the same year of the launch of Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” probably accelerated his success as women everywhere wished to emulate the film's style and its star Anita Ekberg. Since his early shows Valentino drew praise for his full-length romantic skirts and his style was immediately recognizable for dresses made in a particular shade of red, now known as \"Valentino red”, which still characterizes the label. In 1967 he was awarded with the prestigious Neiman Marcus Award for his ”no-colour” collection, in which he featured a palette of beige, white, and ivory hues.</p>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/valentino_css08_266.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8391\"><em>Model on catwalk for Valentino&#039;s final show at the Musée Rodin in Paris. Spring Summer 2008, Couture collection. Courtesy of Catwalkpictures. All rights reserved</em></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Since the very beginning Valentino’s unique and feminine designs have enchanted the women known for their allure and personal style. One of his first most prominent client was Jacqueline Kennedy, who in 1964 ordered six dresses in black and white to wear during the year following the assassination of her husband, President John F. Kennedy; in 1968 Valentino also designed the dress that she wore for the wedding with Aristotle Onassis. But she is not the only iconic personality the Valentino’s signature was linked to; the Maison has been chosen several times by Hollywood actresses and remains a staple in the wardrobe of socialites and other personalities.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">As a leading fashion designer who contributed to build the fashion system that we know today, Valentino worked with the most legendary models including Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer and Eva Herzigova, who took part to his final show at the Musée Rodin in Paris in 2008, cherishing the maestro before his retirement.</p>"

        title: 'A dress, a couturier and his muse'
        introduction: ''
        body: "The relationship between Audrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy is one of the greatest, enduring fashion pairings and friendships of all time which has generated the most iconic items of clothing in the history, looks that are still the epitome of style.\n\nIn 1954 Audrey Hepburn, who was working on the set of Sabrina, decided to go to the Paris atelier of master couturier Hubert de Givenchy to suggest a collaboration making her costumes for the film. Givenchy finally accepted to collaborate, contributing to create an iconic style for the character that made Audrey the highest-paid actress in the world. From this experience started a lifelong friendship based on mutual inspiration which reached the apogee of refined elegance. Las year Hubert de Givenchy has presented a book entitled “To Audrey with Love”, which contains designs for clothes he created for her on and off the screen.\n\n\n\nThe picture is a digital copy of a color photo in horizontal format with white frame. It represents actress Audrey Hepburn standing at the top of a staircase with the wrought iron railing and wearing a long red party costume designed by Givenchy. First appears the boa in ensemble with the dress. Audrey Hepburn worn the feather dress at the the Eighth Annual Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards on January 1989 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\n\n\n\nThe dress was originally designed by Givenchy for the actress Audrey Hepburn, who has been his muse since the 1960s. Here is the drawing of a woman wearing the very tight red evening dress. The body has neckline all made of feathers held in the center by a large bodice of red rhinestones. The outfit is completed by the red feather boa in ensemble."

        title: 'The Brides of Greece and Cyprus at the Leventis Municipal Museum'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>A new exhibition brings together over two centuries of bridal costumes from the collections of the Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia and of the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation of Nafplion.</strong>\n\nWith some exceptions, differences and peculiarities, marriage is an institution present in all cultures. Many are the elements that define every marriage tradition, making them vary from country to country, region to region, even town to town or family to family. Among these elements, the bridal gown stands out as the first and maybe as the most apparent. In a new exhibition, the Leventis Municipal Museum of Nicosia gathers the costumes of two countries history has both united and divided: Greece and Cyprus.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8409\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/nicosia-1967.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Nicosia, 1967. Bride: Fotini Michaelidou of the Leventis family. Fashion House: Lanvin, Paris. Collection: Foundation «Polycarpos Yiorkadjis».</em></p>\n\n‘Brides at the Leventis Museum: tradition and fashion in Greece and Cyprus’ features pieces from the collections of the Cypriot museum and the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation. The bridal gowns on show range from the late nineteenth century to 1974, covering over one hundred years of historical and social events, culminating with the year 1974, chosen by the curator of the exhibition as the year in which ‘the centuries-long order of things of the indigenous population was ruptured, dramatically and irrevocably changing the socio-economic structures’.\n\nDistinguishing between wedding gowns from the city and the village and between those of wealthy and less privileged brides, the exhibition focuses on the similarities and differences between the dresses of the Greek area and those from Cyprus, comparing their length, width and materials showing how they have been influenced not only by national and regional history and traditions, but also by movies and royal weddings.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8410\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/constantinopole-1899-2014.6.0161.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Constantinople,1898. Bride: Olga Kourteli. Collection: Peloponnesian Folkore Foundation.</em></p>\n\nThe exhibition explores the changes of the wedding gowns in relation to the events that characterised the two countries during the period, including two World Wars and the independence of Cyprus. The dresses show the changing approach to the very practice of marriage, such as the abandon of the use of traditional garments and the harmonisation with international fashion, or the introduction of the ‘white wedding dress’ after the one worn by Queen Victoria of England for her wedding with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8411\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/nicosia-1952.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Nicosia, 1952.

        title: 'Venus in Feathers: Boas of Paradise'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">There are materials that alone can give an aura of preciousness to the garments or accessories they are part of. This is true for beads and jewels, but also for fur and, above all, feathers, whose very nature is able to turn the ordinary into something astonishing.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8417\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/7069da5eeca2b11658969f02d0d493f3.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Lady with feather boa, drawing by Herbert Mocho, 1935 ca., Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin CC BY NC SA</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">There are two main types of feathers: contour and down. Contour feathers cover the wings and tail, while the down feathers, shorter, softer and fluffier, are to be found at the base of the contour feathers. The use of these precious materials in personal adornment really does cross times and cultures.The craze for feathers let to great damage to the animal world: the bittern, for example, was extinct due to the immense demand during the nineteenth-century, a destiny shared with the huia of New Zealand, which happened right at the beginning of twentieth\_century. Now national and international legislations are very\_strict, to protect species that are greatly reduced; also, advancements in technology made it possible to produce fake feathers and fur that look and feel real.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">When talking about feathers and fashion, it is not much a matter of need, but\_definitely a matter of appearance and spectacularity. The more exotic and flamboyant the feathers\_orating dresses and accessories, the better, above all in attires for parties and events. And, if many accessories, as hats and bags, have been decorated with feathers, one fashion object can be said to be the real celebration of the material and of all its potential: The feather boa.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8418\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/47181832197bfe2a6bc60e1f9f547fee.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Boa with ostrich feathers, 1971, Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">It is claimed that this 'long muffler made of feathers' was invented by Henri Bendel at the end of nineteenth century, when it was used above all by the ladies of high society for special occasions; even though there are accounts of similar items since the mid-1800, its popularity grew substantially during the 1920s, and then again in the 1970s, the late 1990s till the early 21st century. Interestingly, the fame of the boa is linked to the stage; boas have been used by dancers and entertainers in general to perform their acts: for instance, dancer Isadora Duncan and actress Mae West used it.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8419\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/56987727.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Christian Dior fashion show, A/W 1989/1990, photo Courtesy Paul van Riel, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">the appropriation of this object from some sectors of popular culture considerably changed its meaning and, therefore, the kind of ‘elegance’ it bears. \_ Some of the most mesmerising and 'campy’ personalities, such as David Bowie, Cher and Elton John used to wear boas as ‘props’ in their performances. It was - and still is - also a staple of cabaret and drag shows, which appropriate of the objects defining the look of the ’ladies’ turning them into caricatures.</p>"

        title: '''Duchess of Savoy'' Fancy Dress'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">For the last blogpost of the year, we decided to treat ourselves with the interesting story of an amazing ballgown picked from the Europeana Fashion archive.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8427\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/a69e996c8868c5ca415460b095f2306c.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Duchess of Savoy&#039; fancy dress, 1897, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">the fancy dress costume consists of an embroidered silver satin dress and lace ruff, and was made in England in 1897. The costume is embellished with pearls and silver strips; it has a low round neckline, large slashed and puffed sleeves with tight lower sleeve covered in pearls, jewelled girdle. The dress was given by Lady Victoria Wemyss, Duchess of Portland, to the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8429\" src=\"/files/fashion/2016-12/mw158543-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The Duchess of Portland dressed as the Duchess of Savoy, 1897, at the Duchess of Devonshire’s Diamond Jubilee Ball, © National Portrait Gallery, London, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Lady Victoria Wemyss was an intimate of the royal circle: her father, the sixth Duke of Portland, was Master of the Horse to Queen Victoria and her mother, the Duchess, later Mistress of the Robes to Queen Alexandra. Lady Victoria, probably the last surviving godchild of Queen Victoria, was for 57 years an Extra Woman of the Bedchamber to her cousin Queen Elizabeth.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Lady Victoria Wemyss was the subject of a photograph that is probably the earliest surviving commercial work by the photographer Alice Hughes. In the photograph, now part of the collection of the National Portrait Gallery, she is wearing the dress she donated to the Victoria and Albert museum. The dress - which ‘transformed’ Lady Victoria in the Duchess of Savoy - was worn in occasion of what has been called the ‘social event of the year’ 1897, the Duchess of Devonshire’s Diamond Jubilee Costume Ball.</p>\n\n<div></div>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: CELEBRITY'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Celebrity is not just a word individuating a ‘very important person’; its meaning can be stretched to signify ‘fame’ in its absolute form: something that can be either linked to people, but to objects as well. This is why this month we decided to turn our blog into a stage and showcase the celebrity stories that the archives and museums taking part into the Europeana Fashion project hold.\n<em></em></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8434\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/fp00175b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Marilyn Monroe wearing a Pucci ensemble, 1962, Courtesy Pucci Archive, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">One of the first places in which to spot the bond between fashion and celebrity is, indeed, the stage, be it of a theatre or a cinema; the prolific dialogue of costume designers, directors and of course actors is represented by the very costumes used on screen, which not only define the features of the character played, but also stand as the output of the intellectual collaboration between many different professionals. Fashion archives and museums are full of these testimonies, whose stories are just waiting to be unveiled, revealed, rediscovered.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Celebrities - meaning VIPs - are sometimes built into a real\_‘brand’: in endorsing some designers over others, they chose to be part of \_aesthetic, and in\_return influence the image and appeal of the\_producs they use and display. Some fashion objects are material memories of iconic couples - the celebrity and the designer - made famous by the histories they tell, and these histories are to be found not only in recent times, but can be traced back to at least the seventeenth century; some others are designed as homages to ideal muses, ratifying the aura of fame and importance of a person not only in the present, but above all for the future.\n<em></em></p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8435\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/fd96c31aeaf62f50541fb468ab1c2212.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Costume design for Willy Walden as Josephine Baker by Anthony Holland, 1962, Courtesy Theatercollectie Bijzondere Collecties UvA, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The value of objects that are at the centre of these connections is directly linked to the people they evoke, and their potential to generate desire is magnified by their being the ‘proof’ of these liaisons. The power of the relationship between fashion and celebrity stands in the mutual ability of infuse something or someone with immortality; and it is this endurance of meaning intrinsic in objects that makes their stories everlasting.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "The Gemeentemuseum den Haag is the new curator of the Europeana Fashion Tumblr. For this January, the museum has selected from the Europeana Fashion portal a variety of images to explore, focus and enhance the themes of the exhibition ‘Hubert de Givenchy: To Audrey With Love’, on show at the museum until the 26th March 2017.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8454\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/15781467_1314587728602761_5178535659954303216_n.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Ensemble worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961, a famous design by Hubert de Givenchy. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAudrey Hepburn and Hubert de Givenchy are both considered two legends. The former, the actress that enchanted the world in movies that have soon become cults, such as ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ and ‘Roman Holidays’; the latter, a couturier whose creations have amazed many great women for almost half a century. Among those women, it is Audrey Hepburn herself that stands out: both a muse and a dear friend to Hubert de Givenchy, the name and fame of the British actress is forever bound to the sublime work of the couturier.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8455\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/54f72e00d448d6fb832f5c886feddbcf.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>An evening dress in bright green silk matelassé brocade, ca. 1955, designed by Hubert de Givenchy. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nWhile the exhibition is mainly dedicated to the career of the French designer - who founded his maison in Paris 1952 and quit it only in 1995 - it also highlights the strong relationship between Monsieur Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn, begun in 1953 and endured for the rest of the actress’ life. The exhibitions includes some garments selected by the designer himself and never before shown, and also sketches, drawings, photos and film stills; through the pieces on show,\_the display explores the creative collaboration between the two and the ways each other influenced their reciprocal image and style. In addition, a gallery of the museum is entirely dedicated to the humanitarian work conducted by Audrey Hepburn as a Goodwill Ambassador for Unicef.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8456\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/d0c42b1e80fa2c44da55415cad339eb0-665x580.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Wool coat with a beautiful shape, Hubert de Givenchy, 1957.

        title: 'Some Like It Print: Marilyn Monroe in Pucci'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">From about 1960, Marilyn Monroe seemed to favour designs created by Emilio Pucci; many photographs, portraying the actress in both public and private moments, show how the encounter between the creation of the marquis with the body - and soul - of the iconic actress defined the image of the celebrity in some of her most unforgettable looks.\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8461\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/fp0017502b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Marilyn Monroe wearing an orange blouse by Pucci, Courtesy Pucci Archive, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">A personal property auction, held by Christie’s New York in 1999, is a prove of the liaison of the actress with Pucci and, more generally, with his ‘idea’ of fashion. In the catalogue, a section accounts for her Pucci clothes, featuring seventeen dresses, nine blouses, two tailleurs and other accessories, such as handbags. Marilyn can be seen wearing many of these items in the beautiful photos taken by George Barris during one of her last photo shoots in July 1962. It’s appropriate then, she is said to be buried in her favorite leaf green shift Pucci dress.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The reason why Marilyn loved Pucci’s designs appears as quite understandable: the very character of Pucci designs fits with Marilyn multifaceted personality and life. Her many complexities and inner contrasts - her flamboyant femininity, her great sensitivity, her simplicity and the ‘diva factor’ - seem to go alongside the variety of designs produced by the Marquis Emilio Pucci: from kaleidoscopic and recognisable prints, to more simple and comfortable jersey ensembles. Marilyn seemed to prefer the monochromes, in the tones of green, pink, orange and blue, above all for her everyday. Prints and patterns are showcased in more ‘public’ moments and photo shootings, such as the shot by photographer George Barris in 1962.\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8462\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/fp0017501b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Marilyn Monroe wearing a blouse by Pucci with the &#039;Specchi&#039; print, Courtesy Pucci Archive, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Some items hold significance since are linked to some of the most wide known moments of the public life of the actress. For example, a green blouse was worn by Marilyn while rehearsing for the JFK Birthday Gala, where she performed her infamous version of “Happy Birthday Mr. President”, at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962. It is said that this is also the blouse the actress used during the final weekend of her life, at the Cal-Neva Lodge in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8468\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/rs00273b-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Specchio della Stampa - Article featuring Pucci designs, Courtesy Pucci Archive, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">It is also said that Marilyn wanted to be buried in Pucci; she is in fact said to be buried in a leaf green Pucci dress. The story became almost a myth, which inspired an exhibition hold at Moore College of Art &amp; Design, Philadelphia in 2009: a mixed-media showcase by artist Devon Dikeou, which reflected on the image of Marilyn, considering also the ‘objects’ that contributed to the construction of the icon.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/2011.0071.00-665x997.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8474\"><em>‘Cage Suit’, designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, s/s 1989. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe ‘cage suit’ is composed by a tailored jacket and a pair of trousers. Its name refers to the particular construction of the jacket, which resembles the structure of a nineteenth century corset. It was designed by French fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier for his Spring/Summer 1989 womenswear collection.\n\nThe jacket is in black cotton, with a notched collar and a breast pocket on the left. The front and back of the jacket feature symmetrical cutaway boned panels; the fastening, placed on the front, consists of five cloth-covered buttons, while the back of the jacket is laced as a corset. The trousers, in the same fabric of the jacket, are pleated and present side pockets and a high waistband with belt loops.\n\nDefined the ‘enfant terrible’ of French fashion, Jean-Paul Gaultier presented his first ready-to-wear collection in Paris in 1976. Ever since the designer has featured on his catwalks witty and daring creations that include the sarong skirt for men and the iconic underwear worn over the clothes, which entered the realm of mass popular culture when Madonna sported one of the pieces - the now infamous cone bra - during her ‘Blond Ambition’ tour in 1990. The suit presented here makes no exception; in it the designer has blended the masculine lines of the male dress with a hyper-sexualized allusion to a female corset.\n\nThe object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=#dataProviders%3DModemuseum%20Hasselt\">Modemuseum Hasselt</a> Archive.

        title: 'Off the Stage, On the Catwalk: Celebrities at Fashion Shows'
        introduction: ''
        body: "It is now a custom for fashion designers and brands to invite celebrities to attend their show. May they be actors, singers or social media stars, sometimes their participation is as much awaited by the press and fans as the fashion show itself. Although it is usual to see them attending the shows, less it is to see them hit the catwalk.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8480\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/vivienne_westwood_aw09_120-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pamela Anderson on the runway of Vivienne Westwood a/w 2009 fashion show, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAs powerful vehicles for desire, celebrities are frequently used by fashion designer, and fashion itself. Muses or stars in ads and campaigns, some celebrities are so intertwined with the practice of certain designers that it is \_sometimes hard to think about them without having in mind the kind of fashion they endorse. It is therefore not surprising that some designers have celebrities to walk their runways, to embody the spirit of their latest collection or\_their aesthetic.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8479\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/dsquared2_ss08_001.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Rihanna on the runway of Dsquared2 s/s 2008 fashion show, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn 1996, Tupac Shakur appeared wearing a golden suit on the runway of the Versace, walking by his then girlfriend and followed by two bodyguards. Earlier in 1993, Madonna walked arm in arm with Jean Paul Gaultier at the finale of his fashion show. Another ‘queen of pop’, Rihanna, modelled in 2008 for Dsquared2. Although the use of celebrities in fashion shows may seem rooted in celebrity culture that permeates certain brands, their use has been frequent even in those whose ethics seem more remissive and less mainstream.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8478\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/ann_demeulemeester_maw06_024.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Patti Smith on the runway of Ann Demeulemeester men&#039;s a/w 2006 fashion show, photo by Etienne Tordoir. Courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn 1987, in fact, painter Michael Basquiat had been a model for Comme des Garçons men’s collection; Ann Demeulemeester men’s 2006 show saw the participation of Patti Smith, the designer’s muse and friend. More outrageously, in the spirit of the brand, Pamela Anderson hit three times the catwalk of Vivienne Westwood’s a/w 2009 collection.\n\nAs unnatural as it may at times look, the presence of celebrities on catwalks may serve as catalyser and their presence on the runway is as powerful as their presence on stage. This is probably why celebrities turn into models: modelling is indeed a kind of performance, something not that far from their own art."

        title: 'CELEBRITY (and) OBJECTS'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">The history of fashion accounts for a number of emblematic accessories dedicated to celebrities; they often seem invested of some sort of magical power to retain the popularity of the person their name refers to - and in some cases exceed it.\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Numerous are the example of objects whose creation was inspired by, or dedicated to celebrities; their stories do not cease to fascinate, enhancing their appeal as objects of everlasting desire. Not only objects, but also prints represent the relationship between brands and famous muses; this is the case of the ‘Flora’ print, made by Gucci especially for Grace Kelly during the 1960s.\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8488  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/m-2009-0335-jt.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>one of the many reinterpretations of the Jackie O model designed by Gucci, 1975, Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Not always did these objects originate as an homage to the celebrity whose name they bear today; most times in fact, it was history itself that caused them to get renamed. This is the case for some of the most well-known bags, such as the infamous Kelly by Hermes, the Jackie O by Gucci and the Lady D by Dior. The Kelly bag originated at the end of nineteenth century as a large bag used for holding a saddle. It was thanks to Alfred Hitchcock and costume designer Edith Head that Grace Kelly was ‘introduced’ to the bag, and immediately fell in love with it. was photographed using the handbag to shield her growing belly from the paparazzi. When a photograph of the princess covering her belly was published on Life magazine in 1956, the bag instantly became known as the Kelly bag; however, it officially changed its name only in 1977.\nThe 'Jackie O’'s original name was ‘Constance', but the American first lady seemed to be so passionate about this bag, the fashion house officially dedicated the model to her. The Lady D was also renamed after the visit of Princess Diana to France in 1995. The bag was a present from Bernadette Chirac who wanted to gift the princess with a typically french design: she contacted the maison Dior and chose the Chouchou model, named which changed immediately after the princess of Wales was seen with the bag at the inauguration of the Cézanne exhibition at the Grand Palais.\n\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Most of these iconic objects have been reinterpreted over and over again, in their design and materials, but always respecting their original shape, what made them iconic. When thinking about iconic accessories, one that comes straight to mind is the 'Rainbow sandal', created by Salvatore Ferragamo. Ferragamo himself used to say that the sandal was created for the actress Judy Garland, right after her appearance in the movie ‘The Wizard of Oz’, where she sings the emblematic song ‘Over The Rainbow’. The shoe, whose multicoloured wedge made it unforgettable, has been reinterpreted in 1988 by the Spanish fashion house ‘Menkes', almost sticking accurately to the original design.\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8490  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/sc0000939_f2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Rainbow&#039; Sandal, designed by Salvatore Ferragamo, 1938-1939, Courtesy Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8489 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/sc0012486_f.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>reinterpretation of the Ferragamo &#039;Rainbow&#039; sandal (from 1939) made by the Spanish Fashion House &#039;Menkes&#039; in 1988, Courtesy Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "The name - and fame - of some designers is sometimes bound to that of their prestigious clients. Sir Norman Hartnell is one of them. In his more than fifty years of activity, the British designer had the honour to dress remarkable clients, but it is his his link to the British Royal family what made him gain a prominent role in the history of Western fashion.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8506\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/cc7f86d9cf92e1e5637670ac857f3a9b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dress designed by Norman Hartnell. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nBefore beginning his career as a fashion designer opening a shop in London’s Mayfair in 1923, Sir Norman Hartnell had been the costume designer for the Footlights Dramatic Club of the University of Cambridge. It is this favour for the theatrical that characterised his own work, legible on his richly embroidered creations.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8507\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/b7dea86d4029ef4110c1fbb0bb1bb6d2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dress designed by Norman Hartnell, produced by Berketex, ca.1942 - 1955. © Norman Hartnell for Berketex, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nA prolific designer, Norman Hartnell has worked on women's daywear, eveningwear and also homeware products, including a line that he designed for the British government utility campaign.

        title: 'Maria Callas: from Diva to Icon'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Maria Callas is internationally recognised as one of the most important ‘Divas'. Her popularity was motivated by her enormous talent, but surely her fashion choices, both on and off stage, weighed in her consecration as unforgettable icon.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8528\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/mg3000.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Stage costume for Luigi Cherubini&#039;s Medea, designed by Lucien Coutaud, Courtesy Fondazione Cerratelli, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">In her practice as opera singer, Maria Callas was indeed unique: an incredible interpreter, an innovator in her use of the voice, able to give unprecedented depth to the roles she took on. Her consecration on stage was enhanced by the costumes she wore, which were designed to suit her persona and immediately communicate with the audience. The costumes exemplified the encounter between the personality of the singer and the plot of the story on the body of callas, whose proverbial ability to convey emotions through her performance was in some way supported by the designs she wore. Clothes were something that she used as tools to get into the character and then made integral to the performance, accounting for them in the design of movements and gestures she designed to sew each role on herself.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8529\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/1987.6.0093.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Theatrical costume by Yannis Tsarouchis for Maria Callas in Medea, performed in Dallas, Texas, Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Her incredible talent was counterparted by a deep insecurity, which led her to be rather clumsy in her everyday life. Her appearance was not until 1951, when she made an encounter that changed her life. It was in that year that, in the Milanese home of director Arturo Toscanini, Maria Callas met\_Elvira Leonardi Bouyeure, better known as Biki. Biki was an established italian dressmaker at the time, whose atelier in Milan was a point of encounter for intellectuals and socialites. Biki not only did design all of Callas' outfits, but actually re-styled the whole look of the singer, starting the transformation of Maria Callas from opera singer to international icon.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8530\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/00000489n.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Cocktail ensemble in wool and silk designed by Biki, 1950s, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The relationship between Biki and Callas was well described by\_Hélène Blignaut in\_<em>La scala di vetro</em>\_(<em>L'escalier de Verre)</em>, the biography of the designer.\_It is said that Biki used to provide the singer with written indications on how to compose each outfit, which were complete of accessories as hats and shoes. If Biki has contributed to the making of the ‘Diva’ Callas, the singer, in being one of the first ’testimonial’ of a brand, carried Biki’s design outside of Italy, establishing the name and fame of the designer across different places and, we can say today, across time as well.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Focus: ‘Orgueil’ Perfume by Lucien Lelong, 1946'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8538\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/fc72b8bda79ddc4c5967b86e926381bf.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Orgueil&#039; perfume by Lucien Lelong, 1946, Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet CC BY NC ND</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The perfume is a creation by French couturier Lucien Lelong. It was commercialised right after the end of WW2, and its name ‘orgueil’, meaning ‘pride‘ in French, was an homage to the endurance of the French population during the hard times of the war. The photo was taken by photographer Erik Leonard Holmén in 1947.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The perfume is described as an aldehydic fruity floral chypre fragrance with soft floral and spicy oriental undertones; in its bouquet, it is possible to distinguish plum, peach and sweet pea as top notes; carnation, tuberose, jasmine, iris, rose, cloves, nutmeg as middle notes; oak moss, sandalwood, ambergris and leather as base notes.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Lucien Lelong was born in Paris as the son of the owner of a textile shop. He studied at the Hautes Etudes de Commerciales and opened his fashion house in Paris in the early 1910s. Although he did not design his creations himself, he was able to gather a group of talented designers and support them in their first steps into the couture world: two people part of his network were, for example, Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Lucien Lelong is credited with having done a great deal to preserve the couture industry in France during the difficult years of the Occupation, and this perfume stands as the celebration of the victory of perseverance in their democracy.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html?inpSearch=Stiftelsen+Nordiska+museet#dataProviders%3DStiftelsen%20Nordiska%20museet\">Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet</a> Archive.</p>"

        title: 'Piero Tosi: costume designer, icon-maker'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Piero Tosi is one of the most celebrated Italian costume designer. With his creations not only he greatly contributed to the image of the Golden Age of Italian cinema, developing costumes for movies whose style is one of the main features of their enduring fame.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8550  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/00000408n.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Costume designed by Piero Tosi and worn by Isabelle Huppert in La Signora delle Camelie, by Mauro Bolognini, 1981, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Piero Tosi, born in 1927 in Sesto Fiorentino, near Florence, studied with painter Ottone Rosai. It was legendary director Luchino Visconti who gave him his first job in 1951, when Tosi moved from Florence to Rome to pursue a career in the movie industry. The collaboration with Visconti was one of the most fruitful of his career; together, they made: <em>Bellissima, Senso, The Leopard, The Stranger, Death in Venice, Ludwig</em> and <em>The Innocent</em>. Tosi did not stop to cinema; he also worked for the opera and theatre. In participating to this rich season for the movie industry - the season, we could argue, where icons were made primarily by their look on the screen - Tosi dressed actors as Romi Schneider, Laura Antonelli, Silvana\_Mangano, Anna Magnani. He also dressed Maria Callas for her role of <em>Medea</em>in the eponymous movie shot by Pier Paolo Pasolini in 1969.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8552  \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/00001543n.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Costume designed by Piero Tosi and worn by Maria Callas in Medea, by Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1969, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">His talent consisted in materially building the vision each director had of the\_personages and their character. These ‘constructions’, imagined by the designer, were made in collaboration with Sartoria Tirelli, one of the most famous tailor shop in Rome, where most of the costumes for Cinecittà were produced.\nTosi has been nominated for the\_Academy Award for Costume Design five times:\_<em>The Leopard, Death in Venice, Ludwig, La Cage aux Folles, La Traviata.\_</em>He won both the\_David di Donatello for Best Costumes (<em>La storia vera della signora delle Camelie and</em>\_<em>Storia di una capinera)\_</em>and the\_BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design twice, as well as the 50th Anniversary David in 2006. In 2013 he was awarded an\_Academy Honorary Award For his personal achievements in costume design over 75 years of activity.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\" wp-image-8551 \" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/00000428n.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Costume designed by Piero Tosi and worn by Laura Antonelli in Il malato immaginario, by Tonino Cervi, 1979, Courtesy Galleria del Costume di Palazzo Pitti, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Today his designs are preserved in archives as material traces of a not so distant past we can hardly picture. His practice is historically located in a period in which the practice of costume design was harder, given the different access to information, both visual and conceptual, from the one we imagine today. His costumes bear the effort of representing a place, an era or a feeling and propose it to a public not only to make them dream, but also to tell them something relevant about the story and its context.</p>"

        title: 'Nudie Cohn: Embroidering the Cowboys'
        introduction: ''
        body: "‘Nudie suits’ are as legendary as the celebrities who wore them. They are heavily customised bespoke suit, embroidered with rhinestones or studs in Western motifs, and bear the name of their creator, Nudie Cohn, an Ukranian-born tailor who bedazzled America with his bold creations.\n\nCaravans and desert landscapes, bulls, cowboys riding horses in rodeos, poppies, marijuana, pheasants, eagles and other American birds are just some of the motifs ornating the designs by Nudie Cohn. An ode to the ‘Western’ American culture and its landmarks, these decorations found place on the famous suits, but also in dresses, suits, boots and hats that have been favoured by Country performers of the last century.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8564\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/f2580820bfdb60668f7ec0c7f9359d30.jpg\" alt=\"Shirt, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-75. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.\"><em>Shirt, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-75. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nBorn Nuta Kotlyarenko in 1902, Nudie got his later name when he moved to America with his family at the age of eleven to escape the Czarist pogroms. After working as shoe shiner in front of the Palace Theatre in Broadway, he became an itinerant boxer; it was during one of his travels that Nudie met his wife Helen Barbara Kruger, later Bobbie. Just married, they opened their first store in Manhattan in 1934. ‘Nudie's for the Ladies’ sold lingerie and G-strings for starlets and burlesque dancers.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8565\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/d2abdf0ce44118a4eb5541993dfad2ff.jpg\" alt=\"Suit, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-80. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.\"><em>Suit, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-80. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nBut it was when Nudie and his wife moved to Hollywood that their business and above all his exuberant designs took off. Convinced that performers needed something more flamboyant to wear, Nudie designed the first embellished jackets in 1947. As the story goes, he made it after convincing the young and far from famous country musician Tex Williams to buy him a sewing machine. He had his first suits worn by another country star, Lefty Frizzel and after him, the success followed. Elvis Presley, Elton John, Dolly Parton, Roy Rogers, Cher, Gram Parsons were just some of the celebrities who attended his ‘Nudie's of Hollywood’ and later ‘Nudie's Rodeo Tailors’ shops.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8563\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/73b3abd1415926b627cd7a495ae3c788-665x498.jpg\" alt=\"Hat, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-80. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.\"><em>Hat, designed by Nudie Cohn, ca. 1970-80. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe activity run until 1994, with the help of Nudie’s wife and granddaughter after his death in 1984. A flamboyant character himself, the tailor used to drive customized promotional vehicles, Pontiacs decorated with the outrageous ornaments that he used to feature in his suits: bull’s horns, guns, saddles and silver dollar coins. Two of these cars have been collected by Belgian entertainer Bobbejaan Schoepen, who also owned a collections of suits and other garments by Cohn that has been put on show at MoMu in Antwerp from October 2011 to February 2012. The exhibition, curated by fashion historian Mari MacKenzie and designer R. Cerimagic, entitled ‘Dreamsuits. Designs by Nudie Cohn, the Rodeo Tailor’ was the first in Europe to explore the work of the tailor who embodied the style of the country music."

        title: 'Face It: Celebrities on Clothes'
        introduction: ''
        body: "Before being creators, fashion designer are collectors. In their search for novelty and inspirations, they gather references and then dissect their findings, in search of what they need for their collection, purging them from the superfluous and un-interesting. In this process, not evens bodies are safe, as they get dismembered and severed, and sometimes just the heads live out to their designs.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8572\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/7be692c0005fa598db3c0347dfbd5f6d.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Skirt with a portrait of Michael Jackson, designed by Bernhard Willhelm, 2000. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn art, it was Andy Warhol who, in 1962, realized the famous diptych of silkscreens featuring the face of American diva Marilyn Monroe. The diptych, as part of a wider series of celebrities’ portraits, become itself iconic in respect to the work of the artist, and of Pop art and culture; it is still considered today an influential art piece for its multiplicity of meanings.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8573\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/2008.6.0233.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan on a poster dress designed by Harry Gordon - Poster Dresses Ltd, 1967.

Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIt is reasonable to say that the same complexity of meanings and intentions invests the use of celebrities faces in fashion as well. Although sometimes just the features of certain celebrities,\_whether used as a print or as a decoration, can make fans sob and sigh, celebrities’ faces on clothes envision or enhance the concept of the collection and sometimes, they serve to embody the ideals of the brand.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8574\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/16114481_1325735927487941_214578326900991600_n.jpg\" alt=\"'Kiki de Montparnasse', dress designed by Jean Paul Gaultier, f/w 1999-2000.

Courtesy MUDE - Museu do Design e da Moda, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nMore than collaborations, icons of the past and the latest stars are used to illustrate the narrative of the collections. Sometimes out of their contexts, these images gain new values or are used in antithetic circumstances to create new meanings or question others. Other times, they are tributes to a particular muse and in their most extreme and outspoken way they are shaped or constructed to resemble their most visible and memorable feature - their image."

        title: 'André Perugia: Patenting Celebrity'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Andre Perugia is remembered as one of the first shoe designer and maker whose name reached celebrity. This is probably due to his revolutionary approach to shoe design, in between technical discipline and art-making, and also to the importance he gave to the idea of authorship, which led him to patent most of his 'inventions'.</p>\n<p><em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8578\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/38dbb2cc9fb0886a36beddf9face4255.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sandals designed by Andre Perugia, 1938 ca., Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet CC BY NC ND</em></p></em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">After having learned the technical skills from his father, Perugia set up his own boutiques, the first in Nice, his hometown, and then in Paris. His abilities as a maker developed working in an aircraft factory during the First World War. The precision needed in that sector opened up his mind to the possibility to apply ‘science’ to shoemaking; this made him halfway between a maker, an engineer and, of course, a master <em>createur</em>. During his long career, spanning from the 1920s to the 1960s,\_Perugia collaborated with the designers who ‘made’ history of fashion, from Paul Poiret to Elsa Schiaparelli and Christian Dior; he was also a collector of art, and many of his designs are <em>hommages</em> to his favourite artists, from Braques to Picasso. His last collaboration was with Charles Jourdan – he acted as consultant between 1960 and 1966 - to whom Perugia left his personal archive.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Perugia was a pioneer in giving value to his design by patenting his models. He is one of the first designers reflecting on his value as maker and above all inventor,\_reclaiming the authenticity of his products and establishing \_them as symbols of craft, quality, value and identity.</p>\n<p><em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8579\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-01/00704.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Sandal by Andre Perugia, Courtesy Rossimoda Shoe Museum, CC BY NC ND</em></p></em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Apart from being a celebrity himself, Perugia also used other celebrities as inspirations to give form to his designs: in 1928, he turned Josephine Baker's turban into the famous 'Turban Sandal'. The link with celebrity culture is exeplified by the very title of his autobiography 'From Eve to Rita Heyworth', where he collects a number of psychological portraits, claiming that one way to understand women was to study their feet.</p>"

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: BOUNDARIES'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">In fashion, as in many other disciplines, the expression ‘pushing the boundaries’ is often used to indicate the strive for newness necessary to allow its very existence. Everyone seems so preoccupied with what is beyond the fence, that the liminal spaces are often overseen. This month we will try to prove how incredibly interesting it is, instead, to linger on the edges.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8585\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/c0940390ca0700f14740f54fc54926b3.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Pelerine made of cotton and feathers from peacock and domestic fowl, Britain, 1830s, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Using the idea of boundaries as leitmotiv, this month we will explore the many ways in which clothes and accessories can inform our understanding of limits. Boundaries are a tough issue to tackle, maybe because the very concept of boundary seem to call for its direct opposites: resistance, rejection, revolution. looking at the material hold in the Europeana Fashion collection, it is possible to see how objects often function as tools to break the boundaries; some other times, though, objects are the ones tracing the limits and setting the limits.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Historically, fashion has been used by the political power to set the boundaries between different strata of society, and also to sedate anxiety and safeguard morality. However, fashion is not only affected by boundaries in a passive way; it often uses boundaries to delimitate its area of influence, its reign; many times it is the very weapon that can break the barriers.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8586\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/a1b56dde6066fa7c547b86116a302884.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Detail of the embroidered edge of a Skirt, Crete, Greece, 18th century, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The global dimension in which materials an people interact today has affected the very definition of boundaries. digital data are accessible virtually everywhere and every time, forcing us to reconsider the given notions of space, time and distances. This had and continues to have an impact on fashion, and also in fashion heritage: the very idea of archive is dematerialised, connections are fostered, and accessibility has become a key term - and a more obtainable goal - in many realms of culture.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Boundaries as a visual statement; boundaries as positive constraints; boundaries as security, order, discipline; boundaries as limit; boundaries as freedom; boundaries as no-boundaries. listing some of the themes that will be addressed, it is clear how boundaries are at the same time also their contrary. We are interested in understanding how fashion responds to this dichotomy, using what the archives hold to tell these stories.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<strong>As this February we are going to investigate the ‘boundaries’ of fashion, Mude – Museu do Design e da Moda takes over the Europeana Fashion Tumblr with the pictures from its exhibition ‘Abaixo as fronteiras. Vivam o Design e as Artes’, that was on display at MACE – Museu de Arte Contemporânea de Elvas and at MUDE in Lisbon from 21st May to the 7th September 2016.</strong>\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8597\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/pesce_calapez_mude-c2-a9albertomayer2016-665x444.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The exhibition ‘Abaixo as fronteiras. Vivam o Design e as Artes</em></p>\n\nFashion is a complex and kaleidoscopic phenomenon. We can study it from a wide scope of perspectives. We can choose the historical, cultural and sociological point of view, managing, through them, to characterize the collective identity of each period. We can also analyze it from an artistic approach, focusing on aesthetics and techniques, or underline its communicative value. Through fashion, we can see the change of mentalities or understand the different ways how each society defined beauty and conceived the body. In the exhibition <strong>Abaixo as fronteiras. Vivam o Design e as Artes</strong> (No Borders! Long live Design and Arts), curated by Barbara Coutinho, the approach was to put in dialogue the creative universe of fashion and design with contemporary art, from 1980’s to nowadays, to underline influences and highlight affinities, overlappings or correlations, challenging their traditional disciplinary boundaries, increasingly undefined.\n\nThe partnership between MACE – Museu de Arte Contemporânea de Elvas. Coleção António Cachola (museum of Portuguese contemporary art) and MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda, Coleção Francisco Capelo turned possible to explore different dialogues between fashion and furniture, jewellery, painting, photography, engraving, sculpture, installation, video, and drawing, relating different scales and materials.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8598\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/andre_ataide_mude-c2-a9luisa-ferreira02016-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"The exhibition ‘Abaixo as fronteiras.

The pictures will be accompanied by short texts, which will give further insights on the themes explored in the exhibition.\n\nDon’t miss a post on the <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a>."

The show presented the first couture collection designed for the French maison\_by Alexander McQueen, who was recently appointed creative director.\n\nAlexander McQueen followed John Galliano, who served as creative director of the House since 1995 and who moved on to design for Dior. Differently from his predecessor, who looked to the past to design dreamy collections, Alexander McQueen focused on tailoring and construction to debut with his modern vision of Givenchy. Entitled ‘Search for the Golden Fleece’, the collection featured pieces in gold and white that explored the classical inspirations beyond the ‘Grecian’ Givenchy logo.\n\nThe show took place in the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, for the occasion decorated with white drapes bearing the Givenchy signs and models passed through a door above whose arch sat a winged Marcus Schenkenberg. The picture showcased here was taken by the Belgian photographer Etienne Tordoir and it presents one of the most dramatic looks:\_a coat-cape and a stuffed bird worn as a head ornament. The show also featured decorated bustiers and dresseses decorated with vines motifs, feather dresses and bodysuits and the popular gold body-armour.\n\nAlthough this debut collection became infamous for the bad response of the press and critics, the English designer remained at the head of the fashion house until March 2001.\n\nThe object is part of Catwalkpictures Archive.

        title: 'Setting Social Boundaries: Sumptuary Laws'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Appearance has for ages been the object of anxieties that led institution to try and regulate it in order to maintain a defined social order. One of the ways in which this kind of control has been exercised was trough the emanation of laws limiting the possibility to use fashion in order to perform an identity different from the one prescribed by one's position in society.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8608\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/m-2010-0417-jt.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Fragment of Silk Brocade, 17th century, Courtesy Les Arts Decoratifs, All Rights Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The term ‘sumptuary’ derives from the latin <em>sumptus</em>, which refers to cost, or to the act of spending. Sumptuary laws were made to clearly define hierarchies in society, above all to safeguard morality and control the social body in its clear definition in classes. Given that appearance was charged of great values, insofar it was the first and more immediate way in which people presented their self to the world, most of these laws had to do with preventing people to 'self-fashion’ themselves in ways that did not conform to their rank, class or social status.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sumptuary laws have been originally used by the clergy, whose hierarchy was visually and materially defined by the vestments. Then, secular institutions nobility used them to limit the growing power of the bourgeoisie, preventing the new, dynamic class to imitate or, worse, to provoke the emergence of new fashions. Some social groups were targeted with the precise request to dress some badges in order to be recognisable: this is the case, for instance, of prostitutes, but also of people belonging to precise religious beliefs.</p>\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8609\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/bdff10e30e97118795a80fd64ce589f2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Chausuble made of two different velvets and embroidered in silver thread, probably 15th century, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">These kind of laws were usually very detailed, indicating what colours, materials and styles were prescribed for each class, age and sex. Precious materials such as gold and silks were the most targeted. The Tudor dynasty in England is remembered to have enforced many sumptuary laws, even though these were often ignored.\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sumptuary laws have been also used to limit importations in favour of the promotion of national productions; some historians have argued that even in recent times attempts to make a state self-sufficient - as happened in Fascist Italy with Autarchic policies - could be read as attempt to create a sense of deep nationhood by ultimately controlling the surface - the\_‘look’ -\_of the people.</p>"

        title: 'From (Selv)edge to (Selv)edge'
        introduction: ''
        body: "Fabric is essential to fashion, whether its shape or dimension, it often delimits the material area in which designers and tailors can experiment to resolve their ideas. In this way, the boundaries of fabric are translated into the boundaries of fashion itself, whose definition is then from selvedge to selvedge.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/ebe1444baf1e1e0f0cc8144e36237638-665x732.jpg\" alt=\"Checkered fabric in linen, 1950-1970. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8617\"><em>Checkered fabric in linen, 1950-1970. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nWhile the length of a fabric can virtually be extended to the wish of its producer, its width is subdued to the width of the loom used to produce it. Although the world’s widest loom ever made – created by Jürgens GmbH &amp; Co. of Emsdetten in May 2005 - measures 33,15 m (108.75 ft), the usual width of fabrics revolves around 0,70 and 3 meters.\n\nSelvedge is the name used to indicate its extremes. selvedges run parallel to warp of the fabric and are usually created by the looping back of the weft thread with the main function to prevent the fabric to fray or unravel, finishing the fabric as it exits from the loom. To do this, the weft threads turn and go back on themselves while they are whirled around the warp. Since they are created along with the fabric, their style and size depends on the way the fabric is produced and on the type of loom involved.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8616\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/8478f72a0036c4c88ddf7db5779b6836.jpg\" alt=\"Dress fabric of glazed brocaded worsted, probably made in Norwich, 1760-1770. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.\"><em>Dress fabric of glazed brocaded worsted, probably made in Norwich, 1760-1770. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY.</em></p>\n\nStiff and sound, they can come plain or similar to the rest of the fabric, but otherwise they can be customised using thread in fancy colours. Sometimes instead, when jacquard looms or prints are involved, it is use to write on the selvedge the information of the fabric, as its commercial name, composition, or the name of its producer.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8618\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/c876308bcb2f44b63604ddb190972b0a.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Dress designed by Dries van Noten, s/s 2010. Photo Stephen Matteus for MoMu. Courtesy MoMu - ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nBeing stiffer and differing the texture of the rest of the fabric, they are usually discarded. Sometimes however, because of their peculiarities, they are used in design as embellishment or as structural resolutions. As they are made to prevent the fabric to fray, they don’t need any finishing, and their colours variations are intelligently used in other designs as hems decorations. Indeed, even if they limit the fabric, they don’t limit creativity."

The dress is made of two layers: a basis in sheer, pale pink fabric and a net of shimmering material. The outfit belongs to Isaac Mizrahi's Autumn-Winter 1997-1998 Womenswear collection, shown in New York.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Isaac Mizrahi is an American fashion designer trained at Parsons School of Design. He comes from a Syrian Jewish family, and it was his family to favour his entering into the fashion world: at the age of 15, he received a sewing machine from his father. He started his eponymous label in 1987 in New York, where the collection was presented in a trunk show held by Bergdoorf Goodman. Apart for his feminine and refined designs, chosen by many celebrities for public events, Mizrahi is also known for his interest in media and performance: he took part to several TV programmes throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and collaborated with many institution as costume designer. The making of his 1994 collection was turned into a documentary, called 'unzipped'.</p>"

Not only it is significant of tastes and personal preferences, but it can easily become charged with cultural relevance, when used in a precise historical and geographical context.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8634\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/7341fb95f83a9eae7d21c1ac68e52bf8.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Silk Bonnet, 1933-34, Courtesy Centraal Museum, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Fashion can indeed set the boundaries of identity though colours. Historically, some colours were reserved to some strata of society, being used as disclaimer to associate a person to a particular class; this is the case of gold, whose use was restrained by sumptuary laws in the early modern period, given its ideal link to wealth and high status; same can be said of purple, which in the Tudor period in England was especially reserved to kings, queens and some members of the aristocracy. Colours are charged of different meanings - some times, almost opposites - in different cultures: for instance, while black is accounted as the colour of mourning in Europe since the Roman Empire, in Asia the colour used by people participating in mourning is white.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8635\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/c9b3ebe717d37e6e59d9123ee6261863.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Baby shoes in pink and white vichy, Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Sometimes the meaning of colours can shift through times, originating tropes and myths that are hard to die out, even though there are no apparent reasons for their existence. Maybe the most widespread of the ‘myths’ surrounding colours is the binary that wants pink associated with girls and blue with boys. While white was the most practical and neutral colour of children clothing during the nineteenth century, it was at the beginning of twentieth century that pastel colours for babies were introduced. Museums and archives that feature children clothing from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in their collections are useful to challenge the trope that associates colours to genders. In fact, interestingly enough, in 1918 an account on the american newspaper\_<em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>\_stated that 'The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.' this demonstrates that the ’trope’ as we know it today - pink for girls and blue for boys - is quite recent: it started being used and marketed during the 1940s. It got periodically reinforced ever since, setting a 'contemporary' boundary that is now heavily criticised: a sign of a changing sensibility within society, that might change again the perception future generations will have of these colours - and of their power to create categories.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "Conventions in dress are sometimes boundaries that cannot be easily crossed. This is valid for fabrics as well, whose material qualities sometimes limit their use for one or another occasion; while some fabrics command their use in some proper settings, one in particular, the toile, even rules over the definition of product and prototype.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8648\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/3d33e2d0b0eced18b0d4b47f9272f8ca-665x886.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype of an ensemble designed by Frank Govers.

Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nPlain-weave and unbleached, the toile consists of a linen or cotton muslin, and comes in different weights. Generally inexpensive, in ateliers the toile is the fabric used to create prototypes and mock-ups, its plain qualities enabling experimentation both in draping and tailoring.\n\nIts use is so popular that the name toile – although coming from French and meaning cloth or canvas – has been extended to indicate the mock-up or prototype of the final creation, usually made with this fabric. It has been in use since the nineteenth century and even though it implicates a further passage in the design line, it is essential to assure the final product a perfect fit or for the fabric to drape in the best way.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8647\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/800e479281d565b0ccc54c53b41aec44-665x817.jpg\" alt=\"Design patterns, made of toile. Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet, CC BY NC ND.\"><em>Design patterns, made of toile. Courtesy Stiftelsen Nordiska Museet, CC BY NC ND.</em></p>\n\nToile – the fabric - is for convention bounded to the atelier, its use limited to produce the mock-ups and generally disregarded for the creation of actual garments and accessories; \_even though, even though it is durable and resistant.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8646\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/comme_des_garcons_ss13_0423.jpg\" alt=\"Comme des Garçons, s/s 2013 fashion show. Photo Etienne Tordoir, courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.\"><em>Comme des Garçons, s/s 2013 fashion show. Photo Etienne Tordoir, courtesy Catwalkpictures, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nSome designers, however, have overturned this norm, showing the fascinating aspects and details of prototyping and of its materials, lingering on the subtle edge between finished and unfinished. Martin Margiela in particular delved with this theme in his ‘Semi Couture’, s/s 1997 and a/w 1998-99 collections, with coats made out of pattern-paper or vests resembling the bodice of atelier’s dummies; John Galliano showed for Dior a/w 2004-05 couture collection, an ‘unfinished’ couture gown, exposing nude silk and paddings, baring the ingenuous act of draping and designing,\_making something spectacular of the 'demure' material; more recently\_Rei Kawakubo sent out on the catwalk of Comme des Garçons s/s 2013 fashion show elaborate silhouettes in canvas and twill,\_showing how experimentations of this kind are able to push the boundaries of established fashion conventions."

The two outfits belong to Giorgio Armani's 1979 collection, shown in Florence in occasion of Pitti Immagine 15.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Florence has been one of the Italian capitals of fashion at least since 1951, when the first collective fashion show was organised by Giovanni Battista Giorgini and held in the Sala Bianca. in 1954 was founded the Centro di Firenze per la Moda Italiana (CFMI) to promote Italian fashion, but it was only from the 1970s that Palazzo Pitti became the stage for showcasing the many aspects of Italian fashion to international markets. Pitti Uomo was founded in 1972, with the precise intent of promoting clothing and accessories for men. It was in this context that Giorgio Armani showed his first collections, using the catwalk to communicate his idea of menswear, and preceding what he would later do in Milan with his womenswear collections.</p>"

It is a creation of the Maison Christian Dior from the 1970s.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The outfit is characterised by a streamlined cut, enriched by flat decorations and tridimensional applications that make the whole ensemble a unique example of high manufacture.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The ensemble probably belongs to one of the collections produced in the 1970 by Dior, in the years in which designer Marc Bohan was at the helm of the maison. Marc Bohan was followed Yves Saint Laurent as head of the design team in 1958, and kept his position till 1989. His design aesthetic was dominated by an attention to balance and measure, both in cut and decorations, and a rejection of the excesses in favour of simplicity and elegant sobriety.\nThe fascination with foreign traditions was strongly felt by Bohan; the motif of the embroidery, drawing elegant lines that intertwine to create meanders, leaves and flowers, seems to recall some oriental patterns, together with the fastening of the jacket that reminds a chinese knot.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of MUDE Archive.

        title: 'Exhibition Archaeology: ''Stretching Boundaries, Fashion and Beyond'''
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">One of the most interesting features of fashion is its geographical specificity, which leads to the privileged ability fashion has to gather and represent national\_identities. In 2005, the exhibition\_<em>Stretching Boundaries, Fashion and Beyond\_</em>presented in Paris and New York, had exactly this aim: showcase the peculiarities and characters of the contemporary Dutch fashions scene.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8664\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/b9ffa6096309413a51884be31b25795e.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Stretching Boundaries. Fashion and Beyond at Gallery Passage du Désir, Paris, May 2005, Photo Courtesy ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">Opened on\_3rd May 2005 at\_the gallery Passage du Désir, and repurposed in New York the following September at the Diane Von Furstenberg Gallery, the exhibition was curated by Angelique Westerhof;\_it featured the work of an array of different professionals:Bas Kosters, Cees Krijnen, Corné Gabriels, Esther Loonen, Fleur van Maarschalkerwaart, Freudenthal Verhagen, Jan Taminiau, Jeroen van Tuyl, Martine van 't Hul, Niels Klavers, Oscar Suleyman, Peter Jeroense, Piet Paris, Rob Ponsen, Wojtek Dziedzic. Each of them with a specific aesthetic, their inner diversity\_really stretched the boundaries on the very definition of dutch fashion, reflecting on its various forms and key features.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The exhibition took the form of a path in which video installations, paintings, 3D art projects, graphic interventions were organised in order to represent, in an heterogeneous but coherent way, the very meaning of contemporary dutch fashion, from the view of its makers. Fashion is both the subject and the object of this experimental exploration, and each designer was asked to produce something that could speak of their own take on dress, most of the times going beyond the boundaries of fashion itself.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The decision to install the exhibition first in paris and then in New York was another way of crossing the boundaries, this time geographical ones, by proposing to an international audience the national specificities of Dutch fashion. This aligned with the agenda of the organiser of the exhibition, which was one of the outputs of The Dutch Touch.\_The Dutch Touch is a campaign active since 2001, whose role is to showcase Dutch fashion within the international context of fairs and trade shows. It is a project of the Dutch Fashion Foundation, an organisation working on the construction and dissemination of the economic and cultural role of Dutch fashion on a national and international level. The foundation\_strengthens\_the network of Dutch fashion, gathering designers and other creatives, as artists, photographers, image makers and graphic designers.</p>"

        title: 'Fashion and Design – Technology'
        introduction: ''
        body: "Fashion and design share a common language, owing much to each other progress. Although their products are usually different - in terms of use, material and destination - they ways the one influences the other are many and disparate. Technology, in particular, serves as an instrument for both design and fashion; the improvements each field makes turn out to be new instruments in the hands of the other.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8673\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/tumblr_olss93ckfj1s0n7o6o1_1280-1-665x993.jpg\" alt=\"Dress, Gianni Versace, ca. 1990; Vermelha Chair, Fernando Campana and Humberto Campana, 1993. Photo by Alberto Mayer, all rights reserved. \"><em>Dress, Gianni Versace, ca. 1990; Vermelha Chair, Fernando Campana and Humberto Campana, 1993. Photo by Alberto Mayer, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nAs it is clear in the pictures that compose MUDE – Museu do Design e da Moda curation of Europeana Fashion Tumblr, the boundaries among art, design and fashion are not strict. They are instead extremely blurred whether is the value and role we recognize to each of these practices, as these mainly work and proceed tightly connected one to each other, referencing each of the other disciplines and exploring common thematises.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8674\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/222.jpg\" alt=\"Ensemble, Hussein Chalayan, 2000. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.\"><em>Ensemble, Hussein Chalayan, 2000. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that there are designers – in fashion and design – who not only cross the boundaries experimenting both in one and on the other field, but whose work focuses on lingering on this blurred boundary. However, these designers are not the only one that delve with this theme in their work.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8670\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/4d20dc807488973843478add6fbf5c40.jpg\" alt=\"Dress, Iris van Herpen, 2001. Courtesy Centraal Museum, all rights reserved.\"><em>Dress, Iris van Herpen, 2001. Courtesy Centraal Museum, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nIn fact, common to the practice of design and fashion is new technologies, in its wider sense. Designers draw both from its past and its ultimate innovations, adapting them to their best use, could this be producing a lace or building door handle. Laser-cutting, cast moulding and 3D printing, for instance, are some of the practices that in recent times are borrowed by the practices of design and fashion.\n\nSharing technology, they also share the issues relate to it and their aims, sometimes, overlap. Reproducibility, democratisation and, more crucially, sustainability are issues that fashion and design are called to face. And while they seem to proceed parallel to each other, the ideas they develop and the problems they step into, both contribute to their research for new – and fashionable – solutions."

On the foreground, a model sports one of the designer’s most evocative creations, a bodysuit shaped as the silhouettes of two black cats, whose whiskers ties to make it tighter.\n\nThe Viennese designer Helmut Lang is acclaimed as one of the ultimate fashion innovator and, although he left fashion in 2005 to pursue a career in visual arts, his original designs are sought after by archivists and stylists. He is still a reference for contemporary fashion designers, as his work still resonates in fashion today, even in the ways fashion is presented. In 1989, he rejected the traditional structure of the fashion show and introduced his ‘Séance de Travail’, working sessions in which he presented his latest designs, both for womenswear and menswear. When he moved his studio across the ocean to New York in 1998, he also presented his a/w 1998-99 collection on the Internet, and the following season he moved his s/s 1999 show ahead of the European schedule, eventually shifting the fashion calendar."

        title: 'Defying Boundaries: exhibition ''Across Japan'' at Modemuseum Hasselt'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">The encounter between East and West is usually that of two traditions whose boundaries are clearly set. The exhibition Across Japan, at Modemuseum Hasselt from March 3rd 2016, is a fascinating way to show how these boundaries, sharply defined only in appearance, are indeed blurred.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mceTemp\" style=\"text-align: center\"><dl><dt><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2017/02/27/defying-boundaries-exhibition-across-japan-at-modemuseum-hassel/acrossjapan12/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8702\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8702\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/acrossjapan121.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"1230\" /></a></dt><dd>Maison Margiela Artisanal by John Galliano, Fall 2015 Couture. Photo: Paolo Roversi for Vogue Italia, September 2011 © Paolo Roversi</dd></dl></div>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The exhibition explores the influences Japan in general, its materials, techniques and images, and also Japanese designers have had on the western - and global - fashion system. This due to a history of connections and relationships, commercial as much as aesthetic and technological, but also due to the fascination Japanese culture has had on western culture. Focusing on imagery, lines, inspirations but also actual interventions Japanese designers have made into the west, as the wave of designers who relocated in Paris in the 1970s and 1980s, the exhibition deploys as a chronological exploration that individuates five themes: <em>Japonism, Wabi Sabi, Ma, Gi-jutsu and Kawaii</em>. the first section gives the historical context, explaining the trade that linked Japan to the West in the second half of nineteenth century, through the Great Exhibitions till the influence kimonos had on the straight lines of designs by Vionnet and Balenciaga, among others; Wabi Sabi refers to the Japanese concept of beauty as ‘imperfect, incomplete, impermanent’, embraced by designers such as Martin Margiela; Ma deals with the relationship between the body and dress; Gi-Jutsu explores materials and techniques, and their crossovers in the work of both western and Japanese designers; finally Kawaii is presented in its influence on contemporary designs, which bear cute and erotic meanings altogether.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8693\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-02/51f21ddb4311b31ea4f5c8af7526d97e1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Issey Miyake and Tim Hawkinson, pleated dress in ecru with grey print.

        title: 'THE EDITOR''S COLUMN: TIME'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"“justify”\">Fashion is naturally drawn to look forward, but the links with the past, its own as much as\_‘History’\_in a wider perspective, generates a tension in the relationship fashion itself has with time. This month’s theme looks at how fashion negotiates its position between past and future, gravitating around the idea of time as it appears from the items contained in museum collections and archives.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8716\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/0adc6104e8d1e8b3997f1ae25641befc.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>&#039;Witching Hour&#039;, hat by Stephen Jones, 1999, Courtesy ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">As constraint and\_challenge, but also as catalyst of design practices and the reflections they originate, Time affects fashion 'from the micro to the macro' so to speak. In general - and abstract - terms, fashion has been deemed as the expression of its time, its fluctuations articulating the succession of epochs, sentiments and values. The personal relationship people have with fashion takes time into account: life is signalled by occasions requiring a reflection on how we appear; and even one single day can itself be divided into moments asking for different vestamentary\_choices.</p>\n\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8717\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/pff6.049.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>“The collections: A journey through space and time”, permanent collection, Courtesy Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">If fashion can be defined ephemeral, establishing an interesting relationship with time, dresses and other fashion items populating archives and collections deal with another kind of temporality: longer, for sure, and\_in some cases aiming at eternity.\_Historian and critic Elizabeth Wilson opens her book Adorned in dreams, a cornerstone for the study of fashion, talking about the feelings of alienation that assails the visitor in a museum displaying fashion, where the clothes, first belonged and 'lived' by a body, are instead 'mounted' on a mannequin, while still retaining signs of its previous life. The stories of fashion inscribed in objects are made of the material traces that can be detected on their surface and appearance. the\_‘look’ of these objects tells the tale of the past, of experiences lived through the objects, testifying the transient nature not only of styles, but of life itself.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The interesting movement between eternity and change can be detected directly on the items contained in the collection, and in the ways in which they have been reconsidered and used in exhibitions, revitalising them and reactivating their potential to speak.</p>"

Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.\"><em>France Andrevie, Spring-Summer 1979. Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</em></p>\n\nThe picture represents some models at France Andrevie s/s 1979 fashion show, standing aside an alarm clock and a young girl dressed up as Alice, the protagonist of ‘Alice's Adventures in Wonderland’, a 1865 novel by Lewis Carroll.\n\nThe models themselves look like modern interpretations of characters of the novel. One wears a golden ensemble composed of tank top and trousers, under a black and yellow striped skirt, while the one wears a metallic red leotard and two gloves in the same material, on the head a bonnet with two rabbit ears. The large alarm clock immediately evokes the character of the White Rabbit that, always in a hurry, frets through the first chapters of the novel not to miss his appointment with the Queen of Hearts. Whit this cheerful collection, the French designer France Andrevie, addressed not only the ludic aspects of fashion but also a crucial theme: its perpetual rush towards the future."

Courtesy Rossimoda Shoe Museum, CC BY NC ND.\"><em>Shoe designed by Emanuel Ungaro, 1980s. Courtesy Rossimoda Shoe Museum, CC BY NC ND.</em></p>\n\nThe object is an ankle boot in red suede with seam details and a leather ribbon. It was designed by Emanuel Ungaro in the 1980s.\n\nThe right side of the upper part is shell-shaped, each fold drawn by a stitching in the same colour of the suede. The folds gather towards a cut-out detail, where a leather ribbon sneaks out. The boot stands on a cone heel.\n\nEmanuel Ungaro started his career in the 1965, when he set up his own couture house in Paris. Despite what he had learnt as an assistant of Cristobal Balenciaga, his first collection lacked evening gowns, insisting instead on the fresher, youthful look that pervaded fashion during the decade. The designer remained at the head of his Maison for over four decades, developing throughout his work an elaborate language expressed also through the characteristic fabrics produced in collaboration with his muse and friend Sonja Knapp. During the Eighties, the designer used to borrow from an exotic imagery to decorate his sexy and baroque silhouettes, realized with lavish floral fabrics.\n\nThe object is part of Rossimoda Archive.

The exhibition, retracing the many ways in which Japanese and western fashion contaminate since the 17th century, focuses mainly on the fascinating innovations brought in fashion by Japanese avant-garde designers and their younger counterparts in fashion over the last three decades, and how their unique aesthetics still resonate in the work of western fashion designers. Each picture of the curation will be enriched by comments that will provide interesting insights on the object displayed.\n\nWhile the exhibition will be on show at the museum until September 3rd 2017, don’t miss a post of the Europeana Fashion Tumblr curation, that will advance throughout this March on our Tumblr."

        introduction: ''
        body: "While it is commonly considered a whim today to frequently change outfit during the day, this convention is rooted in modernism, which produced a new conception of time and the ways it was organized.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8748\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/cb70e5487249010cf655796f006a8309-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"Accessories, drawing by Petra Fiedler, ca. 1928. Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.\"><em>Accessories, drawing by Petra Fiedler, ca. 1928. Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nThe time of fashion is mainly conceived as linear. Designers’ collections develop season by season, a rapid look over the history of fashion may be intended as a timeline of every period’s silhouettes. While fashion historians and critics have brought now a wide range of substantial theories to discuss this linearity, a first and practical example of a circular time of fashion can be found on the revolution of dress changes during the day that happened from the time of the Industrialization and progressed through modernism.\n\nThe impact of Industrialization on the mid-18th century fashion reflected the changes it brought in society. Not only did the industrial production lower the costs of dress production, but also the shift from country labour to industrial labour had an impact on the way people dealt with time. Although who lived in the city was already keen on the modalities court and ceremonies articulated the day, the shifts of factory work favoured the conception of clock time instead of natural time for a wider part of the population.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8747\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/efad044a8aff72f1b7e17b5c48bc0ad5-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"Women in evening dress, illustration by Léonard, ca. 1930.

Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nAs time started to be scanned by the clock, new rituals in dress emerged and appropriate dresses for appropriate occasion started to be produced and worn, differentiating models, lengths and ensembles throughout the day. If the practice of changing dress according to the time of the day was already diffused, it was with the modernist concern about time rationalisation that fashion and clock time became bound, as shown in fashion and society magazine of the time. These publications showcased progressive silhouettes in line for the right hour of the day, demonstrating that the clock influenced the way the day was lived, and fashions and garments were designed accordingly."

        title: 'Watches: Time as Material Luxury'
        introduction: ''
        body: "To understand time was one of the first necessity experienced by human beings. This led to the invention of devices that could help keeping track of time passing: watches. Both as ‘public’ objects and personal belongings, watches soon became artefacts that gathered scientific expertise and high-manufacture skill.\r\n\r\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8768\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/e6f9ca1bf829ce87aa822e5c4b2ae291.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Watch with a case and dial of painted enamel and gilt brass, England, ca.1640, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\nThe pocket watch developed in sixteenth century as mostly ‘masculine’ object, and consisted in a timepiece made wearable thanks to a chain. The round shape - the most common - is the reason why they were also called Nuremberg eggs, and worn around the neck. It is said that it was Charles II of England who introduced the trend of wearing the watch in the pocket of waistcoats: this led to changes in size and, above all, styles.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8774\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/884f9b88d5707816ea019dd3698a89952.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Chain watch with hook and compass, 1850-1900, Courtesy ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\r\n\r\nThe pocket watch, or fob watch, a stable of the gentlemen’s attire, was substituted by the wristwatch, which developed after the so-called trench watch, a transitional object used by the military in World War I. Interestingly, watches to be worn on the wrist before the 20th century were mostly used by women. The oldest surviving was in fact made in 1806 and belonged o\_Joséphine de Beauharnais. Other sources account for a watch\_made for Countess Koscowicz of Hungary by the Swiss watch manufacturer Patek Philippe in 1868 as the first\_artefact\_of this kind.\r\n\r\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8769\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/64365006270d3d61259f6ffe38c7bb6e-1.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Golden wristwatch, 1867, Courtesy Amsterdam Museum CC</em></p>\r\n\r\nEven though their invention came ‘out of necessity’, today we tend to link watches - above all, the most decorated, precious and iconic in design - to an idea of luxury; this maybe because, in our speeded up reality, time itself\_might be a luxury."

        title: 'Faire sa Toilette – Time for Dressing Up'
        introduction: ''
        body: "The term ‘toilet’ holds in itself many temporalities, from the fast and rapid, to the long and elaborate. It indicates the process of dressing or grooming oneself, a morning ritual that is, and has been, both a private and public.\n\nIn origin, the word indicated, namely, a ‘little cloth’ that was placed over someone shoulders during the process of hairdressing to protect the dress from the eventual moistures and powders used for combing. During the seventeenth century its meaning changed to include, for metonymy, the process of grooming and dressing at the dressing table.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8779\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/306aea4d09ce5259c01de0d263cdcfaf-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"'Modethorheit: Les Dames vivent en Paris', caricature, Johann Martin Will, 1775-76.

Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nOnly in the 18th century however an audience started to be involved in the ‘toilet’, which before was a rather intimate daily practice to be done 'behind closed doors'. In fact, while its early stages, including grooming and sponge-bathing, were spent privately with a maid, the later stages, that involved hairdressing, picking clothes and writing letters, close friends and guest were invited to assist.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8780\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/95b7769892d9ef3819ea4de22d4d8a74-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"'Le bon genre, No. 39:  Les Titus et les Cache-folies', caricature, Pierre de la Mésangère, 1812. Courtesy Anna Russ, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.\"><em>&#039;Le bon genre, No. 39: Les Titus et les Cache-folies&#039;, caricature, Pierre de la Mésangère, 1812. Courtesy Anna Russ, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nThese ‘toilet-calls’, as they were named, exposed the intricacies and magnificence of this ritual that was as fascinating as its participants were wealthy. It captured the imagination of writers and painters, who documented these ceremonies and described them in their extravagant details, as did the poet Alexander Pope in ‘The Rape of the Lock’. The toilet, however, was not an exclusive practice for women. Men, and in particular dandies and their precursors, the ‘macaroni’, spent many hours at the toilet for their dressing up; George Brummel, for instance, used to invite the Prince Regent, the future King George IV, at his morning ritual.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8778\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/7572d6566c562074f3c0cba1a35cfcb7-665x739.jpg\" alt=\"'Progress of the Toilet.

Courtesy Dietmar Katz, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nIn the representation of the toilet, the objects, the gestures and time served as props to construct the grandiosity of these moments spent at dressing up, and of the women and men taking part in it. Time indeed, was what toilets were about. What the lengthy toilet really represented was, in fact, instead of one’s vanity, one’s possibility and the will to take time, and spend it, in the 'fundamentally ephemeral' act of dressing and grooming oneself."

        introduction: ''
        body: "From the 21st April, Centro Culturale Santa Maria della Pietà in Cremona, Italy, will host ‘Gianfranco Ferré. Moda, un racconto nei disegni’, an exhibition dedicated to the sketches and drawings by Italian fashion designer Gianfranco Ferré.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8791\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/2_g.ferr-c3-a9_am-ai-1988-dis.jpg\" alt=\"Silk taffeta and silk velvet cape with topstitching.

With his sapient use of sartorial construction, materials and decoration, he introduced\_a new sensibility in fashion, frequently represented by his iconic creations.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8790\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/8_g.ferr-c3-a9_p-c3-a0p-ai-1990-dis-582x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Silk grisaille trench coat.

Pencil, fine black felt-tip pen, colored felt-tip pen on construction paper. Courtesy Fondazione Gianfranco Ferré, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe exhibition ‘Gianfranco Ferré. Moda, un racconto nei disegni’ is\_curated by Rita Airaghi, Director of the Fondazione Gianfranco Ferré, and was developed with the collaboration of the Municipality of Cremona. While including some of the garments he designed, it will focus on his hand-signed sketches and drawings, one of the most fascinating artefacts of the designer's creative process. Quoting Gianfranco Ferré himself: “For me drawing means jotting down on paper a spontaneous idea which I can then analyse, check, verify and finetune, reducing the basics to precise concise lines set on diagonals and parallels within geometric shapes and figures... as both a fashion designer and an architect I see fashion as a form of design...”; either elaborate and detailed or more essential and instinctual, the selection of over one hundred sketches on show in Cremona tells the history of the vision, passions and ideals of the poetic fashion creator, as well as unveiling to the public a part of his unique creative process.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8792\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/4_g.ferr-c3-a9_p-c3-a0p-pe-1990-dis-597x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Printed silk and lurex caftan with embroideries and sequin appliqués.

Pencil, fine black felt-tip pen, pastel crayon, gold powder on construction paper. Courtesy Fondazione Gianfranco Ferré, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nWhile fixing on paper the necessary information to turn the fashion designer’s ideas into material creations, these drawings are also greatly evocative artworks; they show the idea of beauty, harmony and style that the designer developed and improved during his prolific career both at his own brand and as the creative director of the Maison Christian Dior, where he worked from 1989 to 1997. More than instruments, these drawings are a statement of Gianfranco Ferré dedication to fashion design, an important working method and an indispensable key to comprehend the work of Gianfranco Ferré both in its materiality and his aesthetics.\n\nThe exhibition will be open until the 18th June."

Courtesy Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, CC BY NC SA.</em></p>\n\nThe picture shows a model posing in an nineteenth century interior, with three women, probably clients, looking carefully at the model while sitting on chairs. The model, standing straight, is wearing a knee-long redingote with fur collar, cuffs and lower hem. Underneath the coat, is an an ankle-lenght skirt, worn over black tights and low-heeled shoes. On the head, the model is sporting a flat hat with wide straight brims.\n\nDifferently from nowadays nearly public shows, whose grandeur is usually streamed on the Internet, in their early stages fashion shows were private events that involved few guests. In-house models were dressed in the maison's creations and sent on a proper stage, with potential clients as audience. The clients would chose their favourite looks, to later discuss the eventual details for the finalization of their new silhouettes. In this original photography by 'Atlantic', the clients are assisting at the fashion show of designer Johanna Marbach in Berlin. Marbach was a designer active in the first two decades of the twentieth century, who also designed the costumes for films of Carl Froelich and William Dieterle."

In the same year, the Marquis had set up a sport, casual and leisure clothing company.\_His passion for sport translated into the development of collections focused on leisure activities, such as sky and, indeed 'scooter racing', directed to an active woman, projected to the future. This interests led, in 1957, to the design of the 'Vespa' dress, and to a collaboration with Piaggio, the Italian manufacturer of the iconic scooter, at the end of the 1970s.</p>\n<p align=\"“justify”\">The object is part of Emilio Pucci Archive.

        title: 'Exhibition Archaeology: Spectres. When Fashion Turns Back'
        introduction: ''
        body: "Fashion spans many temporalities. While being projected to the future, it constantly looks back to the past to which it strongly relates. As explained by Walter Benjamin with the image of the ‘tiger’s leap’, fashion interacts with history in many and different ways. Back in 2004, curator and exhibition maker Judith Clark explored this haunting relationship in the exhibition ‘Spectres. When Fashion Turns Back’.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8825\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/f8a843802f785e393ee45340a24a0018-665x442.jpg\" alt=\"The exhibition 'Malign Museus.

When Fashion Turns Back&#039; at MoMu - Fashion Museum of the Province of Antwerp, photo by Tim Stoops, 2004. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe exhibition was first installed at MoMu, in Antwerp, from September 2004 to January 2005 with the title ‘Malign Muses. When Fashion Turns Back’ and later at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, from February to May 2005. As explained in the catalogue of the exhibition, it took shape after a two years long conversation between Clark and the fashion theorist Caroline Evans, author of the seminal text ‘Fashion at the Edge’, whose suggestion and ideas served as an inspiration for the real-life devices that characterised the set of the exhibition.\n\nThe display recalled the dark atmosphere of the Victorian circuses and freak shows; it used devices such as toys, carousels and lantern slides tricks to evocate the ghastly bound between fashion and history and to articulate the complicate and introspective sections of the exhibition, in which the creations of contemporary designers where shown alongside historical pieces in suggestive juxtapositions.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8826\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/d15e4257f90cecc433bfd00c37c85852-665x443.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The exhibition &#039;Malign Museus. When Fashion Turns Back&#039; at MoMu - Fashion Museum of the Province of Antwerp, photo by Tim Stoops, 2004. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nThe sections of the exhibition were: ‘Reappearances: Getting Things Back’, ‘Nostalgia’, ‘Locking In and Out’, ‘Phantasmagoria: The Amazing Lost and Found’, ‘Remixing It: The Past in Pieces’, ‘A New Distress’ and, in Antwerp, ‘The Garden of Forking Paths’. They explored the modalities through which fashion turns to the past through the results of these various operations. If history serves as a source of inspiration, it also represents a bound to be broken or ignored to move forward, an instrument at the designers’ disposal for the invention of new stories with clothes.\n\n<p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-large wp-image-8827\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/f8f2d1d95ccc0a774eb28284f84db9fe-665x382.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>The exhibition &#039;Malign Museus. When Fashion Turns Back&#039; at MoMu - Fashion Museum of the Province of Antwerp, photo by Tim Stoops, 2004. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</em></p>\n\nContemporary designers, such as Junya Watanabe, Dries van Noten, Viktor and Rolf, Simon Thorogood, Hussein Chalayan, Shelley Fox and Rei Kawakbo, featured in the exhibition; their creations were\_put in dialogue with those of earlier couturiers, such as Schiaparelli, Madame Grés, Jean Dessès and Dior, and previous century costumes, to highlight the references and similarities: all the elements contributing to a discourse that draws back and puts forward the figures inhabiting past and present, to tell new, compelling stories."

        title: 'Temporal Meditations: Hussein Chalayan at Pitti Immagine 64'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p align=\"justify\">For the 64th edition of Pitti Immagine Uomo, Hussein Chalayan showed his first men’s collection, developed in collaboration with Pitti Immagine. The designer decided to mark his debut in menswear presenting Temporal Meditation, the first movie he wrote and directed.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2017/03/27/temporal-meditations-hussein-chalayan-at-pitti-immagine-64/pu2003005r00016/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8838\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8838 aligncenter\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/pu2003005r00016.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" /></a></p>\n\n<em><div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl><dd>Temporal Meditations, Hussein Chalayan, Pitti Uomo 64, 2003, photo by Giovanni Giannoni, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Right Reserved</dd></dl></div></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The movie premiered on 19th June 2003 at Teatro della Pergola in Florence. It was shot in Athens, and saw as protagonists the photographer Mark Segal and Sophie Hill, a Greek actress. Even though it was the first time that Chalayan presented himself as film director, he was not new to experimentations that could combine fashion and art. He was well known for blending art and fashion in his own practice, working both within the fashion system and in art galleries.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The movie is 20-minute long; the action takes place in an airport, a liminal non-place where the boundaries between different countries seems to be negates, and time suspended. the narrative is constructed by many themes: identity, memory, time. Chalayan used genetic anthropology to draw the ethnic paths that crossed Cyprus, his homeland, within space and time. This interest in human geography and migration is very dear to the designer, who constantly refers back to the idea of ‘homeland’ as constant reference characterising his fashion and artistic production.</p>\n\n\n<em><p class='image-with-caption'><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8839\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/pu2003005r00015.jpg\" alt=\"\"><em>Temporal Meditations, Hussein Chalayan, Pitti Uomo 64, 2003, photo by Giovanni Giannoni, Courtesy Pitti Immagine, All Right Reserved</em></p></em>\n<p align=\"justify\">The press release of the event states: \"Historical discourse has exemplified a view of time as sequential and progressive which has been embalmed through the use of the printed word. Garments can be viewed as an archaeological talisman which morphs slivers of past and present, ultimately and perhaps paradoxically becoming a frozen fragment of its own archaeological quest\".</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The movie proposes to consider clothes as symbols holding together different chronological dimensions; In their being material memories of an undefined past that still bear sign of the present, they become traces that have to be rediscovered through quasi-archaeological techniques in order to reveal their meaning. This way, clothes have the power to negate the linearity of the time of history proposing instead a chronology dictated by feelings, memories and emotions.</p>"

        title: 'The Editor''s Column: Authorship'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>In fashion, names are crucial: the history of fashion was constructed on the names of the designers who shaped the most iconic silhouettes, or designed the unforgettable items that became symbols of their time. However, this kind of history is sometimes guilty of leaving behind some of the names whose role is not to visible, but still invaluably important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048221/10918x1y142170.html\"><img alt=\"Label of suit by H Huntsman &amp; Sons\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/601e35a42f2b351f86c329f0ecadc6ea.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></a><br />\r\n<em>Label of Suit by H. Huntsman &amp; Sons Ltd, Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion objects themselves can be used to challenge this narrative, allowing us to discover new stories hidden behind the scenes of their production. What we consider fashion objects, be it clothes or accessories, are the end result of a process that involves many different actors. They originate from the encounter of different realities, sharing knowledge and abilities in order to produce something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visibility designers have nowadays turned them into public personae, whose image and name is directly linked to the aesthetic they develop in their work. The status of celebrities granted to designers has a flip side: it often ends up concealing the intricate network of artisans, technicians, manufacturers, producers without whom fashion could simply not be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/it/record/2048230/europeana_fashion_16642.html\"><img alt=\"chanel handbag\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/2011.0097.00.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chanel 2.55, 1986, Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt</em><em>, All Rights Reserved</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objects and their biographies can be used as tools to question the common definition of author, and make us rethink creation in terms of lively networks. The stories of the production of fashion items are interesting because they make us understand that every detail of an object comes out of a dialogue, a collaboration, a partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion materially explains that creativity has to be paired with technical rigour, savoir-faire and craftsmanship. By choosing authorship as this month’s theme, we want to present some of the ways in which designers have constructed their image and exploited their visibility in order to make some statements through fashion. We also intend to look at the experiences and personal relationships behind the creation of beautiful objects.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The influence of time over fashion also concerns its production; even if from a mere economical point of view, time has a big impact on the production costs and the final price of a garment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this sense, time is such a topical theme today that brand’s focus over faster or slower production techniques can determine the very identity of a brand. Being conscious of time and its value is an important quality for designers, not only for the definition of their aesthetics but also for shaping their approach towards the production and commercialisation of their clothes.<br />\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048208/OBJ13507.html\"><img alt=\"delyth dress by Bruno Pieters\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/d7ad209271a750969c80442cdd313ea3.jpg\" style=\"width: 567px; height: 758px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Delyth', dress designedby Bruno Pieters, 2004. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nFrom June to July 2016, Antwerp hosted the exhibition ‘Beyond the Clothes’, curated by Bruno Pieters. The exhibition displayed the ways the Belgian fashion designer approached these issues with his own project and website, Honest By. Bruno Pieters. This project, launched in 2012, aimed at stimulating costumers’ consciousness over themes such as sustainability and transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048208/OBJ17040.html\"><img alt=\"Delyth dress by Bruno Pieters\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-03/58eeb821c650e75a2d94783b4a6db4bc-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 533px; height: 800px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Tatja', dress designed by Bruno Pieters, 2005-06. Courtesy MoMu - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, all rights reserved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBruno Pieters, who graduated from the Royal Academie in Antwerp in 1999 and gained experience at Christian Lacroix, Maison Martin Margiela and Josephus Timister, first started with his website, which he created after a two years long hiatus. In it, for each piece on sale, he described in details the manufacturing process and the information of the materials and accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These details serve not only to retrace the story of the garment back from its conception but also to keep trace of operation and works that, beyond the clothes, usually remain invisible or untold. What lies beyond clothes, in fact, is the craftmanship of a group of authors and interpreters that convey their knowledge and experience to the realization of the product. Therefore time acquires a great importance as it is the direct expression of their contribution abd one of the key terms to value it. At a time when fashion and its industry speed up their pace to the extreme, the consciousness of the time needed and its costs are essential to understand, and maybe defend, the right to take it.</p>"

The model wears a white shirt in a loosely weaved fabric under a denim oversized jacket, whose proportions and lines remind of a sixteenth century doublet. In particular, its punched texture recalls the one worn by the Tailor in the infamous painting by Giovan Battista Moroni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood is known for her use of the past to find inspiration for her collections. Her own version of nineteenth century Victorian figures or Parisian cocottes are considered a milestone of fashion history. Although her vision is romantic, however, the designer’s practice is very much merged in the present. Her revoluntary activities and ideas allow her to use fashion as a way to raise awareness on topical issues of contemporary times.</p>"

        body: "<p><img alt=\"Hat designed by Max Hyemens\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/50203ef4199fae06f791fc4da18d50ce.jpg\" style=\"width: 768px; height: 1024px;\" />Hat designed by Max Hyemens, 1950s. Courtesy Amsterdam Museum, all rights reserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture shows a cocktail hat designed in the 1950s by Max Heymans, dubbed the ‘godfather’ of Dutch couture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hat is helmet shaped with no brims, and the back is longer that the front. It is made of velvet, and from the ornate top appears a tuft of black egret feathers. The hat is decorated with large sequins that don’t cover the hat with a regular pattern. The inside is unfinished, with no linings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutch couturier Max Heymans has designed hats throughout all his life. First, for his mother when he was young and later for his clients. Although he was helped by milliners such as Suzanne Moulijn to realise his creations, his obsession had him developing his first silhouettes to accompany his headwear. Although still influenced by Parisian fashion, his collections reflected his own personal vision, darkened by the events of the Second World War. His fruitful career lasted from 1945 to 1997.</p>"

        introduction: ''
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048232/europeana_fashion_54882568_jpg.html\"><img alt=\"two women dancing\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/2048232-europeana-fashion-54882568-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"width: 819px; height: 1200px;\" /></a>Valentino autumn-winter 1979/1980 women's ready-to-wear collection, shown at Forum des Halles. Courtesy Paul Van Riel, All Rights Reserved</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image captures a moment of fun on the runway of the Valentino winter 1979-1980 collection. The models are wearing two total-black outfits, composed by an two different ‘little black dresses’, one made of velvet and the other probably of sheer silk, and pointed heels. The two outfit are completed by flamboyant hats and accessories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture shows the two models dancing together: an interesting way to interpret the usual walk down the runway. The freedom and joy the image evokes might seem in contrast with the rather repetitive and rigorous parades at fashion shows. This has probably to do with the fact that the image comes from the show of a ready to wear collection: a different, more accessible line designed by Valentino, quite different from the couture. Through this line, the designer updated his definition of fashion, speaking to a wider audience and proposing another side of his personality to his public.</p>"

        title: 'The ''Mains'' of Couture'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Within the environment of the atelier, hands are so important, they traditionally are used, as a term, to indicate those professionals who take care of the materialisation of the couturier’s ideas to reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048230/europeana_fashion_17547.html?q=haute+couture\"><img alt=\"Gown form the Maison Worth, 1895-1900 ca., Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, All Rights Reserved\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/gown-from-maison-worth.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1200px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Gown from the Maison Worth, 1895-1900 ca., Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, All Rights Reserved</h4>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The première main, often referred to as just première, is the head of the atelier, the person in charge of supervise the work of all the people involved in the the process of production of dreamy couture gowns and precious ensembles. The other workers, each specialised in one passage of the process, are called petites mains. The hierarchy within the atelier is quite strict, and usually petite mains end up being so loyal to the fashion house they are in, to grow there professionally, from the apprenticeship onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/2017-04/thumbnail-by-url-2.json.jpeg\"><img alt=\"Dress by Hubert de Givenchy, 1950 ca., Courtesy MUDE - Museu Do Design E Da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo, All Rights Reserved\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/dress-by-hubert-de-givenchy-c1950.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Dress by Hubert de Givenchy, 1950 ca., Courtesy MUDE - Museu Do Design E Da Moda, Colecção Francisco Capelo, All Rights Reserved</h4>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is very important that both premieres and petites mains are able to understand the designer they work with, and above all that they share a language in order for the creations to be successful. Premières are always present during fittings, and have to be able to understand what is wrong with the toiles - the first step of the process, usually made of cheaper fabric - so they can go back to the tier and fix it according to the couturier’s vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is probably their attention to all the visible and invisible aspects of couture that made them gain this name. Petites Mains are in fact the ones who embroider and complete all the details of a gown, tirelessly putting effort and technique into their work through their hands.</p>"

Photo © Paul van Riel / HH.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture captures a model whirling her dress during the A/W 1981-82 show by Thierry Mugler. The dress is made of different layers of red tulle, with details that gleam in the light, turning the figure into a sort of mesmerizing apparition. The dramatic pose also shows lacquered red pump shoes and a huge jewel-ring, worn on the left hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image well evokes the atmosphere of the oustanding shows of the French fashion designer Thierry Mugler, whose spectacularity characterised the atmosphere of the Eighties and permeated through the Nineties. Beside fashion, however, the designer expressed his fascination for the spectacular directing films and videos and with photography; he created Demi Moore’s black dress in the movie ‘Indecent Proposal’, and designed the costumes for Beyoncé for the ‘I Am… World Tour’, working as her artistic advisor. Mugler also designed and developed the colourful costumes and characters for the Cirque du Soleil show ‘Zumanity’, exploting the potential of fashion to materialise his vision and amaze the audience.</p>"

        title: 'Clues of Authorship: Madeleine Vionnet''s Fingerprint'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>It is a complicate matter to state the authorship of a dress, as in its creation concurs the hands of many. Conventionally, however, labels provide the information needed to retrace its creator; sometimes summarising the complete cast of interventions or highlighting the designer as the only inventor, the label eventually is the very last clue leading to the author.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/latex-dress-designed-by-maison-martin-margiela.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dress, designed by Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1998. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s maybe why the label has functioned as a vehicle for many designers to esablish their idenity and the identity of their work, as did most famously Martin Margiela, that initially substituted with a white strip of cloth, attached to the garment with the iconic four with stitch at each extremity. Seventy years earlier, instead, Madeleine Vionnet used it as her bastion to preserve her authenticity. To do so, she phisically imprinted her fingerprint on each of her labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/dress-designed-by-madeleine-vionnet.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dress, designed by Madeleine Vionnet, 1930-35. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By doing so, the couturier Madeleine Vionnet, who established her Maison in Paris in 1912, was trying to defend her work - and set a primate for fellow couturiers to follow - to prevent copyists from plagiarising her work. Plagiarism, was, in fact, a practice that had long affected high fashion. Copyists were appointed by manufacturers and department stores to visit couture fashion shows to sketch the garments in order to had the instruction to remake them, as the American copyist-turned-fashion designer and writer Elizabeth Hawes explained in her book 'Fashion is Spinach'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/ensemble-designed-by-madeleine-vionnet.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ensemble, designed by Madeleine Vionnet, 1935. Courtesy Les Arts Décoratifs, all rights reserved. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her quest against plagiarism, Maideleine Vionnet had previosuly set in 1921 the A<em>ssociation for the Defence of Fine and Applied Arts</em>. However, she eventually started to document her creations photographing them from the front, back and sides, and then decided to stamp on each label her irreproducible and unique fingerprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as protecting her creativity, by marking the clothes in this way she put her own identity as a guarantee of their authenticity. At last, her labels served as a clue in a crime scene, they reconducted her mindful creations to her hands.</p>"

        title: 'Liberty: Store and Stories'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Stores are not only a place where to sell and buy products. They relate to the act of researching, selecting and displaying to create their identity. In theses actions resides their authorship, sometimes even turning them into creators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opened in 1875, the iconic Liberty store was first set in London’s Regent Street. Its founder, Arthur Lassey Liberty, once said: “I was determined not to follow existing fashion but to create new ones”. Indeed, since its earlier stage, the shop distinguished itself for its peculiar selection of goods imported from the Japan and the East. The selection included ornaments, fabrics and object d’arts, both following and contributing to the fascination for the Orient that characterized the art and costume of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/dress-of-silk-velvet-and-embroidered-silk-damask.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 559px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dress of silk velvet and embroidered silk damask, retailed by Liberty &amp; Co., London, ca. 1894. Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY SA.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1884, Arthur Lassey Liberty engaged Edward William Goodwin, already founder of the Costume Society, to direct the costume department. For it, Goodwin designed in-house apparel that challenged Parisian fashion's historical inspirations. Liberty became famous especially for its printed fabrics, whose recognisable motifs became the signature of the deparment store as brand; due to their high request, Liberty started to have blank canvases imported from India to hand-print them in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/enamelled-gold-pendant-for-the-cymric-jewellery.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enamelled gold pendant for the Cymric jewellery range of Liberty &amp; Company, Regent Street, designed by Archibald Knox, made by W H Haseler &amp; Co., Birmingham, ca. 1900.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the death of its founder in 1917, the exclusive Liberty line had expanded its range of goods with further and major collaborations with British artists and designers, that included William Morris and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Ruskin and Archibald Knox; a practice, that of collaboration, that the department store kept active to the recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/evening-gown-design-by-liberty-and-co.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 551px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evening gown, designed by</strong> <strong>Liberty &amp; Co., London, ca. 1910-11. Courtesy Gemeentemuseum den Haag, all rights reserved. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenging the very notion of authorship in fashion through these collaboration, Liberty transformed itself from selector to producer, in either way designing for itself a strong image and imagery, that made the store, in both cases, an invaluable creator of fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

Scheurer Lauth and Cie was a textile produces active in Thann, in France, since the end of nineteenth century. The maison reproduced on the textile a famous design by Alphonse Mucha, who was very popular in the French art scene at the end of nineteenth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alphonse Mucha was a Czech painter and decorative artist. He was a very prolific artist: not only did he produced paintings, but also posters and illustrations for advertising campaigns. Even though it is not clear if the artist was directly involved in the production of the textile, it is documented that Mucha was used to designing decorative patterns for textiles, carpets and wallpapers. Many of his works featured young women dressed in neoclassical clothes and surrounded by flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Femme à la marguerite is a clear example of Mucha’s recognisable style, which aligns to the canons of Art Nouveau, an international style in the decorative arts that became popular between nineteenth and twentieth century. It was characterised by smooth lines and curves, and natural motifs as plants and flowers.</p>"

        title: 'Maison Martin Margiela: Replica'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>Founded in 1988 by Belgian designer Martin Margiela, Maison Martin Margiela has since then awed with its unsettling creations that questioned the limits and potentialities of creativity and authorship in fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/sweater-made-of-military-socks.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sweater made of military socks, a/w 1991-92. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maison has, from its first collections, explored the use – and the reuse – of materials and clothes from the past. Example of this is its 'Artisanal' line, which contructs new garments through the deconstruction of other found garments and accessories, such as men hats or military socks, or plastic chains and necklaces. Beside this, Maison Martin Margiela introduced in its womenswear and menswear lines a selection of identical reconstruction of clothes from the past, called 'replicas'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Dress, reconstruction of a 1930s seethrough evening dress, Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1994. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/dress-reconstruction-of-a-seethrough-evening-dress-from-the-early-1930s-maison-martin-margiela.jpeg\" style=\"width: 801px; height: 1200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dress, reconstruction of a seethrough evening dress from the early 1930s, Maison Martin Margiela, s/s 1994. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selected from second-hand shops for their peculiarity, and with the aim of representing archetypal clothes for the contemporary wardrobe, these replicas differentiate one from each other for style and period, coming from the Thirties as well from the Seventies. Maison Martin Margiela designs their copies ensuring that their construction is an accurate reconstrucion of the original and the choice of fabric respects the identity of its model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This way, the garments are reactivated; what was just an unique lucky found on a rack or in a pile at a second-hand shop or market - regardless of its 'sartorial' past - becomes widely available, with the possibility to be worn in different sizes and by many. In the folds or linings of the replicas, accompanying the iconic hand stitched label of the maison, attached is a label delivering all the information neaded to retrace the history of the garment, explaining its style, provenance and period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-04/detail-label-of-a-replica-of-a-reconstructed-jacket-from-the-1940s-maison-martin-margiela.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Detail, label of a replica of a reconstructed jacket from the 1940s, Maison Martin Margiela, 1990-95. Courtesy Modemuseum Hasselt, all rights reserved. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reproducting pre-existing garments, Maison Martin Margiela questioned the meaning of authorship in the design team; the identity of the Maison lies in the very decision to do reproductions of clothes picked from a pile. Regardless of the label their bear or the inside, they are chosen for their resemblance of an archetype, whose research is the very aim of the Maison itself.</p>"

The fashion designer duo Viktor &amp; Rolf, who founded their company in 1993 after graduating from the Arhnem Academy of Art and Design in the Netherlands, were they met, frequently used their couture show to convey messages and articulate discourses on the topical issues of fashion design. On the runway, they sent models wearing piles of couture pieces, tulle gowns with laser-cut holes in them and gowns submerged by ribbons.</p>"

        body: "<p>Fashion, as a design discipline, comes out of processes that require specific knowledge and skills in order to produce any output. The set of techniques and methods implied in the production of fashion objects is technology. Over history, the methods of fashion and those of technology have overlapped and joined forces, producing not only objects, but progess in a wider sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-05/silk-ribbon-woven-on-a-jacquard-loom-designed-by-m.-clack.jpeg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; line-height: 16px;\">Silk Ribbon woven on a Jacquard loom designed by M.

Technological innovation have often developed thanks to the demand of the market, driven by the thrive of new or different fashions for the most diverse reasons: class distinction, economic supremacy, desire to either fit in or stand out.<br />\r\nThe fashion system relied on technology not only to produce objects, but also to create meaning and build a narrative around the objects: this is the case of photos, plates and images crafted to make fashion a fascinating myth.<br />\r\nNowadays, the word technology is tightly linked to digital tools. The possibilities digital technologies have opened up for museums and archives allow these institutions to exploit the potential of their collections and develop new, interesting ways to either preserve, exhibit and communicate their amazing holdings and ways to manage them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-05/dress-by-designer-iris-van-herpen.jpg\" style=\"width: 533px; height: 800px;\" /><em><strong><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; line-height: 16px;\">Dress by designer Iris Van Herpen, 2007, Courtesy Central Museum, All Rights Reserved</span></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, as Europeana Fashion, feel part of this new technological era, and that’s why we decided to explore the meaning of the relationship between fashion heritage and technology - or, better, technologies - by looking at the very objects and retracing their stories. This theme will also be celebrated and analysed thoroughly in our upcoming symposium ‘Fashion Digital Memories’, in collaboration with IUAV University of Venice and Parsons Paris, which will take place in Venice on 22nd and 23rd May.</p>"

The model is wearing an oversized poncho-dress in colourful checked wool, which seems to be made of a giant scarf draped around a body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designer Jean Charles de Castelbajac is known for his irreverent and yet conceptual take on fashion. His first collection was presented in 1970 and made immediate sensation because he sent out on the runway a model dressed in a blanket. Amongst his most know creations are the Poncho for Two, the teddy bear jacket and, of course, the many reinterpretations of classic outerwear, with which the designer played, adding extravagant details such as feathers and unexpected materials, and often referencing pop art and street art.</p>"

        title: 'Timeless Technology: The Jacquard Loom'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">Before the 1800s, weaving was a repetitive and mechanical process: lots of time and skill were required in order to produce the embellished textiles that were all the rage amongst the higher strata of society. Between 1801 and 1806, French weaver Joseph-Marie Jacquard developed a machine that was then individuated as one of the most important technological advancement in history: the Jacquard Loom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"><strong><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-05/1494889428_thumbnail-by-url.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 648px;\" /></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"><strong><em>Fabric of jacquard silk made by Tholozan et Cie, Lyon, 1855, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">Joseph-Marie Jacquard was born in Lyons in 1752, from a family of weavers. At the time, not only did weaving require a skilled weaver managing the loom, but also another professional, called drawboy, who was to sit next to the weaver and move the threads according to the design of the cloth. Jacquard was familiar with the process and understood that, in order to make the most from the business, it was key to make these passages automatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">Once his parents died, he inherited the family business and devoted much of his time to study and develop a new machine that could make the weaving process faster ad more profitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">\r\n<p class=\"split-items\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0.4em 1em 0px; padding: 0px; display: block;\"><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-05/thumbnail-by-url-2.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 481px;\" /></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"split-items\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0.4em 1em 0px; padding: 0px; display: block;\"><em><strong>Ribbon of Jacquard-woven figured silk, made by Cox &amp; Co., Coventry, 1850, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC BY</strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">Jacquard worked on his invention at the end of 1700s, but was interrupted buy the French Revolution. After the revolution, he went back to his project and developed a machine that he presented in Paris in 1804, where he patented his invention and was given a medal. The French government claimed that the loom was to become a public property, leaving Jacquard with no more than a small royalty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">The Jacquard loom was based on a system of cards, needles and hooks. The cards were made of cardboard, where holed could be easily punched in order to create the design; the hooks and needles used followed the holes in the cardboard, passing through these holes and inserting the thread to create the pattern. The more intricate the design was, the more cards were arranged one after the other in the loom. Thanks to the system on which it was based, the loom allowed to create highly complex designs and patterns, in which new colors could be used and marvelous patterns developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-05/thumbnail-by-url-1.json.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\" /></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"><em><strong>Manuscript related mainly to jacquard weaving, Courtesy MoMU - Modemuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-size: 12px;\">In terms of impact, it is not an exaggeration to say that Jacquard’s invention not only revolutionised the textile industry, but was also fundamentally for a more general technological advancement. Jacquard’s invention helped not only the textile industry, but helped in the advance of technology. The Jacquard loom not only cut back on the amount of human labor, but also allowed for patterns to now be stored on cards and to be utilized over and over again to achieve the same product. The jacquard loom allowed to ‘save’ patterns on cards that could be archived and re-used, cutting on time, labour and costs. The system followed a mathematical algorithm, and some have argued that the jacquard loom holds many similarities with computers: both machine work by storing and organising information.</p>"

The collection was designed by Nicolas Ghesquière, who stayed at the head of the maison Balenciaga from 1997 to 2012.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; line-height: 16px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system-font; font-size: 12px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; line-height: 16px;\">Ghesquière joined the maison Balenciaga when he was 25 years old. His approach has been applauded by critics and public alike, because it was respectful of the heritage of the maison, while being able to speak to the contemporary scene of both fashion and art. With Cristobal Balenciaga, who established the maison in 1937 in Paris, Ghesquière shared not only the creative talent, drawn to research, attention for volumes, shapes and details, but also the preference for an under-exposed life, based more in the atelier than on the stage.</div>"

How is it disseminated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were the questions driving 'The Fashion Europeana Project 2012-2015,’ a project developed as a collaboration between Stockholm University and Europeana Fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-05/su09573.jpg\" style=\"width: 1263px; height: 1493px;\" />Screenshot from Ioana Ciolacu Instagram page, Courtesy Stockholm University, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project lasted between 2012 and 2015 and saw the Centre for Fashion Studies at Stockholm University becoming the first academic institution to also be a content provider, interrogating itself on the nature of digital fashion heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collaboration resulted with the inclusion, in the Europeana Fashion Archive, of many objects, such as screenshots of websites, blogs, Instagram and Facebook pages whose content was related to fashion. The collection was aimed at giving substance to the notion of ‘European web culture of fashion,’ the research being based on content published in European countries, with an institution actively monitoring and selecting the material forming this culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-05/2048216-localid-europeana-fashion-su5032.jpeg\" style=\"width: 1024px; height: 2203px;\" />Screenshot from LundLund Set Design Joel Junsjö | LundLund, Courtesy Stockholm University All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Fashion Archive now holds more than 9,000 records provided by Stockholm University. The project was also a way of ‘saving’ all those web experiences that could potentially disappear, to fix them in the memory of the archive, to provide material to future researchers interested in the contact between digital technology, fashion and heritage.</p>"

We learned how the materiality of the archive can come as straightforward as it is in the acts of preservation of garments, as appeared in Sarah Scaturro’s explanation of her work in the conservation department at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It can also be de-materialised into the definition of a list of classification terms - a thesaurus - instrumental in the conservation of the meanings and messages enclosed in the objects, as articulated by Sabine de Guenther and Yjke Wildenborg. The case study of the Gianni Versace Historical Archive presented by Antonio Masciariello has shown how the act of preserving, especially with respect to contemporary archives, must deal with issues related to the making of images and myths, and identity, as rather ungraspable but nevertheless incredibly significant moments of fashion.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/34698121451-365afa59d6-z.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 427px;\" /><em><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-648a-6b2f-6003-b7f9d8ba2421\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(33, 33, 36); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Panel discussion during Fashion Digital Memories, Europeana Fashion Symposium 2017, Photo by Sebastiaan ter Burg</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, All Rights Reserved</span></span></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">All these examples, discussed together in the roundtable chaired by Dr Marco Pecorari, showed how digital technologies, and also those that were not developed to be applied to fashion heritage in the first place, can be and, indeed, are fundamental in allowing us to protect and also make available the memories hold in archives and museums, in their material or digital form.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Following a conceptual structure that from the ‘back end’ of the laboratory of preservation moves to the exhibition stage and then to the tools of communication, the second day was filled with contributions describing how digital technologies can or could be used when exhibiting fashion in different spaces.

A similar path, however based on a completely different primary material, was followed by Marco Rubichi from Promemoria, whose paper focused on the project the company Promemoria developed together with Maria Luisa Frisa, Laudomia Pucci and the Pucci Archive. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">After this rich round of presentations, Professor José Teunissen, dean of the school of design and technology at the London College of fashion, closed the symposium with a reflection on her practice as curator and educator within the Art Cherie programme she runs at LCF, opening up another scenario - that of academia - where fashion and technology very often cross paths and overlap.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finally, Dr Gabriele Monti chair a roundtable where the themes discussed in the papers were developed further, especially in relation to the many definition of translation enclosed in all the papers presented during the day: objects turned into learning experiences, displays, information and also excitement.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/34790221526-ca33c2bfe0-z.jpg\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 427px;\" /><em><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-648a-fb0c-f2e8-16c073ae8ec4\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(33, 33, 36); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Europeana Fashion Quiz installation at Fashion Digital Memories, Europeana Fashion Symposium 2017, </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Photo by Sebastiaan ter Burg, All Rights Reserved</span></span></strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.5999999999999999;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Other side events took place during the two days. At the end of the first day, a spot was also reserved for the presentation of the new Europeana Fashion Collection website, which was launched earlier this month. While, in the courtyard of Palazzo Badoer, two screens were installed with a trivia game developed by Noterik, based on a selection of material hold in the Europeana Fashion archive, which engaged all the participants. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c6504c2-6484-d03b-f918-e79863ee0a72\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">We are pleased with the reflections provoked by the juxtaposition of themes and experiences, and we hope that the discussion begun in Venice will lead to more projects that bring together fashion heritage and digital tools and we are looking forward to our next international symposium in 2018</span></span></p>"

The model is wearing a black suit composed by a slim jacket and low waist trousers. Under the jacket, she is wearing a crop top in sheer skin colour fabric with cheetah print. The picture and the attitude of the model, who sports a strong black makeup, capture the impetuos atmosphere of the collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jean Colonna, who trained working for Balmain and collaborating on accessories with Jean Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler, was nicknamed in the nineties the 'King of Paris Downtown Chic'. With his low-key, grungy aesthetic, he dominated Parisian catwalks alongside other radicals of his era, like Martin Margiela and Helmut Lang, working and collaborating with rising stars such as photographers David Sims, Jeff Burton and Jurgen Teller. His shops closed in 2002; although after a long stop, he re-emerged with his line again in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, all rights reserved. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image shows an sketch made by fashion illustrator René Gruau in 1966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entitled 'Gruau's young man about town in summer', it represents a boy in the act of walking cheerily, wearing a tight orange striped shirt with matching tie and white skinny tailored trousers. In his hands, a cap and a cigarette, his eyes covered by pair of shades. On the right side of the figure, a note in pencil is indicating its length: 31,5 cm. The drawing is signed by the author on the bottom right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 1940s and throughout the 1950s, René Gruau, born Renato Zavagli Ricciardelli delle Caminate in Rimini, Italy, illustrated the haute couture with his bold and glamorous drawings. His works were featured in fashion magazine such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Femina and for Flair, for whom he worked as sole illustrator. Besides, he was hired by couturiers like Pierre Balamin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Christian Dior, for whom he illustrated the advertisement campaigns. From 1949 to 1975, he illustrated menswear for ‘Club’, an Italian magazine dedicated to men’s fashion.</p>"

        title: 'The Editor''s Column: Craft'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>To respond to last month’s theme, which dealt with the relationship between fashion and technology, we decided to focus on the experiences that decidedly go against the proverbial drive and speed of technological advancement. This month we will instead move into the world of ‘craft,’ trying to map it, in its various configurations, within the material traces composing our archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/f62ba52b93c68385dceb9ce32c7e69a1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 905px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Highland Crafts: kilt maker &amp; gents tailor, Courtesy ModeMuseum Provincie Antwerpen, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craft, as a concept, is directly linked to what is handmade, and therefore recalls ideas of artistry and uniqueness. These characteristics are embedded in the objects that are now in museum and archives, as either real features or narrative constructions, able to to give a context - and a story, and a value - to the objects themselves. Often considered as an established practice, craft holds a strong connection with the idea of tradition, incredibly powerful, which makes it reassuring and linear: the way things were done, the way things thou be done. The value objects acquire, when they are associated with craftsmanship, comes from the images and attitudes this term evokes: patience and attention, repetition and constance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craft also account for a completely different consideration of time: while technology is always projected forward, trying to push limits and break boundaries, craft seems to always stand still, lingering in a nostalgic present, linking past and future in the continuity of its practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/2048221-10918x1y67490.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Customized boots, Antwerp, 1984, Courtesy Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, All Rights Reserved</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about craft means considering the ways in which objects are, first and foremost, made. When we look at an object, what we see is the result of many operations that led to its creation; objects are made - or crafted - by men, and come to us as the result of the encounter between mind and hand. Hands are involved so much in the crafting of an object, that it is quite impossible to separate the definition of craft from the image of two hands working on something: a pattern, an embroidery, a sketch.<br />\r\nIn its being an embodied practice - linked and performed by humans with their bodies - craft can also lead to modifications, customization and DIY, and in this sense was indeed used as tool for political and ideological subversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are few of the actions associated with the idea of craft, of which collections and archive hold many examples - our personal craft, as curious researchers, engaged in the meaning of heritage, is to find them and let them tell their stories.</p>"

        body: "<p>This month, our Tumblr is dissecting Greece’s traditional costumes, with a selection of images curated by the Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation of Nafplion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional costumes are usually known or remembered for their detailed and colourful craft: embroideries, prints and other ornaments usually cover and distinguish these clothes for their role and use. Moreover, their patterns and their construction let insights on histories – and stories – able to enrich our common undertanding of regional traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/tumblr-or1kzvagjw1s0n7o6o1-1280.jpg\" style=\"width: 613px; height: 911px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Pattern of a Karagouna (Thessaly, Greece) chemise - 'linomaniko'.

It was founded in 1947 by the folklorist and scenic designer Ioanna Papantoniou. Its collection, composed by traditional and folk costumes, as well as the work of recent Greek fashion designers, is accessible on the Europeana Fashion collection and, for this June, also on our Tumblr, where we will unveil some of the gems of the archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/pff.2a.jpg\" style=\"width: 755px; height: 871px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>'Linomaniko'.

Peloponnesian Folklore Foundation Collection, Nafplion. </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, every day on the Tumblr will be posted two pictures illustrating the pattern of a different traditional costume, each with a detailed description of the facture of the costume. From ‘linomaniko’ chemises to bridal overcoats – ‘kavais’ – every layer and piece of costume will be represented on the Tumblr curation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tune on the <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr </a>and don’t miss a post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

They were probably presenting the summer collections of the Nordiska Kompaniet.<br />\r\nNordiska Kompaniet are two department stores located in Stockholm and Gothenburg, in Sweden. They were first established at the beginning of twentieth century by Karl Ludvig Lundberg and Josef Sachs, who wanted to give Sweeden stores that could compete with those in London and Paris. It is probably with this objective in mind that fashion shows were organised there, as part of a campaign of technological advancements aimed at updating the shopping experience In relation to ‘European' standards.</p>"

        title: 'The Other Side of Modernity: The Arts and Crafts Movement'
        introduction: ''
        body: "<p>The industrial revolution is often regarded as the key moment for the beginning of a new era. In his book ‘The great divergence', historian Kenneth Pomeranz individuated Western culture, specifically Great Britain, as the cradle of a new positive sensibility towards machines, that ultimately led to modernisation. However, together with this modernity came the negative effect of industrialisation, which led designers and artists to develop new approaches and ways to express social anxieties. One of the responses to these feelings and contradictions was the Arts &amp; Craft Movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/a9e31c29ef85bbc0b0ae13bc0ee64981-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Child's embroidered silk coat, probably British, 1880-95.

It was based on the idea that craftsmanship was an enjoyable practice, as opposed to mechanic work, and could help men to express their interiority, naturally drawn towards art and beauty. Critic John Ruskin was the one who theorised the aims and philosophy of the movement, and wrote extensively about the connections between the social role of art and the value of work. The name more directly associated with the movement is that of William Morris, who was a textile designer, poet, and social activist. Drawing from Ruskin’s writings, through his work he campaigned for return to hand-craftsmanship, recognising to artisans the status of artists, and to a closer contact with nature. Indeed, the privileged motifs characterising the aesthetics of the movement took inspiration from the natural world: leaves, flower, animals composed the scenes illustrated on textiles and stitched in the embroideries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-06/8af27b8504958d917849eb3685acd4c3.jpg\" style=\"width: 721px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Collar of embroidered linen with silks, designed and embroidered by Jessie Newbery, Glasgow, ca. 1900.

The Glasgow scene counted for many women designers, who focused their practice on textiles and embroideries. Amongst them were Jessie King, an illustrator whose designs were sold at the Liberty Department Store in London, and Jessie Newbery, who produced embroideries and was also a teacher at the Glasgow School of Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the movement was not entirely against industrial techniques; designers were in fact keen on collaborating with industries, as long as the products were produced according to an ethical code that safeguarded the identity of both materials, and of the people working with them.</p>"

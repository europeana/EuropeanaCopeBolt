The organisation is currently steered by a Governing Board of 20 experts from cultural and scientific heritage organisations across Europe and led by Harry Verwayen, Executive Director.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure its operations continue to run smoothly and effectively,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-restructures-its-governance\">the Europeana Foundation is changing its governance structure</a>. The change in governance will see the current governing board become a board of directors and a supervisory board, complemented and supported by an advisory board. The new structure will see the cultural heritage sector in all its diversity better represented, creating a stronger two-way link between the Foundation and the sector. This will put the Foundation in a better position to support the cultural heritage sector to build capacity for digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To that aim, the Europeana Foundation is looking for 3 candidates to join and complement its Supervisory Board.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supervisory Board</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Supervisory Board members:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Are passionately committed to the advancement of digital cultural heritage;</li>\r\n    <li>Feel strongly connected to the Foundation’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/mission\">vision and mission</a>;</li>\r\n    <li>Have a strong sense of responsibility, integrity and ethics;</li>\r\n    <li>Are prepared to commit time and engagement to the work of the Board;</li>\r\n    <li>Have networks relevant to the work of the Foundation;</li>\r\n    <li>Are ambassadors and advocates of our work and act in the best interests of the Foundation and its stakeholders;</li>\r\n    <li>Contribute to the Foundation’s organisational culture, strategic focus, effectiveness, and financial sustainability;</li>\r\n    <li>Complement one another in supervising the general course of affairs of the Foundation;</li>\r\n    <li>Contribute to the development of the Foundation's strategic direction, annual plans, mission and policies;</li>\r\n    <li>Safeguard the identity and the realisation of goals and objectives of the Foundation;</li>\r\n    <li>Ensure the Foundation complies with legal requirements;</li>\r\n    <li>Review and approve annual financial reports and budgets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Supervisory Board members prepare for board meetings, attend at least five (mainly virtual) meetings per year, and participate in the activities and the work of the Board actively and conscientiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory and Advisory Boards is restricted to an expense allowance or a minimum attendance fee.

We work to share and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-reuse-be-inspired\">promote cultural heritage</a> so that it can be used and enjoyed by people all over the world.

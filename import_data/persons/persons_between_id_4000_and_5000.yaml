        introduction: 'A biologist by training I took up the position as curator at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in 1989 and spent my days compiling thesauri for the use in environmental data systems. The controlled vocabularies were not so popular in the collection systems. Then in 1991 the museum needed to connect to ‚ÄúThe Internet‚Äù. Not long after that the department installed a web server and I became the museum''s first webmaster, coding web pages with a text editor. When we started publishing the museum‚Äôs collections online, our scientists saved tons of time when they got loan requests for specified objects instead of a set of search criteria. In 1995 I made a proposal on behalf of the government that heritage collections should be made available online on the internet. Since then I‚Äôve been engaged in several initiatives regarding digital heritage such as ABM-centrum (an initiative to increase coordination of data from archives, libraries, and museums). I‚Äôve also worked with the top-level domain  dot.museum. Currently I‚Äôm a special advisor at the Ministry of Culture and among other responsibilities, I work around digital heritage policies. I still see a need for more extended use of controlled vocabularies and standards in digital heritage. I represent Sweden in the European Commission‚Äôs expert group CEDCHE. During 2023 I will serve on the Europeana Advisory Board as a representative of CEDCHE and the member states.'

        introduction: 'Stephanie was born in The Hague, but studied archaeology and art history at the University of Lyons. She then went back to the Netherlands and studied iconology and medieval studies at Utrecht University. After obtaining master''s degrees in both Lyons and Utrecht, she specialized in the migration of Dutch and Flemish artists to France in modern history (16th and 17th century). Obsessed with sources, archives and artists'' biographies, her studies focuse mainly on historic aspects of this phenomena and are based on intensive archival research. <br>She recently defended her PhD thesis at Utrecht University intitled "Etrangers, mais habitu√©s en cette ville de Paris" : les artistes n√©erlandais √† Paris (1550-1700) : une prosopographie and plans to pursue her research on Dutch and Flemish artists in France in the coming years, hopefully in a French or Dutch academic team.<br>Like her 333 painters and sculptors, she has been living in Paris for more than 10 years with her french partner and her half French- half Dutch son. But she frequently visits her homeland (i.e. as often as she can).'

        introduction: 'Ina Bl√ºmel is architect and acting professor for Open Science, Digital Libraries and Research Infrastructures at Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Arts. She holds a doctorate in Information Science and conducts research on open, networked sciences and research information as well as knowledge extraction and modeling at the Open Science Lab of the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB). She has successfully raised third-party funds on national and international digital library projects in digital heritage and related science domains e.g., for indexing and provision of architectural 3D models. Ina is co-facilitating collaborative open book projects as well as the European community on Linked Open Data for research information. A current project on open access images integrates this research field with the infrastructure of Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata. Ina is part of several digital heritage related initiatives such as the working group Digital Reconstruction within Digital Heritage Germany (DHd), the Federation of German Architectural Archives, and mentor in the Wikimedia DE / Open Science Fellows Program.'

Hence, the complexity of being pluralistic about cultural knowledge should be allowed to co-exist in a transparent knowledge space, where we need to support not only one single source of truth, but tracking authorship and provenance of different views, as well as collaborative knowledge building processes.</p>\r\n"

I just did things I liked, and thought would be interesting and exciting.<br>I worked at promoting reading - I am very much interested in digital possibilities  - and I am now working at my favorite place, a museum.<br>So the connection between all these kind of jobs is actually quite simple: it is education and communication, the cultural education,  which unites all my jobs.</p><p>Today I work as head of education for the Altonaer Museum and Jenisch Haus in the Stiftung Historische Museen Hamburg.<br>I am a board member of the LAG Kinder- und Jugendkultur Hamburg, responsible for the field schools.</p><p>I am also working as a freelancer in the field of reading promotion, often as lecturer about  digital reading promotion, and also at a children reading club.</p><p>For several years, until  the beginning of 2017,  I worked at the Hamburger Kinderbuchhaus.</p>'

        introduction: '<p>Barbara''s enthusiasm for cultural heritage began in her childhood when the family sat together telling stories and sharing memories about time, space and change. She was able to professionalise her interest in history and the devolpment of the historical cultural landscape through her studies of  heritage conservation.</p><p>After a few years of renovating old houses and working for urban development, she founded the Kulturerben | Culture Heirs e.V. and is now working as a cultural heritage educator in Schleswig-Holstein/ Germany. In this context, she teaches courses for all ages, from primary school to university. In order to broaden her horizon, she is currently writing a masters thesis to become an art teacher.</p><p>Europeana opens up new opportunities for cross-border co-creative research, education, participation and communication. Barbara is excited to be more actively involved in this innovative network that makes our stories visible.</p>'

        introduction: 'Roxanne was Europeana‚Äôs IPR Advisor and worked closely with policymakers to update copyright law and make it easier for everyone to enjoy online access to cultural content and shared history. She has over 10 years IPR experience in the arts and heritage sector and has an academic background in fashion design history, visual culture and copyright law. When she is not putting the world to rights with rights you can often find Roxanne immersed in just-one-more music gig or engineering yet another trip to the seaside.'

        introduction: 'Jochen joined Europeana at the beginning of 2018 as a Java developer and is passionate about making maintainable, reusable and robust software. He holds Master''s degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics and thrives on challenges, as well as tea that is much fancier than what is probably good for him. In his spare time, he is likely reading, hiking, doing math or planning his next trip to some unusual corner of the world. He has finally resigned himself to the fact that he will forever underestimate the time it takes to pack for his trips.'

        introduction: '<p>My background stems from the relationship between digital technologies and the arts. With this, and through integrating my passions for open heritage data and democratisation of new technologies led me to start Scan the World, now the largest community-built archive of 3D printable objects of cultural significance.</p><p>I strive to keep my project''s approach and outcomes open, having hosted a plethora of workshops and public talks to serve as an evangelist for OpenGLAM and the maker communities. It is with this community that I have been enabled to disrupt institutions and allow anyone to engage with the arts. Two objects from the Scan the World collection have recently been acquired by The Victoria and Albert Museum for the upcoming reopening of the Cast Courts, exhibited as a prime example of what museums can do with open 3D data.</p>'

I am aware that Europeana is partially focused on VR though I believe that this is a short-sighted view for the potential of 3D data, especially when partnered with cost-effective additive manufacturing.</p>\r\n"

        introduction: 'I''m a student at Jagiellonian University, with a taste for risk and adventure, starting to look at roles in the data industry. I''ve always been a bit of uninhibited right- and left- brain split. I tend to gravitate toward more analytical, operational-based roles, but always in super creative environments - which I think is actually pretty telling of my personality and my outlook on science as well. I want to be someone who propels creative people into the research sector.'

        introduction: 'Jan Nikolai Nelles is a multi-disciplinary German artist born 1980 in Frankfurt/Main. He graduated from Offenbach University of Art and Design in 2011. In the past he founded an independent project space in Frankfurt/Main and co-founded a photography magazine. Since 2009 Jan Nikolai Nelles and Nora Al-Badri are working together. Their artistic practice oscillates between different fields such as visual and media art, documentary filmmaking and cultural activism. Their pieces deal with issues arising through hegemonic and neo-colonial power structures and representations between the Global South and North as well as with the various facets of war and its aftermath. Their artistic practice reflects on the absurdity of the human condition. The works interfere in social infrastructures by misbehavior performances or challenges institutions through civil disobedience aware of their artistic freedom. The collective pursues a critical re-evaluation of actual cultural commons, the power of representation through material objects of other cultures, their digital images as well as the concepts of heritage and identity politics schemes.'

        introduction: 'Nora Al-Badri is a multi-disciplinary artist with a German-Iraqi background and was born 1984 in Marburg an der Lahn. She lives and works in Berlin. She studied visual art at Offenbach University of Art and Design and graduated in political sciences at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt/Main. Since 2009 Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles are working together. Their artistic practice oscillates between different fields such as visual and media art, documentary filmmaking and cultural activism. Their pieces deal with issues arising through hegemonic and neo-colonial power structures and representations between the Global South and North as well as with the various facets of war and its aftermath. Their artistic practice reflects on the absurdity of the human condition. The works interfere in social infrastructures by misbehavior performances or challenges institutions through civil disobedience aware of their artistic freedom. The collective pursues a critical re-evaluation of actual cultural commons, the power of representation through material objects of other cultures, their digital images as well as the concepts of heritage and identity politics schemes.'

        introduction: 'Sebastian Hellmann has completed his PhD thesis under the guidance of Jens Lehmann and S√∂ren Auer at the University of Leipzig in 2014 on the transformation of NLP tool output to RDF. Sebastian is a senior member of the ‚ÄúAgile Knowledge Engineering and Semantic Web‚Äù AKSW research center, which currently has 50 researchers (PhDs and senior researchers) focusing on semantic technology research ‚Äì often in combination with other areas such as machine learning, databases, and natural language processing. Sebastian is head of the ‚ÄúKnowledge Integration and Language Technologies (KILT)" Competence Center at InfAI. He also is the executive director and board member of the non-profit DBpedia Association. Sebastian is contributor to various open-source projects and communities such as DBpedia, NLP2RDF, DL-Learner and OWLG and wrote code in Java, PHP, JavaScript, Scala, C & C++, MatLab, Prolog, Smodels, but now does everything in Bash and Zsh since he discovered the Ubuntu Terminal. Sebastian is the author of over 80 peer-reviewed scientific publications (h-index of 21 and over 4300 citations [Google Scholar] (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=caLrIhoAAAAJ)) and a not-yet-deleted Wikipedia article about Knowledge Extraction. Currently, he is project manager for Leipzig University and InfAI of the EU H2020 Projects ALIGNED and FREME and the BMWi funded project Smart Data Web. Before that, he was also involved in other funded projects such as FREME (EU H2020), LIDER (EU FP7), BIG and LOD2. Sebastian was chair at the Open Knowledge Conference in 2011, the Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics 2012, the Linked Data Cup 2012, the Multilingual Linked Data for Enterprises (MLODE) 2012 workshop, the NLP & DBpedia Workshop 2014, the SEMANTiCS 2014, 2015 and 2016 conference as well as the KEKI Workshop 2016. In 2012, we held a hackathon at MLODE 2012 bootstrapping an initial version of the Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud image, which led to the LIDER project and linguistic-lod.org that now publishes regular updates (thanks to John McCrae).'

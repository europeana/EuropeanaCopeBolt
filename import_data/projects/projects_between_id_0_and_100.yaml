        intro: "<p>Daguerreobase develops a common reflection and best practice in the collection and dissemination of information on daguerreotypes in European collections, thus creating a knowledge base designed by and for all of those interested in Europe's diverse cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The daguerreotype was the first successful photographic process in the history of photography and can be seen as the ‘Incunabula of Photography'. On January 7, 1839, the daguerreotype was presented at the Académie des Sciences in Paris. The daguerreotype is named after its inventor Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, was widely used in Europe and represents the first photographic images of Europe and its citizens. The base of the daguerreotype is a highly polished metal plate, consisting of a thin layer of silver on a copper support. A daguerreotype is created through direct exposure in the camera and delivers a unique image from which no further prints can be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are still many aspects of the daguerreotype that need to be discovered to understand the impact of photography on Europe's social and cultural history. In order to do so all information on the surviving daguerreotypes needs to be collected, thus making identifying, attributing and gathering further knowledge on the remaining examples of this earliest form of photography possible. A first attempt was made by the Dutch initiative www.daguerreobase.org. This initiative covered only The Netherlands. Daguerreobase can however only function as an efficient cultural and informative tool for Europeana and its users when more daguerreotypes from a large number of European collections will be brought together. This is exactly the aim of the current Daguerreobase project proposal: to develop a common reflection and best practice in the collection and dissemination of information on daguerreotypes in European collections, thus creating a knowledge base designed by and for all of those interested in Europe's divers cultural heritage. Through a European-wide consortium and supported by workshops we want to enhance the functionality of the knowledge base, compile and aggregate existing digital content held by different cultural institutions from across Europe and make it accessible through Europeana.</p>"

        title: 'Digitising Contemporary Art'
        subtitle: DCA
        projecttype: Project
        intro: '‘Digitising Contemporary Art'' (DCA) was a digitisation project for contemporary art, i.e. art made after 1945.'
        body: "<p>DCA created a digital body of high-quality reproductions of 26,921 artworks - paintings, photographs, sculptures, installations, videos and 1,857 contextual documents, which are accessible and retrievable through Europeana; not only through the use of metadata and thumbnails, but also direct links to large-sized reproductions of each item. DCA ensured that the rights to all available digital content will be cleared. The content provided, including masterpieces from key artists of most European countries, fill a gap in Europeana‘s content supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main issues addressed within the project are the choice of specifications for digitisation and metadata, so that they are inter-operational, and finding the appropriate aggregation solution for each institution. The exchange with Europeana is the main outcome of the project. DCA‘s digitisation process also contributed to the preservation of the artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DCA project enhanced the online visibility of contemporary art as an essential expression and an invaluable part of European culture, and to stimulate the interest of the general public by introducing a stronger presence of contemporary art to the Europeana portal.</p>"

        body: "<p>It is a best-practice network co-funded by the European Commission, under its Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EAGLE Best Practice Network is part of Europeana, a multi-lingual online collection of millions of digitised items from European museums, libraries, archives and multi-media collections. EAGLE will collect, in a single readily-searchable database, more than 1.5 million items, currently scattered across 25 EU countries, as well as the east and south Mediterranean. The project will make available the vast majority of the surviving inscriptions of the Greco-Roman world, complete with the essential information about them and, for all the most important, a translation into English.</p>"

        body: "<p>EFG1914 was\_the follow-up project of EFG – The European Film Gateway (2008-2011). The main outcome of the EFG project was\_the online portal The European Film Gateway, which gives access to several hundreds of thousands photos, films, texts and other material preserved in European film archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>25 partners, among them 20 European film archives, worked towards the following main goals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>digitise 647 hours of film and ca. 5.600 film-related documents on the theme of the First World War</li>\r\n    <li>give access to the material through the European Film Gateway and Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>build a virtual exhibition using selected objects digitised in EFG1914</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>EFG1914 covered all the different genres and sub-genres relevant in that time: newsreels, documentaries, fiction films, propaganda films. Moreover, EFG1914 also gave access to anti-war films that were mainly produced after 1918 and which reflect the tragedies of the 1910s. This material is of special importance since only around 20% of the complete silent film production survived in the film heritage institutions. Therefore, EFG1914 set\_out to digitize a crucial part and a critical mass of these remaining moving image records, mostly undiscovered by the public.</p>"

        intro: 'With the support of FIAT/IFTA, the European Broadcasting Union and the Europeana Foundation, the EUscreen Best Practice Network provided access to a highly interoperable digitised collection of television material.'
        body: "<p>Although content is now being digitised and some of it is available online, access to audiovisual archives, television in particular, remains fractured and scattered. This is due to the lack of interoperability, the non-existence of proven scenarios for the use of audiovisual material, the complexity of rights issues and the lack of contextual information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreen tackled these problems by building a network of content providers, standardisation bodies, television research partners and specific user groups by providing multilingual and multicultural access to television heritage. EUscreen developed long-term solutions to rights issues and supported user-led demand and interest for services and content, including the development of use-case scenarios for different contexts (research, learning, leisure and creative reuse). The project also provided contextual information for the available resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreen was a three-year project that began in October 2009. The consortium was comprised of 27 partners from 19 EU member states (plus Switzerland) and 11 associate partners.</p>"

        projecttype: Project
        intro: 'EUscreenXL is a three-year project that aggregates a comprehensive body of professional audiovisual content and makes it accessible through Europeana and the EUscreenXL portal.'
        body: "<p>The project consortium consists of 20 leading audiovisual archives, excellent media scholars, skilled technical service providers and the EBU. The partnership has established alliances with key stakeholders as the Europeana Foundation, FIAT/IFTA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreenXL represents a considerable segment of Europe's creative industries and has a particular strong link to the public service broadcasting community. It provides Europeana with about 1.000.000 metadata records giving access to digital content held by European providers, and 20.000 high quality contextualised programmes for public access on the EUscreen portal (in addition to the 40.000 already present).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreenXL extends thoroughly the operational EUscreen platform. By implementing cloud-based technologies a wide community of content providers will be able to contribute their content to Europeana. By providing functionalities to support quality contextualisation and re-use of digital content the project will use established web 2.0 practices – with a distinct scientifically driven approach. This ensures a balanced access to accurate content. Through three innovative user engagement pilots the project also develops and tests ways of usage within three target groups; the general public (re-use), researchers (digital humanities), and the creative industries (content delivery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreenXL does not only try to define new coming audiovisual practices for the heritage domain and tackle the fragmentation within the audiovisual sector by establishing apt protocols. Most importantly, the project maximises awareness for a shared pan-European audiovisual content policy among archives, heritage institutions and broadcasters across Europe – and, in effect, substantially increases the online presence of digitised audiovisual heritage in Europeana.</p>"

        body: "<p>In the run-up to 2014 and in the following years, strong interest in the topic is expected from a wide variety of users – including the general public, local and family historians, education professionals, archives, museums and historical societies, people working in the media, the arts or in the tourism industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project consortium made available to Europeana 425.000 especially relevant items that have been selected with help from specialists and target user groups according to agreed quality criteria. They span the full range of national library collections including books, newspapers, trench journals, maps, children's literature, posters, pamphlets, propaganda leaflets, medals and coins. The digital collection will go far beyond any existing digital collection on the topic in terms of size, quality and diversity and will make Europeana the first stop for quality content on the \"Great War\". The consortium enlarged the network and encouraged other memory institutions to contribute more relevant content. Europeana Collections 1914-1918 made a vast amount of sources available online for the first time – content that is often rare and highly fragile because of the deteriorating quality of the paper it was produced on and generally only accessible in reading rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The material highlights the importance of WWI for a common European identity and is reflective of the different experiences of individuals and groups on all sides of the conflict including different ethnic, linguistic, political, social and religious communities and those opposed to the war.</p>"

        body: "<p>Within this overall ambition, the main objectives of Europeana Inside are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To open up a significant critical-mass of new digital cultural content from European cultural institutions for delivery through Europeana,</li>\r\n    <li>To simplify significantly the process of contributing content to Europeana for cultural institutions and aggregators of all scales and types throughout Europe,</li>\r\n    <li>To help cultural institutions and aggregators overcome the organisational, technical, legal and financial barriers to participation by part-automating the workflow by which content is made available to Europeana, and creating tools for the management of permissions and licensing,</li>\r\n    <li>To build on the framework of standards and protocols established under previous Europeana projects by ensuring that current and future generations of Collections and Digital Asset Management Software are ‘Europeana-ready'.</li>\r\n    <li>To support metadata enrichment in Content Provider systems (and thereby deliver value to participating organisations and their users) by creating a channel for enhanced content to flow back from Europeana as the central domain aggregator and point of access to local systems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Europeana Inside contributed to a specific content\_increase in\_Europeana of more than 960,000 new records from 15 cultural institutions and 5 national and thematic aggregators in the EU. It also opened up the potential for more than 7000 other cultural institutions (the installed user-base of the participating Technical Partners) to deliver content to Europeana simply and easily in the future – a potential contribution of more than 30 million new records.</p>"

        body: "<p>The content includes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1,200 film and video clips</li>\r\n<li>850,000 images</li>\r\n<li>4.3 million texts (books, journal articles, theses, letters)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Europeana Libraries created a valuable resource for scholars and built a robust network of national, university and research libraries, supported by Europe's major research library organisations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS </strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>5 Million Objects: Digitised books, films and images are freely available online. Subjects range from Oriental manuscripts to Spanish civil war photographs and represent a wide geographical spread that covers the length and breadth of Europe.</li>\r\n<li>Full-text Indexing: This is the first cultural digitisation project that incorporates full-text indexing and searching capabilities. This creates the potential for in-depth academic study of all texts brought together by Europeana Libraries.</li>\r\n<li>Representation: Europeana Libraries provided research libraries with a platform to promote their collections to the widest possible audience. It lays the foundation on which a critical mass of research resources can be based.</li>\r\n<li>Aggregation: This project unites content from several libraries and creates a single channel for contributing library content to Europeana and The European Library. The model is efficient, cost-effective and capable of being extended to research libraries across Europe.</li>\r\n<li>High Quality Metadata: The quality and structure of library metadata will be improved. This will make online searching more accurate and user-friendly. New features such as timelines and maps will also be supported. </li>\r\n</ul>"

        body: "<p>These are testimonies of the circulation of texts and art in Europe in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. They focus on the beginning of European culture in the 8th century – the start of the Carolingian era. Europeana Regia concentrated on three of the most important sets of Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bibliotheca Carolina: masterworks from the main abbeys and bishop schools of the Carolingian Empire (8th-9th centuries), including Reichenau, Saint-Denis, Corbie, Reims, Saint-Amand, Freising, Wissembourg. The manuscripts show the intellectual and artistic activity of these centres of religious life, ecclesiastical and imperial power, and their numerous exchanges of texts and patterns.</li>\r\n    <li>The Library of King Charles V: the most outstanding royal collection of illuminated manuscripts from the 14th century, which was, thanks to the circulation of copies, at the heart of aristocratic culture in France, England, Flanders and Burgundy.</li>\r\n    <li>The Library of the Aragon Kings of Naples: this collection is a unique concentration of masterworks of French, Venetian, Neapolitan, Lombard and Spanish illumination. It is the symbol, beyond political frontiers, of the cultural unity of Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Altogether, Europeana Regia added 874 volumes of manuscripts and over 307,000 images to the Europeana.eu portal, since 2011.</p>\r\n"

        projecttype: Project
        intro: "<p>Europeana V1.0 was a Thematic Network that brought content-holders – libraries, museums, archives and audio-visual collections – together with universities, ministries and heritage strategy bodies.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The core tasks it achieved were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Transformed the Europeana prototype into an operational service</li>\r\n    <li>Developed new features like the timeline, automatic translation and Wikipedia display</li>\r\n    <li>Improved functionality such as better search ranking and ways to refine results, including the ability to filter on the rights field to see only public domain content</li>\r\n    <li>Increased the content accessible through Europeana, bringing the total up to 20 million objects with much better representation across Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To sustain this knowledge-sharing network of over 200 partners beyond the life of the project, the Council of Content Providers and Aggregators (CCPA) was founded. The CCPA is now part of the governanace structure of Europeana, and provides a forum for issues that affect content providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The v1.0 project also developed a long term strategy for Europeana. Although the next phase, version 2.0, is again project funded, Europeana must be seen as a business with a long term future. The Strategic Plan 2011-2015 will focus resources on developing 4 tracks that began in v1.0:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aggregate: sourcing content from across Europe, and fostering a network of aggregators working either at national level (Hispana; Culture Grid) or domain level (European Film Gateway).</li>\r\n    <li>Facilitate: sharing knowledge among cultural heritage professionals through publications, workshops and conferences, and fostering research and development through events like our hackathons.</li>\r\n    <li>Distribute: making their heritage available to users as and when they want it, using, for example, the Europeana API and search widget</li>\r\n    <li>Engage: enabling users to interact with their heritage in new ways, including bringing in user-generated content as the initiative The First World War in Everyday Documents (Erster Weltkrieg in Alltagsdokumenten) has done.</li>\r\n</ul>"

It continues the work of the APEnet project (2009–2012) in which 19 European national archives and Europeana established and released the Archives Portal Europe. With the continued expansion and enhancement of the Archives Portal Europe – in terms of participating countries and institutions, plus available content and services – APEx will contribute to the development of a coherent digital infrastructure which opens up the portal to our common cultural heritage of archives, equally accessible for citizens, researchers, businesses and governments alike. Funded and supported by the European Commission within the framework of the Information and Technology Policy Support Programme (ICT-PSP), APEx runs from March 2012 until February 2015.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The thinkMOTION project as part of Europeana led to the world's largest, free access digital library of content in the field of motion systems, which is essential for all technical domains.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The thinkMOTION project helped to make a significant improvement in the quantity and quality of digital content and established a new kind of digital library in Europeana with focus on technical knowledge. It covered both the cradle of technical knowledge of mankind and the rapid technical progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collected material was processed and presented immediately in a multilingual interactive portal via Europeana. Here, the techno-cultural heritage and the current developments in motion science is preserved and made accessible for a wide range of European user groups like interested laymen, engineers, scientists, lecturers, students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provided interactive material led to a deeper understanding and motivates to learn more about the scientific and technical background in a European society of lifelong learning. Very different types of content like textual sources, physical models and drawings have been collected by partners in several European countries whereby the connections to the national communities and institutions ease the acquisition of content and the rights of use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the library, new ways of content representation, information retrieval (supported by a multilingual semantic network) and cross linking are supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thinkMOTION project as part of the Europeana has also a worldwide dimension. It allows the first publication of forgotten \"treasures\" to honour the creative genius of the countless European inventors and engineers, which have enabled the technical progress and our high standard of living. It is time to accept that the European cultural heritage is not only defined by artworks or philosophic and religious essays but also defined by technical developments. The thinkMOTION project understands itself as the initial project in this direction.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>EuropeanaConnect worked on the integration of semantic search options and, therefore, the project has significantly improved and deepened the possibility for end-users to discover the online holdings of European museums, archives, libraries and audiovisual institutions. Europeana is able to automatically find and suggest materials that are related to a particular object a user just found. This is done by answering \"What person, place, time period or event is related to the object the user is looking at now?\" Furthermore, the project has opened new ways of discovering cultural heritage in Europeana by offering users the possibility to browse and search in time and space. It has also made Europeana accessible from your mobile phone or PDA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaConnect streamlined the transfer of digitised cultural objects from museums, archives, libraries and audiovisual institutions across Europe to the Europeana headquarters in the Netherlands. It also took major steps to tackle copyright-related problems that prevented European cultural heritage from being discovered, used and re-used by users worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, EuropeanaConnect added around 290,000 audio tracks from more than 500 European archives to Europeana.</p>\r\n"

With a focus on geographic locality and local heritage it will provide over 4 million items of new content to Europeana, aggregation services, new tools, support and training to the participating cultural institutions. It started on 1st March 2013 and will run for three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific objectives of LoCloud are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Supporting small and medium-sized institutions in making their content and metadata available to Europeana, by using cloud computing technologies to reduce technical, semantic and skills barriers.</li>\r\n    <li>Aggregating content for the local heritage, with a special focus on geographic location, and making it available to Europeana users.</li>\r\n    <li>Implementing MINT and MORE to provide aggregation services for LoCloud, building on the results of CARARE and other projects to support the continued development of these systems.</li>\r\n    <li>Exploring and trialling the potential to develop cloud based services and applications suitable for small and medium sized institutions to support metadata enrichment, mapping, harvesting and aggregation.</li>\r\n    <li>Making available a light-weight digital library system suitable for small and medium sized cultural institution.</li>\r\n    <li>Developing a ‘default' infrastructure for metadata from smaller institutions, not currently aggregated by other aggregators.</li>\r\n    <li>Providing guidance, training and support facilities to serve the needs of content providers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The project builds on the achievements of CARARE (2010-2013) in establishing a repository-based aggregator for Archaeological and Architectural heritage; and of Europeana Local (2008-2011) in its work with local institutions and their regional and national aggregators, which resulted in the contribution of nearly 5 million items to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consortium of LoCloud is composed of 32 partners including technical partners, content providers, aggregating services and partners with expertise in specific areas relevant to the project work.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Beginning in 2010, Judaica Europeana partners digitised and uploaded to Europeana 3.7 million items. They include 3,611,000 pages from books, newspapers and archives; 62,000 photographs, postcards and museum objects; 23,000 sound files of music and oral history.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Judaica Europeana worked with libraries, archives and museums to provide integrated access to digital collections, which documented the Jewish presence and heritage in Europe. This content will continue to grow with the second stage of the project (2012-2014) as new partners provide access to their digital collections to be integrated in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Judaica Europeana network is involved - through the European Association for Jewish Culture - in the Digitized Manuscripts to Europeana (DM2E) and the AthenaPlus projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Judaica's achievements</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Documentation</strong> of Jewish expression in Europe: Judaica encouraged and supported content-holders in identifying Jewish content in their collections that reflects the activities, creativity and self-expression of Jews in European cities.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Digitisation and aggregation</strong> of this content: A coherent thematic collection has been created and incorporated into Europeana: Standards were coordinated across institutions in order to synchronise the metadata with the interoperability requirements of Europeana.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Deployment</strong> of knowledge management tools: These enable communities of practice to adapt and apply controlled vocabularies, thesauri and ontologies for the indexing, retrieval and re-use of the aggregated content pertinent to their own areas of interest.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Use</strong>\_of the digitised content: Judaica Europeana digital collections are available in scholarship and academic research; university-based teaching; online learning; museum curatorship and virtual exhibitions; events and initiatives of cultural institutions; cultural tourism; and formal and informal education.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Judaica facts</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Judaica Europeana was launched in January 2010 and concluded successfully in February 2012. It was co-funded by the eContentplus programme of the European Commission.</li>\r\n    <li>The second stage of Judaica Europeana began in March 2012. Project partners formed a network and a consortium under a Memorandum of Understanding to enable continued growth and enrichment of digital Jewish content published in Europeana.</li>\r\n    <li>The network is led by the European Association for Jewish Culture, London in association with the Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universität, Frankfurt and the National Library of Israel.</li>\r\n    <li>It has 27 associated partner institutions in Europe, Israel and the US.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        title: HOPE
        subtitle: 'Heritage of People''s Europe'
        projecttype: Project
        intro: "<p>The 850,000 items that HOPE has contributed to Europeana cover themes such as the emancipation movement, environmentalism and equal rights for immigrants. The collections feature a broad range of items such as posters, periodicals and films.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>HOPE was\_a Best Practice Network comprised of social history institutions across Europe, including archives, libraries and museums. It improved access to the vast amount of highly significant but scattered digital collections on 19th- and 20th-century European social history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Promoting the adoption of standards and best practices for digital libraries amongst its partners was key to achieving HOPE's goals. HOPE also ensured that the metadata and the content became available through Europeana and the Labour History Portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOPE implemented a full-scale discovery-to-delivery (d2d) model that allowed people to find and access resources from a variety of sources, including organisational websites, search engines, social media and other special-interest sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, HOPE sought to achieve economies of scale both in terms of technical infrastructure and technical expertise by implementing a shared and sustainable demand-supply chain between Europeana and the envisaged digital social history resource. This large-scale implementation was built on a web services infrastructure, as introduced above, and used existing, open-source technologies, software and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, HOPE aligns with Objective 2.2 of the European Digital Library ICT-PSP programme – to increase the amount of quality content available through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Activities and Outcomes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The HOPE approach combined consensus-building and awareness-raising activities with the implementation of an infrastructure for metadata dissemination and digital content delivery functions. The outcomes include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A social history metadata aggregator that collects the available data (metadata and preview/thumbnails and direct link to digital objects) and ensures interoperability with Europeana. The aggregator services are based on the existing <a href=\"http://www.driver-community.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DRIVER technlogy\">DRIVER</a> technologies developed by <a href=\"http://www.isti.cnr.it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CNR-ISTI\">CNR-ISTI</a>. The aggregator supplies the data to Europeana by use of the Europeana metadata ingestion tools.</li>\r\n    <li>A social history content repository for Best Practice Network partners who are not able to create and maintain a sustainable digital collection management facility for themselves, due to lack of expertise and technical resources. The shared repository provides basic storage, management and access services and ensures the transparent and straightforward location and delivery of digital content.</li>\r\n    <li>An upgraded version of the existing <a href=\"http://www.labourhistory.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Labour History Portal\">Labour History Portal</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Improved quality of the content, the metadata and the service delivery through sharing best practices in digitisation, metadata harmonisation, digital curation, web service delivery logistics and re-use of content.</li>\r\n    <li>Engagement of the community of social history institutions through awareness-raising, support and access to facilities offered by the Best Practice Network, and by taking new content providers on board as the project proceeds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Impact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By aggregating digital content from unique and authoritative collections in its domain, HOPE brought together a significant pillar of European history to the Europeana audience, thereby enhancing the quality of the historical experience and stimulating discovery in primary source materials never before disclosed to users on such a large scale.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>EuropeanaTravel had two main objectives as a project: Its first objective was to digitise a substantial number of resources from major university libraries and national libraries of Europe to make them available via Europeana. The materials included books, maps, manuscripts, photos, film negatives, postcards and other types of objects related to the theme of travel and tourism, one of the priority content themes identified by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether EuropeanaTravel digitised some 4,000 maps, 16,000 images and 20,000 texts. The second objective was to further strengthen collaboration between <a href=\"http://www.cenl.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CENL\">CENL</a> and <a href=\"http://www.libereurope.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LIBER\">LIBER</a> , aimed at increasing human interoperability in support of Europeana. In addition to that, the project delivered an aggregation service, a tool which enabled LIBER member institutions to aggregate their materials in order to be included into the Europeana portal. The service was developed in a scalable way to enable any research library to use it. This collaboration led on directly to the Europeana Libraries project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An exhibition of some of the material digitized by the project called <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition-travel-history/\">Travelling Through History</a> can be found of The European Library's site.</p>\r\n"

        subtitle: 'EUROPEAN Ancient PHOTOgraphic vintaGe repositoRies of digitAized Pictures of Historic qualitY'
        projecttype: Project
        intro: "<p>EuropeanaPhotography is a digitisation project playing a key role in ensuring that digital content related to ancient photography is accessible in Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In fact, Europeana has an impressive mass of images mostly representing cultural objects while photographic images, the early ones in particular, are underrepresented. EuropeanaPhotography will fill this gap by providing photographic masterpieces from 1839, with the first example of images from Fox Talbot and Daguerre, to the beginning of the Second World War (1939).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EuropeanaPhotography consortium puts together 19 partners coming from 13 Member States; they are private and public leading photographic agencies and cultural institutions holding important photographic collections. This public-private partnership is quite unique in the Europeana group of projects; the private partners will demonstrate how they can derive commercial value from participation in Europeana while the public ones will show how to derive benefits from their cooperation with the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EuropeanaPhotography content providers are digitising over 430,000 photographic items for Europeana; the provided metadata will be made available in all the 11 languages spoken in the partners' countries. This core of documents will illustrate historical moments of the European life, landscapes and people, home and clothes, social and economic changes. The collections will be organised upon four main themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Places (cities – as the transformation of Paris by Haussmann and of Barcelona by Gaudi -, landscape – as the country side in Europe in the 19th century);</li>\r\n    <li>People (portraits as Queen Victoria, the Popes, Garibaldi, and Coco Chanel -, daily life, etc.);</li>\r\n    <li>Events (political events – as la Commune de Paris -, local and civil wars, royal weddings);</li>\r\n    <li>Trends or movements (industrial revolution, women's emancipation, artistic movements, geographic explorations).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Dissemination and promotion involve several activities and tools: beside the official website, EuropeanaPhotography owns a dedicated showcase inside <a href=\"http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net\">www.digitalmeetsculture.net</a> online magazine, and will be present in scientific publications and periodicals. The public sector of the cultural institutions and the private/commercial sector of the photographic archives are the target sectors of dissemination.</p>\r\n"

Besides risk management, content quality and corruption control measures, the framework addresses audiovisual signal migration and multivalent preservation methods using federated services for distributing and storing content.</p>\r\n"

        title: PATHS
        subtitle: 'Personalised Access to Cultural Heritage Spaces'
        projecttype: Project
        intro: "<p>PATHS created a system that acts as an interactive, personalised tour guide through existing digital library collections.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>PATHS enabled and supported:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>personalised paths through digital library collections</li>\r\n    <li>suggestions about items to look at and assist in their interpretation,</li>\r\n    <li>users' knowledge discovery and exploration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Significant amounts of cultural heritage material are now available through online digital library portals. However, this vast amount of cultural heritage material can also be overwhelming for many users who are provided with little or no guidance on how to find and interpret this information. The situation is very different in museums and galleries where items are organised thematically and users guided through the collection. PATHS aims at making it easier for users to explore cultural heritage material by taking them along a trial, or pathway, created by experts, by themselves or by other users. The PATHS system will offer suggestions about items to look at and assist in their interpretation. Navigation will be based around the metaphor of a path through the collection. A path can be based around any theme, for example, artist and media (paintings by Picasso), historic periods (the Cold War), places (Venice) and famous people (Muhammad Ali). Users will be able to construct their own paths or follow pre-defined ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PATHS and Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other cultural heritage portals, access to content in Europeana is currently based on hand-crafted catalogues which use specialised terminology. PATHS will make use of automated techniques to mine cultural heritage sources online for the purpose of building ontologies and significantly enhancing existing domain knowledge and vocabularies. Since PATHS is a research project, it will focus on two core languages, English and Spanish, to demonstrate that the technologies being developed are general. The services developed by PATHS will be demonstrated to the cultural heritage and research communities by using data from the Europeana and Alinari websites. The goal will be to evaluate the services in field trials with users and to evaluate the potential of the services for implementation in other cultural heritage websites and digital library portals. The PATHS project will make use of content from Europeana and will contribute to the Digital Agenda for Europe by creating new ways for users to participate in their cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>3D-ICONS is a pilot project funded under the European Commission's ICT Policy Support Programme which builds on the results of CARARE and 3D-COFORM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public fascination with the architectural and archaeological heritage is well known, it is proven to be one of the main reasons for tourism according to the UN World Tourism Organisation. Historic buildings and archaeological monuments form a significant component Europe's cultural heritage, they are the physical testimonies of European history and of the different events that led to the creation of the European landscape, as we know it today. The project will exploit existing tools and methods, to integrate them in a complete supply chain of 3D digitization to contribute a significant mass of 3D content to Europeana. The project will focus on UNESCO World Heritage monuments and other monuments of outstanding value at European level, to illustrate a particular strand of Europe's history. The digital content will include overall 3D models and reconstructions, enlarged models of important details, images, texts, videos. It will also include and re-contextualize in 3D, objects belonging to a monument but presently located elsewhere, for example in a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project's activities will include both new digitization as well as the conversion of some existing 3D data into formats which are accessible for Europeana users. The project's anticipated impact is making accessible through Europeana an unprecedented quantity of high-quality, 3D, well-organized and attractive information about the masterpieces of European architecture and archaeology.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Partage Plus digitised over 76 thousand pieces of content for ingestion into Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Why Art Nouveau?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Art Nouveau style was a great success all over Europe at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. It is well represented, in almost every art form, in museum collections, archives, libraries, photographic archives, and on buildings throughout Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short period of disinterest, with the arrival of modernist styles, it seems that Art Nouveau is now even more popular than ever. Because of this Partage Plus can count on an immense interest from a range of specialists, and from the public in general, who wish to know more about the masterful creations in this imaginative style. The objects, paintings, drawings, and sculptures from that period are now appreciated for the masterpieces of craftsmanship and originality they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore Art Nouveau monuments are now recognized by UNESCO on their World Heritage List as significant contributions to cultural heritage. Partage Plus will create an access point to information (through the project website) and digital content (through Europeana) on the European cultural heritage of the Art Nouveau period. It provides a means and a structure for the digitisation of content from different domains and different countries and making it available for citizens using Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Partage Plus?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Partage Plus digitised over 76 thousand pieces of content for ingestion into Europeana.

        body: "<p>A wealth of digital cultural heritage is currently available in on-line repositories and digital archives. It is however accessed only in a limited way and utilised through rather static modes of delivery. meSch will bridge the gap between visitors’ cultural heritage experience on-site and on-line by providing a platform for the creation of tangible smart exhibits. This platform will enable curators, artists, designers and cultural heritage professionals in general to create smart objects and intelligent spaces and to compose digital content to be embedded in smart objects and spaces without the need for specialised technical knowledge. Smart objects (like a magnifying glass or a replica) are enriched with digital technology while intelligent spaces embed sensors: both react to people, spaces and smart objects. A bespoke application will adapt the content and the behaviour of the object or space to visitors, their social context and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meSch approach is grounded on principles of co-design: the participation of designers, developers and stake-holders into the process of creation and evaluation as equal partners, and on a Do-It-Yourself philosophy of making and experimenting. Three large-scale case studies in different museums provide test beds for the real-world evaluation of meSch technology with the public and cultural heritage stakeholders.</p>\r\n"

The success of the idea – which became the Great War Archive – had\_encouraged Europeana, Europe's digital archive, library and museum, to bring other national institutions across Europe into an alliance with Oxford University. The collaboration brought\_European stories online alongside their British, German, Slovenian, Luxembourgian, Irish, etc. counterparts in a World War One stories collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Project partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>University of Oxford (<a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.ox.ac.uk</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Provinzialbibliothek Amberg Staatliche Bibliothek (<a href=\"http://www.provinzialbibliothek-amberg.de/\">http://www.provinzialbibliothek-amberg.de/</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>German National Library – die Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (<a href=\"http://www.d-nb.de\">http://www.d-nb.de</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>National Library of Luxembourg – Biblitothèque du Luxembourg (<a href=\"http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/bibliotheque/index.html\">http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/bibliotheque/index.html</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>National Library of Ireland (<a href=\"http://www.nli.ie\">http://www.nli.ie</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>National Library of Slovenia – Narodna in univerzitetna knjižnica (<a href=\"http://www.nuk.uni-lj.si/nukeng.asp\">http://www.nuk.uni-lj.si/nukeng.asp</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Museum of Jutland, Sønderborg Castle Denmark - <span style=\"margin-top: 0pt;\">Museum Sønderjylland, </span><span class=\"Overskrift1\">Sønderborg Slot</span> (<a href=\"http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk\">http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Ministry of Culture Denmark (<a href=\"http://www.kum.dk/\">http://www.kum.dk/</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>Military Museum of the Slovenian Armed Forces <a href=\"http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/main.aspx%20\">(http://www.vojaskimuzej.si/main.aspx )</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Celje Public Library <a href=\"http://www.ce.sik.si/\">(http://www.ce.sik.si/)</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Europeana (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus.html\">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus.html</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A partnership of European cultural heritage associations that have joined forces to bring together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual archives.

This phase of the project focused\_on European items: letters, postcards, photographs and stories from Germany, Luxembourg, Ireland, Slovenia and the UK. Contributions were made in\_two ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918 website</a> - add a picture of the item or type in the story online.<br>\r\n2. At Family History Roadshows - bring the item(s) to the event where project staff will photograph the items and record the stories that go with them</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Family History Roadshows, members of the public were\_invited to bring their documents, artefacts and stories from the First World War to be recorded by the project staff. The stories and scanned or photographed images of the objects were\_then added to the archive.<br><br>\r\nOur Family History Roadshows began in Germany in 2011, and since then we have visited many more countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Online story collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The online story collection opened in March 2011. At the website, anyone could\_add their objects to the collection together with their stories. The objects that were\_submitted were\_checked by the project team and then made available through Europeana.</p>\r\n"

These include ministries and responsible government agencies, content providers and aggregators, leading research centres, publishers and SMEs. The Europeana Foundation was involved as subcontractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several partners participated in related Europeana ecosystem projects; this guarantees alignment with Europeana's evolution.

        body: "<p>However, an impressive abundance of high quality digital content that is available in Natural History Museums (NHMs) around Europe remains largely unexploited due to a number of barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe is a project co-funded by EC under the ICT-PSP programme which suggests a coordinated solution at European level in order to overcome such barriers, by connecting the digital collections of a number of European NHMs with Europeana, and studying the educational methods and deploy the necessary software tools that will allow museum educators to design innovative online pathways through the digital collections of NHMs. To this end, the federation of the Natural Europe digital libraries aims to facilitate: storage, search and retrieval of digital content that is related to Natural History; as well as search and retrieval of content objects related to educational objectives and curricula on Natural History, Environmental Education, and Biological Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this, Natural Europe will design and deploy novel graphical interfaces that facilitate the navigation of educational pathways within digital collections, both from Europeana and the NHMs' Web sites. It will also adapt and tests innovative interactive installations at the NHMs that will allow visitors to follow educational pathways through Europeana's content on Natural History and Sciences, as part of the Museums' exhibition. Finally, it will evaluate and validate the delivered services/solutions through extensive pilot trials with project-internal and external organisations and user groups.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The OpenUp! project aims to mobilise the multimedia information using the existing information networks in the biodiversity research domain and links these networks to the Europeana portal. Access is based on the established technical infrastructure of the Biological Collection Access Service (BioCASE) that also feeds into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The project addresses a number of key issues, namely, technical interoperability, metadata standards, and adaptation of Europeana workflow and harvesting procedures. It will also look at best practices for rights' clearance and IPR management of natural history multimedia. In addition, there is a multilingual enrichment of metadata to facilitate access by a wide European cultural audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem co-ordinates the project co-funded by the ICT PSP Work Programme. The project started in March 2011 and runs until February 2014.\_More than 800,000 multimedia objects have already been made available to Europeana by April 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Expected results</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Distributing natural history multimedia content through Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>Mapping and enrichment of metadata towards compliance with Europeana standards</li>\r\n    <li>Adding data providers for multimedia content</li>\r\n    <li>Incorporation of multilingual metadata, in particular common names of organisms</li>\r\n    <li>Development of a consistent copyright strategy for participating data providers</li>\r\n</ul>"

Its ICT-research program covers the range from small embedded systems, to sensor networks and on to large scale networks, from interaction data, to numerical content and on to text and pictorial web content. Ten universities, five technological institutes, and over sixty small and large businesses participate in fifteen public-private multi-party projects (for a full overview see Projects). They ensure direct state-of-the-art knowledge transfer in an economic or societal urgent area. Like ICT science drives the solving of societal challenges, societal challenges drive need-inspired ICT research as well.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Presto4U is a two-year project supported by a core group of 14 PrestoCentre member organsations. The project will deliver new tools and services to connect the different constituencies involved in AV media preservation: expert users, who understand the problems and require technological solutions; researchers who can develop the fundamental knowledge; and technology providers who can commercialize research results as sustainable tools and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project helps PrestoCentre to put a special emphasis on meeting the needs of smaller collections, private sector media owners and new stakeholders. The project will establish nine communities of practice in AV digital preservation, each based on a shared concern, a shared set of problems and a common pursuit of technological solutions related to the particular custodial practices and preservation challenges in a principal sub-sector of AV media. These communities of practice, collectively and individually, will function as a crucial reference point and exchange environment, pooling the available expertise between the academic research, media, culture and industry sectors.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Creative'
        subtitle: null
        projecttype: Project
        intro: "<p>Europeana Creative was a European project which enabled\_and promoted\_greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by creative industries.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/90892256\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was launched at the end of February 2013 at the Austrian National Library in Vienna and ran for 30 months. 26 partners from 14 European countries with diverse backgrounds contributed to the project. These included content providing institutions with world famous collections, creative industry hubs and organisations, the tourism and education sectors, living labs, software developers and multimedia experts, as well as think tanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project set\_out to demonstrate that Europeana, which provides access to more than 30 million digitised cultural heritage objects from Europe's libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections, can facilitate the creative re-use of digital cultural heritage content and associated metadata. Partners developed a number of pilot applications focused on design, tourism, education and social networks. Building on these pilots, a series of open innovation challenges were launched with entrepreneurs from the creative industries to identify, incubate and spin-off more viable projects into the commercial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project goals were supported by an open laboratory network (the Europeana Labs), an on- and offline environment for experimentation with content, tools and business services, and a licensing framework where content holders can specify the re-use conditions for their material. The project was\_supported by continuous evaluation and business modelling development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/125688698\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The re-use of digital content is an essential part of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Several activities are already stimulating the re-use of cultural heritage in order to demonstrate the social and economic value of cultural content. With the publication of the Europeana metadata under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) in September 2012, further development of innovative applications based on this metadata is now possible. Europeana Creative took this a step further by facilitating re-use of the digital objects themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Project partners </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian National Library</a>, Austria<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Foundation</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://image.ntua.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">National Technical University of Athens</a>, Greece<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Kennisland</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://innovation.mfg.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">MFG Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg, Innovation Agency for ICT and Media Baden-Württemberg</a>, Germany<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ebn.eu\" target=\"_blank\">European Business &amp; Innovation Centre Network</a>, Belgium<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ecbnetwork.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">European Creative Business Network</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org\" target=\"_blank\">Platoniq Sistema Cultural</a>, Spain<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EUN Partnership / European Schoolnet</a>, Belgium<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ait.ac.at\" target=\"_blank\">AIT Austrian Institute of Technology</a>, Austria<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Spild af Tid</a>, Denmark<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.shiftdesign.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Shift </a>(formerly <a href=\"http://wearewhatwedo.org\" target=\"_blank\">We Are What We Do Community Interest Company</a>), United Kingdom<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.semantika.si/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantika</a>, Slovenia<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://webtic.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Webtic</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ontotext.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ontotext</a>, Bulgaria<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.exozet.com\" target=\"_blank\">Exozet Games</a>, Germany<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.plurio.net\" target=\"_blank\">Agence luxembourgeoise d'action culturelle</a>, Luxembourg<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weareculture24.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Culture24</a>, United Kingdom<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu\" target=\"_blank\">EUROCLIO – European Association of History Educators</a>, The Netherlands<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://mlab.taik.fi/\" target=\"_blank\">Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture</a>, Finland<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum</a>, Czech Republic<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum für Naturkunde – Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung</a>, Germany<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/soundarchive\" target=\"_blank\">The British Library</a>, United Kingdom<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.openlivinglabs.eu\" target=\"_blank\">European Network of Living Labs</a>, Belgium<br>\r\nRamulus Ltd., United Kingdom</p>\r\n"

        subtitle: null
        projecttype: TaskForce
        intro: "<p>This Task Force focused on an application profile that would allow a better representation of the FRBR group 1 entities: work, expression, manifestation and item.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile Task Force (EFAP-TF) was launched in response to the recommendations from the deliverable D3.4 from Europeana V1.0. This deliverable asked for an application profile that would allow a better representation of the FRBR group 1 entities: work, expression, manifestation, and item. Additionally, it was to be conceived as an application profile of FRBRoo where each intellectual contribution (e.g., in the publication process) and the related activity are treated as entities in their own right and do not depend too much on the notion of a bibliographic record. As a starting point, they suggested the mapping of FRBRoo and EDM offered by the CIDOC CRM working group. The aim of the EFAP-TF was\_to extend, correct or restrict this suggested mapping and provide examples for the use of the combined EDM and FRBRoo namespaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report delivers combined models in terms of properties and classes of EDM and FRBRoo illustrated by sample data. Smaller groups have worked on three different examples. The report also provides principles for modeling and mapping rules based on the experiments of the working groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Find the report and its annexes below:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/EDM_FRBRoo//TaskfoApplication%20Profile%20EDM-FRBRoo.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Final Report on EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile Task Force</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Details of the annexes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hamlet examples</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Musical work examples</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Don Quixote example Available at <a href=\"http://november.idi.ntnu.no/frbrized/rest/db/edm/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://november.idi.ntnu.no/frbrized/rest/db/edm/index.html</a> and archived here</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">1. MOTIVATION </span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The deliverable <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/EDM_FRBRoo/D3.4%20final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Final Technical &amp; Logical Architecture and future work recommendations (D3.4) </a>from Europeana V1.0, WP3 makes the following statement:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">\"The distinction between the work, expression, manifestation, and item will be relevant for the resources that are aggregated in Europeana. Functionality may be required to group results under the work level (e.g. all copies of all digital files in any format that contain all performances of a composition), under the expression level (e.g. all digital files in any format of a particular performance of a composition), or under the manifestation level (e.g. all digital files in a particular format of a particular performance of a composition). The framework of reference, however, should not so much be the original FRBR specification (which still is too much depending on the notion of a bibliographic record!) but rather the FRBRoo approach, in which each aggregate is treated as an entity in its own right. Note that a mapping of FRBRoo and EDM is offered by CIDOC.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The creation of this Task Force (EFAP-TF) reacted\_to this statement and is intended to start from the mapping provided by CIDOC eventually extending, correcting or restricting it and providing examples for the use of the combined EDM and FRBRoo namespace clusters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">2. SCOPE </span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Activities included:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Checking the mapping proposed by CIDOC available at <a href=\"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/EDM-DC-ORE-CRM-FRBR_Integration_ORE_fix.ppt\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cidoc-crm.org/docs/EDM-DC-ORE-CRM-FRBR_Integration_ORE_fix.ppt</a></span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Collecting data samples illustrating the possible use of the combined namespaces</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Identifying a relevant subset of classes and properties for the information integration scenario characteristic for Europeana, possibly a core set.</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Providing use cases for the combined namespaces</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The group did not\_work on primary cataloging in whatever format which is regarded as a provider task. Therefore, the group only dealt with the\_mapping of existing data formats into an extended EDM model, and at most with guidelines to use a core set of properties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">3. DELIVERABLE</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The Task Force on the EDM FRBRoo extension\_successfully delivered a\_report\_on:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Combined model in terms of properties and classes including sample data</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Principles for modeling and mapping rules</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This deliverable benefits all those wishing to model derivative relations in EDM and may also help to clarify a future strategy regarding RDA compliant metadata and the way these are mapped to EDM.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">4.

The motivation and the scope of the Task Force are defined in the Task Force Charter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Analyzing the datasets, we found that enrichment flaws can be caused during one of the three stages that the metadata undergoes until it is displayed in Europeana:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Creation of the metadata by the provider.</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mapping to EDM.</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Ingestion into Europeana.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"s1\">During the process of enrichment itself, two choices are key to success or failure:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">the vocabulary used for enrichment, and</span></li>\r\n    <li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">the rules established for using the right terms for enrichment (on the target and the source side).</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The task force revealed the common obstacles in automatic semantic enrichments and provided recommendations to overcome some of these issues.

        intro: "<p>The Task Force collected mappings to and extensions of the Europeana Data Model, documenting and summarising work from different partners and projects into an overall 'big picture'.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Many projects and partners have been working on different extensions, refinements and mappings as a way to enable data interoperability with other Europeana data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By extending and refining EDM they minimised the loss of data from their original metadata format on conversion to EDM. Also, it provides them with a way to specify the level of granularity of the metadata descriptions. Since the creation of the EDM many of these mappings and refinements have been created without a central reference that would provide an overview of all. The task force has collected mappings to and extensions of EDM, documenting and summarising work from different partners and projects into an overall 'big picture'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mappings, refinements and extensions have been collected and organised in a <strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3NvCLTMRUFjrgkZNGp6MScAcUELIXHv2-GDxozAL9k/edit#gid=0\">spreadsheet.</a></strong> It provides further details on the various types of documentation collected by the Task Force and a direct access to the technical specifications of those mappings.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A mapping to EDM is any kind of specification (e.g., a concordance table) of relationships and equivalences between two metadata formats or models, e.g., between EDM and another metadata schema.</li>\r\n    <li>A refinement of EDM or EDM Application Profile is any kind of specialisation of EDM to meet specific needs of the data provider.</li>\r\n    <li>An extension to EDM is required when existing EDM classes and properties cannot represent the semantics of providers’ data with sufficient details.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of\_the Task Force has highlighted the need to coordinate and collect the mappings, refinements and extensions produced by Europeana data providers and related projects. Based on the analysis the Task Force provides a few recommendations for data providers and projects doing similar interoperability efforts. The work of the Task Force was limited to the identification, collection and documentation of the mappings, refinements and extensions but there is definitely a need to continue these efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaired by Valentine Charles (EuropeanaFoundation) and Marlies Olensky (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin).</p>\r\n"

We have tried to do this in a way that we hope will facilitate identification and use of services relevant to the application that needs them. This includes general considerations on the diversity of the processes at hand and a focus on interoperability issues.</li>\r\n    <li>further developed criteria to select datasets for semantic enrichment and illustrate with a thorough analysis of selected examples</li>\r\n    <li>explored methodological issues for the evaluation of semantic enrichment services</li>\r\n    <li>performed a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of seven enrichment services on a same subset of the Europeana dataset, containing 17.300 records.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This report, together with its two companion documents and a data space on the Europeana Assembla, presents all this.

For this purpose, the Europeana Data Model contains the field ‘EDM:rights'. This field is mandatory and data providers must provide specific values selected from a limited list. Since the beginning of 2012, it has become clear that the limited list of options that is currently being provided does not cover all needs encountered by Europeana's data providers. One example of this is books that are digitised by Google. Generally, these works are in the public domain, but because of exclusivity clauses contained in the agreements between Google and the libraries, commercial uses of these works are not allowed by parties other than Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current options for ‘EDM:rights' are not granular enough to express situations like these and need to be updated, this task force adressed this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outcome: </strong>This task force resulted in the attached document setting forth a recommendation extending the amount of rights labels avaialable to data providers.</p>"

        title: 'EuropeanaTech FLOSS'
        subtitle: null
        projecttype: TaskForce
        intro: "<p>The EuropeanaTech task force on the FLOSS Inventory enriched, improved and structured\_the Inventory which contains over 300 free, open source tools relevant for the EuropeanaTech community.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As part of Europeana v 2.0 WP7, The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision established the FLOSS Inventory. The FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software) Inventory is a list of aggregated metadata for software relevant for the digital heritage domain. Currently, the Inventory has 307 entries, which reside in a standard Google Sheet and is the only place where Europeana Project R&amp;D results are visible. Everyone who is interested is free to contribute new and improve existing entries to the inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its incarnation, the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOoQiXFjGyR3oEubdLdkfCat7V4TsNLnEXGOJWkJ63c/edit#gid=516255520&amp;vpid=D2\">FLOSS Inventory</a> has grown and has been enriched drastically. Close to 100 tools have in-depth reviews, which add an additional layer of information about the usefulness of these tools. The list is currently managed by the EuropeanaTech Community Manager</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FLOSS Inventory’s target audience expands further than the obvious Europeana DCH developer community and has already attracted the intention of international institutions, including Stanford University, Northwestern University, DigitalNZ, DPLA, George Mason University, Berkley University and the DiRT Directory team (a similar inventory for the digital humanities). Furthermore, the inventory’s contents are relevant for re-users (tailored lists for hackathons) and smaller institutions looking to creatively reuse content with OS platforms (Omeka, Timeline.JS, Storymap.JS, Islanadora, Amplifon).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the Inventory could be significantly improved. The FLOSS Inventory is intended to be the go-to place for information about and access to free and open source software relevant for the EuropeanaTech Community, Europeana Network, and international digital heritage sector. In order for this to become possible, several key measures need to be taken, which this Task Force aims to address:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enrichment and Improvement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As per the request of the European Commission, and from the inherent necessity to make the FLOSS Inventory something more than a simple list of tools, this Task Force investigate ways to improve the current FLOSS Inventory. This will be done in several ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Standardizing necessary fields: not every field is necessary or pertinent to the users. The TF will assess which fields are most important and easy to maintain as to not have a plethora of out-dated information on the list.</li>\r\n    <li>All these fields for existing tools and new tools will be updated as thoroughly as possible, most importantly, checking for dead or broken links.</li>\r\n    <li>List cleanse: any tools that have been inactive for several years and/or contain no documentation will be removed. This is to maintain a certain level of quality over quantity within the inventory.</li>\r\n    <li>Reviews: TF Members will be asked to review FLOSS entries. The reviews will cover the following aspects: Quality of Documentation, Ease of Adaptation, Code Quality.</li>\r\n    <li>A similar directory has been developed for Digital Humanities called the <a href=\"http://dirtdirectory.org/\">DiRT Directory</a>. The Task Force will assess the overlap between the two directories and investigate directions for collaboration.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Gathering new software</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the FLOSS Inventory has 307 entries. While the list covers many of the paramount technical aspects of digital cultural heritage, we believe that more software is open and freely available, even from within the Europeana Network. As part of this Task Force, we would like to create a critical mass of aggregation. The difficulty of this simply lies with a number of contributors to the inventory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While quantity is an easy measure of success, the FLOSS Inventory will not have a KPI based on the number of tools, but rather success and quality will be measured based on how well represented each aspect of OSS relevant for digital humanities and digital cultural heritage is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All new entries will be required to have reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Improvement of software taxonomy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage software is diverse. Many aspects of software and informatics are relevant for institutions and developers in the sector. From tools that enable the re-use of metadata or content, backend Collection Management Systems (CMS), cataloging software, to front-end exhibition and presentation systems. The field is extremely diverse and vast. Due to this broad scope, it is imperative that software added to the inventory fit into a proper taxonomy to improve findability of relevant tools. This section will also take into consideration the Digital Humanities taxonomy,<a href=\"https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH\"> TaDiRAH </a>used by the DiRT Directory. The outcomes of the TF will primarily be visible in the Inventory itself. However, in relation to section 1, an overview of the process and selection of new tags and classifications of DCH OS tools will be drafted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sustainability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The FLOSS Inventory was developed as part of Europeana v 2.0, enriched and improved as part of Europeana v 3.0 and will continue to be maintained by the product owner (NISV) in conjunction with the EuropeanaTech team as part of the Europeana DSI.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Data Quality Committee has developed, together with aggregators, the metadata component of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, based on three quality \"pillars\". The first one is based on the languages in which metadata records are provided, following Europeana's <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-multilingual-strategy\">multilingual strategy</a>. The second follows the recommendations of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee#discovery-user-scenarios\">Discovery - User Scenarios</a> and relies on \"enabling metadata elements\". These enabling elements are desirable but optional - including them supports functionalities for a specific set of usage scenarios, beyond the fundamental minimum for all metadata descriptions defined by mandatory elements. The third pillar is based on the use of \"contextual classes\" that provide <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\">richer semantics</a> to metadata. More information can be found <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-a-metadata-standard-for-digital-culture-the-story-of-the-europeana-publishing-framework\">here</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>This Task Force evaluated the terms of reference, procedures activities and requirements\_for Task Forces and Working Groups.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>One of the important tasks of the Members Council is to encourage Network Association Members to take part in the activities for maintaining and improving Europeana. Association Members must feel involved. Task Forces and Working Groups are currently the instruments for such involvement. However, their terms of reference don’t appear to cover all the useful ways in which participation is needed or desired. Two ways of contributing to the working of the Association have emerged during the first years of its existence that do not fit the current models of Task Forces or Working Groups:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Sub-groups of the Members Council\_that perform tasks on behalf of the Council itself, such as the Elections Committee or the AGM Working Group;</li>\r\n    <li>Sub-communities of the Network should be better integrated within the Association in order to properly participate in the new governance structure of Europeana, with the opportunity to represent the concerns of their own community, such as the communities of the aggregators or of the libraries who have already expressed such a desire.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is time to further streamline and consolidate the participation in Europeana activities by Association Members, based on this experience. The working model that best suits such work appeared\_to be a Task Force: a short period with a specific recommendation or plan as output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, the tasks of this Task Force were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Evaluate the current terms of reference and procedures for Task Forces and Working Groups</li>\r\n    <li>Verify the compliance of past and currently active Task Forces and Working Groups</li>\r\n    <li>Investigate requirements of new groups (e.g. committees and communities) and how they match current structures</li>\r\n    <li>Investigate how existing communities can be integrated within the Network Association, e.g. EuropeanaTech</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>This Task Force developed standard guidelines/formats, intended for cultural heritage communities and taking into account the specific needs of Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The digital documentation of cultural heritage assets is inherently a multimedia process, addressed through the digital representation of the shape, appearance and conservation condition of the heritage/cultural object for which 3D digital model is expected to become the representation. 3D representations should progress beyond current levels to provide the necessary semantic information (knowledge/story) for in-depth studies and use by researchers, and creative users, offering new perspectives and understandings. Digital surrogates can add a laboratory dimension to on-site explorations originating new avenues in the way tangible cultural heritage is addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The generation of high-quality 3D models is still very time-consuming and expensive, not at least because the modeling is carried out for individual objects rather than for entire collections and formats provided in digital reconstructions are frequently not interoperable and therefore cannot be easily accessed and/or reused or sustained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many projects have investigated aspects related to cultural heritage assets and highly elaborated theoretical approaches, principles and guidelines are proposed for data schemes and infrastructures. On the other hand, in practice, 3D reconstruction projects are often based on unique and prototypic semantics, workflows, and infrastructures and are customized for a specific purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendation covers<strong> </strong>semantically-aware 3D objects with a view to improving their archiving, retrieval, reusability and sustainability<strong> </strong>enriching the geometrical structure(s) with related knowledge, taking into account the range of devices, models and software applications involved.</p>\r\n"

        intro: 'Project Launch: "Erster Weltkrieg in Alltagsdokumenten" - The First World War in everyday documents'
        body: "<p><strong>Pictures, letters and memorabilia wanted</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlin, 24 March 2011: \"The First World War in everyday documents\" is launched today with a call to the public in Germany to participate in building a digital European archive by contributing private memorabilia from the First World War. We are looking for photographs, letters, diaries, short films, audio recordings, objects and their stories. Following the launch of the project, four roadshows take place in Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart. The project is a partnership between Europeana, the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek and Oxford University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Call for participation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ask everybody to bring World War 1 memorabilia to the roadshows. They will be digitised professionally and added to the online archive, along with corresponding descriptions. Independently of the roadshows, everyone can contribute their digitised images and information to the website - <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana Collections 1914-1918 website\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until 2014, the year of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One, we will collect memorabilia in digital form from many of the countries involved in the War. The project aims to save people's family memories of this tragedy that convulsed Europe and make them accessible to the world. The historian Prof Dr Gerhard Hirschfeld of Universität Stuttgart/Bibliothek für Zeitgeschichte, highlights the significance of the project:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"It is vital that we hold onto private letters and documents to reconstruct the everyday life of wartime and the mindsets of those involved. We need to give a voice to those people who otherwise remain silent. Their experiences as well as their fears, hopes and fantasies are normally inaccessible to historians.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memorabilia and stories are kept by families for a while, but after a century their significance is starting to fade. This First World War digital archive makes it possible to renew and share their significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"By inviting people to actively contribute to its content, Europeana opens up to users on a new level. To bring together family lore and the memories of those involved in World War One from different countries, who have experienced this time as allies or opponents, is a fascinating undertaking. World War One resonates in the collective memory, and this project will spark renewed popular interest and also scholarly research,\"</em> said Dr Elisabeth Niggemann, Chair of the Europeana Foundation and Director General of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, outlining Europeana's aims for the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One innovative aspect of the project is the application of crowdsourcing - collecting input from people at large and assembling a wide variety of family memorabilia which will be made accessible to the public and to researchers. In 2008, Oxford University produced a remarkable collection of 1914-18 papers, pictures, souvenirs and memorable stories, digitised by people across the UK and the Commonwealth in the <a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Great War Archive website\">Great War Archive</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The film</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the stories collected by the British project is connected to Germany. A contribution to the Great War Archive records the friendship of RAF man Bernard Darley and German prisoner of war Otto Arndt. A short film about this unlikely friendship illustrates the project's intention vividly. Luise Arndt, Otto's great-grandchild, finds out more about her grandfather on the website and even gets in touch with Bernard's family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Public digitisation roadshows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, Frankfurt am Main 31 March 2011, 10-20 hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - PK 2 April 2011, 10-17 hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München 6 April 2011, 10-20 hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Württembergische Landesbibliothek / Bibliothek für Zeitgeschichte, Stuttgart 12 April 2011, 10-20 hours</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Press contact:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facts &amp; Files,<br />\r\nFrank Drauschke, mobile.: +49-163-4809862,<br />\r\ndrauschke@factsandfiles.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana portal\">Europeana</a> is a partnership of European cultural heritage associations that have joined forces to bring together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections.

        intro: 'Europeana, the digital library, museum and archive, has opened a new interactive video space, Europeana Remix, which enriches a short film on a First World War friendship using the latest HTML5 and Popcorn.js technology.'
        body: "<p>Europeana Remix plays the video in HTML5, and uses the Popcorn.js framework to let users call up resources that are related to the story, from Europeana, Flickr, Wikipedia, Oxford University, Google maps and other web services. Users can leave comments at any point and share their stories or URLs. <em>\"Europeana Remix gives users a new experience of inter-relating cultural content without leaving the video space,\"</em> says Harry Verwayen, Europeana's Business Development Director. <em>\"It will be exciting to see how this new technology affects the way that people get involved with stories on the web.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is experimenting with HTML5 to create new interactive cultural experiences, and because HTML5 is fast, seamless and unobtrusive. HTML5 is set to become a standard way to play video online. Popcorn.js, a new Javascript framework, is used because it utilises the great new features of HTML5 and combines web resources seamlessly to the movie player to give the user greater choice and interactivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using leading new technologies to engage users with cultural heritage is central to Europeana's mission and puts the Commission-Funded project ahead of the curve. <em>\"Europeana Remix' use of HTML5 web video and the Popcorn.js framework is both a technical and aesthetic leap for web video,\"</em> says <a href=\"http://chirls.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit Brian Chirls website\">Brian Chirls</a>, the code-developer behind the project, and a leader in interactive video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, Remix is so advanced that it plays only on the latest version of web browsers -<br />\r\nFirefox Chrome Safari IE Opera 4.0+ 4.0+ 4.0+ 9+ 10.5+</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to allow others to make free use of this ground-breaking development as the basis for new applications, the Remix source code has been made available on <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit GitHub\">GitHub</a>, the collaborative code repository for programmers. The film itself and all user contributions are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brett Gaylor, of Mozilla Foundation, the Open Source web innovation driver, says, <em>\"It's exciting to see Mozilla's Popcorn technology used in such a creative way. The developers of the Europeana Remix project have pushed video to the cutting edge - it is a fantastic use of archives, web services and user generated content.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information contact :<br />\r\nannemarie.vangerwen@kb.nl<br />\r\nDirect line: +31 [0] 70 314 0622</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Links:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana website\">Europeana.eu</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://remix.europeana.eu\" title=\"Click here to visit Europeana Remix\">Europeana Remix</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana Collections 1914-1918 website\">Europeana 1914-1918</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes for Editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana brings together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections. Currently Europeana gives integrated access to 20 million books, films, paintings, museum objects and archival documents from some 1500 content providers. The content is drawn from every European member state and the interface is in 27 European languages. Europeana receives its main funding from the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's core mission is to engage audiences with digitised cultural content. This is not simply to put the digital files online, but to create innovative tools and methods of access and interaction. The aim is to renew the relevance of our cultural heritage and enable its stories to be told in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source video for Europeana Remix, Otto and Bernard, the story of an unlikely friendship, was made to promote the Europeana 1914-1918 project in Germany. The project encourages people to digitise their own family documents and memorabilia from the First World War and share them with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Knowledgeland (<a href=\"http://www.knowledgeland.org\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Knowledgeland website\">www.knowledgeland.org)</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept behind Europeana Remix was developed by Knowledgeland, where Thijs van Exel co-ordinated the realisation. Knowledgeland is an independent think tank searching for ways to spark the social innovations needed to improve the knowledge society.

        posttype: pressrelease

        intro: 'Meeting at the Royal Library of Denmark, the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL), has voted overwhelmingly to support the open licensing of their data. CENL represents Europe''s 46 national libraries, and are responsible for the massive collec'
        body: "<p><strong>What does that mean in practice?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It means that the datasets describing all the millions of books and texts ever published in Europe – the title, author, date, imprint, place of publication and so on, which exists in the vast library catalogues of Europe – will become increasingly accessible for anybody to re-use for whatever purpose they want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will mean that Wikipedia can use the metadata, linking it to all sorts of articles; it will mean that apps developers can embed it in new mobile tools for tourism or teaching. Crucially, for information scientists, it will mean that vast quantities of trustworthy data are available for Linked Open Data developments, creating relationships between elements of information that's never been possible before. The potential to create new relationships between datasets from Europe's greatest libraries creates what an expert in Semantic Web technology, Dr Stefan Gradmann, Professor of Library and Information Science at Humboldt University, Berlin, has called a ‘knowledge-generating engine'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first outcome of the open licence agreement is that the metadata provided by national libraries to Europeana.eu, Europe's digital library, museum and archive, via the CENL service The European Library, will have a Creative Commons Universal Public Domain Dedication, or CC0 licence. This metadata relates to millions of digitised texts and images coming into Europeana from initiatives that include Google's mass digitisations of books in the national libraries of the Netherlands and Austria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Racine, new Chair of CENL and President of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and Dr. Elisabeth Niggemann, former Chair of CENL and Director of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, welcomed the leadership shown by CENL. Dr Niggemann said, ‘Providing data under an open licence is key to putting cultural institutions like our national libraries at the heart of innovations in digital applications. Only that way can society derive full social and economic benefit from the data that we've created to record Europe's published output over the past 500 years. The best analogy is between bottled water and a water main. Rather than bottling it and branding it, we're putting data on tap, so that everyone has free and open access, and can use it for whatever purpose they need.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This resonates with the words of the European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, who in her speech to the Open Europe Summit this week said, ‘I am convinced that the potential to re-use public data is significantly untapped. Such data is a resource, a new and valuable raw material… To mine it would be an investment which would pay-off with benefits for all of us.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as demonstrating strategic leadership in the heritage and information sectors, the pay-off for the libraries is twofold. Firstly, as their data becomes pervasive online, it will lead users back to its source, encouraging visits both both online and onsite. Secondly, their data will be enriched by contact with complementary data sources, and be available for them to re-use to upgrade their own services to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jonathan.purday@bl.uk for further information</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes for Editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://web3.nlib.ee/cenl/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the CENL website\">CENL:</a> Founded in 1987, the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL) develops the role of national libraries in Europe, in particular their responsibilities for maintaining the national cultural heritage, ensuring the accessibility of knowledge and support for related research and development activities. <a href=\"http://search.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/en/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the European Library search page\">Members of CENL</a> are the national librarians of the member states of the Council of Europe. CENL currently consists of 49 members from 46 Council of Europe countries. The full Conference meets annually, and is currently meeting in Copenhagen at the National Library of Denmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana website\">Europeana:</a> brings together the digitised content of Europe's libraries, galleries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections. Currently Europeana gives integrated access to 20 million books, films, paintings, museum objects and archival documents from some 1500 content providers. The content is drawn from every European member state and the interface is in 27 European languages. Europeana receives its main funding from the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is funded not only to engage audiences with digitised cultural content but also to facilitate innovation in the cultural heritage sector. The Europeana Foundation, which runs Europeana and comprises the professional associations for the cultural heritage organisations of Europe, last week also declared in favour of open data licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Creative Commons website\">Creative Commons</a> <strong>Universal Public Domain Dedication, or CC0 licence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative Commons is a not-for-profit organization, founded in 2001, that promotes the creative reuse of intellectual and artistic works, whether owned or in the public domain. Through its free copyright licences, Creative Commons offers authors, artists, scientists, and educators the choice of a flexible range of protections and freedoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative Commons' public domain tools enhance the public domain by allowing cultural and other works that are free of known copyright to be easily discoverable over the Internet, and works to be dedicated to the public domain by their owners. CC0 enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and re-use the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.</p>"

        title: 'New look Europeana launches'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Europeana, Europe''s digital library, museum and archive, today launches a redesign with new functionality. The new interface has more visual appeal and has been adapted for iPads and Android touchscreens, bringing all the benefits of touch to Europe''s onli'
        body: "<p>Europeana's makeover has been shaped by users, who have helped to create the services they wanted around their cultural heritage. One request was made above all: the right to download for free and re-use the cultural highlights they find on the site. For the first time, Europeana makes it possible to narrow searches ‘by copyright' so that public domain – out of copyright – content can be precisely targeted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, almost half a million items are clearly shown as public domain on Europeana, and Europeana is strongly encouraging its data providers to correctly identify more out-of-copyright content, and not to invoke new rights just because they have digitised an item. At the forefront of public domain provision in Europeana are Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other benefits that users get from the new Europeana include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>new ways of precision searching and a more logical structure of search results</li>\r\n    <li>more interactivity, highlighting blogging and social media activities around Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>more opportunities to browse in online exhibitions and around individual objects, each of which displays a slideshows of related images</li>\r\n    <li>automatic translation of details about a chosen item from its original language to 37 others</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, the Executive Director of Europeana, welcomed the makeover, saying, ‘We've been working closely with users to create a design they respond to, and trialling it with tablets because we know that iPad and Android users are our fastest-growing sector. They are also users who like to download, and we encourage people to use public domain content for their work, their college projects, their teaching and their creative remixes.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana portal\">Europeana.eu</a> brings together the digitised content of Europe's libraries, galleries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections. It features digitised books, newspapers, paintings, photographs, maps, music and other sound recordings, museum objects, archival records, films and TV broadcasts. Europeana is funded by the European Commission to provide engaging ways for people to discover digitised cultural content and to facilitate digital innovation in the heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been able to amass a huge dataset, giving access to 19 million digitised books and other works, because of the network of aggregators with which it works. These aggregators collect data either nationally – like the Polish Digital Libraries Federation, which supplies data from hundreds of institutions across Poland – or by domain, like the European Film Gateway, which supplies data from Europe's film archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Public Domain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative works go out of copyright 70 years after the death of [all] their creators or contributors. Once they enter the public domain, they can be freely copied. The public domain is a resource for learning and research, a source of inspiration for new ideas and innovation. Europeana's Public Domain Charter recommends that when out-of-copyright works are digitised, they should remain in the public domain and be labelled as such, enabling free download, copying and re-use by the public of their own heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increasing numbers of content providers are identifying their content with the public domain mark, so of Europeana's 19 million items, a growing percentage will in future show their public domain status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Images</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the public domain images in Europeana can be freely used in media coverage - for example, The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92033/0C9CD59A04A44003BF9BA70B90E508B2B06F72C6.html?utm_source=pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Launch%2Bpress%2Brelease\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the Revolution in Warsaw record\">Revolution in Warsaw</a>, 1830, from the Polish National Library</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information contact<br />\r\njonathan.purday@bl.uk<br />\r\nSenior Communications Advisor, Europeana</p>"

        title: 'Digital Public Library of America and Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Two major digital library networks have reached an agreement to collaborate in ways that will make a large part of the world's cultural heritage available to a large part of the world's population.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Robert Darnton, a DPLA Steering Committee member and University Librarian at Harvard, said, \"The association between the DPLA and Europeana means that users everywhere will eventually have access to the combined riches of the two systems at a single click. The aggregated databases will include many millions of books, pamphlets, newspapers, manuscripts, images, recordings, videos, and other materials in many formats.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana, welcomed the agreement, saying that \"Europeana was designed to be open and interoperable, and to be able to collaborate with the DPLA is a validation of that aim. By this combined effort on two continents, Europeana and the DPLA hope to promote the creation of a global network with partners from around the world.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another outcome of this collaboration will be a virtual exhibition about the migration of Europeans to America. The DPLA and Europeana will demonstrate the potential of their combined collections by digitizing and making freely available material about the journey from the Old World to the New. This pilot project will include text and images about the experience of the uprooted as they abandoned their homes to seek a new life thousands of miles across a treacherous ocean. Letters, photographs, and official records open up unfamiliar views into the harsh world inhabited by Europeans from the shtetl communities of Russia to the peasant villages of Ireland. And equally vivid testimonies illustrate the culture shock and hard lot of the immigrants after their arrival. Everyone in the United States, including Amerindians, descends from immigrants, and nearly everyone in Europe has some connection with migration, either within Europe itself or across the ocean. All will be invited to stroll digitally through this rich exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Statement of Common Principles: DPLA-Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Public Library of America and Europeana share a common goal: to make the riches of libraries, museums, and archives available, free of charge, to everyone in the world. They will be guided in this mission by the following principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>They will make their systems and data interoperable to the greatest possible extent.</li>\r\n    <li>They will promote open access to the greatest possible extent through joint existing and new policies concerning content, data, and metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>They will collaborate regularly in developing specific aspects of their systems, beginning with:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>--an interoperable data model<br>\r\n--a shared source code<br>\r\n--cooperative collection building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>###</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>About the Digital Public Library of America</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPLA Steering Committee is leading the first concrete steps toward the realization of a large-scale digital public library that will make the cultural and scientific record available to all. This impact-oriented research effort unites leaders from all types of libraries, museums, and archives with educators, industry, and government to define the vision for a digital library in service of the American public. The DPLA Secretariat is located at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University; the Steering Committee comprises library and foundation leaders across the nation.

        intro: 'The European Commission has just adopted a Recommendation on Digitisation and Digital Preservation, asking Member States to step up their efforts, pool their resources and involve private actors in digitising cultural material and making it available throu'
        body: "<p>In particular, the Recommendation invites Member States to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>put in place solid plans for their investments in digitisation and foster public-private partnerships to share the gigantic cost of digitisation (recently estimated at 100 billion EUR). The Recommendation spells out key principles to ensure that such partnerships are fair and balanced.</li>\r\n    <li>make available through Europeana 30 million objects by 2015, including all Europe's masterpieces which are no longer protected by copyright, and all material digitised with public funding.</li>\r\n    <li>get more in-copyright material online, by, for example, creating the legal framework conditions enabling large-scale digitisation and cross-border accessibility of out-of-commerce works.</li>\r\n    <li>reinforce their strategies and adapt their legislation to ensure long-term preservation of digital material, by, for example, ensuring the material deposited is not protected by technical measures that impede librarians from preserving it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Recommendation is an update of a first recommendation adopted in 2006. It takes account of Member States' progress reports from 2008 and 2010, which show that although progress has been made, more and better action is needed as regards financial resources, quantitative targets for digitisation and solid support for Europeana. It also builds on the conclusions of the Comité des Sages, appointed by Commissioners Kroes and Vassiliou in 2010, on bringing Europe's cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Useful links:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1292&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the Commision's press release on the Recommendation\">The Commission's press release on the Recommendation</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the text of the Recommendation in English, French and German\">The text of the Recommendation in English, French and German</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Europeana website\">Europeana, Europe's digital library, archive and museum</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/comite_des_sages/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the Comite des Sages report\">\"Comité des Sages\" on Bringing Europe's Cultural Heritage Online</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/digital_libraries/other_groups/mseg/reports2010/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the Member States progress reports\">Member States progress reports can be found on the digital libraries website</a></p>"

        title: 'French National Librarian for chair'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'The Chief Executive of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Bruno Racine, has been elected to chair the Board of the Europeana Foundation, responsible for the EU''s primary cultural heritage showcase, Europeana.eu.'
        body: "<p>Mr Racine takes over from Elisabeth Niggemann, Director of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek. Dr Niggemann was the Foundation's first chair from 2007. On taking up the post, Mr Racine paid tribute to the vision and determination of his predecessor, saying, 'I salute the remarkable work achieved by Elisabeth Niggemann in launching and consolidating Europeana'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His election comes at a significant moment in the development of Europeana. Twenty million cultural artefacts – books, films, sounds and pictures – are now accessible through the portal. The European Commission has just announced its proposals for structural funding of Europeana from 2014-2020 through the Connecting Europe Facility, part of its investment in the Digital Agenda for Europe. Europeana is seen as a key advocate of the value of cultural heritage in digital innovation and creative enterprise and has been running events to develop mobile apps and making large datasets available for Linked Open Data initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Racine will continue to develop Europeana's strategic role as a facilitator for new ideas in the cultural heritage sector. He sees Europeana as 'possibly the most important project in the field of culture in the EU. Our success lies in our network. The museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections have come together as a community that is finding new ways to connect users with their patrimony. Access to Europe's digitised knowledge on the scale that Europeana provides is awe-inspiring.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes for Editors</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bruno Racine</strong> – biography</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Racine has been Chairman and Chief Executive of the <em>Bibliothèque nationale de France</em>, the French National Library, since March 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Paris in 1951, Bruno Racine studied at the most prestigious French <em>grandes écoles</em>, the <em>Ecole normale supérieure</em>, where he studied Classics, the <em>Institut d'études politiques</em>, and finally the <em>Ecole nationale d'Administration</em> (ENA), which forms France's elite civil servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Racine joined the <em>Cour des Comptes</em>, the French national audit jurisdiction, in 1979, before being appointed in 1986 to the Cabinet of Jacques Chirac, then Prime Minister.

        title: 'Remembering the First World War'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Europeana Collections 1914-1918 will create by 2014 – the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War - a substantial digital collection of material from national libraries and other partners from eight countries that found themselves on different sid'
        body: "<p>The First World War was a conflict on an unprecedented scale that affected the every-day lives of virtually all Europeans and many people living in other parts of the world. The memory of the war, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remains very much alive today. It has become part of the individual and collective memory of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-year project will make over 400,000 WWI sources publicly and freely available online for the first time – content that is often rare and highly fragile because of the deteriorating quality of the paper it was produced on and generally only accessible in reading rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital collection will span the full range of national library collections including books, newspapers, trench journals, maps, music sheets, children's literature, photographs, posters, pamphlets, propaganda leaflets, original art, religious works, medals and coins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This material will highlight the importance of the First World War for a common European identity and reflect the experiences of people from different ethnic, linguistic, political, social and religious communities on all sides of the conflict, including those opposed to the war. It will permit new interpretations of history that go far beyond traditional military history and include artistic and cultural reinterpretation of the experiences of 1914-1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sir Andrew Motion commented on this project: \"It is wonderful to learn that the British Library will work with partners from across Europe to digitise material relating to the First World War, and to make this accessible to all online. This is a tremendously important project that will transform access to Europe's shared cultural heritage in the run-up to the anniversary of the War's outbreak in 2014.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the digitised collections will be made available through Europeana.eu, where they will join related material from other institutions as well as family papers and memorabilia from the war digitised by private individuals in Germany and the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamie Andrews, the British Library's Head of English and Drama said: \"I am delighted that the British Library is working with Europeana, and with colleagues from across Europe, to build an online collection of material relating to all aspects of the First World War, and the ways that it touched civilians and servicemen from all parts of the world.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>For more information contact:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Evie Jeffreys<br />\r\nBritish Library<br />\r\nt:+ 44 (0) 20 7412 7105<br />\r\ne: evie.jeffreys@bl.uk</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The British Library</strong> is the national library of the United Kingdom and one of the world's greatest research libraries.

        title: 'Mobile browsing will transform the web'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'A new report, Culture on the Go, from UK web-watchers CIBER Research, shows how access to information is changing as people search for, read and use information on the move. A growing proportion of web browsing happens on smartphones like the new Mac iPhon'
        body: "<p>Professor David Nicholas of CIBER said, \"We are seeing a transformation of behaviour. We know that the mobile device will soon be the dominant platform for searching the Web and yet right now we know virtually nothing about how people seek, read and use information via these devices. The CIBER group are cyberspace voyeurs - we've analysed tens of thousands of visits and are making sense of these digital footprints to give us an understanding of behaviour in the virtual space.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The CIBER group has developed a bespoke deep log analysis technique for monitoring behaviours online. The group conducted their research for Europeana, Europe's cultural heritage portal, to look at how it should be developing its information services for the Google Generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The report sets out to show how people search the Web via mobile devices and compares this with use of the same platform by PC and laptop users. The data was collected for visitors to <a href=\"http://Europeana.eu/\"><span class=\"s1\">Europeana.eu</span></a> using deep log analysis and data mining techniques during 2010 - 2011. The main findings were that visits from users on the go are very different in the aggregate to those from fixed platforms. Visits are typically shorter, less interactive, and less content is viewed per visit. The variation between different mobile devices is huge, with information seeking on smartphones substantially different from that associated with PCs and laptops, whereas from iPads the behaviour tends more towards PC-based browsing.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Most websites have been designed for access from a PC or laptop, and accessing the Web via a mobile device is quite a different experience. Many websites from the cultural heritage sector are attracting a new demographic that includes more digital natives. This, coupled with the fact that people are used to paying for content via mobile devices, heralds a transformation in the way cultural web services will be delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana said, \"We were prescient in designing a Europeana ‘lite' interface for users with mobile phones three years ago. However, the mobile screen is too small to get a good experience of the great books and paintings on Europeana. Tablet devices like the iPad give high-resolution display with enough screen estate to explore your favourite pictures. This report shows us that we must speed up our development for new mobile and tablet interfaces.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Culture on the Go also reported on the countries showing the heaviest mobile use of Europeana, and showed France led Europe with over 23% of mobile use. The study also shows that typically, Europeana users look at material from their own country, but that interest in other cultures varies by country and can be tracked. CIBER's techniques have also been used to study each country's take-up of mobile devices, and points to a greater democratisation of online access than was possible using fixed platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Contact:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">For CIBER Research:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:Dave.Nicholas@ciber-research.eu\"><span class=\"s3\">Dave.Nicholas@ciber-research.eu</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">For Europeana:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jonathan.purday@bl.uk\"><span class=\"s3\">jonathan.purday@bl.uk</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>Notes for Editors</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><b>CIBER Research</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/vwkf/j7w2wb/bdssf\">CIBER Research</a></span> is a policy-led, consumer-driven, interdisciplinary and independent research group. <a href=\"http://e2.ma/click/vwkf/j7w2wb/r5ssf\"><span class=\"s1\">CIBER</span></a>'s particular expertise lies in making sense of how very large numbers of people behave and consume in the digital environment.

        intro: 'Europeana''s 20 millionth digital artifact, Caravaggio''s painting of David with the Head of Goliath, has just been contributed by the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The dataset was made available via Kulturpool, the Austrian aggregator. Kulturpool, dev'

Kulturpool acts as an Austrian cross-domain aggregator for digital cultural heritage to Europeana and makes Austrian cultural heritage accessible on a pan-European level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kunsthistorisches Museum's collection comprises paintings and art works from different ages. Founded in 1891, the museum focuses chiefly on the art of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Caravaggio's 'David mit dem Haupt des Goliath,' painted in 1600/01, is among its masterpieces</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We are pleased to provide the Kunsthistorisches Museum's collection as part of the digital culture portal Europeana, which makes the European cultural heritage accessible to the worldwide public,\" said Dr. Sabine Haag, general director of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. \"Caravaggio's painting of David ideally symbolizes the goals of Europeana, given the painting's history. After its completion, the painting was part of a collection in Italy, then an English collection, and later also in the Netherlands, before it landed in the collection of imperial Austria in 1667, which later became the collection of the federal Austrian museum.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uma team has worked for several years to create a Web 2.0 semantic platform that combines the rich knowledge repositories of Kulturpool's museum partners – for example Albertina, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien and Österreichische Nationalbibliothek. Targeted user groups of the Kulturpool include the interested public, as well as students, teachers, the scientific community and the participating cultural institutions themselves. Also the Kulturpool provides research and collaboration tools as well as special support tools for educators to develop and share learning resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, more than 380,000 objects are available through the Kulturpool, which is constantly expanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20111215_OTS0105/caravaggio-gemaelde-aus-dem-kunsthistorischen-museum-ist-20-millionstes-objekt-der-digitalen-europaeischen-bibliothek-bild\" rel=\"ext\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the press release in German\">View the press release in German</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>About Europeana</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana brings together the digitized content of Europe's libraries, galleries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections.

        featured: false
        intro: 'Europeana releases an animation to explain - and a pilot dataset'
        body: "<p>Linked Open Data is gaining traction in the information world right now. Europeana has just launched an <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36752317\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the Linked Open Data animation\">animation</a> to explain what it is and why it's a good thing, both for users and for data providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is facilitating developments in Linked Open Data by publishing <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the data for 2.4 million objects\">data for 2.4 million objects for the first time</a> under an <strong>open metadata licence</strong> - CC0, the Creative Commons' Public Domain Dedication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is making data openly available to the public and private sectors alike so they can use it to develop of innovative applications for smartphones and tablets and to create new web services and portals. This support for commercial enterprise in the digital sector is central to Europeana's business strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metadata that is openly available is re-usable by anyone. Linked to external data sources, such as <a href=\"http://geonames.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the GeoNames site\">GeoNames</a>, it's enriched and can also be re-used by its providers as the basis of improved services to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of Linked Open Data is attracting Europe's major national libraries: the Bibliothèque nationale de France recently launched its rich <a href=\"http://data.bnf.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Bibliotheque nationale de France website\">linked data resource</a>, while the national libraries of the UK, Germany and Spain, among many other cultural institutions, have been publishing their metadata under an open licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the World Wide Web Consortium website\">World Wide Web Consortium</a> has also put cultural Linked Data high on its agenda, notably via the reports of the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/News/2011.html#entry-9239\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to visit the Library Linked Data Incubator Group\">Library Linked Data Incubator Group</a>, co-chaired by Europeana's Antoine Isaac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support for Open Data innovation is at the root of Europeana's new <a href=\"/support-for-open-data\" title=\"Click here for more information on the Data Exchange Agreement\">Data Exchange Agreement</a>, the contract that libraries, museums, and archives agree to when their metadata goes into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Data Exchange Agreement has been signed by all the national libraries, by leading national museums such as the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and by many of the content providers for entire countries, such as Sweden's National Heritage Board. The new Data Exchange Agreement dedicates the metadata to the Public Domain and comes into effect on 1 July 2012, after which all metadata in Europeana will be available as Open Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Notes for editors:</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana, Europe's digital library, archive and museum, supports digital innovation in the heritage sector. Working with national memory organisations across Europe - over 2,000 providers of 23 million items in its dataset - Europeana runs pilot programmes and organises workshops and hackathons, bringing the heritage and developer communities together to pioneer new ways of connecting people with culture. These communities are served by a new Europeana website, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu\" title=\"Europeana Professional\">Europeana Professional</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about Europeana's work in support of Open Data can be found here <a href=\"/support-for-open-data\">http://pro.europeana.eu/support-for-open-data</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong> is an international community where <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the member organizations involved in the W3C\">Member organizations</a>, a full-time <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the staff involved with the W3C\">staff</a>, and the public work together to develop <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/standards/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click here to view the web standards page\">Web standards</a>.

        intro: 'World War One 1914 -1918 -&nbsp;Digitising pictures, letters and memories for the 100th anniversary.'
        body: "<p><strong>Press conference invitation</strong><br />\r\nMuseum of Lancashire, Stanley Street, Preston, PR1 4YP<br />\r\nTel: 01772 534075<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThursday, March 1, 2012<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre; \"> </span>10.30am – 12pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have a box hidden deep in the attic or under the bed that holds your great grandfather's diaries? Maybe a letter from the front line? Or a photo taken at the time? Is there a special story behind it?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If so, we want to see it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are building the first ever online European archive of private memorabilia from WW1 in time for the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of war – and we need your help to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we are urging people to root out memorabilia from 1914-1918 to bring along to the Museum of Lancashire in Preston, on Saturday March 10 – one of the first in a series of WW1 Family History Roadshows that will be visiting Luxembourg, Ireland, Slovenia, Denmark and Belgium during 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We anticipate that it will be the first time many of these items have ever been seen outside the family – creating a new and exciting source of material for historians, schools, genealogists and cultural organisations in their interpretation of how the war affected the lives or ordinary people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want families to tell us about their keepsakes, who they belonged to and why they are so important to them - and we will save those memories in our archive www.europeana1914-1918.eu/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 brings together a partnership of libraries, museums, academic and cultural institutions, which in the UK includes the British Library, Oxford University, JISC, and Lancashire County Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On roadshow days, historians and experts will be available to talk about the significance of the finds - while our staff will professionally digitise and upload them to the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you are unable to attend the event, you can scan or digitally photograph your own material and upload it on the website www.europeana1914-1918.eu/.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the centenary approaches, it is vital we preserve these precious documents for future generations. Digitisation saves them from being lost or thrown away – and it allows the information to be incorporated into apps for smartphones and tablets that will bring history alive for people in contemporary ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, more than 25,000 digital images were recorded from nine family history roadshows held in major cities across Germany. These included: unpublished diaries, hand-drawn maps, portraits, sketches and photographs recording life under fire and on the home front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stephen Bull, curator of military history and archaeology at the Museum of Lancashire, said: \"As the centenary of 1914 and WW1 approaches, it is more important than ever that we save these items. It tells us what life was like for the ordinary people of Lancashire – the soldiers, their families and the workers back home who kept the country going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We are hoping people will bring in anything from that period, be it a family photo, a love letter, some sort of document or object. It doesn't matter if they don't know the background behind it, once it's online then it's likely people will be able to fill in some of those gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"And while experts scan these precious items, visitors can use the opportunity to enjoy our museum with its replica WW1 trench, meet costumed re-enactors and experience at first hand some of the sights, smells and sounds from a conflict that affected the everyday lives of virtually all Europeans.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana's executive director, said: \"Memorabilia and stories are kept by families for a while, but after a century their significance starts to fade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"That's why our online archive, which is collecting material from across Europe in a series of roadshows, is so important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The Preston event will give people the opportunity to share their memories, photos and diaries with future generations, while learning about the sacrifices their ancestors made.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamie Andrews, head of English and Drama at the British Library, said he was delighted to be involved in the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We're already set to digitise more than 400,000 items from national libraries in eight European countries with our Europeana Collections 1914-1918 project,\" he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Add to this unseen material from people's own homes and we will have a truly rounded picture of the impact of the war on families from all the different communities involved.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stuart Lee, director of Computing Systems and Services at Oxford University, said: \"We're thrilled to be part of this project. We pioneered this idea of collecting the memories of the community online - and concentrating on an individual town like Preston will give us a wonderful opportunity to assess the lasting legacy of the war in the regions.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roadshows are funded in the UK by JISC, which promotes IT innovation in higher education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stuart Dempster, programme director at JISC, said: \"These roadshows will give universities, colleges, museums, galleries, archives, libraries, the creative industries and schools the opportunity to work together with the public to create new and exciting ways of considering the historical, political and social legacy of the war through innovative digital technologies.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For further information, sample images and to confirm attendance at the press conference, please contact: Jackie Storer on 07710 070270 or jackie.storer@bl.uk&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes for editors:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe's digital library, archive and museum. It launched its 1914-1918 family history project in Germany in 2011 to collect memorabilia and family stories from combat and the home front. Nine family history roadshows were held in major cities across the country and so far we've recorded 25,000 digital images. These include: unpublished diaries, hand-drawn maps, portraits, sketches and photographs recording life under fire and on the home front. The project is being rolled out across 10 countries in Europe to create a unique pan-European virtual archive of WW1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>www.europeana1914-1918.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oxford University began the initiative when it asked people across Britain to bring family letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised in 2006. The success of the idea - which became the Great War Archive - encouraged Europeana 1914-1918 to roll out the scheme in Germany in 2011, and across Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, Slovenia, Denmark and Belgium in 2012. Oxford University continues to lead the project in terms of digital, training and cataloguing expertise during roadshow events across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://www.thegreatwararchive.blogspot.com/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British Library is a lead player in Europeana Collections 1914-1918 – a three year project to digitise more than 400,000 items from national libraries in eight countries across Europe that found themselves on different sides of the conflict. The Library is also sending curatorial and cataloguing staff to the roadshow event to work alongside Oxford University colleagues in Preston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Museum of Lancashire, which boasts a WW1 trench and a treasure trove of military history memorabilia, was reopened in November, last year, following a £1.7m refurbishment. In addition to a new entrance, cash from Lancashire County Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund paid for eight new interactive collections covering Roman times, the Iron Age and Edwardian England. Admission is free for the first 12 months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/acs/sites/museums/venues/mol/index.asp?siteid=3860&amp;pageid=16500&amp;e=e</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JISC inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK's position as a global leader in education. JISC's work for the commemoration is focused on giving students, teachers and researchers in higher and further education access to a wealth of unique and authoritative digital resources that can be used and re-used to inspire research and teaching. This event will potentially ‘unlock' resources of huge educational potential which have previously been kept in the nation's attics and drawers, so that we can increase our insight around the war and its legacy. http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/</p>"

Februar 2012:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mit einem Aufruf an die Öffentlichkeit, sich mit persönlichen Erinnerungsstücken aus der Zeit des Ersten Weltkrieges am Aufbau eines digitalen europäischen Archivs zu beteiligen startet heute in Luxemburg das Projekt europeana1914-1918.eu europaweit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gesucht werden Materialien verschiedenster Art, wie Fotos, Briefe, Feldpostkarten, Tagebücher, Filme, Tonaufnahmen oder Erinnerungsstücke und die dazugehörigen Geschichten. Anknüpfend an den Projektstart finden bis 2014 mehrere Aktionstage in ganz Europa statt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Das Projekt ist eine gemeinsame Initiative von Europeana, der Oxford University und einer großen Anzahl von lokalen Partnern. Aufruf zum Mitmachen Jeder ist eingeladen, zu den Aktionstagen Erinnerungsstücke an die Kriegszeit mitzubringen. Diese werden vor Ort auf professionelle Weise begutachtet, digitalisiert und mit den dazu gehörigen Angaben dem Online-Archiv hinzugefügt. Unabhängig von den Aktionstagen können sich Interessierte auf der Internetseite www.europeana1914-1918.eu registrieren und das OnlineArchiv selbstständig mit digitalen Bildern und Informationen füllen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bis 2014, dem Jahr, in dem sich der Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkriegs zum einhundertsten Mal jährt, sollen in mindestens zehn europäischen Ländern Memorabilia in digitaler Form gesammelt werden. Ziel des Projektes ist es, die privaten Erinnerungen von Menschen verschiedener Nationen an diese europäische Tragödie zu sichern und öffentlich zugänglich zu machen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Direktorin von Europeana erklärt: \"Erinnerungsstücke und Geschichten werden von den Familien für eine Weile aufbewahrt, aber nach einem Jahrhundert beginnt ihre Bedeutung zu verblassen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Um diese Dinge zu bewahren ist unser Online-Archiv so wichtig. Wir sammeln Material aus ganz Europa in einer Reihe von Roadshows. \"Wir versuchen, Menschen zu ermutigen, ihre kollektive Erinnerung an einen 2 Krieg zu teilen, der den Alltag von fast allen Europäern betroffen hat, egal auf welcher Seite sie standen.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neuer Sammlungsansatz „Crowdsourcing\" Neu ist die Herangehensweise des Projektes, bei der die interaktiven Möglichkeiten des Internets genutzt und mit Hilfe des „crowdsourcing\", also der Quellensammlung aus der Masse, ein breites Spektrum an persönlichen Erinnerungsstücken gesammelt und der Öffentlichkeit sowie der Forschung zugänglich gemacht werden. Die Oxford University hat 2008 mit dieser Methode bereits gute Erfahrungen gemacht und eine digitale Sammlung mit einem breiten Spektrum an persönlichen Erinnerungsstücken zum Ersten Weltkrieg im „Great War Archive\" (www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/) erstellt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2011: Deutscher Projektstart Im Jahr 2011 wurde das Projekt mit großem Erfolg in Deutschland gestartet. Es fanden Aktionstage in 9 Städten statt, zu denen über 700 Besucher mit ihren Erinnerungstücken kamen. Die bei diesen Aktionstagen entstandenen über 25.000 digitalen Dateien sind unter www.europeana1914-1918.eu recherchierbar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Der Aktionstag am 6. März in Luxemburg Der luxemburgische Beitrag zum Projekt Europeana1914-1918 wird von der Nationalbibliothek in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Nationalarchiv und dem kulturellen Internetportal plurio.net koordiniert.

Eine Bibel rettete seinem Vater, dem Infanteristen Kurt Geiler, 1917 das Leben. In den nicht enden wollenden Stellungskämpfen im Nordosten Frankreichs lag Kurt Geiler im Schützengraben und schlief wie immer mit der Bibel unter seinem Kopf. Ein Volltreffer zerstörte den Unterstand fast vollständig, überall waren Tote und Verwundete. Kurt Geiler konnte sich unverletzt aus den Trümmern retten. Später fand er seine Bibel wieder und zu seinem Erstaunen steckte darin ein großer Granatsplitter. Ohne die Bibel hätte dieser ihm wohl den Kopf zerschmettert. Seit dieser Zeit ist diese Bibel ein wichtiges Erinnerungsstück der Familie. Der Enkel des Soldaten, Markus Geiler, wird auf der Pressekonferenz sprechen und die Bibel präsentieren.

        body: "<p>\r\n    Europeana je evropska digitalna knjižnica, arhiv in muzej. Europeana je spletni portal, ki deluje kot&nbsp;posrednik do milijonov knjig, slik, filmov, muzejskih predmetov in arhivskega gradiva, ki so bili&nbsp;digitalizirani po vsej Evropi. Med strokovnjaki na področju dediščine je Europeana tudi platforma za&nbsp;izmenjavo in spodbuja sodelovanje med knjižničarji, kustosi in arhivisti. Tako ima končni uporabnik&nbsp;možnost integriranega dostopa do kulturne vsebine preko portala Europeana. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Cilji Europeane so določeni v njenem statutu in med drugim vključujejo: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Zagotoviti dostop do kulturne in znanstvene dediščine Evrope preko portala.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Olajšati formalne dogovore med muzeji, arhivi, avdio‐vizualnimi arhivi in knjižnicami o</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    sodelovanju pri izvajanju in trajnosti skupnega portala.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Spodbujati in omogočati pobude za združevanje obstoječe digitalne vsebine.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Podpirati in olajšati digitaliziranje kulturne in znanstvene evropske dediščine. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, direktorica Fundacije Europeana o pomenu Europeane pravi: » Z mrežo preko 90‐tih&nbsp;kulturnih organizacij, Europeana obravnava &nbsp;človeška, politična, tehnična in semantična vprašanja o&nbsp;ustanavljanju skupnega portala. Europeana si prizadeva za javno dostopnost evropske kulture in&nbsp;zakladov vsem državljanom &nbsp;Evrope, tako da je vse zbrano na enem mestu, kljub temu da so predmeti&nbsp;dejansko locirani nekje drugje. Na kratko, Europeana bo zagotovila eno vstopno točko za vse vire o&nbsp;umetnikih, kot je van Gogh, ali glasbenikih, kot je Mozart, na enem mestu. Na koncu bo tako javno&nbsp;dostopno 10 milijonov predmetov. Vsi državljani Evrope bodo imeli koristi od dostopa in izmenjave&nbsp;kulturnih virov in pomagali dvigovati kultno zavedanje.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914‐1918</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana je v Nemčiji leta 2011 pričela z izvajanjem projekta Europeana 1914‐1918. V okviru&nbsp;projekta Europeana 1914‐1918 so pričeli zbirati spomine in družinske zgodbe v zvezi z vojnimi&nbsp;spopadi in medvojnim življenjem civilistov. V večjih mestih po državi je potekalo devet dogodkov, na&nbsp;katerih so zbirali spomine in zgodbe, povezane z družinskimi zgodovinami. Do zdaj je bilo zbranih že&nbsp;25.000 digitalnih slik, med njimi so neobjavljeni dnevniki, na roko narisani zemljevidi, portreti, skice&nbsp;in fotografije, ki opisujejo in prikazujejo življenje med obstreljevanjem, v sanitetnih vodih in v zaledju.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Sedaj se projekt širi v Slovenijo, Veliko Britanijo, Luksemburg, na Irsko in Dansko, pozneje in v letu&nbsp;2013 pa še v nekaj drugih držav, saj želimo ustvariti edinstven vseevropski virtualni arhiv 1. svetovne&nbsp;vojne. Vse zbrane predmete se bo digitaliziralo in objavilo na javno dostopnem spletnem portalu&nbsp;Europeana, v Sloveniji tudi na portalih dLib in Kamra. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dnevi zbiranja spominov v Sloveniji</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Organizatorji si želimo, da bi nam običajne družine zaupajo zgodbo o svojim spominkih, komu so&nbsp;pripadali in zakaj jim toliko pomenijo. Zato so po celi Evropi organizirani Dnevi zbiranja spominov, na&nbsp;katere vabimo vse, ki si želijo deliti svoje zgodbe in tako prispevati v virtualni arhiv spominov na prvosvetovno vojno. V Sloveniji so organizirani trije takšni dogodki, na katerih bodo prisotni strokovnjaki&nbsp;in zgodovinarji, ki bodo prispevke pregledali in komentirali njihovo pomembnost, strokovni&nbsp;digitalizatorji in katalogizatorji pa jih bodo naložili na spletni portal Europeana. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Ker se približuje stoletnica, je namen projekta ohraniti te dragocene dokumente za prihodnje</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    generacije. Z digitalizacijo preprečimo, da bi se ti izgubili ali zavrgli, na varnem pa se hranijo tudi za&nbsp;uporabo šol, rodoslovcev in kulturnih organizacij.&nbsp;Termini in lokacije dogodkov v Sloveniji</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Sreda, 28.

        title: 'Crowds flock to ‘biggest ever'' WW1 roadshow'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'WW1 memorabilia from Prisoner of War sketches, to locks of hair and photographs of families and soldiers were revealed at the most successful roadshow event ever to get people to share their memories on the web.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    More than 200 people poured into the Museum of Lancashire in Preston at the weekend to have their loved-one's precious items digitised for the virtual archive <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu/</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Queuing began an hour before doors opened on Saturday (10.03.12) – and the crowds continued to stream in until they closed nine hours later. Many people had travelled from as far afield as Leeds, Manchester, Birkenhead, Liverpool and Warrington just to be there.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    More than 2,300 images were taken of a wide variety of items, including: letters, diaries, medals, birth and death certificates, nurses' autograph books, cartoons, pictures and trench art – everyday objects made from anything the soldiers found, such as shell casings and spent ammunition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Preston roadshow is the latest in a series that is being rolled-out across 10 countries in Europe this year to create a unique pan-European account of WW1 that is available to everyone.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914-1918 brings together a partnership of libraries, museums, academic and cultural institutions, which in the UK includes the British Library, Oxford University, JISC and Lancashire County Council.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jon Purday, senior communications advisor at Europeana1914-1918, the organisation behind the project, said: \"The Preston event has been our best so far - we've never had so many people through the doors. It just goes to show the extraordinary level of interest in WW1 and how much importance people attach to having their personal histories recorded in time for the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"We had 111 contributors arriving with family and friends, so we had about 220 people eager to share their loved-ones' memories.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Thomas Langdale, who brought in a German school exercise book filled with diary entries and sketches by Prisoners of War from England, Australia, Canada and France, said: \"Without events like these, we will lose the thoughts and feelings of our ancestors who went through so much.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Now those memories can be saved for future generations, which will hopefully help us understand the sacrifices that were made in the war,\" added Mr Langdale, of Darwen, near Blackburn.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alun Edwards, project manager at Oxford University, which has been involved in running 17 roadshows across Europe, said: \"These events are a fantastic way of engaging people with history through the internet.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"At Preston we had one woman who brought in a notebook relating to her grandfather, which included a lock of hair from her mother as a little girl in 1918. Her grandfather had kept this link to his daughter during his time away from the family. While this was not a unique story from the war, the artefact had been saved and it was memorable to those of us who were given the opportunity to photograph it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Stephen Bull, curator of military history and archaeology at the Museum of Lancashire, said: \"Many of the items people brought with them have never been seen outside the family until now – yet they add valuable new information about what life was like for soldiers in the trenches and for those left behind on the home front.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The WW1 roadshow, which began in Germany last year, has already visited Luxembourg and is en route to Dublin on March 21, followed by Slovenia, Denmark and Banbury, Oxfordshire, in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Anyone who can't make the events, but would like to add their WW1 memories, can do so by uploading their images via the website <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Notes for editors:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Europeana&nbsp;</strong>is Europe's digital library, archive and museum. It launched its 1914-1918 family history project in Germany in 2011 to collect memorabilia and family stories from combat and the home front. Nine family history roadshows were held in major cities across the country and 25,000 digital images were recorded in Germany alone. The project is being rolled out across 10 countries in Europe to create a unique pan-European virtual archive of WW1. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Oxford&nbsp;</strong><strong>University&nbsp;</strong>began the initiative when it ran a pilot project in Britain in 2008 to bring family letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised. The success of the idea - which became the Great War Archive - encouraged Europeana 1914-1918 to take the scheme to Germany in 2011, and across Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, Slovenia, Denmark and Belgium in 2012. Oxford University continues to lead the project in terms of digital training and cataloguing expertise during roadshow events across Europe. <a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa\">http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>The British Library&nbsp;</strong>is a lead player in a sister project, Europeana Collections 1914-1918 – a three year programme to digitise more than 400,000 items from national libraries in eight countries across Europe that found themselves on different sides of the conflict. The Library's curatorial and cataloguing staff worked alongside Oxford University colleagues in Preston. <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>The Museum of Lancashire</strong>, which boasts a WW1 trench and a treasure trove of military history memorabilia, was reopened in November, last year, following a £1.7m refurbishment. Admission is free for the first 12 months.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/acs/sites/museums/venues/mol/index.asp?siteid=3860&amp;pageid=16500&amp;e=e\">http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/acs/sites/museums/venues/mol/index.asp?siteid=3860&amp;pageid=16500&amp;e=e</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>JISC&nbsp;</strong>inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK's position as a global leader in education. JISC's work for the commemoration is focused on giving students, teachers and researchers in higher and further education access to a wealth of unique and authoritative digital resources that can be used and re-used to inspire research and teaching. This event will potentially unlock resources of huge educational potential which have previously been kept in the nation's attics and drawers, so that we can increase our insight around the war and its legacy. <a href=\"http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/\" title=\"blocked::http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/\">http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For further information or photographs from the Preston roadshow, please contact:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jackie Storer – <a href=\"mailto:jackie.storer@bl.uk\">jackie.storer@bl.uk</a>or 07710 070270</p>"

        title: 'Ireland welcomes visitors to WW1 Roadshow'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Following the huge response to an appeal for memorabilia, family stories will be recorded as photographs, letters, keepsakes and other treasures are digitised from 10am to 7pm  on 21 March.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    Following last week's appeal for people to search their attics and under the bed for World War One memorabilia, staff from the National Library of Ireland and Europeana are expecting to see a rich variety of family objects and stories today . The material brought to the Library will be digitised on the spot and people are then free to bring them home with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Based on previous roadshows in Germany, Luxembourg, and the UK, memorabilia could include photographs, letters, postcards, medals, coins, keepsakes, diaries, sketches, army discharge papers, recordings and other items belonging to those who experienced World War One. During the day, cataloguing and &nbsp;digitisation teams will be photographing items and recording the personal stories behind them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    People unable to attend the roadshows, or who have large amounts of material, are being invited to digitally photograph their items and upload them to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\" target=\"_blank\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a> website. The website features a step-by-step guide to the process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Today's World War One Family History Roadshow is being organised in conjunction with Oxford University and Europeana (Europe's digital library, museum and archive). Europeana is building the first ever online European archive of private stories and documents from World War One in time for the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the war in 1914.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The World War One Family History Roadshow is the first of a series of events taking place in cities and town around Ireland in the coming months. At today's roadshow, which continues until 7pm, the National Library will have historians and experts on hand to talk to visitors about the significance of their finds. Once scanned, the material will be uploaded to the Europeana 1914-1918 website.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Commenting on the project, Katherine McSharry, Head of Services, National Library of Ireland said that as the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War approaches, it is vital that we preserve precious documents and other memorabilia in digital format for future generations of historians, genealogists, schools and cultural organisations in remembrance of the war and its effect on people's lives.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Digitisation will ensure that World War One-related materials are not destroyed or thrown away. It will also allow the information in those materials to be incorporated into apps for smartphones and tablets that will bring history alive for people in contemporary ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"The Europeana 1914-1918 project will give universities, colleges, museums, galleries, archives, libraries, the creative industries and schools the opportunity to work together with the public to create new and exciting ways of considering the historical, political and social legacy of the World War One through innovative digital technologies\", Ms McSharry added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Among those attending today's event are Tom Burke MBE, Chair of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers Association, which has a large archive of World War One memorabilia in the Dublin City Archive, Pearse Street, focusing on the personal stories of those who fought and died; Paddy Reid, maternal grandson of Patrick O'Neill, who fought in the Battle of Passchendaele, and Jon Purday, Europeana Head of Communications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Speaking in advance of the today's event, Jon Purday said that memorabilia and stories are kept by families for a while but, after a century, their significance starts to fade. &nbsp;\"That is why Europeana, which is collecting material across Europe, is so important. The Europeana team hope that the National Library of Ireland series of roadshows will give people the opportunity to share their memories, photographs and diaries with future generations while learning about the sacrifices their ancestors made\", Mr Purday added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana project which is being rolled out in the UK, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Denmark, Belgium and Ireland this year, aims to create a unique pan-European virtual archive of World War One that is available to everyone. The project has already proved hugely successful in Germany and in the UK, where it was led by Oxford University. The University continues to lead the project in terms of digital training and cataloguing expertise for Europeana roadshow events across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In 2011, more than 25,000 digital images were recorded from nine family history roadshows held in major cities across Germany. Among the images scanned and digitised were unpublished diaries, hand-drawn maps, portraits, sketches and photographs recording life under fire and on the home front.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For further information, or to request images of National Library of Ireland World War One memorabilia, please contact: Brenda O'Hanlon on 087 258 &nbsp;3292</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Notes for editors:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana is Europe's digital library, archive and museum and is based in The Hague in the national library of the Netherlands. It launched its 1914-1918 family history project in Germany in 2011 to collect memorabilia and family stories from combat and the home front. The project is being rolled out across 10 countries in Europe to create a unique pan-European virtual archive of World War One. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\" target=\"_blank\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In the UK Oxford University began the initiative in 2006 when it asked people across Britain to bring family letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised. The success of the initiative – which became the Great War Archive – encouraged Europeana 1914-1918 to roll out the scheme in Germany in 2011, and across Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, Slovenia, Denmark and Belgium in 2012. Oxford University continues to lead the project in terms of digital training and cataloguing expertise during roadshow events across Europe. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.thegreatwararchive.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.thegreatwararchive.blogspot.com/</a></p>"

        intro: 'On 1 March 2012 the Europeana Fashion project was launched. This exciting three-year project, co-funded by the European Commission within the ICT Policy Support Programme, will publish online by March 2015 over 700,000 fashion-related digital objects, rang'
        body: "<p>\r\n    Europeana Fashion is a best practice network of 23 partners, representing the leading public and private museums, archives and collections from 12 European countries.

Since the beginning of the XX century some of the most important public and private cultural institutions and museums of applied arts in Europe have begun collecting and preserving garments, accessories, catalogues, fashion magazines and other documents and materials related to fashion.

        title: 'Life Saving Bible, Crucifix, Hitler Postcard'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "Web portal Europeana has collected and shared these extraordinary personal stories of World War 1 from across Europe.\r\n\r\nDanish, French, German, Slovenian"
        body: "<p style=\"font-size: 16px; \">\r\n    <strong>What connects a life-saving Bible, a crucifix in a bottle and a postcard from Hitler?</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; \">\r\n    <strong>Web portal Europeana has collected and shared these extraordinary personal stories of World War 1 from across Europe.</strong> <strong>The Hague, 2 May 2012&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Untold and extraordinary real-life stories from World War 1 have come to light and will be shared online as a result of family history roadshows run by the digital innovation service Europeana. They include a life-saving Bible, the first-hand testimony of a centenarian, and a postcard from a 27-year-old soldier named Adolf Hitler, which suggests that the future dictator had problems with his teeth and his spelling.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In preparation for the 100th anniversary of the conflict, WW1 roadshows have been held in Germany, England, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Denmark. People are invited to bring along WW1 memorabilia to be seen by experts and digitised. The Europeana 1914-1918 website also shows people how to upload their own digital scans. The idea for the roadshows came from the success of the University of Oxford's Great War Archive in 2008, funded by leading UK educational technology innovator, JISC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Two thousand people of all ages from across Europe have attended the roadshows to share family stories. Roadshow participants have been joined by online contributors and 45,000 photos of objects, scanned letters and diaries have been uploaded onto the website to date. Most of these are previously unpublished and have never been seen or studied outside the families.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana said: \"The project's success highlights the huge interest that Europeans have in their shared history. People pass their stories down their families, and in Europeana have found the means to preserve them for future generations, and make them universally accessible. Europeana brings a new approach to cultural history, linking people's own stories to the official histories of the war that we're collecting from the national libraries and archives.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Markus Geiler contributed pictures of his grandfather's life-saving Bible, with the lump of shrapnel embedded in it from the grenade that killed his comrades while they slept. He said: \"I am here to show how a family story can actually become part of the collective memory of Europe. I hope that there will be many, many such stories, and the European idea will develop even further when people deal together with the past and tell each other their stories.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In Preston, UK, John Stafford's first hand account of the Battle of the Somme was brought along by his daughter Joan Almond, 85. &nbsp;The typed manuscript documents Stafford's experiences and illustrates how he coped with post traumatic stress disorder, decades before the condition was recognised. Stafford lay horribly injured for two days until Allied troops found him and carried him across ‘Death Valley' to medical help. Joan said: \"I think the war must have haunted him a lot, especially when you read his account. My mother used to encourage him to write down his experiences and this seemed to have a calming influence.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The participation of Irishmen in WW1 was politically sensitive and as a result many of their stories have never been told. That was one reason why the Dublin roadshow was the best attended in Europe so far. More than 600 people turned up, some queuing for hours, to share their memorabilia and stories. They include a marvellous wartime love story, told by Joseph Heapes' daughter-in-law, Máire, of how Joseph found the love of his life, Mary, while a prisoner of war in Germany.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Slovenian centenarian Slavko Zupan is one participant able to share his direct memories of the war. His enthusiasm for the project was such that he visited the roadshow in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, twice. To illustrate his childhood recollections Slavko brought along a bottle containing a richly decorated wooden crucifix. It was made by a Russian prisoner of war in Slovenia. Existing on meagre rations, prisoners crafted such objects to barter for food or cigarettes. The crucifix has been in Slavko's family since 1916.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Munich roadshow revealed what at first sight appears to be just one of many postcards sent by soldiers in the field. The postcard, ‘Greetings from Nuremberg', describes the sender's recent trip to the dentist and his desire to go back to the front line. That soldier was Adolf Hitler, writing to his comrade Karl Lanzhammer in December 1916.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Director of Oxford University Computing Services, Dr Stuart Lee, one of the digital experts attending the roadshow, recalls the moment when he was first handed Hitler's postcard: \"I felt a shudder run through me. I found it hard to believe that at a local event to record ordinary people's stories, I was seeing a previously unknown document in Hitler's own hand. Europeana's project is remarkable in that it can bring in the most meaningful story in a person's whole existence - the Bible that saved a life, for example - as well as the mundane and misspelt jottings of the future dictator.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Oxford University has provided professional expertise to Europeana 1914-18, leading the training for the family roadshows, and providing expert support in digitising and cataloguing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Press contacts:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jon Purday, tel: 00 44 1937 546614<br />\r\n    mob: +44 (0) 7885 516234<br />\r\n    jonathan.purday@bl.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Eleanor Kenny, tel: +44 (0) 20 7412 7113<br />\r\n    eleanor.kenny@bl.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frank Drauschke, Facts &amp; Files,<br />\r\n    mob: +49163 4809862, drauschke@factsandfiles.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>See below for full stories of the items mentioned in the release and links to images&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Click <a href=\"/web/guest/1914-1918-press-images\">here</a>&nbsp;to link to press images</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Images available include</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Kurt Geiler's life-saving bible</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Markus Geiler with his grandfather's bible</li>\r\n    li&gt;Kurt Geiler in uniform\r\n    <li>\r\n        Postcard from Adolf Hitler to Karl Lanzhammer, Dec 1916 (both sides)</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Postcard from Adolf Hitler to Karl Lanzhammer, Dec 1916 (front view)</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Postcard from Adolf Hitler to Karl Lanzhammer, Dec 1916 (back view)</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Crucifix in a bottle, made by WW1 Russian prisoner of war</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Centenarian Slavko Zupan talking with Matej Arčon, the mayor of Nova Gorica, at the Slovenian roadshow</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        John Stafford, 5th Liverpool Regiment</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        John Stafford, extract of personal account of the Battle of the Somme</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        John Stafford, full account of the Battle of the Somme (pdf)</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Passport of Joseph Heapes, Royal Irish Rifles, in later life</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px; \">\r\n    <strong>Selected stories from Europeana 1914-1918</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; \">\r\n    <strong>My father's Bible saved his life</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Click <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/2020601/369ECFFC4514E6BBE638CCD79B0FAB036692FFF8\">here</a> to see Kurt Geiler's Bible on Europeana</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Devout Christian Kurt Geiler never went anywhere without his Bible – and that faith paid off in 1917 when the precious leather-bound book saved his life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In the never-ending trench warfare in North-East France, the German infantryman was sleeping as usual with his Bible underneath his head. Without warning, a direct hit destroyed his dug-out almost completely, wounding and killing many of his comrades.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Geiler was not harmed and managed to get out of the rubble. It was only later when he retrieved his Bible he discovered to his astonishment that the holy book had saved him.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    His son, Professor Gottfried Geiler, from Leipzig, said: \"A 4cm large piece of shrapnel tore the Bible under his head. It broke through, but not completely, so my father was unharmed and still alive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"It's true to say that the Bible, which has been kept ever since as a precious memento in the family, really was his salvation.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Geiler's grandson Markus Geiler said it had also been treated as a ‘family anti-war memorial'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"I can remember my father leading me to his bookcase, opening it and taking out the Bible which was wrapped in thick paper,\" he recalled. He said: ‘Look, this is what saved your grandfather's life.'

These prisoners often created pieces of art, rings and bracelets of copper and iron which they could sell to Austro-Hungarian soldiers for a piece of bread or a cigarette.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Slavko Zupan said his relative, Rozina Pahor, a restaurant owner in Prvačina, bought it from a Russian prisoner of war in 1916. The prisoner had carried the bottle from Russia and later inserted wooden carvings of a skull, cross and other symbolic figures.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Zupan, who lived in Ljubljana during WW1, said he could remember watching trains full of prisoners of war being brought in from the Front. The bottle, which is very similar to a ship in a bottle, is kept in his family home today.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; \">\r\n    <strong>Bad teeth and poor spelling: a postcard from Adolf Hitler, 1916&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/2020601/8CE30CFD17898E1FB9BF2CEB5010DED58A43E7CE\">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/2020601/92EF25FD540118BE652E5EEB4CC1D8A791A70CD9\">here</a>&nbsp;to view Adolf Hitler's postcard to Karl Lanzhammer on Europeana&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Transcription:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Feldpost<br />\r\n    Post mark: München 31, 19.

On his 65th Birthday, the head of the District Savings Bank presented him with this memorable philatelic collector's item. It is a field postcard written by Corporal Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) to his regimental comrade Karl Lanzhammer (1896-1918) on 19/12/1916 from Munich.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Karl Lanzhammer was a friend of Hitler's from their time together on the Western Front, and a known correspondent of his. At this time he was a cyclist at regimental headquarters of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment. In 1917 he went to flight school in Schleissheim, and died at a test flight accident on 15 March 1918 in Feldmoching. Lanzhammer was born in Dingolfing and was also buried there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The postcard is likely to have come from his estate, among items given away by his parents. It came into the possession of the manager of the town's Savings Bank, who later gave it away as a birthday present to the Landrat.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Hitler was wounded by shrapnel in October 1916 and was in the hospital at Beelitz near Berlin. In December 1916, when he wrote this postcard, he had just been discharged from hospital and was then stationed with the reserve battalion in Munich. He tells Lanzhammer, that he is now with the reserve battalion, is undergoing dental treatment and would as soon as possible voluntarily report back to the field. In fact, he went back in March 1917 at the request of his 16th Reserve infantry regiment as a news runner. In the brief text, Hitler reveals some spelling difficulties by writing the German word for immediately, ‘sofort' with double f – ‘soffort'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Authentication</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The postcard was authenticated by signature expert Ian Sayer, who advises the UK's Imperial War Museum, and by Thomas Weber, a German-born expert on WW1 who teaches at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and is the author of Hitler's First War. Additional research was provided by Frank Drauschke, founder of the Berlin-based historical research company, Facts and Files.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; \">\r\n    <strong>Love found as a Prisoner of War&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020601/984EE4CAC11823ACAD6F8DC0F13A65844C424374.html\">here</a>&nbsp;to learn about Joseph Heape and other soldiers' stories on Europeana</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Having been gassed, shot and held as a German Prisoner of War, the last thing Irish soldier Joseph Heapes expected to find was love.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Born in 1887, Heapes had already served in India and Burma with the Royal Irish Rifles between 1906 and 1913. But when war broke out in 1914, he was recalled by the army and sent to the continent where he was injured, captured and held at the Limburg Camp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It was while he was there, sending letters to his sister Theresa - a&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    housemaid in Killiney, Dublin - that Heapes' fortunes changed. Theresa encouraged her co-workers to write to the men in the POW camp to keep their spirits up - and one of the women to answer the call was Mary Fearon, a cook from Dundalk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    She wrote to Heapes and the couple quickly became pen pals. Many letters and photos followed until Heapes finally returned home to Ireland in 1919.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Heapes' daughter-in-law Máire Uí Éafa - who contributed official&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    letters, a passport and medals to the Dublin roadshow - said Mary obviously liked what she saw because the couple were married in 1921 and went on to have one son and two daughters.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 14px; \">\r\n    <strong>Soldier left for dead at the Somme documents horrors to save his sanity.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Click&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020601/1C470843D4336FB1FA199A03666D313A21AAD6C3.html\">here</a>&nbsp;to find out more of John Stafford's story on Europeana</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A British soldier who was left for dead after being shot through both legs on the Somme had his life saved by Allied troops who took shelter in the same trench.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    John Stafford was just 20 yards from the Germans when he was wounded during the symbolic battle of 1916, which resulted in 420,000 British casualties, including nearly 60,000 on the first day alone.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    His daughter, Joan Almond, 85, told the WW1 roadshow at Preston, that had it not been for Allied soldiers finding her father two days after he was shot, he would have died.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Although at the time he was unconscious, they managed to get him back across ‘Death Valley' as they called it, where he was actually seen by medics,\" she said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"He was covered with a sheet, having had a label tied to him on which a doctor had written ‘maggots'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Thankfully medical staff were able to save his most badly injured leg. However, it did end up 3.5 inches shorter than his other one and he had to wear a surgical boot for the rest of his life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Although he couldn't return to the frontline after his injuries, he was employed by the Army in a civilian capacity at their records' office in Fullwood Barracks, Preston.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    But the war took its toll on John, said Joan, who brought in her typed copy of her father's recollection of the conflict.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"Dad was a very nice man, a gentle man – a wonderful man,\" she said. \"But looking back I think the war must have haunted him a lot, especially when you read his account. My mother used to encourage him to write down his experiences and this seemed to have a calming influence. I also remember him always asking us children to read him fairy tales.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    During WW2, the Army needed Fullwood Barracks for soldiers, causing all civilian personnel to be moved to other record offices. For John this meant working in London through the Blitz, before being moved to Leicester and Edinburgh.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"During my early teens I saw very little of my father,\" recalled Joan. \"But later he was awarded the MBE for his services – which made us all very proud.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; \">Notes for Editors</span></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Europeana&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/</a></strong>&nbsp;is Europe's digital library, archive and museum. It gives people access to over 20 million books, paintings, films, recordings, photographs and archival records from over 2,000 partner organisations, through an interface in 29 languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana has set up a project with Oxford University Computing Services called Europeana 1914-1918 to collect people's digitised photographs, letters, diaries, photographs, film, recordings and objects such as trench art and souvenirs. In the run up to 2014 and the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One, members of the public brought objects and their stories along to roadshows to be professionally digitised and added to the online archive, along with their corresponding descriptions. All material collected by the project is channelled into Europeana.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The project website also shows people how to contribute their own digitised images and stories directly:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Many local libraries and museums do the work of organising and running the roadshows, and to date 15 have taken place in Germany, England, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Denmark. In the run-up to the WW1 centenary Europeana is working with partners in Belgium, Italy, France, Switzerland, Romania, Poland and Austria so that thousands more people will have the opportunity to share their stories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    These family stories complement the national narratives being digitised by national and state libraries for the centenary as part of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Oxford University Computing Services (OUCS)&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Oxford University began the WW1 family history initiative when it asked people across Britain to bring letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised in 2006. This pilot project was funded by JISC, the UK educational technology innovator. Its success encouraged Europeana to approach OUCS to form a partnership to roll out the scheme across Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    OUCS provides training, equipment, digitisation and cataloguing expertise during the roadshow events across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ENDS</p>"

        body: "<p>\r\n    Europeana je evropska digitalna knjižnica, arhiv in muzej. Europeana je spletni portal, ki deluje kot&nbsp;posrednik do milijonov knjig, slik, filmov, muzejskih predmetov in arhivskega gradiva, ki so bili&nbsp;digitalizirani po vsej Evropi. Med strokovnjaki na področju dediščine je Europeana tudi platforma za&nbsp;izmenjavo in spodbuja sodelovanje med knjižničarji, kustosi in arhivisti. Tako ima končni uporabnik&nbsp;možnost integriranega dostopa do kulturne vsebine preko portala Europeana. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Cilji Europeane so določeni v njenem statutu in med drugim vključujejo: &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Zagotoviti dostop do kulturne in znanstvene dediščine Evrope preko portala.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Olajšati formalne dogovore med muzeji, arhivi, avdio‐vizualnimi arhivi in knjižnicami o</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    sodelovanju pri izvajanju in trajnosti skupnega portala.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Spodbujati in omogočati pobude za združevanje obstoječe digitalne vsebine.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n     Podpirati in olajšati digitaliziranje kulturne in znanstvene evropske dediščine. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, direktorica Fundacije Europeana o pomenu Europeane pravi: » Z mrežo preko 90‐tih&nbsp;kulturnih organizacij, Europeana obravnava &nbsp;človeška, politična, tehnična in semantična vprašanja o&nbsp;ustanavljanju skupnega portala. Europeana si prizadeva za javno dostopnost evropske kulture in&nbsp;zakladov vsem državljanom &nbsp;Evrope, tako da je vse zbrano na enem mestu, kljub temu da so predmeti&nbsp;dejansko locirani nekje drugje. Na kratko, Europeana bo zagotovila eno vstopno točko za vse vire o&nbsp;umetnikih, kot je van Gogh, ali glasbenikih, kot je Mozart, na enem mestu. Na koncu bo tako javno&nbsp;dostopno 10 milijonov predmetov. Vsi državljani Evrope bodo imeli koristi od dostopa in izmenjave&nbsp;kulturnih virov in pomagali dvigovati kultno zavedanje.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914‐1918</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana je v Nemčiji leta 2011 pričela z izvajanjem projekta Europeana 1914‐1918. V okviru&nbsp;projekta Europeana 1914‐1918 so pričeli zbirati spomine in družinske zgodbe v zvezi z vojnimi&nbsp;spopadi in medvojnim življenjem civilistov. V večjih mestih po državi je potekalo devet dogodkov, na&nbsp;katerih so zbirali spomine in zgodbe, povezane z družinskimi zgodovinami. Do zdaj je bilo zbranih že&nbsp;25.000 digitalnih slik, med njimi so neobjavljeni dnevniki, na roko narisani zemljevidi, portreti, skice&nbsp;in fotografije, ki opisujejo in prikazujejo življenje med obstreljevanjem, v sanitetnih vodih in v zaledju.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Sedaj se projekt širi v Slovenijo, Veliko Britanijo, Luksemburg, na Irsko in Dansko, pozneje in v letu&nbsp;2013 pa še v nekaj drugih držav, saj želimo ustvariti edinstven vseevropski virtualni arhiv 1. svetovne&nbsp;vojne. Vse zbrane predmete se bo digitaliziralo in objavilo na javno dostopnem spletnem portalu&nbsp;Europeana, v Sloveniji tudi na portalih dLib in Kamra. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dnevi zbiranja spominov v Sloveniji</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Organizatorji si želimo, da bi nam običajne družine zaupajo zgodbo o svojim spominkih, komu so&nbsp;pripadali in zakaj jim toliko pomenijo. Zato so po celi Evropi organizirani Dnevi zbiranja spominov, na&nbsp;katere vabimo vse, ki si želijo deliti svoje zgodbe in tako prispevati v virtualni arhiv spominov na prvosvetovno vojno.

The sector represents 3.3% of EU GDP and over €150 billion in exports.<br>\r\n    \_<br>\r\n    Supporting the European Commission's Digital Agenda, Europeana is working to make data openly available to the public and private sectors so it can be used to develop innovative applications for tablets and smartphones and to create new web services and portals.<br><br>\r\n    Through its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/data-exchange-agreement?utm_campaign=Hack4Europe%20press%20release&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_content=Data%20Exchange%20Agreement\">Data Exchange Agreement</a>, with partners across Europe, it is moving towards the goal of making the data for 23 million cultural objects available for re-use under open licence.<br><br>\r\n    This dataset is already made widely available as an API to the Europeana partner network and was used by event developers from across Europe at each <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/tag/hackathon/?utm_campaign=Hack4Europe%20press%20release&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_content=Hack4Europe%202012\">Hack4Europe! 2012</a> event.<br><br>\r\n    Winners were selected in three categories at each hackathon: greatest commercial potential; greatest social impact; and most innovative.

        title: 'Research to Develop Semantic Similarity'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'OCLC and Europeana are collaborating to investigate ways of creating semantic links between the millions of digital objects that are accessible online through Europeana.eu in order to improve ''similar object'' browsing.'
        body: "<p>Europeana is Europe's digital library, archive and museum. The Europeana platform and network of experts facilitate research and knowledge exchange between librarians, curators and archivists, and link them with digital innovators and the creative industries. Europeana currently gives people access to over 24 million books, paintings, films, recordings, photographs and archival records from 2,200 partner organisations, through an interface in 29 languages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause aggregating metadata from these heterogeneous collections leads to quality issues such as duplication, uneven granularity of the object descriptions, ambiguity between original and derivative versions of the same object, etc., Europeana and OCLC Research are working together on innovation pilots to identify and create semantic links between objects that are connected. Examples of this include: translated copies of the same publication; a painting and a photograph of that painting; different editions of one book; or a collection of letters that belong to the same archive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOCLC Research has extensive experience and expertise in metadata quality improvement techniques and methods, such as duplicate detection and clustering of similar metadata records around FRBR-entity-relationships, reproductions and originals, different cataloguing languages. In addition, OCLC Research is currently experimenting with the automated enhancement of records with links to the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) and other Linked Data elements. The data quality improvement and enrichment efforts of OCLC are part of its philosophy to 'make the metadata work harder for libraries' and to enhance end-user experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe collaboration between Europeana and OCLC Research will benefit both organisations and their partners, offering new opportunities for data enrichment.&nbsp; The outcomes of the research project will feed into the implementation of the Europeana Data Model (EDM), which is devised to improve the browsing experience of the visitors of Europeana.eu. In addition, the piloting of OCLC Research data clustering and enrichment methods and techniques will inform follow-up activities in more innovative directions and opportunities to develop new data services for third parties.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe team members working on the research project are all based in the Netherlands. Europeana team members include: Antoine Isaac, Scientific Coordinator; Valentine Charles, Ingestion Specialist; and Nuno Freire, Interoperability Architect for The European Library. OCLC Research team members include: Titia van der Werf, Senior Program Officer;&nbsp; Shenghui Wang, Research Scientist; and Rob Koopman, Innovation Lab Architect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>More information</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOCLC Research and Europeana Innovation Pilots Activity Page<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/europeana.html\">http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/europeana.html</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nEuropeana<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nEuropeana Data Model<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtual International Authority File (VIAF)<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/viaf/\">http://www.oclc.org/viaf/</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Contacts:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTitia van der Werf<br />\r\nSenior Program Officer<br />\r\nOCLC Research<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:titia.vanderwerf@oclc.org?subject=OCLC%20Europeana%20Announcement\">titia.vanderwerf@oclc.org</a><br />\r\n+31-71-5246500<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAntoine Isaac<br />\r\nScientific Coordinator<br />\r\nEuropeana<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:aisaac@few.vu.nl?subject=OCLC%20Europeana%20Announcement\">aisaac@few.vu.nl</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMelissa Renspie<br />\r\nSenior Communications Officer<br />\r\nOCLC Research<br />\r\n<a href=\"mailto:renspiem@oclc.org?subject=OCLC%20Europeana%20Announcement\">renspiem@oclc.org</a><br />\r\n+1-614-761-5231</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?img_id=1251479&amp;igImageId=1251478&amp;igSmallImage=1&amp;t=1345629134871\" style=\"width: 143px; height: 150px;\" /></p>"

        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'EUscreen makes thousands of items from Europe’s television history freely available through its online portal and through Europeana. The project now announces its online exhibitions, a new addition to the portal that helps users, educators and the general'
        body: "<p>\r\n    The EUscreen collection includes thousands of items. To help users get the most from the EUscreen material, researchers, experts and members of its partner broadcasters and audiovisual archives have created a series of online exhibitions. These exhibitions cover historical events, political debates and everyday life in Europe. Expert knowledge and a fascinating range of materials combine to offer exciting exhibitions on a wide range of subjects. A fine example of such an exhibition is the exhibition <em>Being European</em>, which brings together source materials from providers across the continent and is divided in multiple strands that showcase what European culture and identity may signify.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    These inter-archival exhibitions add new meaning to a wonderful collection of unique television materials and make them accessible to a different and larger audience; later on, visitors will be able to form their own stories and add more connections between the richness of 60 years of television history in Europe. The tools designed for these exhibitions allow for the insertion of multimedia materials from all the project’s content providers and link back to the original items on the site, where users can find out more about them, share the links or get in touch with the providers themselves.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The current release, visible at <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html\">http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html</a>, brings online 10 different exhibitions, some of which are divided into subchapters or strands. The exhibitions are created by archivists, researchers, and enthusiasts. Many more will become available over the next couple of months and EUscreen is working hard to get the tools ready for everyone to start creating their own exhibitions.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Notes for editors</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    EUscreen started in October 2009 as a three-year project, funded by the European Commission’s eContentplus programme. Over the project’s duration more than 30,000 items representing Europe’s television heritage (videos, photographs, articles) will be made available online through a freely accessible multilingual portal.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explore the exhibitions at <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html\">http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html</a><br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For event info and updates on the project, visit <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu\">http://blog.euscreen.eu</a><br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For images and logo materials, visit <a href=\"https://minus.com/mojCJC8YC\">https://minus.com/mojCJC8YC</a><br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;EUscreen: Explore your past - Remix video explaining how EUscreen uncovers television history: <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/31778916\">http://vimeo.com/31778916</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Press contact</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Erwin Verbruggen<br />\r\n    tel: +31 (0) 35 677 16 91<br />\r\n    mob: +31 (0) 6 15 360 371<a href=\"mailto:everbruggen@beeldengeluid.nl\"><br />\r\n    everbruggen@beeldengeluid.nl</a><a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu\"><br />\r\n    blog.euscreen.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    \_</p>"

        title: 'Europeana’s huge cultural dataset opens for re-use'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Opportunities for apps developers, designers and other digital innovators will be boosted today as the digital portal Europeana opens up its dataset of over 20 million cultural objects for free re-use.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    The massive dataset is the descriptive information about Europe's digitised treasures. For the first time, the metadata is released under the Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication, meaning that anyone can use the data for any purpose - creative, educational, commercial - with no restrictions. This release, which is by far the largest one-time dedication of cultural data to the public domain using CC0 offers a new boost to the digital economy, providing electronic entrepreneurs with opportunities to create innovative apps and games for tablets and smartphones and to create new web services and portals.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Europeana's move to CC0 is a step change in open data access. Releasing data from across the memory organisations of every EU country sets an important new international precedent, a decisive move away from the world of closed and controlled data.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Importantly, the change represents a valuable contribution to the European Commission's agenda to drive growth through digital innovation. Online open data is a core resource which can fuel enterprise and create opportunities for millions of Europeans working in Europe's cultural and creative industries. The sector represents 3.3% of EU GDP and is worth over €150 billion in exports.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Welcoming the announcement, Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission with responsibility for the Digital Agenda for Europe, said:<br />\r\n    \"Open data is such a powerful idea, and Europeana is such a cultural asset, that only good things can result from the marriage of the two. People often speak about closing the digital divide and opening up culture to new audiences but very few can claim such a big contribution to those efforts as Europeana's shift to creative commons.\"<br />\r\n    &nbsp;<br />\r\n    Applying the CC0 waiver also means that Europeana's metadata can now be used in Linked Open Data developments. This holds the potential to bring together data from Europe's great libraries, museums and archives with data from other sectors such as tourism and broadcasting.

It currently gives people access to over 20 million books, paintings, films, recordings, photographs and archival records in 29 languages. It represents 2,200 partner organisations, including all the great national collections such as the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the British Library in London and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The Europeana platform and network of experts facilitate research and knowledge exchange between librarians, curators and archivists, and link them with digital innovators and the creative industries.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Europeana actively promotes the use and re-use of open data on the European stage and recognises the importance of clarity in this complex area. It has a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/8a403108-7050-407e-bd00-141c20082afd\">Data Exchange Agreement</a> (DEA) with each of its partner contributors that establishes that Europeana publishes metadata it receives from its data providers under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Common</a>s Zero Universal Public Domain Dedication (CC0 waiver).

Guided by your GPS, you can search Europeana to see if it has images of interesting places and buildings nearby. The app puts the original image as a thin overlay in your viewfinder and you can easily fade in and out to ensure that you take a your picture from a similar view point.<br />\r\n    Time Mash simplifies the process of seeking out history, on location, and connecting to it. The result can then be shared with the world by uploading to the Time Mash server. While you are uploading the new picture you also contribute your geo-location, refining it, so that more people can get there to admire and contribute.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Developed by</strong> Martin Duveborg and Jonas Bolin of the Swedish National Heritage Board<br />\r\n    \_</p>"

        intro: "Bring us your WW1 letters, photos, diaries or recordings\r\n\r\nBanbury Museum, Spiceball Park Road, Banbury, OX16 2PQ\r\n3 November, 2012 10.00am – 4.30pm"
        body: "<p>\r\n    Do you have a box hidden deep in the attic or under the bed that holds your great grandfather's diaries from 1914-1918? His army medals? Or a photo with a special story behind it? If so, it could be part of a unique European WW1 project, shared worldwide to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Oxford University, the British Library and JISC have joined forces with Europeana - Europe's digital museum, library and archive - and local institutions including the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum and Banbury Museum, to gather and tell personal stories from 1914-1918. These valuable stories will then take their place in the ever-growing online European archive of family memorabilia from WW1. And we need people's help.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Families are urged to bring photographs, letters, diaries, film or audio recordings, together with the stories of who they belonged to and why they are important to their families to the Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow at Banbury Museum on 3 November.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Historians and experts from the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, the Western Front Association and Oxford Museum Services will be on hand to talk about the significance of finds, while staff from Oxford University IT Services and the British Library will professionally digitise the objects and upload them to the dedicated <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">europeana1914-1918.eu </a>website on the spot.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Roadshows like this one are being held across Europe as the centenary approaches. Each individual story - that otherwise might never be told outside of the family - is essential to creating a unique European archive and perspective of World War One. Through this archive, stories from countries across Europe will be shared online, accessed by others worldwide and saved for future generations.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    And if people can't get to the event in Banbury, the Europeana 1914-1918 website gives advice on how to can scan, photograph and upload material at home. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor\">europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Digitisation saves precious memorabilia from being lost or thrown away - and it keeps them safe for future use by schools, genealogists, cultural organisations and historians.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's executive director, said:<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    ‘Memorabilia and stories are kept by families.&nbsp; They are hidden archives containing very personal stories of great historical significance. &nbsp;<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    ‘That's why our online archive, which is collecting material from across Europe in a series of roadshows, is so important.

To date 15 roadshows have taken place across Germany, the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Denmark. In the run-up to the WW1 centenary Europeana is working with partners in Belgium, Italy, France, Switzerland, Romania, Poland and Austria. So far, 2,000 people of all ages from across Europe have attended the roadshows to share family stories.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Roadshow participants have been joined by online contributors and 45,000 photos of objects related to WW1 have been uploaded to the Europeana 1914-18 website. All material collected by the project is channelled into Europeana. These family stories complement the national narratives being digitised by national and state libraries for the centenary as part of Europeana Collections 1914-1918. &nbsp;<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Oxford University IT Services</strong><br />\r\n    Oxford University began the WW1 family history initiative when it asked people across Britain to bring letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised in 2006. This pilot project was funded by JISC, the UK educational technology innovator. Its success encouraged Europeana to approach Oxford to form a partnership to roll out the scheme across Europe.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Oxford University IT Services provide training, equipment, digitisation and cataloguing expertise during the roadshow events across Europe.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>The British Library </strong>is a lead player in Europeana Collections 1914-1918 – a three year project to digitise more than 400,000 items from national libraries in eight countries across Europe that found themselves on different sides of the conflict. The Library is also sending curatorial and cataloguing staff to the roadshow event to work alongside Oxford University colleagues in Banbury.<a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\"><br />\r\n    http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>JISC</strong> inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK's position as a global leader in education. JISC's work for the commemoration is focused on giving students, teachers and researchers in higher and further education access to a wealth of unique and authoritative digital resources that can be used and re-used to inspire research and teaching. This event will potentially ‘unlock' resources of huge educational potential which have previously been kept in the nation's attics and drawers, so that we can increase our insight around the war and its legacy. <a href=\"http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/\">http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum</strong> was established in 2000 to find a permanent home for the archives and collections of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, The Oxfordshire Yeomanry and The Oxford University Officers Training Corps. Work on a new museum and research centre began in June 2012 at The Oxfordshire Museum in Woodstock. <a href=\"http://www.sofo.org.uk\"><br />\r\n    www.sofo.org.uk</a><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong>Banbury Museum</strong> opened in 2002, and is situated in an attractive town centre and waterside location. The iconic modern building displays local history collections and hosts touring exhibitions. The Museum offers a family friendly approach, with a busy programme of activities and events for all ages.<a href=\"http://www.banburymuseum.org\"><br />\r\n    www.banburymuseum.org</a><br />\r\n    \_</p>"

And the hope is that the people in the UK can add to this European perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people hope Europeana can help fill the gaps in their family stories. Fourteen-year-old Chloe Coules was the youngest ever member of the British Legion and is keen to find out more about her great-great-grandfathers Lawrence Hyde and William John Mills whose medals she has. Chloe said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'One of my great-great-grandfathers, Lawrence Hyde, must have been courageous and daring, because he lied about his age to join the 17th Lancers, or the 'Death or Glory Boys', at the age of 15. He was at a very similar age to me and it shocks me to think that someone could have fought in a war when so young.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation saves precious memorabilia from being lost or thrown away - and it keeps them safe for future use by schools, genealogists, cultural organisations and historians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin Northover plans to share a unique letter sent from his great-uncle Will Goldsmith in action in France and written on a piece of WW1 fighter plane that had been shot down by his regiment. Kevin said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'It is incredible to think that such a remarkable but personal letter, handwritten by my great uncle Will nearly one hundred years ago, could potentially be read by millions of people online as a result of today's technology and the Europeana WW1 project.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana's executive director, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Memorabilia and stories are kept by families.

In the run-up to the WW1 centenary, Europeana is working with partners in Belgium, Italy, France, Switzerland, Romania, Poland and Austria. So far, 2,000 people of all ages from across Europe have attended the roadshows to share family stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roadshow participants have been joined by online contributors and 45,000 photos of objects related to WW1 have been uploaded to the Europeana 1914-1918 website. All material collected by the project is channelled into Europeana. These family stories complement the national narratives being digitised by national and state libraries for the centenary as part of Europeana Collections 1914-1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Oxford University IT Services</b><br>\r\nOxford University began the WW1 family history initiative when it asked people across Britain to bring letters, photographs and keepsakes from the war to be digitised in 2006. This pilot project was funded by JISC, the UK educational technology innovator. Its success encouraged Europeana to approach Oxford to form a partnership to roll out the scheme across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oxford University IT Services provide training, equipment, digitisation and cataloguing expertise during the roadshow events across Europe.<br><a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/\">www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The British Library</b><br>\r\nThe British Library is a lead player in Europeana Collections 1914-1918, a three year project to digitise more than 400,000 items from national libraries in eight countries across Europe that found themselves on different sides of the conflict. The Library is also sending curatorial and cataloguing staff to the roadshow event to work alongside Oxford University colleagues in Banbury.<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/ </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>JISC</b><br>\r\nJISC inspires UK colleges and universities in the innovative use of digital technologies, helping to maintain the UK's position as a global leader in education. JISC's work for the commemoration is focused on giving students, teachers and researchers in higher and further education access to a wealth of unique and authoritative digital resources that can be used and re-used to inspire research and teaching. This event will potentially 'unlock' resources of huge educational potential which have previously been kept in the nation's attics and drawers, so that we can increase our insight around the war and its legacy.<br><a href=\"http://jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/\">jiscww1.jiscinvolve.org/wp/ </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum</b><br>\r\nSoldiers of Oxfordshire Museum was established in 2000 to find a permanent home for the archives and collections of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, The Oxfordshire Yeomanry and the Oxford University Officers Training Corps, whilst also being a museum of conflict and county. After several successful exhibitions including 'Children and War', work on a new building including a research centre began in August 2012 at the Oxfordshire Museum in Woodstock. It is expected to open to the public in October 2013.<br><a href=\"http://www.sofo.org.uk\">www.sofo.org.uk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Banbury Museum</b><br>\r\nBanbury Museum opened in 2002, and is situated in an attractive town centre and waterside location.

        title: 'beta version of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: '28 November, 2012 - The Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) goes online for the general public today at www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    <img alt=\"DBB logo\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/5da2a345-ee2d-4aba-80dd-15a47eb586fe\" style=\"width: 198px; height: 88px; float: left; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;\" />In Berlin's Altes Museum on the city's Museum Island, Hermann Parzinger, President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and Spokesperson for the Board of the DDB Competence Network,&nbsp; Elke Harjes-Ecker, Head of the Culture Department at Thuringia's Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the DDB Competence Network,&nbsp; Matthias Harbort, Head of New Media for the Federal Government Representative for Culture and Media and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees, as well as Jill Cousins, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, today introduced the new portal together.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This will pave the way for networking all of Germany's cultural and scientific institutions together with their digitised inventories in the medium to long term and integrating them into the European digital library, Europeana. \"The goal of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is to offer everyone unrestricted access to Germany's cultural and scientific heritage, that is, access to millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music and other sound documents, as well as films and scores, from all over Germany,\" explained Hermann Parzinger.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \"The DDB should secure Germany's connectivity and competitiveness in the areas of science, research and education, but also make it possible for anyone to access Germany's unique cultural heritage and knowledge conveniently via one central point of entry,\" emphasised Elke Harjes-Ecker. \"This will bring about a fundamental improvement to our opportunities in the areas of research, education and the economy.\"<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Since the summer of 2007, a competence network made up of representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder and municipalities has been working on this ambitious project. Starting in 2010, the first phase of the technical infrastructure was created at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIA). As technical operator, FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure is responsible for the entire technical and administrative operations of the DDB central infrastructure.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The first public beta version provides users with a great many contents and new functions. Users can explore the entire inventory of items using search terms. In addition, the system provides an advanced search as well as different filters to narrow down results. The information to be found there has been processed with a great deal of editorial care and bears the quality seal of Germany's cultural and scientific institutions. Search results are not influenced by commercial interests. Thanks to the comprehensive preparation of the metadata, it is possible to carry out a uniform search in the collections from different contexts. \"The user will soon be able to navigate between the objects found using semantic references, which will open up unexpected content and contexts. This will highlight connections and cross-references that are not clearly visible on the websites of individual institutions or on domain-specific sites, such as purely library-based portals for example. This is a feature unique to the DDB,\" explained Matthias Harbort.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    One important function fulfilled by the DDB is that of national data aggregator for the European cultural portal, Europeana. It enables German cultural and scientific institutions to make a significant contribution towards this European project. \"The Europeana emerged from the conviction that free, democratic access to cultural heritage must be guaranteed for everyone so that the opportunities provided by digitalisation can be used for the further development of our society,\" said Jill Cousins. \"We are happy to have the DDB on board as a central national partner whose support will help us work towards fulfilling our objective.\"<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Like many internet services, the DDB lives from participation. On the one hand from those who provide content and, on the other, from those who use the portal and recommend it further. \"All of Germany's scientific, research and cultural institutions are invited to support the continued expansion of the DDB to make it more attractive,\" says Elke Harjes-Ecker. The institutions that have provided their content for the DDB already enjoy many advantages. The central access provided by the DDB takes users reliably to digitised cultural items from Germany. As the digital items are always linked to the location where the actual works and objects can be found, this increases the visibility and public awareness of the institutions in question, so they can expect an increase in visitor numbers both online and offline.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Soon the institutions will be able to exchange information and ideas and support one another via the emerging DDB network. What is more, the DDB offers tools and services that should help the institutions in future to prepare, edit and present their own digitised objects.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    In the course of the coming year, the DDB will already be adding successively to the functions it provides and will optimise the search for and networking of objects. The virtual exhibitions put together by experts will clearly present the entire range of cultural heritage to be made accessible via the DDB. The portal will act as a continuously growing network for the participating cultural and scientific institutions. Moreover, an application programming interface (API) will enable the development of services around the DDB, for example, specific applications for smartphones and tablets.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    \"Today's launch of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek beta version goes a long way to realising our vision of making the cultural and scientific heritage of Germany available in digital form via the portal,\" explained Hermann Parzinger. \"However, we have not yet reached our destination. This is a process that will take years to complete.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Press contact:<br />\r\n    Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek<br />\r\n    Achim Klapp, Tel.: +49 (0)30 ‐ 25 79 70 16<br />\r\n    Wilhelm Nöldeke, Tel.: +49 (0)30 ‐ 23 00 31 77<a href=\"mailto:presse@deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de\"><br />\r\n    presse@deutsche-­digitale‐bibliothek.de</a><a href=\"http://www.deutsche-­digitale-­bibliothek.de\"><br />\r\n    www.deutsche-­digitale-­bibliothek.de</a></p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/8e535db0-32ec-41b9-9c18-d6b694831410\" style=\"width: 377px; height: 51px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning in December 2012, the online platform Europeana will host about one million historical images coming fresh from the archives of nine European news agencies participating in the EURO-Photo project: ANSA in Italy, belga in Belgium, dpa in Germany, EFE in Spain, Lusa in Portugal, MTI in Hungary, PAP in Poland, Scanpix in Denmark and epa worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agencies forming the EURO-Photo consortium, have digitised about one million historical images to be available both on Europeana and its commercial portal <a href=\"http://www.europhoto.eu.com/\">http://www.europhoto.eu.com</a>, the world's first historical photo journalism site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> is a platform for the exchange of knowledge among librarians, curators, archivists, creative industries and the public . It is a single access point to millions of images, books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe. Endorsed by the European Commission, Europeana is a prestigious initiative and is a means to stimulate creative economy and promote cultural tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a common project, the nine European news agencies have gone a step further and created a comprehensive historical photo archive especially for their customers on <a href=\"http://www.europhoto.eu.com/\">www.europhoto.eu.com</a>. This fantastic source of 20th century European historical photographs, many of which have never seen the light of day before, captures events that shaped history – be it news items, politics, sport, culture, entertainment or ordinary daily life in different eras. The EURO-Photo platform contains historic moments of European history such as the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, the Chernobyl disaster, King Leopold abdication in Belgium, Allied Forces in post-war Germany , and even going back to cultural events such as the first performance of Henrik Ibsen's plays in 1880s in Copenhagen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneously, \_this treasure trove will also be made available to customers by each individual agency taking part in the project on their respective websites or other distribution systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information please contact the project co-ordinator <a href=\"mailto:maurizio.lunetta@ansa.it\">maurizio.lunetta@ansa.it</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A range of images are available for journalists to use for editorial purposes only, please find\_ a small selection below - click on an image to download a larger version.

        title: 'Roadshow in Nicosia a success'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>More than 500 WW1 images are published on the Europeana 1914-1918 project website.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana, Europe's digital library, museum and archive, saves and makes public the memories and personal accounts of World War One through the project Europeana 1914-1918. After a successful start in Germany last year, the project expanded to other European countries like the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Denmark and recently Cyprus.<br><br>\r\nFollowing the success of the roadshows that took place in six European countries and attracted thousands of participants from all ages, another roadshow was held in Nicosia on the weekend of 1-2 December. Historians and experts welcomed participants and talked about the significance of their memorabilia, while staff from the Cyprus Library digitised the objects and uploaded them to the dedicated <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">europeana1914-1918.eu</a> website on the spot.<br><br>\r\nThe untold stories of Cypriots participating in WW1 made Nicosia's roadshow a great success. More than 150 people contributed the WW1 memorabilia of their ancestors, such as photographs, letters and diaries, at the roadshow. So far, more than 500 digital images from Cypriots have been published on the project website, adding to the rich archive of thousands of WW1 images from all over Europe.<br><br>\r\nOne of the first items that was made available online is the list of all Cypriots who served in WW1 that was compiled in 1919. The source is kept at the National Archives of the UK. This list is a unique historical source for Cypriot history. It states the names of about 11,000 Cypriots serving from 1916-1919 in the Macedonian Mule Corps. Thanks to the project, the list is now available online (at the websites of the Cyprus Library and the Ministry of Education and Culture), so that every Cypriot family can discover if their grandfathers or great-grandfathers took part in WWI.<br><br>\r\nAnother key finding was the extraordinary story of Agathoklis Hajichristodoulou from Polystipos – who was later named 'Polistipiotis'. Agathoklis lost both his legs in the Salonika front to frostbite and after that he was given a set of ‘new' prosthetic legs and 40 pounds as a compensation. When he came back to Cyprus he was given a job in the Forestry Department, but after about a decade of service, he was fired because he constantly complained about his legs, which had been replaced twice. So in the late 1930s, he was given 50 pounds and another new set of legs to start working as a shoemaker. Later on Agathoklis started writing poems which he sold at local fairs to be able to make a living. He died in Cyprus in 1964. One of the three sets of prosthetic legs that Agathoklis changed is now kept at the London Science Museum.<br><br>\r\nAmong the many items was also a contribution of a set of binoculars and a diary which belonged to a captain of WW1 named ‘Michael Savva' whose ship Evaggelistria was used to carry pomace (pulp from oil extractions). During the Great War, his ship was bombed and sunk by the French who falsely accused him of carrying fuel to enemy troops. Michael Savva survived the explosion and was sent to Egypt where he experienced horrifying times in jail and was later sentenced to death. Luckily, a few months later all accusations were withdrawn and Michael was sent back to Cyprus. He died 7 years later in 1923, depressed by not being able to return to a life on the sea. Both binoculars and diaries were brought to the roadshow by his grandson, Andreas Keleshis.<br><br>\r\nMr. Andreas Michael the president of Filia Community who contributed medals, pictures and diaries of Cypriot WW1 soldiers said:<br>\r\n'We would like to thank Europeana, the Cultural Services of Education and Culture and the Cyprus Library for giving us this unique opportunity to highlight at a pan-European level the heroism and contribution of our fellow citizens during the Great War.'<br><br>\r\nThe Nicosia roadshow revealed many unpublished stories describing the experiences and the contribution of Cypriots during the WW1, stories that will be available to all Cypriots and will therefore benefit WW1 research and education for current and future generations. The project helps to keep this type of stories alive; it saved these precious memorabilia from being lost or thrown away - and will definitely provide unique resources for research and education in Cyprus and abroad.<br><br>\r\nPavlos Paraskevas, Director of the Cultural Services of the Ministry of Education and Culture, which is the main partner of the project in Cyprus, said:<br>\r\n'The Ministry of Education and Culture is thrilled with the success of the first WW1 roadshow in Cyprus. We would like to thank all the people who participated in this initiative and digitised their family memorabilia. They have helped us to unveil uknown stories and keep them alive so that they are available for research and educational purposes. With the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One fast approaching, we are confident that Cyprus will be an important contributor to this unique archive with images that show the impact the Great War had in the lives of ordinary people.'<br><br>\r\nFor those who were not able to attend the event in Nicosia, the Europeana 1914-1918 website gives advice on how to scan, photograph and upload material at home: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor\">europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributor</a><br><br>\r\n-ENDS-<br><br><strong>About Europeana 1914-1918</strong>:<br>\r\nThe Europeana 1914-1918 project is a joint initiative of the European digital library Europeana, Oxford University and many local partners. The European public is invited to share their private memorabilia from the First World War on the web. This could be photographs, letters, diaries, short films, audio recordings, objects and their stories that will be digitised professionally and added to the online archive, along with corresponding descriptions. Independently of the roadshows, everyone can contribute their digitised images and information to the website - <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a>. We will collect memorabilia in digital form from many of the countries across Europe until 2014, the year of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One. The project aims to save people's family memories of this tragedy that convulsed Europe and make them accessible to the world.<br><br><strong>About Europeana:</strong><br>\r\nEuropeana (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a>) is Europe's digital library, archive and museum.

        body: "<p><strong>In het kader van het project Europeana 1914-1918 waarmee men een Europese archiefdatabank over de Eerste Wereldoorlog tot stand wil brengen, kwam het team van Europeana naar Ieper om er de vrijwilligers te helpen met het scannen en delen van hun voorwerpen en verhalen met betrekking tot WO I.</strong><br><br>\r\nEuropeana 1914-1918 is een Europees project om de herinnering aan de Eerste Wereldoorlog opnieuw tot leven te brengen. In het kader van dit project is Europeana op zoek naar familiegetuigenissen. Vandaag start in Ieper de campagne voor België. 'Al meer dan 45.000 voorwerpen, documenten, foto's en verhalen werden in heel de Europese Unie verzameld voor de website Europeana 14-18. Nu is het de beurt aan de frontstreek van ons land. Geschiedenis delen met elkaar, in de gehele Unie en via het net met de hele wereld, is in het licht van de eeuwherdenking van de Eerste Wereldoorlog een bijzonder zinvolle wijze van herdenken,' vernemen we van Piet Chielens, coördinator van het In Flanders Fields Museum.<br><br>\r\nVeel mensen hebben thuis of op zolder een oude doos met brieven, foto's, dagboeken, voorwerpen of medailles uit WO I. Iedereen die over dergelijke documenten beschikt, wordt uitgenodigd om deze te delen en op die manier mee te werken aan het project Europeana 1914-1918.<br><br><strong>Online delen, met de hele wereld</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Er zijn twee mogelijkheden om deze documenten te delen. Belgen met interesse worden uitgenodigd om naar een van de ‘collectiedagen' te komen, zoals deze die vandaag, woensdag, in Ieper plaatsvindt en waarvan er in 2013 nog verschillende over heel België worden georganiseerd. Daarnaast kunnen ze hun documenten ook delen via de webportaal van Europeana: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914/18.eu/nl/contributor\">http://www.europeana1914/18.eu/nl/contributor</a>. Het ‘online' deel van het project is immers erg belangrijk en geniet de steun van de universiteit van Oxford: 'We zijn blij dat we kunnen deel uitmaken van een dergelijk project', vertelt Dr. Stuart Lee, Deputy CIO van de dienst IT Services bij de universiteit van Oxford. 'Wij lanceerden dit idee voor het online inzamelen van herinneringen bij burgers in heel Europa. Een collectiedag in Ieper, een stad die historisch zo belangrijk is, geeft ons een formidabele kans om meer zicht te krijgen op de bestaande oorlogserfenis in de verschillende regio's van Europa.'<br><br>\r\nPersoonlijke familieverhalen, die misschien nooit werden gedeeld buiten de familie, kunnen nu worden opgenomen in de databank en op die manier verspreid en bewaard worden. Dit biedt elke Belg ook de kans om mee te werken aan een groter project dat de Belgische grenzen overstijgt.<br><br>\r\nJill Cousins, Executive Director Europeana: 'De herinneringen en verhalen worden binnen families bewaard. Er zijn verborgen archieven met zeer persoonlijke verhalen die historisch erg belangrijk zijn. Om die reden vind ik het zo belangrijk dat we online archiveren, waarbij dankzij een reeks collectiedagen in heel Europa materiaal wordt bijeengebracht. Europeana biedt een nieuwe aanpak voor de culturele geschiedenis, door het creëren van links tussen de geschiedenis van individuen en de officiële geschiedenis, door het tonen van verschillende versies van eenzelfde stukje verleden. We willen mensen aanmoedigen om samen een collectief geheugen te realiseren voor een oorlog die het dagelijkse leven van de Europeanen sterk heeft beïnvloed, ongeacht aan welke kant ze stonden.'<br><br><strong>Professionele verwerking\_\_</strong> \_<br><br>\r\nDe door Europeana ingezamelde documenten worden ingedeeld, behandeld en gebruikt volgens een nauwgezette en wetenschappelijke methodologie. Tijdens de collectiedagen zijn er experts aanwezig om de mensen meer te vertellen over de voorwerpen die ze meebrengen en de geschiedenis ervan.<br><br>\r\nAfstand doen van familiedocumenten is niet altijd evident. Daarom vraagt Europeana enkel een scan van deze foto's, brieven of kaarten. Het originele document blijft in het bezit van de bijdrager.<br><br><strong>Een project van Europese omvang</strong><br><br>\r\nMet dit unieke project wil men een gigantische Europese databank uitbouwen, een archief over WO I dat met de hele wereld zal kunnen worden gedeeld. Over heel Europa zijn er een vijftiental collectiedagen, een aantal hebben al met succes plaatsgevonden. Tot de landen waarin deze campagne loopt behoren\_ Duitsland, het Verenigd Koninkrijk, Ierland, Luxemburg, Slovenië en Denemarken. Na Ieper volgen er in België nog andere initiatieven, waarover Europeana weldra meer informatie zal verspreiden.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nota voor de redactie</strong><br><br>\r\nEuropeana (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">europeana.eu</a>) is een bibliotheek, archief en museum over Europa, in digitale vorm.<br><br>\r\nHet project Europeana 1914-1918 (<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">europeana1914-1918.eu</a>) wil nieuwe bronnen bieden voor onderwijs, tentoonstellingen, toepassingen en diensten die de herinnering aan de Eerste Wereldoorlog en hun invloed op het leven van de mensen moeten laten voortleven.<br><br>\r\nTal van lokale musea en bibliotheken werken mee aan de organisatie en dagelijkse werking van de reizende tentoonstellingen. De dienst Patrimonium van Ieper en het Vredescentrum van Antwerpen zijn de belangrijkste lokale partners voor de organisatie van dit project. Tot nu toe vonden er 25 tentoonstellingen plaats, in Duitsland, Groot-Brittannië, Ierland, Luxemburg, Slovenië, Denemarken en Cyprus. In 2014 zal het 100 jaar geleden zijn dat de Eerste Wereldoorlog uitbrak en in het kader daarvan werkt Europeana ook samen met partners in Italië, Frankrijk, Roemenië en Oostenrijk. Voor België zijn de partners onder meer de stad Ieper, het In Flanders Field Museum en de provincie Limburg. Tot nu toe hebben al ruim 2.000 mensen van alle leeftijden en uit heel Europa deelgenomen aan de collectiedagen en er hun familiegeschiedenis gedeeld.<br><br>\r\nNaast de deelnemers aan de tentoonstellingen waren er nog de online bijdragers. Ondertussen werden er al ongeveer 50.000 foto's en scans van voorwerpen die verband houden met WO I geüpload op de website Europeana 1914-18. Alle documenten die in het kader van het project worden verzameld, passeren eerst langs Europeana. Deze familieverhalen zijn een aanvulling bij de nationale documenten die naar aanleiding van de herdenking van deze oorlog en in het kader van Europeana Collections 1914-1918 worden gedigitaliseerd door de nationale en regionale bibliotheken.<br><br><strong>Wilt u graag een interview of bijkomende informatie?

Dans le cadre de ce projet, Européana est à la recherche de témoignages de famille. Aujourd'hui, c'était à Ypres que la campagne en Belgique a été lancée. « Plus de 45.000 objets, documents, photos et histoires ont déjà été récoltés dans l'Union Européenne pour le site Europeana 14-18. C'est maintenant au tour de la région de la ligne de front de notre pays. Partager de telles histoires avec d'autres personnes dans toute l'Union Européenne et avec le monde entier via le net\_ est, dans le cadre du siècle de commémoration de la Première Guerre Mondiale, une manière exceptionnelle de se remémorer les faits » déclare Piet Chielens de l'In Flanders Fields Museum.<br><br>\r\nChacun possède certainement chez lui ou dans son grenier une vieille boîte contenant des lettres, des photos, des journaux intimes, des objets ou médailles de la Première Guerre Mondiale. Toutes les personnes retrouvant de tels documents sont invitées à les partager et d'ainsi faire partie du projet Europeana 1914-1918.<br><br><strong>Partage en ligne, dirigé vers les monde entier</strong><br><br>\r\nDeux possibilités sont proposées afin de partager ces documents. Les Belges intéressés sont soit invités à se rendre à un des ‘collect days' – comme celui d'Ypres qui a eu lieu ce mercredi - qui auront lieu durant l'année 2013 en Belgique, soit à les partager en ligne via le portail en ligne d'Europeana: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributor\">http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/fr/contributor</a>. Le côté ‘online' du projet est en effet très important et bénéficie du support de l'Université d'Oxford:\_ « Nous sommes heureux de faire partie d'un tel projet. », dit le Docteur Stuart Lee, Député CIO des services IT de l'Université d'Oxford, « Nous avons lancé cette idée de collecte de souvenirs en ligne auprès de la communauté. Un jour de collecte dans une ville comme Ypres, si importante historiquement, va nous offrir une opportunité formidable afin d'évaluer l'héritage de la guerre existant dans les différentes régions de l'Europe. »<br><br>\r\nLes histoires personnelles de famille, qui n'ont peut-être jamais été partagées en dehors de celle-ci pourront alors dès ce moment faire partie de la base de données et être diffusées et sauvegardées. Ceci offre la possibilité à tout Belge de faire partie d'un projet plus important et qui dépasse les frontières de la Belgique.<br><br>\r\nJill Cousins, Directeur Exécutif d'Europeana déclare « les souvenirs et les histoires sont gardés par les familles. Il existe des archives cachées qui contiennent des histoires très personnelles d'une grande importance historiquement. C'est pourquoi notre archivage en ligne, qui collecte du matériel à travers l'Europe grâce à une série de ‘collect days', est si important. Europeana apporte une nouvelle approche de l'histoire culturelle, créant le lien entre les histoires des gens et l'histoire officielle, et démontrant les versions différentes d'un même morceau d'histoire. Nous voulons encourager les gens à créer leur mémoire collective d'une guerre qui a fortement affecté la vie quotidienne des Européens, peu importe de quel côté de la bataille ils étaient. »<br><br><strong>Traitement professionnel\_\_</strong> \_<br><br>\r\nLes documents collectés par Europeana sont catégorisés, traités et exploités selon une méthodologie rigoureuse et scientifique. Durant les ‘collect days', des experts seront présents afin d'en dire plus sur les objets et leur histoire aux personnes qui les ramènent.<br><br>\r\nDe plus, se séparer de documents de famille n'est pas toujours évident. C'est pourquoi Europeana ne demande qu'un scan de ces photos, lettres ou cartes. Le document original reste entre les mains du contributeur.<br><br><strong>Un projet à taille européenne</strong><br><br>\r\nLe but de ce projet unique est de construire une immense database européenne, un lieu d'archives pour la mémoire de la Première Guerre Mondiale, dont tous les documents pourront être partagés avec le monde entier. Une quinzaine de ‘collect days' seront ou ont déjà été organisés avec succès à travers l'Europe, notamment en Allemagne, au Royaume-Uni, en Irlande, au Luxembourg, en Slovénie ou au Danemark. Après Ypres, d'autres initiatives suivront en Belgique, à propos desquelles Europeana communiquera d'ici peu.<br><br><strong>Note aux rédactions</strong><br><br>\r\nEuropeana (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">europeana.eu</a>) est la bibliothèque, l'archive et le musée numériques de l'Europe.<br><br>\r\nLe projet Europeana 1914-1918 (<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">europeana1914-1918.eu</a>) vise à fournir de nouvelles ressources uniques pour l'éducation, des expositions, des applications et des services ayant pour mission de faire perdurer le souvenir de la Première Guerre mondiale et de ses effets sur la vie des gens.<br><br>\r\nDe nombreux musées et bibliothèques locaux se chargent de l'organisation et du fonctionnement quotidien des expositions itinérantes ; la cellule de patrimoine d'Ypres et le centre pour la paix d'Anvers sont des partenaires locaux importants pour l'organisation de ce projet. Jusqu'à présent, 25 expositions ont eu lieu en Allemagne, en Grande-Bretagne, en Irlande, au Luxembourg, en Slovénie, au Danemark et à Chypre . Dans le cadre du centenaire de la Première Guerre mondiale, Europeana travaille avec des partenaires en Belgique - comme la ville d'Ypres, le In Flanders Field Museum ou la province du Limbourg - en Italie, en France, en Roumanie, et en Autriche. Jusqu'à présent, plus de 2.000 personnes de tous âges et de l'Europe entière ont participé aux tournées afin de partager des histoires de famille.<br><br>\r\nLes participants aux expositions ont été rejoints par des contributeurs en ligne, si bien que 50.000 photos ou objets liés à la Première Guerre mondiale ont été uploadés sur le site web Europeana 1914-18. Tous les documents collectés par le projet passent par Europeana. Ces histoires de famille complètent les récits nationaux numérisés par les bibliothèques nationales et régionales pour le centenaire, dans le cadre d'Europeana Collections 1914-1918.<br><br><br><strong>Europeana se tient à votre disposition pour toute interview ou précision supplémentaire.</strong><br><br>\r\nContact :<br>\r\nJo Detavernier<br><a href=\"mailto:Jo.detavernier@finn.be\">Jo.detavernier@finn.be</a><br>\r\n0486 45 69 81<br><br><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "To mark the beginning of a unique digital collaboration, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and Europeana are pleased to announce the launch of Leaving Europe: A new life in America.\r\n\r\nRead press release in Dutch or French"
        body: "<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The all-new virtual exhibition tells the story of European emigration to the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries. Jointly curated by the two digital libraries, the exhibition uses photographs, manuscripts, broadsheets, paintings, letters, audio, government documents and other unique materials to chart people's journeys across the European continent and their settlement in the United States. The digital items displayed are from U.S. and European libraries, museums and archives and the accompanying narrative has been commissioned specially for the exhibition from U.S. and European experts.&nbsp; </span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">‘By combining forces to show how Europeans began new lives in the New World, Europeana and the DPLA have demonstrated a principle that goes far beyond the immediate subject of their exhibition: to build a successful digital future, we must collaborate on an international scale,' said Robert Darnton, DPLA Steering Committee member and Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and Director of the Harvard University Library. ‘The exhibition inaugurates an alliance that will multiply the benefits of the Internet for generation after generation, everywhere in the world.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The DPLA and Europeana—guided by a common mission to make the riches of libraries, museums, and archives openly available to everyone in the world—collaborated regularly with curators, content partners, project staff, and others to design and build the exhibition cooperatively. <em>Leaving Europe: A new life in America</em> represents the starting point of a significant long-term relationship between the two digital libraries. </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">‘I am delighted at this first joint initiative between the DPLA and Europeana, one on an eminently trans-Atlantic subject,' said Bruno Racine, Chair of the Europeana Executive Committee. ‘We share common goals—the free circulation of ideas and knowledge, dedication to the public good—and we believe that the digital revolution opens up unprecedented possibilities for exchanges like this one. I am very proud that Europeana can in this way express its support for the DPLA and for the values it defends.'</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Over 30 million Europeans, from as far north as Scandinavia and as far south as Sicily, set sail to America in the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century. The exhibition, organized across seven major themes, describes the experiences that different groups of hopeful immigrants from across Europe faced. The exhibition allows the virtual visitor to accompany them on their often difficult journey from their native region and country, across the Atlantic and into the ports, cities and local communities of the United States. </span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><em>Leaving Europe: A new life in America</em> is presented in French and English and features over 100 rare digitized items, many of which have not been made available before. Europeana's contributing partners to the exhibition include the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Jewish Museum of London, the Royal Library of the Netherlands, the Saxon State Library and the Norwegian Photo Archives. The DPLA's contributors include the New York Public Library, Harvard University, The (U.S.) National Archives and Records Administration, and the University of Minnesota Immigration History Research Center.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">••••</span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Notes for Editors</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Europeana launched in 2008 and the DPLA will officially launch a prototype on April 18, 2013. They have made commitments to make their systems and data interoperable to the greatest possible extent; to promote open access through joint existing and new policies concerning content, data, and metadata; and to collaborate regularly on developing specific aspects of their systems, beginning with an interoperable data model, a shared source code, and cooperative collection building. The two digital libraries announced their collaboration in October 2011.</span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">About the Digital Public Library of America</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The DPLA is taking the first concrete steps toward the realization of a large-scale digital public library that will make the cultural and scientific record available to all. This impact-oriented research effort unites leaders from all types of libraries, museums, and archives with educators, industry, and government to define the vision for a digital library in service of the American public.

Prior to that time, transatlantic migration was a minor affair, mostly involving merchants, civil servants and soldiers. Within a few decades, it all changed rapidly. Europe was on the brink of a new era, with migration to the U.S. more extensive than ever before and ever to come. From every corner of the European continent, all kinds of people decided to leave their homelands and headed for the young and promising nation on the other side of the Atlantic. In less than a century, over 30 million Europeans, from as far north as Scandinavia and as far south as Sicily, set sail to America.</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/abb1f460-89b2-4106-ad72-f8c192f06fb8\" /><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Image: Climbing into America, Ellis Island, 1905 (1905) </span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Credit: The Photography Collection, The New York Public Library, NY, USA. </span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">View more information about this image online:<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?212025\" rel=\"httpdigitalgallery.nypl.orgnypldigitalid?212025\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Climbing into America\">http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/id?212025</a></span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Download hi-res:<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/efa52806-b365-4185-927b-7e4b969af8d9\" rel=\"httppro.europeana.eudocuments89999efa52806-b365-4185-927b-7e4b969af8d9\" title=\"Climbing into America hi-res file\">http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/efa52806-b365-4185-927b-7e4b969af8d9</a></span></em></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/82ef9f39-170a-45de-b66b-4c9e82f5a897\" /><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Image: Emigrants at Ellis Island – two Italian children</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Credit: French National Library - Bibliothèque Nationale de France, public domain image</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">View more information about this image online:<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/DA0CF42F379E7F482C8CAA0C22AA27D0A601EB52.html\" rel=\"httpwww.europeana.euportalrecord9200103DA0CF42F379E7F482C8CAA0C22AA27D0A601EB52.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Emigrants at Ellis Island\">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/DA0CF42F379E7F482C8CAA0C22AA27D0A601EB52.html</a></span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Download hi-res:<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/0b59ca6c-6486-45e6-b0b7-fa3406423a73\" rel=\"httppro.europeana.eudocuments899990b59ca6c-6486-45e6-b0b7-fa3406423a73\" title=\"Emigrants at Ellis Island hi-res version\">http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/0b59ca6c-6486-45e6-b0b7-fa3406423a73</a></span></em></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    &nbsp;<br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Departure and Crossing: Ports of Departure and Shipping Companies</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Rotterdam, Antwerp, Hamburg, Bremen, Goteborg, Naples, Le Havre, Cork, Belfast and Liverpool were the most important ports of departure. In the 1840s, steamships began transporting wealthy passengers while poor immigrants still made the voyage to America by sailing vessel. In the 1860s and 1870s, the size of steamships increased, and companies transported poor families in steerage at low cost. Transporting immigrants became big business. The major European passenger companies had extensive networks of ticket agencies, and worked diligently to attract business. They published literature describing the merits of America, and did nothing to dispel the notion that American streets were paved with gold. Steamship companies had to be selective, however, in whom they accepted as passengers because the companies had to pay the return passage of any immigrant who was turned away from America. To this end, they examined prospective passengers to make sure they met the health and financial requirements for acceptance into America. </span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/992d8755-60b4-4b74-9ce6-016700441401\" /><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Image: Russian Jews being examined by a doctor before emigration from Liverpool (1891)</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Credit: The Wellcome Library, London, CC-BY-NC</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">View more information about this image online: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/29E2155FD46B9368BAD97548789EF1744E2BB582.html\" rel=\"httpwww.europeana.euportalrecord920010529E2155FD46B9368BAD97548789EF1744E2BB582.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Russian jews being examined by a doctor\"><br />\r\n    http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/</a></span></em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/29E2155FD46B9368BAD97548789EF1744E2BB582.html\" rel=\"httpwww.europeana.euportalrecord920010529E2155FD46B9368BAD97548789EF1744E2BB582.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Russian jews being examined by a doctor\"><em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">29E2155FD46B9368BAD97548789EF1744E2BB582.html</span></em></a><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Download hi-res: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/52c1c36f-5890-4a04-926b-16fe3397a80c\" rel=\"httppro.europeana.eudocuments8999952c1c36f-5890-4a04-926b-16fe3397a80c\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Russian jews being examined by a doctor hi-res version\"><br />\r\n    http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/52c1c36f-5890-4a04-926b-16fe3397a80c</a></span></em></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Life in America: Work</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Immigrants who didn't farm worked for wages in mines and mills where they were paid more than they would be in comparable positions in their homelands. Unskilled immigrants also found employment extending the growing transport systems of canals and later railways, paving streets, digging sewers and building residential, commercial, or public buildings. Women served as domestics or washerwomen, and some immigrant women worked at home sewing clothing or assembling artificial flowers, for example, so they wouldn't have to leave their children alone. Skilled immigrants worked as craftsmen. By the 1880s, as a result of industrialisation, most immigrants worked in cities, manufacturing clothing or operating small businesses such as barbershops, restaurants, and shoeshine parlours. To help make ends meet, children also worked - shining shoes, selling newspapers, or working in factories. Working conditions were severe, with long hours, low wages, and often unclean or unsafe work environments. </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/d5627af8-9b7b-46f6-a5c5-76f56cf3ac94\" /><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Image: Mrs. Larocca making willow plumes in an unlicenced tenement.</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Credit: NARA, unrestricted, public domain</span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">View more information about this image online: <a href=\"http://research.archives.gov/description/523526\" rel=\"httpresearch.archives.govdescription523526\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mrs. Larocca making willow plumes in an unlicenced tenement\"><br />\r\n    http://research.archives.gov/description/523526</a></span></em><br />\r\n    <em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Download hi-res:<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/f8afdc6d-1b44-455e-b43b-6dca7ab86ea7\" rel=\"httppro.europeana.eudocuments89999f8afdc6d-1b44-455e-b43b-6dca7ab86ea7\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mrs. Larocca making willow plumes in an unlicenced tenement hi-res version\">http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/f8afdc6d-1b44-455e-b43b-6dca7ab86ea7</a></span></em></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The man on the left of this photograph, Peder (Peter) Martinson Eyes, was born on 25 January 1886 in Island Hjellan, Norway.

        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) launched a beta of its discovery portal and open platform today.'
        body: "<div>\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/63e3d338-f541-476b-a248-8f514c614ac6\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    The portal delivers millions of materials found in American archives, libraries, museums, and cultural heritage institutions to students, teachers, scholars, and the public. Far more than a search engine, the portal provides innovative ways to search and scan through its united collection of distributed resources. Special features include a dynamic map, a timeline that allow users to visually browse by year or decade, and an app library that provides access to applications and tools created by external developers using DPLA's open data.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"The wonder and joy of entering an expansive library for the first time is truly a special feeling. We are delighted to be able to share this unified, open collection with Americans and the world, and can't wait to see what people discover, and what new applications and knowledge will be created,\" said Dan Cohen, Executive Director of the DPLA.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"Many decades in the visioning, two and a half years in the planning, with a small steering committee and an incubation hub at the helm, and featuring dozens of great libraries, universities and archives involved in hundreds of meetings, workshops, plenary meetings, and hackathons, attracting thousands of volunteers backed by millions of foundation and government dollars, today the Digital Public Library of America goes live! It's a great day for education and progress, as if the Ancient Library of Alexandria had met the Modern World Wide Web and digitized America for the benefit of all,\" said Doron Weber, Vice President of Programs at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, an early funder of the project.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/364740f5-439f-4e14-90f7-34110fa3526a\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The DPLA portal is powered by a rich repository of information, known as the DPLA platform, which enables new and transformative uses of America's digitized cultural heritage. With an application programming interface (API) and maximally open data, the DPLA can be used by software developers, researchers, and others to create novel environments for learning, tools for discovery, and engaging apps. The DPLA App Library (<a href=\"http://dp.la/apps/\" rel=\"DPLA apps\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DPLA apps\">dp.la/apps</a>) features an initial slate of applications built on top of the platform; developers and hobbyists of all skill levels are freely able to make use of the data provided via the platform.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"The DPLA launches virtually today, a symbol of what people can accomplish through collaboration in a networked era,\" said John Palfrey, president of the Board of Directors of the DPLA.&nbsp; \"The most exciting idea is that we cannot begin to imagine the extraordinary things that librarians and their many partners can accomplish with this open platform and such extraordinarily rich materials, from so many institutions large and small, together and at the ready.&nbsp; We will create new knowledge together and make accessible, free to all, information that people need in order to thrive in a democracy.\" </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;\"The DPLA's goal is to bring the entire nation's rich cultural collections off the shelves and into the innovative environment of the Internet for people to discover, download, remix, reuse and build on in ways we haven't yet begun to imagine,\" said Maura Marx, Director of the DPLA Secretariat. \"Regular users can search in the traditional way using the portal, and developers and innovators can build on big chunks of code and content using the platform—we're creating access, not controlling it.\" </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Led by Cohen, the DPLA aims to expand the realm of openly available materials, and make those riches more easily discovered and more widely usable and used. To date, the DPLA has partnered with six state and regional digital libraries and an equal number of large cultural heritage institutions— including the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Smithsonian Institution, the New York Public Library, and Harvard University—to provide access to millions of unique digital objects.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"Among the 2.4 million records available at launch, you will find gems that include daguerreotypes of former Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, images of women marching for the vote in Kentucky, news film clips of the Freedom Riders during the Civil Rights movement, The Book of Hours, an illuminated manuscript from 1514, <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em>, written by Thomas Jefferson, and paintings by Winslow Homer,\" said Emily Gore, DPLA Director for Content.&nbsp; </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/4d5ce23a-9b5a-41e5-894b-434a8f294c3a\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">With its content partners, the DPLA has developed a number of diverse virtual exhibitions (<a href=\"http://dp.la/exhibitions/\" rel=\"DPLA exhibitions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DPLA exhibitions\">dp.la/exhibitions</a>) that tell the stories of people, places, and historical events both here in the US and abroad; all are available freely via the portal. <em>A History of Survivance: 19th c. Upper Midwest Native American Resources</em> in the DPLA, developed by the Minnesota Digital Library, tells the story of extraordinary cultural disruption, change and continuity in Minnesota and the surrounding areas during the 19th century through objects of both Native and non-Native origin (<em>above: Dakota quillwork leather vest [1890-1899], Minnesota Historical Society</em>). Other exhibitions include Boston Sports Temples, developed by Digital Commonwealth (Massachusetts), which celebrates the rich histories of Boston's professional stadiums and arenas; and <em>This Land Is Your Land: Parks and Public Spaces</em>, an exploration of the history, impact, and significance of our national parks and protected areas curated by the South Carolina Digital Library.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"The project unleashes access to a volume and variety of historical and cultural assets through a dynamic, digitized information platform,\" said Jorge Martinez, vice president and chief technology officer at Knight Foundation. \"It offers an invaluable opportunity to reanimate this information and further strengthen the roles of libraries as centers for engagement—bringing communities together, fostering deeper understanding and connecting people with traditional culture - by leveraging the power of new technology.\"</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The DPLA began in October 2010 with a small meeting of representatives from foundations, research institutions, cultural organizations, government, and libraries who came together to discuss best approaches to building a national digital library.&nbsp; In 2011, the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University established, with the support of Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a two-year planning initiative to guide the conceptualization, planning, and development of the DPLA.&nbsp; </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Today's launch is, in large part, the culmination of that effort, marking the transition from a two-year planning initiative towards a fully realized, standalone 501(c)3 non-profit organization that will continue to make the riches of America's libraries, archives, and museums freely available to the world. </span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">A series of festivities to celebrate the launch, scheduled to occur at the Boston Public Library today and tomorrow, were postponed until the fall in the wake of the April 15 Boston Marathon tragedy, which occurred near the storied public library.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\"I see the building of a new library as one of the greatest examples of what humans can do together to extend the light against the darkness,\" said Dan Cohen, reflecting on the recent events in a <a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dplaalpha/2013/04/16/a-message-from-executive-director-dan-cohen/\" rel=\"Letter to the DPLA community\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Letter to the DPLA community\">letter to the DPLA community</a>. \"In due time, we will let that light shine through.\"</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">About the Digital Public Library of America</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) brings together the riches of America's libraries, archives, and museums, and makes them freely available to the world.

        intro: 'We are now halfway through the Wiki Loves Public Art photo contest, which runs throughout May 2013.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    Volunteers in Austria, Finland, Israel, Spain and Sweden have taken over 5,000 pictures of a total of 1,385 public artworks! All of these photos are uploaded under a free licence, so that they can be used, for example, in online projects such as Wikipedia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/e30d04e7-3003-4345-a2b0-af9d38a1f86f\"><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/ff649cb4-a719-40a5-b933-6068cccfb3af\"></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The goal of the Wiki Loves Public Art (WLPA) contest is to get as many pictures of public art as possible available under a free licence on Wikipedia's online database, Wikimedia Commons. The 5,000 photos uploaded so far can then be seen and used by anyone, anywhere. At the same time, the world's sixth largest website, Wikipedia, will see a boost in its art coverage as photos in the contest can be added to illustrate articles in the online encyclopedia. The contest is organized by Wikimedia Sverige, Europeana and volunteers in the Wikimedia chapters and affiliated groups in each of the participating countries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/f8ea4be7-fbdb-416f-8ab1-0e3b7e76db8c\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <i>'Paparazzi statue in Bratislava', photograph by DMY, CC-BY.</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'We are doing this to increase our common collection of photos of artworks and to make them easily accessible to everyone through Wikipedia. This is also a fun way to start contributing for volunteers', says the international WLPA coordinator, John Andersson.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The contest has been challenging to organise because most countries lack a national database of their artworks. In addition, the countries participating in the contest have a diverse set of copyright laws, which means that the public artworks that can be photographed and uploaded online for the contest differ between countries. For example, in Finland the contest focuses on outdoor sculptures made by artists who have been dead for 70 years or more. In Spain and Austria, on the other hand ,any public artwork can be photographed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'This has also made a difference in the amount of artworks photographed in different local contests. From Barcelona we have over 4,000 pictures, whereas from countries with stricter copyright laws we understandably have fewer contributions', states John Andersson.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To make it easier for people to find the artworks suited for the contest, volunteers in national Wikimedia chapters have put together lists on Wikipedia with information about the outdoor artworks. In some countries, the focus has however been on working with the national art museums so that people can go and take photos of the museums' collections that are suitable for the contest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The photos uploaded for the contest will first be judged nationally, and the ten best pictures from each country will be sent to the international jury. The prizes for the three internationally best pictures – which will be announced in July – are travel gift certificates for 500 euros, 300 euros and 200 euros and on top of that Europeana has sponsored high quality prints of the winning pictures that will be sent to the winners.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For more information, go to <a href=\"http://www.wikilovespublicart.com\">wikilovespublicart.com</a> or contact John Andersson, Wikimedia Sverige, by phone: +46 (0)733965189 or email <a href=\"mailto:john.andersson@wikimedia.se\">John Andersson</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:john.andersson@wikimedia.se\"> </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Europeana</b> brings together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections.

        intro: 'Photographer and artist Cheyne Gallarde is putting a new spin on some of Europe''s most recognisable faces.'

Inspired by the work of Cindy Sherman, Cheyne Gallarde poses as a wide range of people. His work is normally based on photographs that his fans send him of themselves, however for a limited time only, he is turning his efforts to some more familiar faces.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/1d1532b9-ee40-4e89-8e9c-b101ef8d31bd\" /></span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Cheyne accepted the challenge of reinventing a range of classic portraits from Europeana's public domain collection. With only minimal make-up, lighting and props, he has recreated some of Europe's beloved images, including a self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh from the Rijksmuseum and an etching of Napoleon from the National Library of Poland. The resulting side-by-side images have been such a hit with Europeana followers that he is now asking them to choose his next challenge, starting with a vote between French monarch, Marie Antoinette, and English playwright, William Shakespeare.</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/69405e79-83a6-4638-ba60-e8b7bab2cd26\" /></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Neil Bates from Europeana says: 'Europeana has nearly 5 million public domain objects from Europe's galleries, libraries, archives, museums, and audiovisual collections. These works can be used without restriction and this collaboration is a great example of how practising artists can not only be inspired by masterpieces, but actually use them in their work.'</span></div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">To vote for Cheyne's next challenge, visit <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/05/europeana-twinsies-whos-next-cast-your-vote/\">Europeana's blog</a>.

Using only make-up, wardrobe and lighting tricks, Cheyne transforms himself into a rainbow of people, each with their own personalities and presence.

        posttype: pressrelease

        intro: 'A new project from Europeana, Europe''s digital library, museum and archive, launches this week.'
        body: "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/af9d60d5-3d1f-42e1-b40b-4122a3438026\" style=\"width: 251px; height: 360px;\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again. Europeana 1989 invites people who lived through the fall of the Iron Curtain to come to a series of events where they can share their experiences, stories and memorabilia.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    History isn't just about the objects in a museum or the accounts in a book; it's about real people's untold stories. Before the elections of 4 June 1989, crowds of people visited Niespodzianka Café in Warsaw, Poland, where Jan Lityński's election committee was located. They were sure that they were about to witness a breakthrough in the country's politics. A few months later, more crowds congregated at Plac Bankowy to see the demolition of the Dzierżyński monument – a symbolic act marking the end of communism in Poland. These events and others like them saw ordinary people make extraordinary history. Europeana 1989 tells their stories.<a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\"><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    europeana1989.eu</a> documents the changes that took place in 1989 in Poland and the former Eastern bloc countries. The project aims to create a vivid and complete picture of the revolutionary events in Europe with stories, photos, videos and sound recordings from every country affected. Personal stories, memories and experiences can help others to better understand what it was like and to see events from a different perspective.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Members of the public can contribute their stories at a series of collection days in each of the countries taking part. In the same way that the democratisation process of Eastern and Central Europe began on the Vistula River, so does Europeana 1989. The first collection days will take place in Warsaw, Poland, on 8-9 June. The campaign will run in the Baltic States in August, and then the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    A debate on the transformation of Europe will take place on 8 June during the inaugural collection day in Warsaw. Each country will be represented by a project ambassador who played a significant role in the transformation period of 1989. The panel speakers will include: Sarmīte Ēlerte – Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis – Lithuania, Tunne Kelam – Estonia, Petr Janyška – Czech Republic, Wolfgang Templin – Germany, László Rajk – Hungary. Poland has two representatives - the first non-communist Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and photographer Chris Niedenthal who documented the road to democratization in his pictures. Chris says:<br />\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    ‘We need to protect our memorabilia and share our memories and family stories. Otherwise our experiences of this historic period of time will be lost. I really hope that the people of Poland will get involved and hand their histories on to the next generation through the online project, Europeana 1989. Everyone's stories, however small, are important – each one helps to complete the picture of events that led to transformation in Central and Eastern Europe.'</blockquote>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <br />\r\n    Contribute at Collection Days</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Everyone is welcome to bring their memorabilia of 1989 to the following collection days<br />\r\n    in Poland, organised by Europeana and the National Audiovisual Institute. We're looking for copyright-free photographs, sound and video recordings, posters, letters and other memorabilia. Project staff will be on hand to make digital copies of these items and to record the stories that go with them for future generations. These stories will then be available<br />\r\n    for others to read and explore at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">europeana1989.eu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8-9 June at the History Meeting House in Warsaw, Karowa 20 street<br />\r\n    (8 June 14:00 - 20:00, 9 June 10:00 - 20:00)<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14-15 June at Kórnik Library at the Działyńskich Palace in Poznan, Old Market 78/79 (10:00 - 20:00)<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;21-22 June at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdansk, Wały Piastowskie 24<br />\r\n    street (10:00 - 20:00)</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <br />\r\n    Contribute online</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Those who can't make it to a collection day can contribute online.

W 2014 roku świat będzie obchodził 25. rocznicę niezwykłego wydarzenia, jakim było zburzenie muru berlińskiego i ponowne zjednoczenie mieszkańców Europy. Europeana 1989 zaprasza wszystkich, którzy byli świadkami upadku żelaznej kurtyny, do wzięcia udziału w zbiórkach, podczas których będzie można zdigitalizować swoje pamiątki, a także historie i doświadczenia z tamtego okresu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Historia to nie tylko eksponaty w muzeum czy dzieje zapisane w książkach, to także niesamowite przeżycia zwykłych ludzi. Przed historycznymi wyborami 4 czerwca 1989 roku, prawdziwe tłumy odwiedzały warszawską kawiarnię Niespodzianka, w której mieścił się komitet wyborczy Jana Lityńskiego. Byli przekonani, że uczestniczą w przełomowych dla kraju wydarzeniach. Kilka miesięcy później ci sami ludzie gromadzili się na Placu Bankowym, aby oglądać demontaż pomnika Dzierżyńskiego, postrzegany jako symboliczny koniec ery komunizmu w Polsce. Uczestnicy tamtych zdarzeń tworzyli historię. Dzięki temu mają teraz tak wiele niezwykłych opowieści, którymi mogą się dzielić. Rozpoczynający się właśnie projekt Europeana 1989 pomoże ocalić te wszystkie wyjątkowe historie od zapomnienia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1989 dokumentuje przemiany, które miały miejsce w Polsce i krajach byłego bloku wschodniego. Projekt ma na celu stworzenie żywego i pełnego obrazu rewolucyjnych wydarzeń mających miejsce w 1989 roku w Europie. Poprzez gromadzenie opowiadań, zdjęć, filmów oraz nagrań dźwiękowych z każdego kraju zaangażowanego w przemiany 1989 roku stworzone zostanie archiwum cyfrowych pamiątek z tamtego czasu. Osobiste historie, wspomnienia i doświadczenia mogą pomóc innym lepiej zrozumieć proces zmian oraz pozwolą pokazać tamte wydarzenia z innej perspektywy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    W ramach projektu zorganizowane zostaną otwarte zbiórki pamiątek, podczas których każdy będzie mógł podzielić się swoimi historiami i wspomnieniami. Podobnie jak cały proces demokratyzacji Europy Środkowo-Wschodniej, także projekt Europeana 1989 zostanie zainicjowany w Polsce. Pierwsza zbiórka pamiątek odbędzie się w dniach 8 – 9 czerwca<br />\r\n    w Warszawie. Następnie, od sierpnia, kampania będzie realizowana także w krajach nadbałtyckich, a potem w Czechach, Niemczech oraz na Węgrzech.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dodatkowo, podczas inauguracyjnego dnia zbiórki w Warszawie w dniu 8 czerwca odbędzie się debata na temat transformacji w Europie. Każdy kraj będzie reprezentowany przez ambasadora projektu, który odegrał znaczącą rolę w okresie przemian w 1989 roku.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    W debacie udział wezmą: Sarmīte Ēlerte z Łotwy, Vytautas Landsbergis z Litwy, Tunne Kelam z Estonii, Petr Janyška z Czech, Wolfgang Templin z Niemiec oraz László Rajk z Węgier. Polska ma aż dwóch przedstawicieli – pierwszego niekomunistycznego Premiera RP Tadeusza Mazowieckiego oraz fotografa Chrisa Niedenthala, który uwieczniał na swoich zdjęciach drogę do demokratyzacji Polski.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    'Powinniśmy chronić nasze pamiątki oraz dzielić się naszymi wspomnieniami i rodzinnymi opowieściami. W przeciwnym razie nasze doświadczenia związane z tymi historycznymi wydarzeniami zostaną utracone. Mam głęboką nadzieję, że Polacy zaangażują się w projekt Europeana 1989 by móc przekazywać swoje doświadczenia kolejnym pokoleniom. Wszystkie historie, nieważne jak małe, są istotne - każda z nich przyczynia się do ukazania pełniejszego obrazu wydarzeń, które doprowadziły do przemian w Europie Środkowej i Wschodniej' – powiedział Chris Niedenthal.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>\r\n    <br />\r\n    Przyłącz się do zbiórek</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Każdy może przynieść swoje pamiątki z 1989 roku na dni zbiórek organizowane w czerwcu przez Europeanę i Narodowy Instytut Audiowizualny. Digitalizowane będą niechronione prawami autorskimi fotografie, nagrania dźwiękowe i wideo, a także plakaty, listy i inne pamiątki. Organizatorzy projektu pomogą tworzyć cyfrowe kopie tych materiałów<br />\r\n    i rejestrować opowieści, które im towarzyszą, tak by stały się świadectwem tamtych czasów dla przyszłych pokoleń.

Europeana 1989 will continue with collection days in Poland, the Baltic States, the Czech Republic, Germany and Hungary.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For the 25th anniversary in 2014, Europeana 1989 aims to create a vivid and personal picture of the revolutionary events in Europe with stories, photos, videos and sound. Members of the public can contribute their stories at a series of collection days in each of the countries taking part as well as via the project website <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A debate on the importance of preserving the experiences and memories of ordinary people involved in the struggle for freedom took place on 8 June during the inaugural collection day in Warsaw. Each partner country was represented by a project ambassador who played a significant role in the events of 1989 and will now continue to support and promote Europeana 1989. The project ambassadors are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Sarmīte Ēlerte – Latvia</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Vytautas Landsbergis – Lithuania</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Tunne Kelam – Estonia</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Petr Janyška – Czech Republic</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Wolfgang Templin – Germany</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        László Rajk – Hungary</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Tadeusz Mazowiecki – Poland</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Chris Niedenthal - Poland</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    At the conclusion of the debate, the project ambassadors shared their own private memorabilia and stories to launch the collection day, followed by people from Warsaw and other parts of Poland, who brought personal memorabilia ranging from photos to underground pamphlets, and from a teddy bear up to the biggest object digitised so far: a Polonez car, produced in Poland during the 80s.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    ‘History isn't just about the objects in a museum or the accounts in a book; it's about real people's untold stories. Ordinary people make extraordinary history and we must be proud of that and share our stories with whole world,'</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    said Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    ‘Started by \"Solidarity\", freedom movements made up of people from many countries of Central and Eastern Europe in 1989 and 1990 paved the way for the unification of Europe. Europeana 1989 will now bring personal experiences of the people involved in those events together and help to transfer knowledge to younger generations,&nbsp; uniting Europeans even further,'</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    said Tadeusz Mazowiecki during the debate.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    ‘I was really surprised by how many people in Poland had brought their memorabilia to share with the world and I hope that our people will also bring unseen photos and their stories, because everyone's stories, however small, are important. Each story and memory helps to complete the picture of events that led to the transformation in Central and Eastern Europe. Personal stories, memories and experiences can help others to better understand what it was like and to see events from a different perspective,'</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    said Petr Janyška from the Czech Republic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    All campaigns in the partner countries will highlight important events from 1989. In Poland for instance the collection days coincide with the anniversary of the first free election; in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, events tie in with the Baltic Way, the biggest peaceful demonstration in history; and in Hungary, events will relate to the actual cutting of the Iron Curtain on the border with Austria.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Notes to editors</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    People from all over the world can contribute their memories online. It's simple. Just register on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a> and upload your items along with the stories that go with them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Collection Days </b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Everyone is welcome to bring their memorabilia of 1989 to collection days, organised by Europeana and the project partners. Items you might bring include photographs, sound and video recordings, leaflets, letters and other memorabilia. Project staff will be on hand to make digital copies of these items and to record the stories that go with them for future generations. Original items will remain with the contributors. After the first collection days in Warsaw, the next events will be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n        14-15 June, 10:00-20:00, Kórnik Library, Działyńskich Palace, Poznan, Stary Rynek 78/79</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        21-22 June, 10:00-20:00, European Solidarity Centre, Gdansk, Wały Piastowskie 24</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        August 2013 in Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>For more information contact: </b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frank Drauschke – Facts &amp; Files<br />\r\n    +49 (0)163 4809862<br />\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:drauschke@factsandfiles.com\">drauschke@factsandfiles.com</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jon Purday – Europeana<br />\r\n    +44 (0) 7885 516234<br />\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.purday@bl.uk\">jonathan.purday@bl.uk</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>About Europeana 1989 </b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again. The Europeana 1989 project asks people from every country involved to digitise their own stories, photos, videos and sound recordings of 1989. The result will be a fascinating archive for present and future generations that can be explored for learning, personal interest and research work. Europeana 1989 is collaboration between eleven partner institutions, Historypin and the Europeana Foundation.<a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>About Europeana</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana 1989 project is part of something much bigger – Europeana (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a>), Europe's digital library, museum and archive.

        intro: 'Making culture available for all online !'
        body: "<p>\r\n    The 'Funding digitisation: can accessible cultural heritage fuel social and economic growth?' conference was opened by Jimmy Deenihan TD, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and attended by the European Commission and key cultural organisations across Europe, including Trinity College Dublin Library.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Minister Deenihan said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    Ireland is a key partner for Europeana. Irish cultural heritage institutions contribute almost one million artworks and documents that can be discovered, shared and reused across Europe. Our young developers have demonstrated their innovation and commercial potential in hackathons using Europeana data, and the Irish public turned out in force to contribute to Europeana 1914-1918 collection days both in Dublin and in Limerick.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    The conference conclusions urged EU member states to use the current round of EU budget decisions to support future investment in culture online. They were asked to raise their voices in support of Europeana at European level for continued funding of Europeana and its network.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    To support this endeavour, a petition calling upon culturally minded people across Europe to voice their support for future funding of Europeana in current budget decisions was launched at the event. The petition can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/keep-europes-culture-open-to-everyone-online\">www.ipetitions.com/petition/keep-europes-culture-open-to-everyone-online</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana is Europe's digital library archive and museum. Through it, anyone can access 27 million digitised cultural objects including books, paintings, films and audio from more than 2,200 cultural institutions and from all EU member states.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    And Europe now leads the world in accessible digital culture as a result of Europeana's work in bringing together and standardising cultural data and making that data available for re-use. This has important economic as well as social value as the open data can help fuel Europe's digital economy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    Europeana makes our culture available online for all to access and use, connecting people through their shared history and heritage. And importantly, it makes a valuable contribution to our economy through the creative industries, one of Europe's fastest growing sectors. These industries need fuel and Europeana provides it with rich, interoperable digital material, complete with copyright information which is vital for companies who want to re-use it.</blockquote>\r\n<h3>\r\n    Media queries</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Press and Information Office<br />\r\n    Tel: 087-2908193 / (01) 631 3807 / 3838 / 3848(direct)<br />\r\n    Email: <a href=\"mailto:press.office@ahg.gov.ie\">press.office@ahg.gov.ie</a><br />\r\n    Website: <a href=\"http://www.ahg.gov.ie/\">www.ahg.gov.ie</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, supporting the Gathering Ireland 2013.

        body: "<p>\r\n    Among these items were: a collection of underground press documents, black and white music festival photographs and an album of illegal postage stamps. The most surprising item was a white Polonez car produced in the ‘80s.

It aims to create a digital archive of souvenirs and memories connected to the fall of the Iron Curtain. Europeana 1989 encourages European citizens to share their experiences, stories and memorabilia in time for 2014 when the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year: 1989. </span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The project was launched in Poland in June. Europeana, together with the National Audiovisual Institute, organised three events in Warsaw, Poznan and Gda</span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">ń</span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">sk. During these events, volunteers took photographs or made other digital versions of everyday objects, pictures, movies and audio recordings. Once digitised, items were returned to their owners and their electronic versions were made available in the online archive: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\" rel=\"www.europeana1989.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1989\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>. Poles brought hundreds of souvenirs and unique personal stories which show that while the ‘80s are associated with politics and Solidarity, they also provided a remarkable backdrop to the joys and sorrows of everyday life.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The diversity of memories</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Among the items brought in were underground press (independent newspapers), election leaflets, food stamps, old bank notes, documents and family photos, clothes and toys.

The popular event attracted many subcultures, which you can see in this photo collection. Another person brought whole albums of illegal postage stamps depicting well-known opposition activists of the ‘80s. Their owner made and copied them with his friends in secrecy in a private apartment.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Many stories present how&nbsp; bizarre life behind the Iron Curtain could </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">sometimes </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">be. Take the story of a Gdańsk citizen who bought a car in exchange for copper. He said that in 1989 there was a general lack of goods, so he sold about two tons of copper wires, at the time worth half a million PLN. What is more, the bank gave him this amount of money in cash. Afterwards, he bought a Fiat 126p and went on holiday with his family. This, and many other everyday life stories describing the ‘80s are on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\" rel=\"www.europeana1989.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1989\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">‘The motto of the project is ‘Europeana 1989 - We made history'. Our goal is to document that history – showing it from the perspective of ordinary people living at the time, recording their stories and struggles, so that people's real experiences are kept for our children and for future generations', said Frank Drauschke, Europeana 1989 project coordinator. ‘Ordinary people make extraordinary history and that's what we want to highlight.'</span></blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">'We are happy that Poles brought such a variety of souvenirs.

We believe that by preserving this great material we are preserving the memory of this important period of history', said Michał Merczyński, Director of the National Audiovisual Institute.</span></blockquote>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The digital online archive now contains nearly 8,000 items and the number </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">is constantly growing.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The next stages of the project</span></strong><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Poland was the first country to run Europeana 1989 collection days. On 8 June, the country also hosted a debate on the transformation of Europe during the inaugural collection day </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">in Warsaw. Each participating country was represented by an ambassador who played </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">a significant role in the transformation period of 1989: Sarmīte Ēlerte from Latvia, Tunne Kelam from Estonia, Petr Janyška from Czech Republic, Wolfgang Templin from Germany and László Rajk from Hungary. Poland was represented by its first non-communist Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and photographer Chris Niedenthal, who documented </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">the process of democratisation in Poland.</span></div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">‘Collection days in Poland are only the beginning of the creation of the common European online archive.

        title: 'What reminds you of the Baltic Way?'
        posttype: pressrelease

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    Or maybe you have a photo where you stand hand-in-hand in the human chain or one with your car in the traffic jam heading for the Baltic Way. All these souvenirs are important documents of an extraordinary historic event which we all made happen. We made history.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    A new project from Europeana, Europe's digital library, museum and archive, is organising collection days in the three Baltic States. Lithuanians are asked to bring their stories, photos and memorabilia from the Baltic Way to be digitised at the collection days at the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) in Vilnius on 9-10 August and in Panevezys G.Petkevicaite-Bite library on 13 August. These events are being organised by the Lithuanian National Library.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The Baltic Way was the biggest peaceful demonstrations in history. Some 2 million people joined hands to form a 600 km human chain that linked the three Baltic States in their quest for freedom and independence. The Baltic Way and the remarkable collective action of ordinary people were recognised by the world by their inclusion into the UNESCO World Heritage list.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Europeana 1989 not only aims to digitise memorabilia and preserve these important memories for years to come, but also to reconstruct the Baltic Way on a virtual map. Those who participated in the Baltic Way are encouraged to pin a picture at the exact location on the Baltic Way map at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Jon Purday, Europeana Head of Communications, said: 'The Baltic Way protesters experienced dramatic changes and were part of historic events in Eastern Europe. You must be proud to have participated in the biggest peaceful demonstration in the world and we want to help you to collect and share your memories.'<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    'The Baltic Way is one of the most beautiful events on the Lithuanian path to freedom and an extraordinary manifestation of human brotherhood. These feelings are always needed, and nowadays even more,' said Vytautas Landsbergis, the Europeana project ambassador in Lithuania. 'I hope that through the Europeana 1989 project, the Lithuanian people will be happy to share their memories with future generations of the world. After all, people who took part in the Baltic Way remember it very well and have saved a lot of memorabilia. Let them be cherished and shown to the children and grandchildren. Let the stories be told. Even if only a small fraction of these memories will remain and will be passed on to others, they are very significant.'<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again. Europeana 1989 will document the changes that took place in 1989 in Lithuania, the Baltics and the former Eastern bloc countries. The project was launched in Warsaw, Poland, in June this year and aims to create a vivid picture of the revolutionary events in Europe with stories, photos, videos and sound recordings. Personal stories, memories and experiences can help to see history from different perspectives.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;<br />\r\n    <strong>Notes for editors</strong><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Collection Days<br />\r\n    We will make digital copies of people's memorabilia of 1989. People can bring photographs, sound and video recordings, leaflets, letters and other memorabilia and expert staff will be on hand to digitise them and to record the stories that go with them. Europeana and the project partners will then upload them to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana1989.eu</a> website for future generations. The original items will remain with the contributors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Collection days in the Baltics will be:<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9-10 August, 10:00-18:00, Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas, Gedimino ave 52, Vilnius<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 August, 10:00-18:00, G.Petkevicaite-Bite library, Respublika str. 14, Panevezys,<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;23-24 August, 12:00–20:00 Riga 2014 Information space Esplanade park, Riga<br />\r\n    •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30-31 August, 10:00-18:00, National Library of Estonia, Tonismagi 2, Tallinn<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Anyone unable to go to a collection day can contribute their memories online. It's simple. Just register at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a> and upload your photos and other items along with the stories that go with them.<br />\r\n    &nbsp;<br />\r\n    For more information contact:<br />\r\n    Egita Veblauskaitė – 'Consensus PR'<br />\r\n    +370 699 975 94<br />\r\n    egita@consensuspr.lt<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Frank Drauschke – Facts &amp; Files<br />\r\n    +49 (0)163 4809862<br />\r\n    drauschke@factsandfiles.com<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Jon Purday – Europeana<br />\r\n    +44 (0) 7885 516234<br />\r\n    jonathan.purday@bl.uk<br />\r\n    &nbsp;<br />\r\n    <strong>About Europeana 1989</strong><br />\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again.

The people of Latvia are invited to share their memories, photos and other memorabilia by pinning them to an online map at the place they stood along the Baltic Way in 1989.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bring your Baltic way memorabilia to the Esplanade at ‘Riga 2014' <u>on 23 and 24 August from 12:00 till 20:00</u>. Experts will be on hand to photograph your objects and record your stories. Your contribution will then be added to the online archive at <a href=\"../../../../Users/bdaley/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Local%20Settings/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/Local%20Settings/Temp/www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.

The impressive chain of people from Tallinn, through Riga and all the way to Vilnius significantly affected Western social thinking as well as politicians' attitudes. The Baltic Way reminds us that the fate of the Baltic was decided by the people, not by the agreement of great political powers; it stresses the importance of every single person's involvement, the responsibility and significance of each person. Memories about this time are an important part of our collective European memory.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/a18d56a8-ecb2-48fc-9afb-986bc3d90ec7\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 279px;\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <em>Representatives of the Europeana 1989 project in Latvia hold up a map of the Baltic Way. From left to right: Frank Drauschke (Facts and Files), Jon Purday (Europeana), Sarmīte Ēlerte (Ambassador), Ineta Kivle (Latvian National Library), Ivars Prauliņš (organiser of Baltic Way Cēsis phase) <em>and Artis Ērglis (</em>Museum of The Popular Front of Latvia)<em>.</em></em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Director of the special</strong><strong>collection department of the Latvian National Library, Ineta Kivle, said:</strong> ‘The Baltic Way is a unique proof of the ideals of the Third Awakening - there was a feeling that the unity of a nation was an indispensable force for Baltic independence and self-sufficiency. Elation, national unity and faith in the future are characteristic of the time of the Awakening in general. People felt involved in creating history. The unique symbol of national strength – the Baltic Way – was included in UNESCO's \"Memories of the World\" in 2009. The memories of the people are evidence of that unique moment in history. Europeana 1989 makes it possible to record personal experiences and integrate them into the history of mankind.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'The participants of the Baltic Way experienced many political changes and played a part in dramatic events which changed the whole of Europe. The people of Baltic countries must be proud of the fact that they had chance to experience and take part in the world's biggest peaceful demonstration. We would like to help you to save your memories and memorabilia about the Baltic Way in an electronic format and share them with the whole world,' <strong>said Head of Communications for Europeana, Jonathan Purday.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Purday stressed that the aim of Europeana 1989 is to create a vivid and full picture of the revolutionary events that took place all around Europe, with stories, photographs, video and audio files from every country involved. The personal stories of the people, their memories and experiences are unique parts of our heritage, which will help the next generations to understand the events of 1989 better.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Baltic Way was one of the biggest peaceful demonstrations in world history. Approximately 2 million people joined hands, creating the 600 km long human chain which united three Baltic countries – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again. Europeana 1989 will document the changes that took place in 1989 in Latvia, the Baltics and the former Eastern bloc countries. The project was launched in Warsaw, Poland, in June this year and aims to create a vivid picture of the revolutionary events in Europe with stories, photos, videos and sound recordings. Personal stories, memories and experiences can help us to see history from different perspectives, and create an archive that can be used for work, learning or pleasure.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana 1989 project is part of something much bigger – Europeana (www.europeana.eu), Europe's digital library, museum and archive. Europeana collects and provides access to digitised material from libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and museums. Europeana believes in making cultural heritage openly accessible in a digital way, to promote the exchange of ideas and information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>More information</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    More information on the Project is available at: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">www.europeana.eu</a> or <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/\">www.europeana1989.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Project in the Baltic States is organised in cooperation of the National Library of Latvia, the National Library of Lithuania and the National Library of Estonia: <a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/\">www.lnb.lv</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lnb.lt/\">www.lnb.lt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nlib.ee/\">www.nlib.ee</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Media contacts</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Sanita Ozolina</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    +371&nbsp;277&nbsp;571 22</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:Sanita.o@actionprgroup.com\">Sanita.o@actionprgroup.com</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frank Drauschke</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    +49 (0) 163 4809862</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:drauschke@factsandfiles.com\">drauschke@factsandfiles.com</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jon Purday</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    +44 (0) 7885 516234</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"mailto:Jonathan.purday@bl.uk\">Jonathan.purday@bl.uk</a></p>"

        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Around 100 people visited the Europeana 1989 Baltic Way'
        body: "<p>\r\n    In addition to many photos and printed materials, a contributor brought in a handmade blue, black and white Estonian tricolour flag mounted on a broomstick, while another person arrived bearing an old Sony portable radio. Both items had been present at the Baltic Way demonstration.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    According to one account, people continued to mark the Baltic Way in a variety of ways after the actual event. For example, a 'green chain' was arranged at Rohuküla harbour as a follow-up, involving participants from the islands of both Saaremaa and Hiiumaa. One man invited his friends to his summer cottage in Kiisa, where he shared beer he'd brewed in his brand new kettle to mark the occasion. One woman brought a pretty light-coloured dress that she'd worn while expecting her first child on the stretch of the Baltic Way demonstration on the big road that circles the city of Türi. Also belonging to this category was a brown coat that had 'taken part' in the Baltic Way. The Tallinn House of Scientists contributed a set of minutes from a meeting that had been held to discuss the events of August 1989, to include the matter of participation in the Baltic Way. Another of their documents reflected brainstorming related to the 1989 legislation on citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frank Drauschke, who is one if the initiators of this action to gather memorabilia, contributed his photos of the era. Drauschke, a young East German, had been hitchhiking in the Baltic States during 1989 and took part in the Baltic Way. A woman who had worked as a tourist guide at the Hotel Viru told the story of how she'd taken a group of Germans to participate in the Baltic Way.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A panel discussion that took place on the first of the collection days revisited the background of how the Baltic Way came about. Estonian MEP and Europeana 1989 National Ambassador Tunne Kelam advocated the idea of gathering people's memories and encouraged the public to participate. Mr Kelam previously contributed to a Europeana 1989 roadshow by having his Citizen's Registration Card uploaded to the Europeana website. Historian Küllo Arjakas spoke of the planning that went into the preparatory phase of the Baltic Way. He had with him a set of original meeting notes from the Estonian city of Pärnu that contained interesting details about a meeting of Popular Front members from all three Baltic countries as they laid the groundwork for the huge coming demonstration in which a huge number of people linked hands. Mr Arjakas contributed his notes for inclusion in the Europeana virtual archive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Filmmaker Peeter Simm, whose documentary film 'The Baltic Way' was shown during the collection days, related stories about the making of the film. Simm happened to see a young man emerging from a forest path with a fishing pole on his shoulder, decked out with an attached Estonian flag. Simm had not been prepared to record the spontaneous event, and asked the young man to retrace his steps so that he could be filmed. Then a Russian TV crew appeared, and the lad had to walk out of the woods a third time. Later the Russian crew said that this is typical of Estonians, who always take the most direct route to their objective.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Press photographer Peeter Langovits, who worked for the Estonian news agency ETA, which was a TASS subsidiary at the time, recalled how he had covered the Baltic Way while on assignment. One of his photos had captured a red flag on which the hammer and sickle was equated with a swastika. TASS refused to disseminate this particular picture, but somehow it reached agencies abroad anyway and was eventually offered to TASS for commercial distribution. Recently, on 23 August of this year, Langovits took photos of marathon runners in Vilnius, Lithuania, who were participating in a race dedicated to the memory of the Baltic Way. Lithuanian runners were also bearing the Estonian national flag. TV reporter Andres Raid spoke emotionally of his memories, noting that he's never subsequently seen a sparkle in the eyes of his countrymen quite as intense as back then on the day of the Baltic Way.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    All of the material that was contributed in Tallinn will be made freely accessible at the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/\">www.europeana1989.eu</a> website, which also sports an interactive feature that enables visitors to upload additional relevant material. The result will be an intriguing and multihued digital archive that users can delve into for educational purposes, for research, or simply out of curiosity and interest. The archive will continue to accept materials until 23 August 2014, when the 25th anniversary of the Baltic Way is due to be celebrated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana and The Estonian National Library teamed up during the collection days with the Estonian Museum of History, which shared its existing materials and also gained new material during the Tallinn collection event. The UNITAS Foundation was also present, gathering life stories for its Kogu Me Lugu project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A heartfelt thank you to everyone who took part of and contributed to Europeana 1989!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana and 1989 <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\"><br />\r\n    Europeana</a> is a digital library, museum and archive that has - since 2008 - been carrying out the ambition of Europe's memory institutions to make the rich and diverse heritage of this part of the world available to all who are interested. More than 2,200 memory institutions and organisations contribute to Europeana from 34 countries. Europeana already contains some 29 million digitised cultural objects, thanks to which it's possible to discover, search and explore the cultural and intellectual heritage of Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana gets end-users involved as well, providing them with the opportunity to digitise and share their stories within the context of campaigns. Europeana 1989 is one of these campaigns. Seven countries are involved in the project - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany. The campaign began in June in Poland, extended through the Baltic States during August, and will move on in the future to the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For additional information, please feel free to contact Annika Koppel of the Estonian National Library, who is also a member of the Europeana project in Estonia, tel. 5680 7260, Annika.Koppel@nlib.ee</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jüri Estam – Action Consensus PR, tel. 506 0832, jestam@neti.ee</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frank Drauschke – Facts &amp; Files, tel. +49 (0)163 480 9862, drauschke@factsandfiles.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jon Purday – Europeana, tel. +44 (0) 788 551 6234, jonathan.purday@bl.uk</p>"

        body: "<p>\r\n    La Grande Collecte en France</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Les Archives de France, la Bibliothèque nationale de France, la Mission du Centenaire et Europeana 1914-1918 organisent La Grande Collecte entre le 9 et le 16 novembre 2013.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Pour commémorer le centenaire de la Première Guerre mondiale, une collecte de documents personnels est mise en place dans une cinquantaine de lieux en France dont les deux tiers appartiennent au réseau des services d'archives départementales*. Cette campagne de numérisation fait partie d'un vaste projet européen : <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    La Grande Collecte invite les particuliers détenant des documents de la guerre tels que des journaux intimes, des carnets, des correspondances, des photographies, des tracts, des affiches… afin de les sauver de l'oubli voire de la disparition. Des professionnels accueilleront les particuliers pour identifier les documents, les numériser et recueillir leur témoignage. Ils seront ensuite restitués au contributeur ou, si celui-ci le souhaite, confiés en don ou en dépôt à l'établissement de numérisation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    La Grande Collecte sera l'occasion d'appréhender une autre facette de la Première Guerre mondiale : les comportements collectifs et individuels suscités par le conflit. Cet évènement rapproche aussi les pays d'Europe dans un esprit fédérateur.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Les différents types de documents inspirés, pour certains, de l'imagerie collective visible sur les affiches ou les cartes postales et d'autres plus personnels relevant du domaine de l'intime, sont des témoignages directs de la vie des soldats et des populations civiles.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Neuf pays ont déjà participé à l'opération et fourni chacun des centaines d'images, de documents et d'objets conservés par des particuliers avec des « histoires » et des récits de vie qui leur sont attachés. La numérisation sur place est un moyen pour les particuliers de mieux connaître le contexte historique de leur patrimoine grâce aux précisions apportées par les experts. Une numérisation des documents est également possible pour les personnes ne pouvant pas se déplacer à partir d'un appareil photo numérique (voir le site Europeana 1914-1918). Elles contribueront ainsi à l'élaboration de cette bibliothèque en ligne.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana donne accès gratuitement aux contenus numériques provenant de plus de 2200 institutions culturelles européennes (bibliothèques, musées, collections audiovisuelles et archives). Tous les contenus numérisés seront disponibles sur Europeana 1914-1918.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Outre les Archives de France, la Bibliothèque nationale de France, la Mission du Centenaire, Europeana 1914 - 1918, cette opération bénéficie du soutien actif de Cinétévé, du Centre national du Cinéma et de l'image animée, du European Film Gateway, du Parisien, de France Télévisions (France 3) et de Radio France (France Bleu).</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n    La Grande Collecte</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Carte, adresses et dates des lieux de collecte sur le site de la Mission du Centenaire: <a href=\"http://www.centenaire.org\">www.centenaire.org</a></p>\r\n<h2>\r\n    Contacts presse,</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Claudine Hermabessière, chef du service de presse et des partenariats médias, BnF<br />\r\n    01 53 79 41 18 - 06 82 56 66 17 - claudine.hermabessiere@bnf.fr</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Joséphine Renard, chargée de la communication pour la Grande Collecte Europeana, BnF<br />\r\n    01 53 79 40 11 - josephine.renard@bnf.fr</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Eleanor Kenny, chargée de la communication, Europeana<br />\r\n    +44 (0) 207 412 7133 - eleanor.kenny@bl.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Muriel Gremillet, directrice de la communication et des partenariats, Mission du Centenaire<br />\r\n    01 80 05 29 02 - 07 63 18 45 45 - muriel.gremillet@centenaire.org</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    *Les archives départementales sont sous la tutelle conjointe des Archives de France et des départements dans lesquels elles sont localisées.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Lieux actuels de collecte (bibliothèques et archives) : Amiens, Alençon, Angers, Arras/Dainville, Bar-le-Duc, Bordeaux, Bourges, Bussy-Saint-Georges,&nbsp; Clermont-Ferrand, Colmar, Dammarie-les-Lys, Dijon, Draguignan, Epinal, Foix, La Rochelle, Lille, Limoges, Lyon, Mâcon, Marseille, Mende, Nanterre, Nevers, Nice, Paris, Péronne, Perpignan, Pierrefitte-sur- Seine, Privas, Rouen, Sablé-sur-Sarthe, Saint-Brieuc, Saint-Etienne, Saint-Lô, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Tours, Versailles</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/976387/a3567114-f673-436f-9537-28bb387c3d5b\">Download this press release as a pdf</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/976387/b07dc2a9-29d5-4a2b-aa01-f562a5eeb37e\">Read this press release in English</a></p>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The project, entitled Europeana 1914-1918, has so far visited nine countries and added over 4,000 stories and 56,000 photos of objects, scanned letters and diaries from WW1 to its website (<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\" rel=\"www.europeana1914-1918.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1914-1918\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a>). Now, with the collaboration of the Romanian Academy Library and the 'Octavian Goga' Cluj County Library, it is looking to enrich the digital archive with material from Romania.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The Kingdom of Romania joined the Allied Forces in August 1916, and its participation in the First World War was significant. The number of war victims was very high - around 330,000 soldiers (33% of the total military force) and hundreds of thousands of civilians. The Kingdom of Romania's war effort was huge, due to the fact that the military front was on this country's territory. In addition to this, it is difficult to calculate the number of victims from Transylvania, as Transylvania was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time, and therefore involved in the war from 1914.</span><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">In Romania, people are invited to bring their keepsakes to be digitised at two Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows: </span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bucharest, on 27-28 September, at the Romanian Academy Library (125 Calea Victoriei, Sector 1, Bucharest), between 10:00-17:30</span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Cluj, on 4-5 October, at the 'Octavian Goga' Cluj County Library (104 Calea Dorobantilor, Cluj-Napoca), between 10:00-17:30.</span><br />\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<div>\r\n    <span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Experts will be available to digitise material and record oral stories.

Europeana brings a new approach to cultural history, linking people's own stories to the official histories of the war that we're collecting from the national libraries and archives.

We hope that numerous untold and extraordinary real-life stories from Romania's involvement in the First World War will come to light and will go down in the collective memory of Europe. Everyone who owns such materials or knows an interesting family story from that period is invited to share them with the world.

        title: 'Academy Award for Europeana'
        posttype: pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'The Europeana Foundation, responsible for Europe’s pioneering online museum.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    The 2013 EMA was given to Europeana by the EMA Board after wide consultation with museum experts, specialists and directors from different backgrounds and from all over Europe. It recognises the outstanding organisation that has contributed most to the development of museum practice at the international level over the year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In its statement, the Academy says that: ‘Europeana is projecting itself into the cultural landscape of tomorrow… using new tools, finding new partners and experimenting with innovative models of participation. The very idea of a ‘virtual museum' has been better defined and enriched by the results achieved by Europeana'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Accepting the award on behalf of the Europeana Foundation, its Executive Director, Jill Cousins, said: ‘It's a huge honour to be awarded this prize by such a prestigious group of international museum experts. It is great to see that Europeana is really valued as a catalyst for change among museums. Europe is a world leader in the quality of our cultural treasures and their display in our well known and wonderful museums: we are now showing that, by working together, we can transfer the fundamental ideas of access, innovation and participation effectively onto the internet.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Academy statement speaks of museums facing the challenge of a conceptual and methodological revolution in the information age. The digital dimension of cultural heritage enormously increases audience numbers and how they can be engaged in museum activities. Europeana has received the award for the ways in which it is facilitating that transformation in close collaboration with an extensive association of heritage institutions. Europeana is extending the boundaries of contemporary museum practice on many fronts, including collecting families' own stories as part of Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989, conducting research into Linked Open Data, piloting new Open Culture apps, advocating clear rights labelling and establishing the Europeana data model internationally. Linking museum material to that of other cultural heritage institutions also improves its discoverability. People exploring archaeology, for example, can read the books and accounts of finds, see the photographs of the sites and objects and even explore 3D representations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana is a hub within a strong network of participating heritage institutions, engaging them in dialogue with new cultural players such as Wikipedia. The award statement cites two particular initiatives, Europeana Fashion and Europeana Creative, that are brokering new relationships between the creative industries and the cultural heritage sector. Creative industries - software, arts, publishing, broadcasting - are showing strong growth across European economies, and Europeana provides them with access to the kind of digital data and content that fuels enterprise and innovation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Academy's statement ends: ‘This daring and stimulating vision is the heritage of Europeana – it is something which should be shared, endorsed and actively sustained.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For further information about Europeana contact Jon Purday on 00 44 7885 516234, or email jonathan.purday@bl.uk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    --ENDS--</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Notes for editors</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>The EMA Prize</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The prize was presented to the winner by the Deputy of Culture of the Bologna Provincial Government, Giuliano Barigazzi on Thursday 19 September 2013 in the Sala del Consiglio in Bologna, on the occasion of The Learning Museum Project International Conference. The event was held under the patronage of the Province of Bologna and the Mayor of Bologna.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/94fe37d3-134f-4a7d-a4a6-6b7e8b4ed39a\" /></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <i><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/a75b95f5-0fad-4d9f-878f-2c8bb13dcc6c\">Download large version of this photograph</a></i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The EMA Prize, which is held by the winner for one year and is not necessarily presented every year, consists of a piece of sculpture by the Swiss artist, Etienne Krähenbühl (b.1953) and is given by the EMA Board on the basis of proposals submitted by its Pool of Experts, National Representatives, Institutional Supporters or other groups that are involved in EMA activities during the year.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>The European Museum Academy</b> <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu\">www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu </a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/05989111-f40f-4704-b553-b11a2ebf90be\" /></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The European Museum Academy, registered as a non-profit foundation in The Netherlands, was established in 2009. The EMA Foundation is engaged in developing researches in the field of museum innovation, stimulating new ideas and experiences and offering its services as an incubator for new talents and new programmes in order to improve the quality of museum services and of the museological discourse at the European level.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The European Museum Academy is a society of museum experts of different national and cultural backgrounds united for the advancement of museological knowledge based on a curriculum of proven capacity in carrying out innovative museum projects. The academy identifies in museums a relevant tool to face socio-economic and cultural challenges in contemporary society and stresses the role of the modern museum as a meeting place and as a most promising forum for the development of scientific debate, creativity, social cohesion and cultural dialogue.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>The Europeana Foundation</b> <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana brings together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    With Europeana 1989, Czech and Slovak personal stories from this crucial time in history will become part of European history. All residents of former Czechoslovakia are called to participate and contribute their story and memorabilia to the digital archive.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Do you have photographs from the revolutionary days of 1989 or photographs from family vacations and everyday life, favourite records or toys that date from this time of change? Perhaps you have memories that could show future generations how the society appeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the Iron Curtain collapsed? If so, then take part and become a permanent part of history with the <strong>Europeana 1989</strong> project. Digitised objects and selected items may also become part of the exhibition that is being prepared by the National Museum next year to celebrate the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Velvet Revolution.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The mission of Europeana 1989 is to create a vivid picture of the revolutionary events in Europe with personal stories, photos, videos and sound recordings from across Central and Eastern Europe. The result will be a fascinating archive to be explored for research work, learning and personal interest<strong>.</strong>The Europeana 1989 project is part of the peerless platform called Europeana – the European digital library, museum and archive. We believe that thanks to modern technologies, we can make history and culture available for everyone everywhere, and we are working on creating new ways to get people involved with their cultural history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1989 in the Czech Republic is organised by the National Museum and the Institute of Contemporary History of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.The National Museum together with four other museums across the Czech Republic is organising Collection Days and encouraging the public to share their own stories, memories and historical items at these events or online at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Residents of Pilsen and Hradec Královéhave already had the possibility to get involved in the <strong>Europeana 1989 </strong>project. At the beginning of November, the first Collection Days took place in both towns. The Pilseners brought so much material to the museum that the historians will be sorting for several months to come. For example, amongst the contributors was one of the local organisers of the November protests. He was followed by a member of the Czech National Council, which was transformed into the Chamber of deputies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ‘When I found out about the existence of this project I brought everything I found at my home. The Velvet Revolution is such an important milestone in our history that it is necessary to have it historically well documented for future,' said František Nerad, who offered – besides recording his memories – valuable photographs of Václav Havel, Dagmar Burešová, Daniela Kolářová and images of his family from the time when the public protests against the communist regime peaked.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    During the following Collection Days in Prague, Olomouc and Opava, people can bring a range of items including. samizdat, photographs from vacations abroad, items associated with exile or the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, period press, advertising leaflets, postcards, public transport tickets, concert tickets, banners, identity cards…</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'We welcome also period toys, food packaging or household appliances. Simply items with a story, which relate to the period of time between the years of 1986 and 1992. We are also interested in memories that will be recorded by our historians,' explains Pavel Douša, Director of the Historical Museum of the National Museum.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'I was really surprised by how many people in Poland brought their memorabilia in order to share them with the world and I am glad that Czechs are bringing unpublished photographs and their stories as well because stories of all of us, however petty these might be, are important. Every story and recollection helps to complete the picture of events that led to the transformation in Central Europe. Personal stories, recollections and experiences can help others to better understand how it was and see the events from the other point of view,' saysPetr Janyška, Czech ambassador of the Europeana 1989 project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    As well as bringing various items or recording their own memories at our events, it is possible for individuals to upload their digitised materials to the purpose-made website <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/cz/\">www.europeana1989.eu/cz/</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    'History is not only about exhibits in museums and about information in books. It is also about real people and their stories. That's why contemporary museums act as intermediaries forf these stories for future generations,' adds Pavel Douša.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>How to participate</strong><br />\r\n    Collection Days will take place from 10:00-18:00 in the following cities:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    17 November - Prague, New Building of National Museum</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    23 November - Olomouc, Regional Museum in Olomouc</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    30 November - Opava, Silesian Museum</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Collection Days have already taken place in Pilsen (2 November) and Hradec Králové (9 November).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Or go to the websites <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/cz\">www.europeana1989.eu/cz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.esbirky.cz\">www.esbirky.cz</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Media contacts:</strong><br />\r\n    Tereza Petáková <strong>|</strong>Národní muzeum<strong>|</strong>E: <a href=\"mailto:jana.martinkova@accpr.cz\">tereza_petakova@nm.c<strong>z</strong></a><br />\r\n    T: +420&nbsp;724&nbsp;412&nbsp;255</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jana Martinková <strong>|</strong>AC&amp;C Public Relations <strong>|</strong>E: <a href=\"mailto:jana.martinkova@accpr.cz\">jana.martinkova@accpr.cz</a><br />\r\n    T: +420&nbsp;736&nbsp;751&nbsp;159</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>About Europeana 1989</strong><br />\r\n    In 2014, the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year - 1989 - when walls crumbled and the people of Europe were united again. The Europeana 1989 project asks people from every country involved to digitise their own stories, photos, videos and sound recordings of 1989. The result will be a fascinating archive for present and future generations that can be explored for learning, personal interest and research work. Europeana 1989 is the result of collaboration between eleven partner institutions, Historypin and Europeana. The campaign already took place in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In Hungary, the actions will relate to the real dismantling of the Iron Curtain on the border with Austria.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>About Europeana – digital library, museum and archive</strong><br />\r\n    The Europeana 1989 project is part of the Europeana platform (www.europeana.eu), Europe's digital library, museum and archive.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    <em>University Library, Bratislava, 29-30 November, 2013 9.00 am – 5.00 pm</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <em>State Science Library, Košice, 6-7 December, 2013 9.00 am – 5.00 pm</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <em>Slovak National Library, Martin, 13-14 December, 2013 9.00 am – 5.00 pm</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Do you have a box hidden deep under the bed containing letters, pictures or diaries documenting the life of your family 100 years ago? If so, then bring these items to Family History Roadshows in three Slovak cities to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war and to save these memories from disappearing. This is your chance to preserve your personal stories and also to commemorate those who did return home from the Great War.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The First World War greatly affected those living in what is now Slovakia as the cemeteries and monuments in almost every village remind us. More than 400,000 men had to leave their families as soldiers of the former Austrian-Hungarian Army (15% of the total population). Their families struggled with a lack of food as harvests decreased by 50%. Almost 70,000 men never returned home and more than 61,000 returned heavily crippled.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana, Europe's digital museum, library and archive, has been gathering personal stories from 1914-1918 and now the Slovak National Library (SNK) is bringing the Europeana 1914-18 project to Slovakia, one of 10 countries where people's memories will be recorded and not forgotten.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Family History Roadshows are being held across Europe. These events provide an opportunity for individuals and families to bring photographs, letters, diaries, or other materials from 1914-1918 which will help to document both military and civilian life during the First World War. All items will be photographed and digitised by experts and the personal stories that go with them will be recorded and preserved for future generations. Historians and experts will also be available to discuss the historical value of the objects. Once digitised, all these previously untold stories will be uploaded to <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-18.eu\">www.europeana1914-18.eu</a> and become part of Europe's historical heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Roadshows will be hosted by the University Library in Bratislava (29-30 November), the Academic Library in Košice (6-7 December) and the Slovak National Library in Martin (14-15 December). People who will be not able to participate can contribute online by uploading pictures and their stories directly at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-18.eu\">www.europeana1914-18.eu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    By recording the stories of our grandparents, we can create new ways for teachers, students, historians, genealogists and the general &nbsp;public to learn about history and about life – both the positive and negative sides – during the First World War.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's executive director, said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        'Memorabilia and stories are kept by families. They are hidden archives containing very personal stories of great historical significance. That's why our online archive, which is collecting material from across Europe in a series of roadshows, is so important. Europeana brings a new approach to cultural history, linking people's own stories to the official histories and showing the many-sided views of the same slice of history. We want to encourage people to create their collective memory of a war that affected the everyday lives of virtually all Europeans, no matter which side they were on.'</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    Katarína Krištofová, General Director, Slovak National Library, which is the main partner of the project Europeana 1914-18 in Slovakia, said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        'The Slovak National Library is very proud to be a partner of this unique European project which provides the opportunity to remember the First World War and to discover family stories, digitise them and to make them public for all Europeans and the world on the internet. Thanks to this project, Slovaks can record the personal stories that have been hidden for years in family archives. It is a chance to learn about the war from very different perspectives – both the military side and the daily lives of people who remained at home. We believe that many people across the country will bring their items and stories and that, thanks to them, we will discover more about an important part of our history.'</p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        \_</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Contact</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Miroslava Remenárová<br />\r\n    Tel. &nbsp;+421&nbsp;903&nbsp;789 707</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    miroslava.remenarova@crossline.sk</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    -ENDS-</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>About Europeana 1914-1918:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The project Europeana 1914-1918 is a joint initiative of Europeana, Oxford University and many local partners. Everyone is invited to share their private memorabilia from the First World War on the web. This could be photographs, letters, diaries, short films, audio recordings, objects and their stories that will be digitised professionally and added to the online archive, along with corresponding descriptions. Independently of the roadshows, everyone can contribute their digitised images and information to the website - <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a>. Until 2014, the year of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One, we will collect memorabilia in digital form from many of the countries across Europe. The project aims to save people's family memories of this tragedy that convulsed Europe and make them accessible to the world.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>About Europeana:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana 1914-1918 project is part of the Europeana platform (www.europeana.eu), Europe's digital library, museum and archive. Europeana collects and provides access to digitised material from libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and museums. It has more than 2,300 collaborating institutions and the website is available in 29 European languages. Europeana allows the public to discover and explore the cultural and intellectual heritage of Europe through a simple search engine and virtual exhibitions. Since its launch by the European Commission in November 2008, Europeana has grown to include 29 million documents and heritage works. All the stories and objects collected by Europeana 1914-1918 will be made available through www.europeana.eu</p>"

        body: "<p>\r\n    Today Europeana brings together the online collections of 2,300 galleries, libraries, museums and archives from across Europe, through both its website and an API. This means that anyone anywhere from members of the public to those working in the creative industries can explore Europe's cultural heritage and build their own services, apps or games with it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    And it isn't just about historical documents and old masters - the 30 millionth item to be available via Europeana is a delightful animation that won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2012. <i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026012/submission_2012_CA_43428_.html\">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a></i> is a story of people who devote their lives to books and books that return the favour. Morris Lessmore is a poignant, humorous allegory about the curative powers of story. The film comes to Europeana through Ars Electronica, an Austrian organisation that brings together art, science and technology, Kulturpool, the Austrian national aggregator, and the Digitising Contemporary Art project. Unusually for a contemporary film, the animation is available under a Creative Commons licence which means that it can be used and shared legally.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"/image/image_gallery?img_id=1973768&amp;t=1385393957244\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"City Map Item\" src=\"/image/image_gallery?img_id=1973768&amp;t=1385393957244\" style=\"width: 600px;\" /></a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <i>‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026012/submission_2012_CA_43428_.html\">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a>', Moonbot Studios, William Joyce, Brandon Oldenburg, made available to Europeana through Ars Electronica and Kulturpool, CC BY-NC-ND<br />\r\n    <a href=\"http://archive.aec.at/#43428\">Watch the animation</a></i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Over the past five years, Europeana has become a driving force in the world of digital cultural heritage. The Europeana model was adopted by the Digital Public Library of America, and the organisation has become a global leader in areas such as open access. In 2012, Europeana created a watershed moment in open access when it released its entire dataset, 20 million items at the time, under a CC0 dedication, making all of its metadata freely available for use by all and reinforcing the importance of public domain for creativity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana has also helped shaped how members of the public interact with their heritage online. Through the Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989 projects, thousands of people in 17 countries have been able to share more than 60,000 of their family items and stories online, creating unique pan-European perspectives of these two significant periods in history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director, says,</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    'Reaching our fifth birthday and the 30 million mark in the same month is really something to celebrate. We are at a turning point and hope to start to reap the rewards of the hard work that has gone into Europeana – thousands of organisations across Europe work together on everything from developing new content and technology to making sure that digital collections can be made available in a useful and uniform way. The Europeana Open Culture app shows what is possible with openly accessible, correctly labelled data. We are looking for more such creative uses of our cultural heritage. Our task now is to move from being an online portal to a global platform where anyone can use the data for their own developments and projects.'\r\n    <p>\r\n        \_</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    <i>Press contact: Eleanor Kenny, +44 (0)20 7412 7113/ +44 (0)7827 896875, eleanor.kenny@bl.uk</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    --ENDS--</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>About Europeana </b></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu </a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana brings together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections.

The content is drawn from every European member state and the interface is in 29 European languages, and Europeana receives its main funding from the European Commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana Foundation also runs sites where people can upload and explore family histories of the First World War - <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a> and the fall of the Iron Curtain: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">www.europeana1989.eu</a> together with an information site for professionals in the heritage sector: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/\">pro.europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Follow Europeana on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/europeanaeu\">@europeanaeu</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">#AllezCulture</a>.</p>"

        intro: 'Europeana, Europe''s digital library, museum and archive, has launched the second version of its free app.'
        body: "<p>\r\n    <span style='font-family: \"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";'>‘Europeana Open Culture' introduces the public to hand-picked and beautiful collections from 17 of Europe's top institutions, and allows people to explore, share, download and comment on them. The app is now available for all Apple and Android tablet devices.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/de6bca06-cfbb-499e-b607-395d72f68ef6\"></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Developed by Glimworm, the app provides an easy introduction to the breadth of Europe's treasures through carefully curated themes: Maps and Plans, Treasures of Art, Treasures of Nature, and Images of the Past. The new version includes over 350,000 images.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/d2359396-41aa-490b-b8d5-0d092db048b7\"></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana Open Culture presents stunning visual collections from Europeana with large images – great for those smaller details - and a ‘comment' option that opens up the possibility for dialogue between many people exploring the same images. What's more, customers can download any item and use it for their own purposes – perhaps as a screensaver, for school work or their own creative activities. They can also link the items to other online resources like Wikipedia for more context and richer information.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/3995de26-2a0b-4b8b-b11b-4d05768580b6\"></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director says:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        ‘The response to Europeana Open Culture has been great. The app was downloaded thousands of times and was one of the top free educational apps. We've listened to the feedback from our first customers and added new content, new functionality and of course, made the app available for all Android and all Apple tablets.'</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    The 350,000 images available through the app come from collections as diverse as the Estonian Museum of Geology, the Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, UK.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/01223645-9406-4bf9-8985-770b6391caa2\"></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Once the app has been downloaded, users can start exploring by entering a keyword or selecting one of the themes. Tapping a thumbnail brings the image up in full resolution with the options to add and read comments, download images and connect the image to other relevant pages on the web. Users can also add the image to their favourites to create a personal museum, as well as share them on Twitter, Facebook or Pinterest.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    All images included are either in the public domain or are openly licensed which means they can be used for any purpose, such as a school project, a student thesis, a presentation to a local history society, or on blogs, Wikipedia, or even commercially. What's more, the code behind the app is open source so developers can get hold of it, use it and experiment with it.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 is the most important pan-European collection of original First World War source material. It is the result of three years of work by 20 European countries and will include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>400,000 rare documents digitised by 10 state libraries and two other partners in Europe</li>\r\n    <li>660 hours of unique film material digitised by audiovisual archives</li>\r\n    <li>90,000 personal papers and memorabilia of some 7,000 people involved in the war, held by their families and digitised at special events in 12 countries</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The Minister of Culture, Monika Grütters, said on the occasion of the launch:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Among the numerous projects the Federal Government of Germany is initiating and financially supporting during the current Centenary 2014, Europeana 1914-1918 is a highlight due to its pan-European dimension. It shows the stark difference between the European disruptions of that time and our way of cooperating nowadays. It is vital for the Government to point out, especially to young people, that today’s Europe is a union based on shared values, policies and justice. That’s the best way to avoid the wars, terror and fragmentation that Europe suffered in the 20th century. We don’t just want to show historical events, we want to use them for the present and the future. The Europeana project will help shape our views of that time and it will make a great contribution to the mutual understanding of the European people, despite the conflicts of history.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hermann Parzinger, the President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation to which the Berlin State Library belongs, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The launch of the Europeana 1914-1918 is a visionary start to the commemoration year \"1914.Aufbruch.Weltbruch\" run by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and all its related institutions. The outcomes of the new website will be of long-lasting value. The worldwide access to this tremendous collection of highly relevant documents from the First World War offers a great basis for researchers and the general public to understand the events one hundred years ago.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 is full of original source material – digitised photographs, maps, diaries, newspapers, letters, drawings and other content that can be used by teachers, historians, journalists, students and interest groups to create new resources. Already, the site is providing content for a new exhibition called <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/14-18-collections-de\">The First World War: Places of transition</a> and a new multilingual <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one\">educational site </a>developed by the British Library in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'It's a unique collection of raw materials – rare, fragile and hardly seen before. We're encouraging everyone - history teachers, Wikipedians, apps developers - to use it in new ways. Most of the content is under an open licence, because we want people to re-use it to help broaden everyone's understanding of our European past.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:14px;\"><strong>The launch marks the beginning of an important programme of events to open this Centenary year:</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><b>30/31 January – two family digitisation days at the Berlin State Library, 10.00 – 18.00.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anybody with family papers and memorabilia from the First World War can bring them along to be photographed and put online. The family digitisation days are from 10.00 to 18.00 on Thursday 30 and Friday 31 January at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on the 30-31 January, the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin is running the <b>Unlocking Sources conference</b>. It will be attended by 300 experts from across Europe. At the conference they will reflect on how online resources can add to our understanding of the conflict – including a session on whether video games harm or help our interpretation of the tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbara Schneider-Kempf, the Director General of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Our partner libraries have provided a rich mix of materials, showing different sides of the historic conflict and never before seen together. This raw material will allow historians, curators, teachers, researchers and digital developers to shape new interpretations of the experiences of 1914-1918. Our Unlocking Sources conference is their first introduction to Europeana 1914-1918 and the opportunities it will offer them.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the major War Collection of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, the <b>exhibition Unlocking Sources 1914-1918 – The Making Of </b>shows how a cultural institution digitises their hidden resources and presents them online so everyone has access and can find new ways to use and share them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the exhibition, a specially made short film tells the story of the war writer Walter Flex, author of the acclaimed Wanderer zwischen beiden Welten (The Wanderer between Two Worlds), whose personal documents, including a bullet-holed map, letters, manuscripts and photographs, are preserved in the Staatsbibliothek.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The First World War on Film</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the evening of 30 January, delegates at the conference will have a special showing of selected films from the period, accompanied by the renowned pianist Eunice Martins in the Zeughaus Cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These films, together with a further 660 hours of moving images, have been contributed to Europeana 1914-1918 by 21 European film archives under the direction of the Deutsches Filminstitut [DIF]. Director of the DIF Claudia Dillmann, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The contribution that film makes to our understanding of the period is immense. Barely 20% of the silent film produced at the time has survived and most of the newsreels, documentaries, fiction and propaganda that we have put online have not been seen by the public for a century. We have also digitised anti-war films that reflect on the catastrophe at first hand.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notes for editors:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The projects that have combined to create the Europeana 1914-1918 web resource are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Europeana Collections 1914-1918 </b>has brought together 10 great European libraries and two further partners to digitise over 400,000 documents from their collections – everything from rare trench newspapers to censored letters from troops. The project has been <b>co-ordinated by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>European Film Gateway 1914</b> is a partnership of 26 institutions. A unique body of work, featuring not only all of the phases and locations of War but also all genres from propaganda to anti-war films, has been contributed by 21 film archives. Over 660 hours of film and 5,500 film-related documents have been digitised. The project has been <b>co-ordinated by the Deutsches Filminstitut in Frankfurt.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Europeana's family history roadshows</b> were developed in partnership with Oxford University and have been held in 12 countries so far, attended by thousands of ordinary people who want to have memorabilia digitised and to tell the stories of their family at war. In 2014, roadshows will be held in five more countries. So far, more than 90,000 contributions are accessible online.

        title: 'Guidelines on Intellectual Property Rights'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'What do Chanel’s interlocking Cs, Louboutin’s red sole and David Bowie’s stage costumes have in common?'
        body: "<p>In collaboration with the Europeana Foundation, Europeana Fashion is publishing guidelines on how to manage IP in fashion content. By releasing these guidelines, the Europeana Foundation and Europeana Fashion want to promote awareness around sharing and re-using intellectual property in and outside the fashion domain and provide support in a time of proliferation of cultural content in both on and offline media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe guidelines were originally developed in 2012-2013 by the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A), partner in the Europeana Fashion project, to provide content providers to the Europeana Fashion portal with a pragmatic approach to securing permission from rights holders. Europeana Fashion has recognised the potential usefulness for professionals in galleries, libraries, archives, museums (GLAMs) and creative industries and wishes to share this best practice with others in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nRoxanne Peters, ‎Intellectual Property Manager at the V&amp;A, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Fashion is as important as any other art or design practice and from established design houses like Chanel to emerging designers, it's crucial their work is appropriately protected. Cultural institutions have a responsibility to pursue best practice, give credit where credit is due and educate others in a virtual world.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><br><a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Fashion-IPR-Guidelines.pdf\">The guidelines are now available on Europeana Fashion</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\n<br>\r\nNote for editors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br><b>About Europeana Fashion </b><br><a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">www.europeanafashion.eu</a><br>\r\nThe Europeana Fashion project was launched on 1 March 2012.

        title: 'Finns to use open access digital heritage content'
        posttype: Pressrelease

        intro: 'Europeanainvites the Finns to explore the culture of the new internet age'
        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    Open data and emerging digital tools allow for the creative use, sharing, editing and construction of cultural identities. For digital natives - the generation born to the internet age and the era of Finnish EU membership - an open world, unlimited creative freedom and new digital tools are taken for granted. But what does this major transition mean and require from decision-makers in the field of culture, media and education? And how has it changed Finnish, and in turn European culture?</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    These new forms of culture of the new internet age will be discussed on 25 February during a breakfast seminar 'The European culture in the new internet age: Open knowledge and digital natives'. The event is organised in conjunction with the National Library, Europeana and the Strategic Research Agency Wevolve. Participants in the discussion include thought leaders from the cultural sector, digitally native thinkers and doers, decision-makers and representatives of the media to reflect on the new possibilities and meanings of the culture of the new internet age for citizens, cultural organisations, the media, creative industries and society.\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana says, ‘The creative industries make an important and exciting contribution to Europe's economy and they are a vital part of its future. Supporting this sector means providing what it needs - quality content and inspiration. \_Europeana can help with both, thereby supporting innovation. Anyone, from members of the public to those working in the creative industries, can now explore Europe's cultural heritage through Europeana. They can use it, save it, share it or play with it creatively – or even build their own services, apps or games.'</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    The National Library and Europeana are also cooperating \_with the national Media Literacy Week, to be held in more than 1,400 Finnish schools , youth centres and libraries from 10-14 February. During the week, new stories will be created using open access Europeana content and digital platforms such as Pinterest, utilising the meme tradition of digital natives for creative learning.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        <strong>About Europeana</strong>\n</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a>\n</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        Europeana brings together the digitised content of Europe's galleries, libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections. Currently Europeana gives integrated access to over 30 million books, films, paintings, museum objects and archival documents from some 2,300 content providers. The content is drawn from every European member state and the interface is in 29 European languages, and Europeana receives its main funding from the European Commission.</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        The Europeana Foundation makes its dataset available through an API to people and organisations who wish to do interesting things with its collections in order to bring this remarkable material into their own sites. It also runs www.europeana1914-1918.eu, where people can upload family histories of the First World War and explore them alongside archive film footage and national library collections, and www.europeana1989.eu, which explores people's stories of the fall of the Iron Curtain. There is also an information site for professionals in the heritage sector: pro.europeana.eu</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        Follow Europeana on Twitter @europeanaeu and #AllezCulture.</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        \_</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        <strong>Not for publication</strong>\n</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        Press contact for Wevolve nuppu@wevolve.us \_+358 50 3414 268\_</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        \_</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n        Press contact at Europeana | Eleanor Kenny Eleanor.Kenny@bl.uk</div>\r\n    <div>\r\n        \_</div>\r\n</div>"

        title: 'Discover art in a whole new way with VanGoYourself'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Tired of just looking at paintings? Now it''s time to get inside them!'
        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    Ever wanted to recreate a version of Vermeer's Milkmaid in your own kitchen or get together with your friends on a Saturday night out and recreate the scene in Leonardo Da Vinci's The Last Supper? A brand new website, VanGoYourself.com, designed to get people to rediscover and engage in classic paintings from around the world in a new and exciting way, will be launched on May 15, 2014.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    VanGoYourself encourages you to recreate classic scenes from some of world's most famous paintings in a contemporary setting, which you can then share with your friends on social media. The site will feature works from Masters such as Van Gogh or Rembrandt - with over fifty paintings from more than ten collections in seven European countries all just waiting to be recreated!</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    The participating collections are the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Amsterdam Museum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels, the National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen, the Herbert Gallery in Conventry, the Royal Pavilion and Museum in Brighton, the Compton Verney Museum (UK), the Villa Vauban in Luxembourg, the Saarlandmuseum in Saarbrücken and the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift in Trier, Germany.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    So how does it work?</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    First channel your inner artist then pick a classic painting from the selection on the VanGoYourself website. Get together with your friends to recreate the famous scene, take a snap and upload it to VanGoYourself, which will twin your new master with the original artwork for you to share on social media, thus immortalising your artistic talent for all to see!</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    The site allows you to choose the level of difficulty –do you want a painting that is ‘easy' or ‘challenging' to recreate? You can choose paintings with ‘selfie' potential or ones ‘for lovers'. The site is free and simple to use, and links up to existing widely used social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    Who is behind it?</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    VanGoYourself is a Europeana Innovation created by a group of people who love museums, paintings and having fun. It is the brainchild of Culture24 in the UK and Plurio.net in Luxembourg, both non-profit, independent art entrepreneurs with a sense of humour. They have a track record of successfully working internationally to support arts and heritage venues to reach audiences online and to challenge the views of some people who think museums can be boring.\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    The work is part of Europeana Creative, a European Commission funded project to enable and promote the greater re-use by creative industries of cultural heritage resources aggregated by Europeana (wwww.europeana.eu). Europeana is a digital platform that makes Europe's cultural heritage open and freely accessible in a range of ways and places. Anyone can explore, discover and share more than 30 million items from museums, libraries, galleries and archives across Europe at Europeana.eu from their mobiles, computers or tablets and Europeana's API is available to creative and cultural organisations and industries.\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    VanGoYourself is a responsive webservice built in WordPress by Surface Impression in the UK. The design is by the Europeana Creative partner Spild af Tid in Denmark and the image twinning tool is built by the Europeana Creative partner Austrian Institute of Technology in Vienna.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    What is the background of the Europeana Creative project?\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    26 partners from 14 European countries are all working together in the Europeana Creative project, which is coordinated by the Austrian National Library and co-funded by the European Union through the ICT Policy Support Programme. Europeana Creative enables and promotes greater use of our digital cultural heritage by Europe's creative industries. We develop innovative applications for education, tourism, social networks and design and run a number of open innovation challenge events with developers, entrepreneurs and heritage experts. For more information, visit us at www.europeanacreative.eu and join in the conversation @eCreativeEU .\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    \_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    What is the added value of VanGoYourself for museums and collections?</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    The service offers a genuinely different and surprisingly deep way for visitors to engage with heritage, based on emotion, playfulness and curiosity. As well as existing as a simple online service, the idea can be deployed by tourist offices, museums, cities, tour guides, etc to promote specific destinations, sites and events.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n    It provides the touristic sector with a way for audiences to have an emotion collection to a place through a playful interaction with its own cultural heritage. It has been built so that spin off collections of twinned images can be offered based on the collections from one specific city or museum.

        body: "<p>\r\n    The Deutsches Filminstitut, coordinator of the European film digitisation project about the First World War, EFG1914, and its European partners welcome the appreciation of their work by the United Nations</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    With a ceremonial event, the United Nations (UN) commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War in the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon tonight (6:30 p.m. local time) in New York. The event will be the only commemoration of WW1 that will bring all the Member States of the United Nations together. A clip with film material digitised by the EFG1914 partners will be shown to several hundred international diplomatic representatives as introduction to the event. European film archives participating in the EFG1914 digitisation project provided the trailer to the UN. It shows original footage from and about WW1, which was digitised with support by the European Commission over the last two years. EFG1914 has digitised more than 700 hours of historic film material and made these available online for the first time on the European Film Gateway (http://europeanfilmgateway.eu/1914) and on Europeana (http://europeana.eu).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Organised by the Permanent Missions of France and Germany, the event commemorates the tragedy of the First World War and sends out a joint message of peace and reconciliation through a speech by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ´We very much appreciate that footage from the valuable films digitised by EFG1914 partners can now be seen on the central commemoration event of the United Nations´, says Claudia Dillmann, Director of the Deutsches Filminstitut.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A live webcast of the event will be available 8 July 2014 at 18:30 EDT (0:30 CEST): http://webtv.un.org/</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The European Film Gateway 1914 provides an extensive overview of the contemporary film production during WW1. Almost 3,000 newsreels, documentary, animation and feature films can be viewed online. The Deutsches Filminstitut in Frankfurt am Main coordinated the work of 31 partners in 15 countries. With the engagement of film archives across Europe, a unique corpus of historic film material has been made available to the public that not only covers all phases and most of the places of the First World War, but also all forms and genres from propaganda films to anti-war dramas.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The films can also be found on the theme portal www.europeana1914-1918.eu, which contains also books and text documents digitised by national libraries and private collection items and memorabilia collected by Europeana1914-1918 ongoing activity of collection days all across Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    EFG1914 Project partners and associated partners: Arhiva Nationala de Filme, Bucharest | Association des Cinémathèques Européennes, Brussels/Frankfurt | Athena Research and Innovation Center in Information, Communication and Knowledge Technologies, Athens | Bundesarchiv, Berlin | Centre National du Cinéma et de l´Image Animée-Archives françaises du film, Bois d´Arcy| Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia, Rom | Cinecittà Luce S.p.A, Rome | Cinémathèque royale de Belgique, Brussels | Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna | CNR-ISTI, Pisa | Det Danske Filminstitut, Copenhagen | Deutsche Kinemathek - Museum für Film und Fernsehen, Berlin | Deutsches Filminstitut - DIF, Frankfurt | Estonian Film Archive, Tallinn | EYE Film Institut Netherlands, Amsterdam | Filmarchiv Austria, Vienna| Filmoteca Española, Madrid | Fondazione Cineteca Italiana, Milan| Fraunhofer IIS, Erlangen | Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Wiesbaden | Imperial War Museums, London | IVAC, Valencia | Jugoslovenska Kinoteka, Belgrade | La Cineteca del Friuli, Gemona | Landesfilmsammlung Baden Württemberg, Stuttgart | Magyar Nemzeti Digitalís Archivum És Filmintezét, Budapest | Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin | Národní filmový archiv, Prague | Nasjonalbiblioteket, Oslo | Österreichisches Filmmuseum, Vienna | reelport GmbH, Cologne</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Facts about the EFG1914 project and the European Film Gateway:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    EFG1914 is co-ordinated by the Deutsches Filminstitut with the support of the Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media and the Hessen State Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts.

        title: 'WW1 roadshow in Vienna'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>\r\n    Vienna, 22 July 2014</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This year sees the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One. To mark this event, the crowdsourcing project Europeana 1914-1918 is collecting private memorabilia throughout Europe and making it all available in a public digital archive. More than 10,000 contributions with roughly 130,000 digital objects from 20 countries can already be researched at www.europeana1914-1918.eu. Now the project is coming to Austria for the first time, and everyone is invited to add Austrian history. Europeana is also launching a new, virtual world war exhibition using works owned by the Austrian National Library (ÖNB).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    After more than 130 roadshows in Europe, a crowdsourcing event will now be held in Vienna on 1 August 2014 at the ORF RadioKulturhaus. This offers individuals the chance to take part in Europeana 1914-1918 with photographs, letters, field postcards, diaries, films, sound recordings or everyday objects and their stories. All of the contributions are professionally digitised at the roadshow, and added to the online archive with relevant information. The originals are immediately returned to their owners. This creates a unique, pan-European archive with memorabilia from World War One.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914-1918 Roadshow in Vienna<br>\r\n    When: Friday, 1 August 2014, 10am until 6pm<br>\r\n    Where: ORF RadioKulturhaus, Argentinierstraße 30a, 1040 Vienna</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Ad Pollé, project manager at Europeana, explains the significance of the initiative: ´The success of the project underlines the great interest Europeans have in their common history. People pass on their stories within their families, and with Europeana they now have an opportunity to safeguard them for future generations and make them publicly accessible. Europeana offers a new type of access to cultural history because it links family stories with official remembrances of war events that we can research in national libraries and archives. So for the first time it is now possible to explore and compare many different private testimonies from the war period throughout Europe. The internet also facilitates cross-generation dialogue and debate regarding one’s own and others’ family histories.´</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Austrian national public service broadcaster (ORF) is part of and a partner of Europeana within the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). At the Vienna roadshow on 1 August, the ORF Archive will be supporting the crowdsourcing project as the local partner, helping with organisation and implementation. The digital copies will subsequently also be available to ORF for its programmes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Herbert Hayduck, head of the ORF Archive: ´This year the ORF is focusing closely on evaluating and presenting the historical events surrounding World War One. To this end, the ORF Archive, the country’s electronic memory, is carrying out research and re-processing historical sources of materials in cooperation with the editorial staff at ORF. This is why we are delighted to be supporting the Vienna roadshow - because it provides an opportunity to collect private historical testimonies directly in an innovative manner, and make them public. We are building yet another bridge to the ORF audience.’</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Digital cultural heritage</b><br>\r\n    Europeana 1914-1918 is the most comprehensive European collection of original documents from World War One; institutions and private individuals from 20 European countries have contributed to this virtual collection so far. The impressive number of 400,000 documents from 10 national libraries, 660 hours of film material from 21 European film archives and more than 130,000 personal documents and memorabilia digitised during the numerous roadshows in 14 countries to date are all publicly available. Digital images of photographs, maps, diaries, newspapers, letters, drawings, books, leaflets, trench newspapers and much more can be found online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Irrespective of the roadshow, anyone can register on the www.europeana1914-1918.eu website and contribute to the online archive by themselves with digital pictures and information.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Further information on the project can be found at:<br>\r\n    www.europeana1914-1918.eu.<br>\r\n    Press images can be downloaded at the following link:<br>\r\n    http://pro.europeana.eu/1914-1918-press-images</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>’To my peoples!’ – new virtual exhibition of Europeana and the Austrian National Library </b><br>\r\n    The new virtual exhibition of Europeana and the Austrian National Library (ÖNB) also focuses on World War One. To this end, roughly 80 exhibits of the analogue exhibition entitled ’To my peoples! World War One 1914–1918‘, which can still be seen in the Great Hall of the ÖNB until 2 November 2014, were digitised. They are now available online at http://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/stichting-europeana. For the first time Europeana uses for the virtual exhibition the innovative platform of the Google Cultural Institute.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Curated by renowned historian Prof. Manfried Rauchensteiner, the impressive exhibits recall the millions of deaths on the front line and the hardships of life for those at home. The main events and stages of the war are relived, from the assassination of heir to the throne Franz Ferdinand in 1914 to the people’s manifesto written by Emperor Karl in 1918 and the slow disintegration of the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian empire. Dr. Johanna Rachinger, Director-General of the Austrian National Library: ´It gives me great pleasure that this cooperation with Europeana means our large exhibition on World War One can now also be viewed online: significant articles and items on the Great War are now accessible to anyone interested, anywhere in the world.’</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>ORF focal area: World War One</b><br>\r\n    For the entire year, ORF is dedicating itself to the ’100th anniversary of World War One‘. In the autumn for example, ORF 2 will be broadcasting Madame Nobel a film about the fictitious love story between Bertha von Suttner and Alfred Nobel, and the documentary film The unequal siblings – Germany and Austria. Culture and information channel ORF III is currently showing an extensive series of programmes on World War One, and every Thursday at 8.15 pm they broadcast Austrian films based on works by famous Austrian authors like Joseph Roth, Stefan Zweig or Franz Werfel. Documentary series 14 – Diaries from World War One by director Jan Peter describes World War One from the perspective of 14 people who experienced the conflict. Comprising eight parts, it will be shown by ORF III until mid-August.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>About Europeana</b> Europeana: Europe's digital library, museum and archive. Europeana collects and provides access to digitised material from libraries, archives, audiovisual archives and museums. It has more than 2,300 collaborating institutions and the website is available in 29 European languages. Europeana allows the public to discover and explore the cultural and intellectual heritage of Europe through a simple search engine and virtual exhibitions. Since its launch by the European Commission in November 2008, Europeana has grown to include 30 million documents and heritage works. All the stories and objects collected by Europeana 1914-1918 will also be made available through www.europeana.eu.</p>"

His grandfather, who died before Phil was born, volunteered for the ‘Hull Pals’ 10th Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment after training as a school teacher in York. He served in Egypt, France and Belgium, but was badly injured at the battle of Oppy Wood. He survived in a shell hole with one leg mostly missing until he was found during a cease-fire two days later. He then spent two years recovering at the Duchess of Connaught Canadian Military Hospital at Cliveden, where he collected this series of the Chronicles of Cliveden, a newspaper produced by the patients. He embroidered a cover for this collection as part of his recuperation, and the family has now donated the Chronicles to the Library. It has been digitised as one of the many ‘trench journals’ the library has contributed to Europeana 1914-1918.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    On the Europeana roadshow day itself, historians and experts from the York Museums Trust, Lancaster University and local history societies will be on hand to talk about the significance of finds, while staff from the British Library will professionally digitise the objects which will be uploaded to the dedicated <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918 </a>website.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana has been holding Family History Roadshows in more than 20 countries across Europe in the lead up to the WW1 Centenary, digitising almost 100,000 images of family memorabilia to sit alongside national WW1 collections.

Back home, daily life in Britain was changing beyond recognition while around the world millions would die as Europe's empires clashed in the first truly global conflict.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    New research will be combined with the museum’s extensive military, costume and social history collections to tell the fascinating and often moving stories of the Yorkshire people who lived and died during the war that they said would end all wars.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The exhibition is the central part of a £1.7 million project at the museum, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Open daily: 9.30am-5pm<br>\r\n    Admission: Adult: £ 9.50 Free entry for children under 16 and residents with a valid York Card.<br>\r\n    01904 6887687 <a href=\"http://www.yorkcastlemuseum.org.uk\">www.yorkcastlemuseum.org.uk</a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Heritage Lottery Fund and support for First World War heritage:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Using money raised through the National Lottery, the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) aims to make a lasting difference for heritage, people and communities across the UK and help build a resilient heritage economy.

        title: 'Croatia’s Forgotten WW1 Family Stories'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Croatia's Ministry of Culture and Europeana have today launched a unique European WW1 project to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war, at a press conference at the National State Archive in Zagreb.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Europeana's Executive Director Jill Cousins and Croatian Minister of Culture Andrea Zlatar Violić announced that they are working together to collect and share Croatian family stories from 1914-1918 online.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Each personal story that perhaps hasn't been told outside the family is important for the complete understanding of this period, both on the battlefield and the home front. Due to the political and social environment in the decades following WW1, the stories of many Croatian soldiers have remained untold and unremembered. Now they will have a chance to be heard.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">These valuable stories will be collected and digitised during collection days, which will take place in October and December in five different cities in Croatia. These stories will then be shared via Europeana 1914-1918.eu ,the most important online resource of original WW1 source material featuring contributions from institutions across the globe and families across Europe.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Croatian citizens are urged to bring photographs, letters, diaries, film or audio recordings, together with the stories of whom they belonged to the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb on 3rd and 4th October. Additional events will be organised on October 10th and 11th by State Archive in Osijek and Library ‘Fran Galović' in Koprivnica. Additional collection days will be held on 12th and 13th December at the public reading room of the city library in Rijeka and on 19th and 20th December at the state archive in Dubrovnik and the archive collection centre on the island of Korčula.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">During these collection days, historians will be on hand to talk about the significance of finds, while experts from the state archives will professionally digitise the objects, which will be uploaded to the dedicated Europeana1914-1918 website.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Europeana 1914-1918 presents all sides of the conflict and all perspectives, and gives a deeper understanding of this important period of Croatian history. Through this archive, stories from countries across Europe are shared online, can be accessed by others worldwide and saved for future generations.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The Ministry of Culture is participating in Europeana's project as part of its comprehensive national programme to mark the centenary of the First World War, in cooperation with the Croatian Government Coordination Committee for the WW1 commemoration.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Dr. Sc. Andrea Zlatar Violić, Minister of Culture of The Republic of Croatia, said:\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>‘We are very pleased with this partnership with Europeana as part of our national programme marking the centenary of the First World War. It is a war where consequences and victims are still not entirely known in Croatia. Besides </em><em>honouring</em><em> the victims, this project also gives us an opportunity to broaden scientific research of the first global conflict that caused material damage and a number of victims, on a scale never seen before. We hope that citizens will also </em><em>recognise</em><em> the opportunity to share with us their untold family stories to jointly enhance discussion and understanding of this painful historical event.</em>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>I'm sure many people have items connected with members of their families participating in the WW1. Each photo, postcard or any other story can enrich Croatian research on the period of WW1, both on the battlefield and the home front. Historical materials concerning events hundred years ago in Croatia </em><em>unfortunately</em><em> are still not thoroughly archived and Europeana's project can help in identifying Croatia's </em><em>geo-political</em><em> and historical circumstances. It will be available not only to Croatian experts and enthusiasts but to academics and other professionals across the world'.</em>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Europeana has held over 150 family history roadshows in 15 countries across Europe since 2011, and five more will take place by the end of 2014. Europeana 1914-1918 includes 400,000 rare documents digitised by 10 state libraries, 660 hours of unique film material digitised by audio-visual archives and over 100,000 personal papers and memorabilia of some 10,000 people involved in the war, held by their families and digitised at special events across Europe.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director, said:\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>‘With Europeana 1914-1918, we are piecing together a unique pan-European perspective of the Great War. Alongside the official records, stories, photographs </em><em>and</em><em> memorabilia from institutions such as museums, archives and galleries, we are asking the citizens of Europe to share their family stories and memories.</em>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>‘Europeana is delighted to collaborate with the Ministry of Culture on the WW1 Collection days in Croatia. Through our family history roadshows, the grandchildren, other family members </em><em>and</em><em> friends who inherited these memorabilia have the opportunity to share pieces of history that might otherwise just be collecting dust in their attics. And through </em><em>digitisation</em><em>, they can preserve them for future generations as records of a defining time in European history'.\_</em>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Mirjana Paušak, senior curator- head of the Museum Valpovština, travelled from Osijek to tell her grandfather's story and contribute his related items to Europeana.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">During the war, Antun Širo, Mirjana's grandfather, worked as a skilled master machinist in the military workshop in Vienna, and was drafted in Osijek and sent to the front line of the area that today makes up northern Romania and western Ukraine.; There he served as a machinist \_and in his spare time, Mirjana's grandfather made rings for his family members, which they kept. These wartime rings are not the only special items that the family has to share - Mirjana also brought along iron rings that they were given in exchange for providing gold for the war effort.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Mirjana Paušak, senior curator- head of the Museum Valpovština, said:\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>´After the war, the family returned to Osijek, along with numerous memorabilia from the battlefields and the Viennese daily life. My grandma saved the postcards that Antun has sent her and my family kept numerous photos with Antun's soldier friends, from the military workshops and family life in Vienna. They also participated in the national humanitarian campaign 'I gave gold for iron', and kept the rings that they got in return.\_</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>As my grandfather was very skilled, in his spare time in the workshop in Vienna he made some rings for my grandmother and mother, with their initials engraved on it. \_Grandma has kept those memories with special care for years and I remember the stories that she told us. We can´t let these stories get lost and forgotten in our family heritage; our children and history deserve more. With the WW1 centenary and exhibition in Valpovo, I remembered that I also have WW1 material that I'm more than happy to </em><em>digitise</em><em> and share´.\_</em>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">During the collection days, there will also be a range of WW1 themed activities, including lectures by State Archives representatives, film projections and an exhibition on ‘Zadar in WW1', which will be organised by the Croatian State Archives.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">If people aren't able to get to the collection day events, Europeana 1914-1918 website gives advice on how you can scan, photograph and upload memorabilia and the stories that go with them.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Collection days:<br>\r\nZAGREB, 3 and 4 October\_<br>\r\nCroatian State Archives, 10 a.m. – 4 p.m.<br>\r\nMarulićev trg 21, Zagreb<br>\r\n+385 1 4801 999</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OSIJEK, 10 and 11 October\_<br>\r\nState Archive Osijek, 10 a.m. – 4 p.m.<br>\r\nMuseum of Slavonia - Osijek, Trg Sv.

It was launched in Germany in 2011 to collect memorabilia and family stories from the front line and the home front. Since then, family history roadshows have been held in 15 countries across Europe, in the lead up to the WW1 commemoration and so far have recorded nearly 100,000 digital images. Throughout 2014, the year of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, the project continues to collect memorabilia in digital form and aims to save people's family memories and make them accessible to the world. This could be photographs, letters, diaries, short films, audio recordings, objects and their stories that will be digitised professionally and added to the online archive, along with corresponding descriptions. Independent of the roadshows that take place across Europe, everyone can contribute their digitised images and information to the website -www.europeana1914-1918.eu. The site now also includes 400,000 items digitised by national libraries across Europe and 660 hours of film digitised by EFG14.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    On 16-17th October, Venice will be the venue for culture and knowledge exchange, with focus on digital technologies applied to cultural heritage: the Auditorium Santa Margherita will host an exciting conference entitled: Digital Cultural Content Re-imagined: New Avenues for the Economy and Society. This conference will include important representatives of European cultural institutions together with experts and researchers in the digital cultural heritage domain. The speeches will focus on the possibilities of creative re-use for the available cultural data in new applications, and the implicit business potential that lies in this.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The conference is the opening event of EU-funded project Europeana Space, and it is organised by Ca’ Foscari University of Venice – Department of Management, together with Promoter S.r.l., an agency with a strong reputation and expertise in the ICT and cultural heritage. The online magazine www.digitalmeetsculture.net is the official media partner of the conference.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The event starts of 16th October at 2.00 pm with the welcome message of Michele Bugliesi, the Rector of Ca’ Foscari University; followed by speeches of Sarah Whatley, project’s coordinator and professor of Dance at Coventry University, Piero Attanasio of AIE the Italian association of Editors, Harry Verwayen of Europeana Foundation, Antonella Fresa of Promoter S.r.l. and other interesting international speakers. The conference explores the potential of digital cultural heritage, to be used in the development of new creative products and services that will boost the creative industry, generating innovation and economic growth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    During the conference, new applications under experimentation will be presented on different themes (Dance, Photography, Interactive TV, Games, Museums, Open and Hybrid Publishing), and it will be possible to meet the most brilliant actors that operate in these fields in Europe. On the following day 17 October, the conference will take place in the morning (9.30 -12.30), while in the afternoon the group of registered participants will get the chance to visit the Venice incubator H-Farm (visits sold-out). It is still possible to attend the conference upon registration free of charge: http://veniceconference2014.europeana-space.eu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana Space (www.europeana-space.eu ), led by Coventry University and including 29 partners from all over Europe, is an EU-funded project that aims to unlock the business potential of digital cultural heritage through the creative re-use of available cultural data. It encompasses 6 themed pilots where experimentation and new business models are developed. The Europeana Space project is developed in cooperation with Europeana, the European portal for Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Department of Management of Ca’ Foscari University carried out a detailed market analysis of the business potential in the 6 key markets addressed by the project. Coordinator of this activity at Ca’ Foscari is Leonardo Buzzavo, professor of Strategy, who declared: ‘You can certainly derive economic growth from culture: by identifying effective business models. This is an un-missable challenge for Italy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Promoter S.r.l. (www.promoter.it ) is Technical Coordinator of Europeana Space, and the responsible partner for communication and dissemination, thus supporting Ca’ Foscari University in the organization of the conference. Antonella Fresa, the director, says: ‘This is a golden opportunity for the creative industries, for the cultural institutions, for students and researchers, for anybody interested in the new scenario of digital cultural heritage. This is the occasion to learn what is happening in this sector: join us, follow us on our blog, website and social networks!</p>"

        title: 'How to make Europe’s cultural heritage more open'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    The collection includes landmarks in the history of modern thought such as texts by Martin Luther as well as insights into more everyday life, from historic cookbooks to children’s spelling books. Another highlight is the library of Prince Eugene of Savoy, one of the most successful military commanders in Europe’s modern history and one of the most ambitious book collectors of his time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Austrian National Library is the first library in Europe to share a collection that has been digitised as part of the Google Books project under the new rights statement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    It is the first step toward creating a truly pan-European collection of books digitised in partnership with leading libraries and Google, available to the public via Europeana.eu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Through Austrian Books Online, the Austrian National Library's public-private partnership with Google, the library is currently digitising and making available its complete holdings of historical books from the 16th to the second half of the -19th century. About 600,000 volumes will be available to the public via Europeana in high quality format. The first 150,000 are now online.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Thanks to the introduction of the new rights label 'Out of copyright - non-commercial re-use' (OOC-NC), the Austrian National Library and Google can now share this unique collection also via Europeana. The rights statement means that books that are out of copyright and digitised through public-private partnerships are clearly marked as being freely available to the public for non-commercial re-use for a limited time and available for unrestricted re-use after that period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The label supports Europeana's Public Domain Charter and underlines the importance of openness and re-use, while recognising the role of public-private partnerships in supporting digitisation. As a result of the new statement, in the future millions of books that otherwise would not have been available via Europeana can be read by readers worldwide: Other libraries across Europe that have digitised collections through Google Books or other private public partnerships will also be able to make collections available via Europeana using the OOC-NC rights label.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The new rights statement was developed through the Europeana Network, with input from Google, the Austrian National Library and other European libraries involved in the Google books project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana said: ´We are so pleased to be able to announce this result. It provides a fair balance between the need to pay for the digitisation of our cultural heritage, supported so strongly by Google, and the desire to make sure that the public can use the material widely in connection with other parts of our diverse and rich European history.´</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Johanna Rachinger, Director General of the Austrian National Library, said: 'With our major digitisation project Austrian Books Online we would like to contribute to the democratisation of knowledge. I am delighted that these books can now be found also in Europeana.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Ben Bunnell, Google Library Partnerships said: ´We set up the Google Books Library project to help make the printed record of human history more available to the world. Including links on Europeana helps more people find and use these materials, complementing the access provided on libraries' websites and on books.google.com.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ENDS</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Notes for Editors:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana collaborates with thematic platforms featuring specific focus on: films (EFG <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu\">europeanfilmgateway.eu</a>); archival material (Archives Poral Europe <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/\">archivesportaleurope.net/</a>); and books (The European Library <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org\">theeuropeanlibrary.org</a>). Austrian Books Online was made available through the enhancement of The European Library.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Austrian National Library collection available on Europeana includes such treasures as:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    A volume from Prince Eugene of Savoy's collection:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Naturalis historiae libri XXXVII.

        title: 'Winner Europeana''s digitisation competition'

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    Namuth's photo is now being exhibited together with those of other finalists at Västerbotten's museum in the city of Umeå, the European Capital of Culture 2014. It will later will be uploaded to www.europeana.eu, and contribute to Europe's digitised cultural heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana is the Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides access to digitised material from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    At Europeana, anyone can discover, download, share, learn from and be inspired by Europe's cultural richness, free of charge: books, manuscripts, sculptures, museum objects, crafts, music and other recordings. Europeana has items from museums and cultural institutions, big and small, from all over Europe. The items can be explored from your mobile and tablets as well as your laptop.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Content on Europeana is not only from museums, libraries, galleries and other cultural institutions; it also includes contributions from the public. The summer campaign gave Swedes the chance to contribute to Europeana. In collaboration with the National Heritage Board and Wikimedia Sweden, Europeana toured the country and held a photo competition in the cities of Umeå, Kalmar, Lund, Gothenburg and Stockholm.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The mission was to track down an old image on www.europeana.eu and then take a new photo of the same. A renowned jury consisting of, among others, award-winning photographers Karl Melander and Joachim Lundgren, chose a winner and a runner-up in each city that qualified for the national competition.\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">Kerstin Namuth and her son Holme Finnilä placed first with their photo of the 1400-century fortress Gamla Älvsborg in Gothenburg.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ‘It feels great and completely unexpected. I fell for the old picture because it's not a touristy place. It is a hidden spot we really had to look up. When we got to the place, I was surprised that it still looks very much the same as the old picture. Even the little shed remains. How it has survived when everything around has been renovated, I do not know. The contest was a fun way to get to know the city', says Kerstin Namuth.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ‘The photo competition is a great way to get people to find Europenana, to open their eyes, get involved in their local environment and at the same time become co-creators of the exhibition,' says Helena Magnusson, head of exhibitions, programmes and pedagogy at Västerbotten's Museum.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director says: ‘New ways of seeing and interpreting our past, showing us that we are products of our cultures and creating an understanding of the cultures of others is a purpose of Europeana. Kerstin Namuth's photo from the historic area of Gamla Älvsborg in Gothenburg, juxtaposed with the original image that was taken in the exact same spot, shows the change but also the continuity of our cultural heritage'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>The jury's motivation:\_</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ´Kerstin Namuth's photo has a high documentary value and its composition is very similar to the older image. These two photos complement each other in an educational and exciting way. The new one shows how the old industrial environment has changed, while the old image explains the traces of previous constructions that we can see on the mountain today, and gives an impression of how the area looked in the past. ´</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>About the photo competition and exhibition #Thenandnow</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Alongside the photo competition, an open photography workshop was held in each of the five cities. The final winner was selected based on the best connection to the original photo, in terms of composition, content and technical quality. The photos are now exhibited at Västerbotten's Museum in Umeå, the cultural capital of Europe 2014, until 8 February.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>For more information, please contact:\_</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Kerstin Namuth, the winner: +46 (0)31-106503, kerstin.namuth@folkuniversitetet.se, Twitter: @kerstinnamuth</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Lena Calderon, The National Heritage Board: +46 (0)708 83 80 27, lena.calderon@raa.se</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Amit Youlzari, Europeana: +44 207 412 7114, amit.youlzari@europeana.eu</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jan Ainali, Wikimedia: +46 (0)72 9672948, jan.ainali@wikimedia.se</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Photos:</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    First place</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:G%C3%B6teborg2014_Gamla_%C3%84lvsborg.jpg%20\">New photo</a>.

        title: 'Opening the door to European cultural heritage'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Spanish citizens are invited to explore, learn and create with Europeana'
        body: "<p>\r\n    The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of the Government of Spain has joined forces with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>, Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage. We are working together to highlight Europeana as the digital door to European cultural heritage, by exposing Spanish citizens to the opportunities that exist here. The platform collects and provides access to digitised material from over 2000 cultural institutions, which have contributed more than 30 million items to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aware of the enormous value of Europeana as an online educational resource, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports is launching a school competition at a nationwide level that encourages secondary students to discover, share and create with Europe's cultural heritage through Europeana. They want to encourage teachers to use it as a catalyst for educational creativity in the 21st century.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Teams of up to five students across Spain, each guided by a teacher, will explore and discover the wealth of cultural treasure to be found in Europeana by using its materials, such as books, films, paintings, photographs, newspapers, sound files, maps, manuscripts and other items, in papers they will submit for this competition.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Each participating team of students will travel virtually in time and gather information through Europeana website on any of the following topics: The First World War, The Generation of 1898, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, The Autogiro, Antoni Gaudí and Design in the Belle Époque.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The obtained information through Europeana will be used to create a digital journalistic chronicle, set between 1880 and 1934. It will focus on real facts and events or fictional ones that relate to real facts and events.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The competition was launched today, 15 October, and will remain open for an entire month, till 15 November. Then the jury will select up to three outstanding works from each region. Later, the best three finalist papers will be chosen at a nationwide level and eventually will be awarded at a press conference at The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports. The winning entries will be digitally published.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Each member of the winning team, including their teacher, will receive a tablet computer. The team that comes second will receive a mini tablet, and the team in third place wins an eBook.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director, said: ´We're delighted to collaborate with The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of the Government of Spain, and excited that students and teachers across the country will be introduced to Europeana as a digital resource for learning in the 21st century. This competition will allow Spaniards to discover, share and create through Europeana as they explore the millions of cultural treasures it offers online. We warmly invite students and teachers to participate in the competition, which highlights the importance of our shared knowledge and culture in understanding who we are in today's Europe.´</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports highlights this competition as a unique opportunity to spread European cultural heritage across Spain, and to introduce this fundamental knowledge to the youth. The immense wealth of cultural material that has been put online is an invaluable educational resource, and will promote and highlight democratisation of culture and knowledge through the Spanish students and teachers participating in this project.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This collaboration between the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports and Europeana will culminate in Madrid at the Annual General Meeting of Europeana 29-31 October. Held at the Museo del Prado, the AGM will be attended by 250 delegates from institutions for the conservation of European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports and Europeana are aiming to create a meeting place between institutions and individuals who wish to access European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Contact:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The competition rules and regulations can be found, together with all other relevant information on: <a href=\"http://certameneuropeana.es\">certameneuropeana.es</a>.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    The Royal Library of Belgium and Europeana have today launched a unique European WW1 project to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war, at a press conference at The Royal Library in Brussels.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Just over 100 years ago, on 20 August 1914, war reached the capital. On 17 August, the government, diplomats and top administration fled to Antwerp. Shortly afterwards, the home guard was ordered to remove all the road blocks as fast as possible. Four years of harsh occupation, famine and fear for the people of the capital begin. ‘We have the feeling of being cut off from the world and being exposed to danger with no defence and at the mercy of the enemy', Stijn Streuvels wrote of the period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Royal Library of Belgium has joined forces with Europeana 1914-1918 to keep the stories of the people in Brussels of the ‘Great War' alive and to share them with the general public. The two organisations announced that Europeana 1914-1918, the most important pan European online resource of original WW1 source material, is bringing its collection days back to Belgium. They will together collect and share online Belgian family stories from the Great War. Now is the time for the people of Brussels to come forward with their memories and family items.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    During collection days at the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, on 24-25 October and 5-6 December, experts will gather and digitise people's family stories from The First World War so they can be shared worldwide, and saved for future generations. Those who can't make it to the collection days can still share their story online via www.europeana1914-1918.eu.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914-1918 brings together personal stories from the battlefield and the home front that perhaps haven't been told outside the family before, alongside the official and national narrative.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \_</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Through Europeana1914-1918.eu, these important personal stories and memorabilia from families across Europe can now take their place alongside WW1 collections from national European libraries including The Royal Library of Brussels. In total, ten national and university libraries from Great Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Austria, Serbia and Belgium united under the coordination of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin in 2011 with one ambition: to make the rich and unique collections from these European countries relating to the First World War accessible online at Europeana1914-1918.eu. Now the personal stories of families from Brussels will also join them.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director, said: ´With Europeana 1914-1918, we are piecing together a unique pan-European perspective of the Great War. Alongside the official records, stories, photographs and memorabilia from institutions such as museums, archives and galleries, we are asking the citizens of Europe to share their family stories and memories. ´Europeana is delighted to collaborate with the Royal Library of Belgium on the WW1 collection days in Brussels. Through our collection days, the grandchildren and other family members and friends who inherited these memorabilia have the opportunity to share pieces of history that might otherwise just be collecting dust in their attics.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Frederic Lemmers of the Royal Library of Belgium said: ‘It is a great opportunity to share history with others. Stories are passed down in families but sometimes lost. Through Europeana, those stories are not only saved for future generations, but find their place in Europe's shared history, making the past relevant today. In light of its 100 year anniversary, this is a useful way of remembering The First World War.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In 2012, Europeana 1914-1918 has held successful collection days at Flanders Field Museum in Ypres. From the battlefront region of Ypres, Europeana 1914-1918 is now coming to Brussels where it has a special relationship with the Royal Library of Belgium. In November 2008 Europeana.eu was launched and officially inaugurated at the Royal Library of Belgium, in the presence of José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    And reflecting Brussels' special place at the heart of Europe, Members of the European Parliament will also be able to contribute their own family stories to Europeana 1914-1918. With the support of the Royal Library, Europeana will hold collection days for MEPs as part of a special event at the European Parliament in December to commemorate not only the centenary of WW1 but also the 25th anniversary of 1989 and the fall of the Iron curtain.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    - Ends-</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Contact: For further information or images please contact Lauren Heeffer, Lauren.heeffer@finn.be +32 494 87 38 12</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Notes for editors</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana and Europeana 1914-1918: Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to more than 30 million digitised items from libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana 1914-1918 project is the most important online resource of original WW1 source material.

        title: 'Serbia''s forgotten WW1 family stories'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Citizens of Serbia urged to contribute to the unique online WW1 archive Europeana 1914-18'
        body: "<p>\r\n    Do you have a box hidden deep in the attic or under the bed that holds your great grandfather's diaries from 1914-1918? His army medals? Or a photo with a special story behind it? If so, your memories could be shared worldwide as part of a unique European WW1 project to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the war.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The city libraries of Belgrade, Novi Sad and Čačak have joined forces with Europeana, Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage. We are working together to collect and tell people's family stories from 1914-1918. These valuable stories will then be shared via Europeana 1914-1918.eu, the most important online resource of original WW1 source material featuring contributions from institutions across the globe and families across Europe. And we need your help!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We are calling on all Serbian citizens to bring photographs, letters, diaries, medals, film or audio recordings, together with the stories of whom they belonged to the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection days which will be held in three Serbian cities in November and December 2014.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Belgrade, 5 – 6 November, Belgrade City Library, Knez Mihailova 56</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Čacak, 12 – 13 December, Čačak City Library, Gospodar Jovanova 6</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Novi Sad, 22 – 23 December, Novi Sad City Library, Dunavska 1</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    On these Collection days, historians will be on hand to talk about the significance of finds, while experts from the State Archives and city libraries will professionally digitise the objects which will be uploaded to the Europeana 1914-1918 website.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana 1914-1918 brings together personal stories that perhaps haven't been told outside the family before, alongside the official and national narrative. It presents all sides of the conflict and all perspectives, from the front line as well as the homefront, and gives a deeper understanding of this important period of our shared Serbian history.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Personal WW1 stories that were left untold during the last hundred years have a chance to be heard, shared online so they can be accessed by others worldwide, and saved for future generations. This is particularly important in Serbia, which found itself at the very heart of a conflict that led to tremendous ramifications for the country and its people.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The role that our country played in the First World War greatly exceeded the size of its land and population, and the conflict had an immense impact on our national and European history. The memories from the Great War, its events and consequences, its victims and victors, remain very much alive today and the individual stories that bring them to life deserve to be told and protected in Serbia and across Europe.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana has held over 150 Collection days in 18 countries across Europe since 2011, and Serbia will be the last country to participate in 2014. The city libraries of Belgrade, Čačak and Novi Sad are participating in the Europeana 1914-1918 project as part of its comprehensive national programme marking the centenary of the First World War.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    If people aren't able to get to the Collection days, the Europeana 1914-1918 website www.europeana 1914-1918.eu provides instructions on how to scan, photograph and upload material at home.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    \L</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    - Ends-</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Contact:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    For further information or images please contact Dušan Jovanović at Action Global Communications (+381 11 675 01 16), serbia@actionprgroup.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Notes for editors</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana and Europeana 1914-1918:\_Europeana and Europeana 1914-1918: Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to more than 30 million digitised items from libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe.

        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    These experts come together as the EuropeanaTech community which comprises operators from the cultural sector, developer and IT architecture communities, and the creative industries. Bringing together these sectors offers a unique opportunity for collaboration on key issues from data modelling, multilingualism, discovery, content re-use and open source development, to Cloud and workable funding models.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The community, which has grown steadily since the first EuropeanaTech conference in 2011 in Austria, and EuropeanaTech 2015 will showcase the developments that have taken place and open up more collaboration and advancement as experts try to predict the future relationship between technology and cultural heritage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Bill Thompson, Head of Partnerships for BBC Archive Development, said: ‘While museums, galleries and archives will remain important as places to visit and repositories of cultural heritage, online access to digital resources is becoming more and more central to people's engagement with the past, and institutions need to learn how to thrive in this world. Europeana has forged a path towards understanding online cultural heritage, and EuropeanaTech is the place for experts, developers and researchers to meet and share their insights, projects and dreams'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Key advances, challenges and opportunities in opening up digital cultural heritage will be presented and investigated. These include fueling content re-use by improving data quality, and developing new models of interaction to aid its discovery. The broadcast media, the digital humanities and the museum sectors will all showcase international cooperation on interoperability, exchange and digital library developments, while funding models from the creative industries will be examined, and the potential of Cloud for cultural heritage explored.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The ambition of the conference and the EuropeanaTech community is reflected in the event's keynote speakers, with European and international figures from across the sectors including: Emma Mulqueeny, Founder and CEO of Rewired State &amp; Young Rewired State; Chris Welty, Google Research; Andy Neale, Director of Digital NZ; Dan Cohen, the founding Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA); Seb Chan, Cooper Hewitt and Smithsonian Design Museum; and George Oates, Good, Form &amp; Spectacle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Emma Mulqueeny, Founder and CEO of Rewired State &amp; Young Rewired State, said: ‘Data, culture and heritage has long been the subject of debate and what intrigues me is how all this real and sacred \"stuff\" will find its place in the digital renaissance. I wonder how will people want to experience it, and whether it can be re-energised, new discoveries made, voices found, secrets unlocked. At the Europeana conference in Paris I will be introducing the concept of 97ers, those born in 1997 or after, the social digital consumers, with their very different attitudes to learning, experiencing and sharing; and how the cultural sector could surprise and delight this generation'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Members of the community, many heavily supported by EU programmes, will present their work and the inaugural EuropeanaTech award will recognise the best technological innovations from the community.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Antoine Isaac, Research &amp;Development Manager at Europeana, said: 'EuropeanaTech is the place where all our community meets. We're going to share our experience as innovators and practitioners, and marvel at the most promising stuff we're working on. We're also going to look hard at our collective challenges - thinking together about where our priorities must be and how we should address them. The programme is packed with inspirational talks that represent the richness of what's happening in the field and offers opportunities for some great alchemy at people level too'.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    ENDS</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Europeana </strong><br>\r\n    Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe.

        title: 'The future of cultural communities'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    We face a new landscape for digital cultural heritage where the old rules no longer apply and archival, cultural, technical and creative communities need to remain open to innovative ways of working and thinking if Europe is to fully exploit the potential of our rich heritage for the benefit of the public and the economy. People seek cultural content online for different reasons in different contexts and don't fall into easy categories. Cultural heritage institutions need to make their content available in ways that reflect today's users, their needs and perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    That was the message to emerge from the EuropeanaTech 2015 conference at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris last week where more than 250 leading technical experts, developers, researchers and creators from across Europe and beyond gathered in a spirit of collaboration and innovation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Their challenge was to answer how we can store and share our digital cultural heritage in cost effective and innovative ways that are relevant in today's digital landscape. Participants were joined by global leaders in the field including Ruth Nicholls, MD of Young Rewired State; Chris Welty, Google Research; Andy Neale, Director of Digital NZ; Dan Cohen, the founding Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA); Seb Chan, Cooper Hewitt and Smithsonian Design Museum; and George Oates, Good, Form &amp; Spectacle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The conference challenged the accepted views of how people discover, explore, play and work with digital heritage today. Experts argued that for people interacting with cultural heritage online, the idea of a typical online search is now being overtaken. As is the idea that we can predict what their experience should look like. People are not looking so much for specific facts and answers but to take a journey, to explore and discover - making that experience as rich as possible for them is essential.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Ruth Nicholls of Young Rewired State said: \"For the 97ers the digital world is one where they have the freedom to define themselves through their own storytelling; this is paramount to their sense of identity and so cannot be isolated from their 'offline' existence.'</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Experts also warned that while providing access to cultural heritage content can stimulate creativity and economic value, we cannot predict or dictate how it will do that. The importance of enabling others to use content to innovate and create was highlighted. The challenge is to make cultural heritage available in a shape that can be reused, to make people aware that it is available and to help them find it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Dan Cohen, of the Digital Public Library of America said: \"People have uses for collections that collection builders cannot anticipate.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    While George Oates, Good, Form &amp; Spectacle added: \"Search engines don't give any guidance, but that is what cultural institutions are so good at!\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Conference speakers and attendees explored the tools and approaches that could make this happen, examining issues such as data quality and modelling, multilingualism, discovery, content re-use and open source development.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Creating new tools and methodologies to visualise, find and experience cultural heritage online was an important theme.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Tim Sherratt of New Zealand's Trove highlighted the increasing importance and professionalism of crowdsourcing as a means of improving and enriching data at source, asking the question: \"Perhaps we should call our [data] correctors ‘discovery engineers'?\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    While Seb Chan from The Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum explained how the museum focused on creating an innovative, user-focused digital presence alongside their visitor experience, releasing their API and a handful of open source tools. He stated: \"Search is a niche solution to a broad problem. People do not visit museums to perform a search\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Europeana's Bram Lohman presented a new Content Re-Use Framework which, alongside Europeana's proposed new Channels feature, promises to make it easier to find high-quality, freely useable content.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The successful approaches shared came with a clear lesson for the wider digital cultural heritage community - that not only is being open to innovation essential, so is being willing to fail. Leaving space for the unexpected and even unwanted is what will lead to the future tools and methodologies that allow cultural heritage to be fully found, reused, and explored.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Chris Welty of Google Research urged the community to \"Invest in failure to succeed.\"</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>ENDS </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Europeana </strong><br>\r\n    Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Europeana and Google’s Niantic Labs have partnered together to surface select Europeana cultural institution partners in <a href=\"http://www.fieldtripper.com/\">Google’s Field Trip app</a>. Now, tourists from around the world can use Field Trip to view and learn about archaeological sites, historical buildings and important monuments in Poland, Estonia and Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\_Field Trip mobile app is developed by Google’s Niantic Labs for iPhone, Android mobile devices and Google Glass, allowing users to explore and discover more about their surroundings. Available in over 30 languages, Field Trip uses Google’s geolocation technology to provide interesting information to travelers as they explore the world around them including local history, fun facts about art and architecture, hidden gem restaurants and much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognising the untapped potential of matching culture and innovative technologies, Europeana and Google’s Niantic Labs began a pilot project in 2014 to add brand new and unique European cultural content to the Field Trip app. Three Europeana partners the\_<strong>Swedish National Heritage Board</strong>, the <strong>National Heritage Board of Estonia</strong> and the <strong>National Heritage Board of Poland</strong> joined the pilot to share their curated and enriched collections on Google’s Field Trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<em>Strategically,\_we want to enable and promote the creative reuse of cultural content in the tourism sector. The pilot project with Google’s Niantic Labs marks our successful entry into this key market and is the first step in building solid and productive relationships between cultural institutions and the digital tourism industry. Making Europeana collections available on the Google’s Field Trip app allows memory institutions to have greater visibility, wider outreach and deeper engagement with their audiences.</em>” - Jill Cousins, Executive Director at Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<em>Through the partnership with Europeana we can now tap into a large and diverse network of European heritage institutions and the cultural wealth they have to share. That means we can add more trusted partners to our publisher list and offer Field Trip users new and rich stories about cultural treasures as they travel throughout Europe</em>.” - Gijs van der Hulst, Senior Manager New Business Development at Google’s Niantic Labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the successful completion of this pilot, Europeana is working to add other cultural institutions’ material to Field Trip and is encouraging members of its network to join this partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana</strong><br>\r\nEuropeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe.

        title: 'Provide ‘Fit for Education and Learning’ content to Europeana say new recommendations'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Policymakers from EU education and culture ministries led by Europeana have released a new set of recommendations to encourage better use of digital cultural heritage content in education and learning, supporting Europe’s Digital Agenda commitment to <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/opening-education\" target=\"_blank\">‘Open Up’ education</a> through the opportunities afforded by the digital revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of learning is changing, and as it increasingly takes place outside of the traditional classroom, and the importance of digital learning grows, demand for engaging and reliable content is rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key recommendations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a Europe-wide structured dialogue between policymakers, cultural heritage institutions and educators to improve access and reduce duplication of effort,</li>\r\n    <li>Prioritise the provision of ‘Fit for Education and Learning’ content by cultural heritage institutions and ministries,</li>\r\n    <li>Emphasise the development of inclusive and accessible digital learning resources,</li>\r\n    <li>Promote open licences and improve the access and re-use conditions that underpin education and learning.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>These recommendations aim to raise awareness of the availability of digital resources through Europeana and show their clear benefits for education and learners in Europe, while also providing information about proper use of the material, and encouraging the development and sharing of digital learning resources. There are, however, a number of challenges in bringing these benefits to the educational community. As learning becomes more digital, there must be greater Europe-wide dialogue about how we make and create our online resources to be fit for education and learning, and the access and re-use conditions that have to accompany them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Steven Stegers, Deputy Director of EUROCLIO observes, \"The cultural heritage sector and the community of educators need to work together to open digital heritage collections for educational re-use. Too often copyright restrictions and limited access prevent those who make high quality educational resources from using and sharing collections to do so.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make digitised European cultural heritage widely available for high-quality education and learning, the recommendations set out a series of proposed actions for policymakers in education which will respond to the changing educational environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We want to make it straightforward for students and their teachers to access the rich cultural heritage which belongs to all of us, regardless of where they live or choose to learn,” says Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana. “We must match the revolution in learning with high quality content, and build strong, productive relationships between the education industry and cultural organisations.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aligning its content and services with the needs of teachers, students and the wider education sector would fulfill part of the vision for Europeana. With over 40 million records, Europeana has huge potential as a valued resource for learners at every stage of their education, and at pan-European level. Digital learning resources <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Historiana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Inventing Europe</a> and institutional sites such as the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/about-the-project\" target=\"_blank\">British Library’s World War One website</a> demonstrate the value of using Europeana’s collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendations, which are the work of policymakers and experts in the educational field from 21 different countries, were created at strategy meetings during the Italian and Latvian Presidencies, facilitated by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EUROCLIO</a> – European Association of History Educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe. We are a network, representing more than 2,500 cultural heritage organisations and a thousand individuals from these and other walks of life including the creative and technical sectors, passionate about bringing Europe's vast wealth of cultural heritage to the world. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUROCLIO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUROCLIO, the European Association of History Educators works from a core mission to support the development of responsible and innovative history, heritage, and citizenship education by promoting critical thinking, mutual respect, peace, stability and democracy.

Since its founding in 1997, European Schoolnet has used its links with education ministries to help schools make effective use of educational technologies, equipping both teachers and pupils with the skills to achieve in the knowledge society.

        title: 'Europeana 280 – Art from the 28 countries of Europe'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Every EU country is asked to celebrate its contribution to European art history as part of a Europe-wide campaign to involve people with their shared art heritage, and to support the launch of the Europeana Art History channel.<br><br>\r\nEurope’s 28 Culture Ministries have been invited to work with their museums and galleries to choose at least 10 paintings that represent their country’s contribution to Europe’s art history. And the public across Europe will have their say on the 280 chosen pieces too, by voting for the works that they feel to be inspirational.<br><br>\r\nThe campaign hopes to get people across Europe involved with art treasures from their own and other European countries, and is supported by the European Commission as part of the development of Europeana.<br><br>\r\nThe nominated paintings will feature on the new Europeana Art History Channel, to be launched in early 2016. The 280 pieces of art will form a special collection in the channel, bringing together Europe’s most influential paintings. Selected paintings will also feature in a specially curated virtual exhibition in 2016.<br><br>\r\nMerete Sanderhoff, Curator of Digital Museum Practice at <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk\">SMK, The National Gallery of Denmark</a>, and member of the Europeana Members Council said:<br>\r\n“Working with digital art collections, I have always been driven by a vision where people can experience artworks side by side, even if the physical objects are located in disparate institutions and different countries. The Europeana Art History Channel helps realise this vision, offering up a unique perspective and access to Europe's artistic heritage to everyone online, no matter where they live or how far they can travel; the Europeana 280 campaign is a great way to start getting people involved with it.”<br><br>\r\nEach nominated piece should have contributed to a European art movement down the centuries - from Gothic to Renaissance, from Baroque to Impressionism, and from Cubism to Pop Art.<br>\r\nThe Europeana Art History Channel will provide a unique perspective on European art, not only providing access to works from all of Europe, and throughout history but where the iconic sits side by side with lesser known but still important counterparts.<br><br>\r\nJill Cousins, Europeana’s Executive Director said:<br>\r\n“Europe’s art history is rich and varied; we are all aware of Europe’s emblematic paintings but so many important and beautiful works are often not known outside of the countries that we live in. We want to give people across Europe the chance to discover those works alongside their more famous cousins, to explore their individual beauty as well as their wider significance. [For example Pyke Koch’s <em>magisch realisme</em> alongside Salvador Dali, or frescoes by Toma of Suceava from Moldavia alongside Da Vinci’s The Last Supper.] And to be able to do all of this online.”<br><br><a href=\"http://Europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana.eu</a> is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage. It brings together more than 40 million books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised by cultural institutions throughout Europe.<br><br>\r\nThe launch of Europeana channels will take this a step further, offering visitors a rich, curated journey through themed content, and with high quality digital images. And visitors will be able to explore different perspectives of a theme through the breadth of related content - for example an artist’s correspondence or others writing on an artist’s work could be items that can be explored alongside paintings. Europeana Art History channel will follow the launch of the Europeana Music Channel in late 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, which collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe.

        body: "<p>Europeana has launched its first <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/world-war-i-battle-perspectives/id1044759339\">Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048044178\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U course</a><em> </em>for use in classrooms, an important step forward in its goal to bring history to life for learners through the use of digital cultural collections in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book and accompanying course, <em>World War I: A battle of perspectives,</em> were developed jointly with EUROCLIO and Gwen Vergouwen, an Apple Distinguished Educator (ADE) and Belgian history teacher as part of Apple’s ADEs in Residence programme, which pairs selected teachers with some of the world’s leading cultural organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available in both Dutch and English, the book and course introduce students and history enthusiasts to different interpretations of what caused the First World War. Together, the linked materials demonstrate the ways in which digital cultural content can engage students and support traditional learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learners are encouraged to map their own path through diverse historical sources from <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>’s collections and learning resources from EUROCLIO, and independently develop an understanding of events leading to the outbreak of war in 1914. Using Multi-Touch technology, they are able to analyse and explore a fascinating array of material, from postcards to propaganda, handwritten letters to satirical cartoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The education sector is a key market for Europeana, and the project with EUROCLIO and ADE Gwen Vergouwen is a groundbreaking achievement in this field. It successfully builds on Europeana’s commitment with experts, member state and EU policy-makers in a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/tranforming-the-world-with-culture\" target=\"_blank\">recent White Paper</a> to open up digital cultural heritage for use in education and develop digital learning resources fit for the classroom using Europeana’s collections. With over 45 million records, Europeana has huge potential as a valued resource for learners at every stage of their education, and at pan-European level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director, Europeana, said: “The WW1 Multi-Touch book and iTunes U course are a great example of digital cultural content being used in education, and as such, they support our efforts in this strategic market. The ADE programme provides an excellent framework connecting cultural heritage institutions and teachers and enabling them to share expertise, content and new technologies for the benefit of both educators and students. Looking ahead, we hope this will be the first of many similar projects for Europeana.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steven Stegers, EUROCLIO, said: “The cooperation with the ADE Gwen Vergouwen and Europeana was a great way to learn how iTunesU and Multi-Touch Books work in practice and to promote the use digital heritage in education.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gwen Vergouwen, ADE, commented on making the Multi-Touch Book: “Through using unique primary sources from Europeana and EUROCLIO, the Multi-Touch Book enhances students’ historical thinking, and nourishes their needs as digitally native learners.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a variety of interactive assignments, the book and course cover secondary school curriculum content and provide educators with an innovative, engaging teaching tool to enhance lessons on the First World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The learning materials, available on Apple’s iTunes U store from today, meet standards for history education in Dutch and Flemish secondary schools, and will be introduced to classrooms in the coming academic year. The English version of the book and course provide valuable reference materials for history teachers and students all over the world, both in school and at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Multi-Touch book and iTunes U course join other digital learning resources produced by Europeana such as Historiana and Inventing Europe in demonstrating the value of re-using Europeana’s rich collections for educational purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Download the English <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/world-war-i-battle-perspectives/id1044759339\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048044178\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U course</a><br>\r\nDownload the Dutch <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/bronnen-en-interpretaties/id1045125525\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048134711\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U course</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Apple Distinguished Educator Programme</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple Distinguished Educators (ADEs) are part of a global community of education leaders recognised for doing amazing things with Apple technology in and out of the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apple’s ADEs in Residence programme places selected ADEs in some of the world’s leading museums, archives, science centers, and cultural organizations to develop innovative teaching and learning resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana</strong><br><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a> is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, and collects and provides online access to tens of millions of digitised items from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It opens up access to over 45 million digital records from over 3000 heritage institutions in 35 countries.

        body: "<p>Everyone in Europe can now get closer to their cultural heritage on the new Europeana Collections website. Online now at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new site offers visitors an immersive cultural experience. Its fresh, clean design makes it easy to navigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improved search and filters, including innovative colour searches (try this one for ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BCOLOURPALETTE%5D%5B%5D=%23483D8B&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\" target=\"_blank\">Dark slate blue</a>’) and quality searches (find our very best <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=map&amp;qf%5B%5D=paris&amp;f%5BIMAGE_SIZE%5D%5B%5D=extra_large&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\" target=\"_blank\">maps of Paris</a>), mean finding what you’re looking for is simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Better, bigger previews, a zoom function for high resolution images and documents (get really close up to this <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_1892.html\" target=\"_blank\">Monet</a>), direct play for video (try this <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08626/1037479000000131017.html\" target=\"_blank\">silent film</a>) and audio (listen to this <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023601/oai_eu_dismarc_GHT_001_00P4403A8657.html\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Callas aria</a>) and a new download option mean less time clicking and more time engrossed in cultural content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clear copyright information shows you what you can and can’t do with the treasures you find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All together, this means trustworthy and relevant content to use, to learn, to share or to contribute to research. See Europeana Collections for yourself with <a href=\"https://app.slidebean.com/p/FQm485gEut/Introducing-New-Europeana-Collections\" target=\"_blank\">our quick demo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name is new too - ‘Europeana Collections’ lets visitors know that Europeana brings digital culture from diverse sources across Europe together. Europeana Collections is a doorway to Europe’s rich digital heritage and a showcase for the Europeana digital platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Racine, Chair of the Europeana Foundation and President of the National Library of France, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Europeana Collections gives everyone access to tens of millions of cultural items and artefacts and the new site presents in dazzling detail those given to us in high quality by our 3,500 partners. Nearly 3 million of our higher quality items are also openly licensed, which means people can use them for their own purposes. The range of this open material is breathtaking - from the unique and iconic like a painting by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020903/KMS3325.html\" target=\"_blank\">Edvard Munch</a>, or handwritten notes and diagrams by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126312869.html\" target=\"_blank\">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>, to the unexpected like an allegorical and plundered painting of the Habsburg <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048007/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Skoklosters_slott_32631.html\">Emperor Rudolf II</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020601/attachments_54843_4960_54843_original_54843_jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\">personal account of the First World War</a>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Executive Director, Jill Cousins, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In just the first few weeks of its test phase, Europeana Collections saw more than 15,000 items being downloaded, demonstrating that the new site is answering a genuine audience desire for high quality, downloadable content. The growing number of high quality and openly licensed content is helping this and helps our partners to improve their international visibility, audience growth, outreach and engagement. We still have many more improvements to make but feel that our new Europeana Collections is a significant step in the right direction.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also new for 2016 are curated collections on popular interest topics. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Music Collections</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art History Collections</a> are available as test versions now and will launch officially in early 2016, with other themes including fashion and newspapers to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discover Europeana Collections at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">www.europeana.eu</a> and find news and updates on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaeu\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Google+</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>--ENDS--</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Examples of openly licensed collection items from Europeana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048007/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Skoklosters_slott_32631.html\" target=\"_blank\">Portrait of Emperor Rudolf II as Vertumnus</a>, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Skoklosters Slott, public domain.<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020601/attachments_47393_2543_47393_original_47393_jpg.html\">Adolf Hitler’s postcard</a>, ‘Greetings from Nuremburg’, Europeana 1914-1918, CC BY-SA.<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126312869.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sketches and notes from BL Arundel 263</a>, Leonardo da Vinci, British Library, public domain.<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020903/KMS3325.html\">Death Struggle</a>, Edvard Munch, Statens Museum for Kunst, CC0.<br>\r\nResults filtered by ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BCOLOURPALETTE%5D%5B%5D=%2387CEEB&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE\">Sky Blue</a>’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes for editors<br>\r\nEuropeana</strong><br>\r\nEuropeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, collecting and providing online access to tens of millions of digitized items from libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It opens up access to over 48 million digital records from over 3,500 heritage organizations in 35 countries.

        body: "<p>Ministries of culture and cultural institutions from 28 European Union countries, plus Norway, have collaborated with digital culture platform Europeana, to identify 300 works of art that have helped define Europe’s art history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Paul Gauguin’s <em>Femmes de Tahiti</em> to the <em>Sălciile de la Chiajna Willows at Chiajna</em> by Romanian Ștefan Luchian, the Europeana 280 collection brings together iconic and unique, famous and lesser-known works - all of which have contributed to European art movements from Renaissance to Cubism. This unique collection is available online as part of a campaign to enable people across Europe to engage with their art heritage and to demonstrate our shared European roots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe’s Culture Ministries were invited to work with their museums, galleries and libraries to choose at least 10 works of art that have contributed to Europe’s art history as part of the Europeana 280 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins Executive Director of Europeana said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Through the Europeana 280 campaign, Culture Ministries and 158 cultural institutions from across Europe have brought together a collection of more than 300 paintings, drawings, photographs, posters, illustrations, sculptures and other objects telling a unique story of how Europe’s art heritage has evolved over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone can now discover and celebrate these treasures online by getting involved in the #Europeana280 campaign through social media, related apps, or in person through a series of virtual reality events and digital installations across Europe from April to November 2016.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A virtual exhibition <a href=\"http://bit.ly/FacesofEurope\">Faces of Europe</a> showcases over 100 items from all 29 countries taking visitors on a journey with artists through the centuries, exploring a changing Europe through their works and role in society.

        title: '#BigArtRide tour ends with EU presidency handover'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: 'Virtual reality bike ride through art connects people across Europe.'
        body: "<p><strong>The European tour of #BigArtRide a virtual reality bike ride designed to connect people across Europe through Art and Technology had its final stops in Slovakia and the Netherlands, marking the handover of the EU Presidency between the two countries. After pit stops in Brussels, Wroclaw, Rome, Berlin, Prague, Paris and many locations in The Netherlands, the tour’s last day kicked off in Bratislava and Amsterdam with a bike race that symbolized the EU Presidency handover as the ministries of art from both countries raced against each other in the #BigArtRide. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The #BigArtRide concept is simple: two participants - one in a city on the tour route, the other in Amsterdam - put on virtual reality headsets and race each other through a virtual city populated with some of Europe’s most iconic and unique artworks. The idea is to allow Europeans to (re)discover our common cultural heritage through a fun, interactive and shared experience. And it worked! Across European squares, in parks, at festivals and at the European Parliament the #BigArtRide brought people of all ages and walks of life together: from young kids to seniors, from cyclists to politicians and Ambassadors, and even Dutch Prince Constantijn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#BigArtRide is part of a broader Europeana campaign, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/Europeana280\">Europeana 280</a>, whose goal is to get Europeans excited about their shared Art heritage. This campaign features some of Europe’s most unique works alongside some of its greatest Masterpieces, from Edvard Munch’s <em>The Scream</em> to Rembrandt’s <em>Night Watch</em>, but also <em>Sălciile de la Chiajna </em>by Ștefan Luchian and Ľudovít Fulla’s<em> Madona s anjelom </em>all provided by more than 150 Cultural Institutions from across Europe. The campaign includes art works from all 28 EU member states and Norway. All of the works can be found on the Europeana Collections <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;view=grid\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The #BigArtRide was also a celebration of the Dutch Presidency of the EU and its wish to build bridges between citizens across Europe. The closing ceremony for #BigArtRide brought together Marjan Hammersma, Director General of Ministry of Education, Culture and Science in The Netherlands and Ivan Secik, State Secretary of the Slovak Ministry of Culture, to reflect that the last stop on #BigArtRide tour coincides with the handover of the Presidency of the Council of the EU between these two countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marjan Hammersma, Director General of the Ministry for Education, Culture and Science in The Netherlands said: <em>“This is a symbolic moment: today the Netherlands hand over the EU Presidency to Slovakia. We are very proud of the results we achieved during our presidency. For example the #BigArtRide was a great way to connect European cities.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ivan Sečík, State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Slovak Republic said. “<em>The combination of cycling, virtual reality, and high-quality digital content offers a unique experience. It attracts the younger generations and helps them discover our cultural heritage.

Ministries of Culture and cultural heritage institutions from all 28 EU Member States plus Norway were invited to submit 10 works of art held in their country that have contributed to a major European art movement that they wanted to celebrate and share across Europe. More than 300 wonderful works have been submitted by 150+ cultural institutions and can be discovered during the Europeana 280 campaign and at </em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\"><em>Europeana Art History Collections</em></a><em> during 2016.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>About the Netherlands Presidency of the Council of the European Union: </em></strong><em>From 1st January to 30th June 2016, the Netherlands will hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. It is important for citizens and civil society organisations to feel connected to Europe. As EU Presidency holder, the Netherlands’ guiding principles are a Union that focuses on the essentials, a Union that focuses on growth and jobs through innovation, and a Union that connects with civil society.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Organisers:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Europeana</em></strong><em> is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, collecting and providing online access to tens of millions of digitised items from over 3,500 libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe, ranging from books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects.

        intro: "<p>Europeana started in 2008\_as a\_big political idea to unite Europe through culture by making our heritage available to all for work, learning or pleasure.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>A deeply felt belief that our shared cultural heritage fundamentally belongs to all of us, and is therefore too important to leave to market forces alone to digitise and make available. We still believe in this big idea. We are Europeana, the\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network\" target=\"_blank\">network</a>\_for the cultural heritage sector in Europe, and we think we are in a unique position to make these ideals come true. We are expanding our network with thousands of cultural institutions, politicians, tech entrepreneurs, open data activists, developers and researchers all with one thing in common:\_A shared dream\_of a world where every citizen will have access to all cultural heritage. We transform the world with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the strategy and accompanying documents\_below, or to find the most up-to-date Europeana strategy, visit our '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/mission\">About us</a>' page.</p>\r\n"

This is what we refer to as technical metadata (e.g. the image size, image colours, duration of audio clips). An overview of all the technical metadata which is extracted can be found in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-profiles#technical-metadata\">EDM profile for technical metadata</a>. An overview of all the technical metadata facets in Europeana Collections can be found at <a href=\"/resources/apis/search\">Documentation on the Europeana Search API</a>. The content tiers, i.e. the quality of a media resource as specified in the Europeana Publishing Framework, <a href=\"/post/publication-policy\">are calculated on the basis of the technical metadata</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retrieving the links to media resources in the above mentioned metadata fields is required in order to access and download those media resources. Downloading each resource is necessary in order to generate the technical metadata (and thumbnails, see below). Europeana will only temporarily download the media resource, which will be discarded after processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to successfully access and download a media resource, the following requirements must be met:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The link to the media resource must be a valid URL (Complies with either <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\">IETF RFC 3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt\">IETF RFC 3987 Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)</a>) and we recommend such URL to use the HTTPS protocol.</li>\r\n    <li>The link must resolve to a media resource directly, not to a webpage (i.e. where the mime-type of the resource would be \"text/html\").</li>\r\n    <li>The link must not return more than three redirects before ending up on the media resource.</li>\r\n    <li>The media resource must be able to be downloaded within a timespan of 20 minutes.</li>\r\n    <li>The media resource must have a valid mime-type. We have established a <a href=\"/page/media-formats-mime-types\">list of valid mime-types</a> that we support from ingestion to display in Europeana Collections based on the mime-types maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml\">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Large PDF files should be <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/optimizing-pdfs-acrobat-pro.html#EnableFastWebViewinaPDF\">optimised for Fast Web View</a> so they take less time to download.</li>\r\n    <li>An exception from these requirements are media resources that are embedded in the Europeana Collections portal (see section below).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>CORS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for the Europeana Collections portal to access and display media resources coming from providers’ servers, the latter must support <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/\">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>. This is because web browsers restrict resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain it was served (Collections in this case). The CORS standard is needed because it allows servers to specify not only who can access its resources but also how these resources can be accessed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is especially important for providers who share resources via IIIF as CORS is essential for our IIIF viewer to perform the image information requests and to obtain the presentation manifests. Without CORS, although the IIIF resources will be displayed in the provider’s website, it won’t be possible to be viewed in the Europeana Collections portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about CORS and how to implement it can be found <a href=\"https://enable-cors.org/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nHTTPS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Providers of IIIF resources are encouraged to deliver their resources over HTTPS so that they can be included in our web page without issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nEmbedding of media resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for an item to be embedded in the Europeana Collections portal, there must be <a href=\"https://oembed.com/\">a valid oEmbed endpoint</a> (see example from <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/oembed?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsketchfab.com%2F3d-models%2Fsaint-laurentius-church-of-ename-around-1500-9e5f19f6416942e49f1a7360d3043503\">SketchFab</a>) available where the media referred to in the item is displayed using a third party viewer or player. An exception is made for some data partners that do not support oEmbed.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the metadata side, a link to a webpage where the item can be displayed and which can be mappable to an oEmbed URL is provided within edm:isShownBy. In order to do this and because there is no information in the metadata that relates the webpage link to the oEmbed endpoint, the Europeana Collections portal has to apply an additional logic to convert the URL provided in edm:isShownBy into an oEmbed URL that can be used for embedding. For this, it uses an <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/europeana-portal-collections/blob/develop/config/initializers/oembed.rb\">internal registry of oEmbed endpoints</a> which consists of both a public list and manual additions made by the Collections development team (which also includes the Europeana oEmbed implementations to cover the exceptions). This means that whenever a new dataset is added that uses a different oEmbed endpoint it will need to be added to this registry.</p>\r\n"

        title: '470,000 images from Europeana join the new Creative Commons Search database'

        body: "<p>A tool for discovery, collaboration and re-use, <a href=\"https://search.creativecommons.org/\">CC Search</a> enables users to search a variety of open repositories through a single interface to find content in the commons. Developed by <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a>, the current CC Search tool is used by nearly <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/new-cc-search/\">600,000 people every month</a>. The new beta version of the project, which was released in early February, includes simple, one-click attribution making it easier to credit the source of any image. CC Search beta also provides social features, allowing users to create, share and save lists as well as adding tags and favorites to the objects in the commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beta version of <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/\">CC Search</a> has recently integrated 470,00 images from Europeana into its database, which already incorporates artworks provided by cultural institutions and repositories from across the globe. This variety of content includes February’s landmark release from <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/met-announcement/\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> as well as large collections of freely licensed images from 500px, Flickr, Rijksmuseum, and New York Public Library. Europeana’s new addition brings the number of searchable objects on CC Search up to 10,022,832, making Europeana its second main provider, and allowing the discovery of major works by masters of European art as well as photographs, prints, drawings, and more. More openly licensed material from Europeana will be added as CC Search continues to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/ccsearch1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:right\"><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>A screenshot of CC Search beta’s engine.</span></i></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this initial phase, CC Search beta focuses on images as its first media, and uses open APIs (including the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana API</a>) to index the available works. Search filters allow users to search by license type, title, creator, tags, collection, and type of institution. The tool aims to provide a ‘front door to the commons,’ bringing together a multitude of collections to inspire creativity and collaboration on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below is an example of Europeana content discovery through CC Search beta: a search for a common term such as “Paris” would suggest more than <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/?page=5&amp;search=paris&amp;licenses=ALL-%24&amp;licenses=ALL-MOD&amp;providers=europeana&amp;search_fields=title&amp;search_fields=creator&amp;search_fields=tags&amp;per_page=100\">500 results</a> - including this <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/image/detail/2uR-nuaDO7qWZzr-6O_QFw==\">portrait</a> of Paris in the 20th century, accessed via Europeana, and open for re-use. These records can all be used for commercial purposes, and are also open for modifications, adaption, or to be built upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/ccsearch2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/916118/S_TEK_photo_TEKA0118646.html?utm_source=api&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_campaign=fjqyYDAFX\"><em>Skioptikonbild med motiv från Paris. Bilden har förvarats i kartong märkt</em></a><em>. Tekniska Museet. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Try out the new CC Search beta and help us improve it by providing your feedback in the <a href=\"https://github.com/creativecommons/open-ledger\">Github repository.</a> The end goal is to make commons material more attractive and usable, and Europeana is pleased to join Creative Commons’ next step towards this achievement.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p>Impact is a hot topic for Europeana this year! It is embedded in every element of our B<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-business-plan-2017.pdf\">usiness Plan</a>, and became the focus of a new Task Force. Our goal, and it is a tough one, is to make it easier for Cultural Heritage Institutions to understand and express the impact of their activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 1. Engaging with people interested in impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March, we dipped our toe in the water and quietly launched a <a href=\"https://impkt.tools/\">beta website</a> that started the process of engaging with people interested in impact within the cultural heritage sector across the world. This effort is supported by our international partners such as the DPLA, and Trove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We kick-started April with an impact filled trip to Copenhagen. There, we ran a workshop for <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-new-mb-chair-merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff </a> and her colleagues helping them to explore the impact of <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/about-smk/camp00/\">SMK Open</a>, their far reaching project aiming at making more of their collections available online. Whilst still in the early stages of this project, they are considering the next steps, such as taking baseline measurements to demonstrate their impact of SMK Open in the years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSanderhoff/status/849139592494231554\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/tweet.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 546px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Step 2. Identifying the components of an impact toolkit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the inspiring surrounds of SMK, we spent a day with the I<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces/impact-assessment-task-force\">mpact Task Force</a> exploring what an impact toolkit meant to them. We looked at what the use cases were - when would an impact toolkit be useful, and how would it help?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learned that the expectations of a ‘toolkit’ were broader than we had originally expected. It involves more than a method, and the means of following that method, and requires canvases or softwares to guide you through undertaking an impact assessment. The Impact Task Force identified a number of components that would help not only undertake impact assessment, but also convince stakeholders and decision makers that assessing impact is an important activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/impact2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step 3. What are we working on in May?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We have created an internal impact team to work with the Task Force and iteratively develop the components of a toolkit that had been requested. In total, there are nine components ranging from the simple (‘a list of impact resources’) to the more complex (‘a methodology for impact design, assessment and narration’). We are also setting up a LinkedIn group as a forum for the growing impact community to share information and experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know more about our work on impact assessment, or are interested in contributing your expertise please get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">impact@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: '#AllezLiterature pays a social media tribute to World Book Day'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>For its third and latest phase, Europeana’s campaign dedicated to the written word is joining UNESCOS’s international celebration of World Book Day. From 23 April, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/allez-literature.html\">#AllezLiterature</a> is engaging social media users in a month long celebration of books and authors, with references to texts that have helped make Europe’s literary history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The date of 23 April was chosen by UNESCO as a commemoration of the anniversary of the death of Cervantes and Shakespeare. Both stand as one of Europe’s best known authors, with their work having been been widely translated - William Shakespeare is still the fourth most translated author in the world. To join the tribute and draw attention to their work, we are taking part in World Book Day by sharing links to some of their writings available in various languages on Europeana. This initiative highlights the variety of resources and languages accessible on the platform but also the reach that some of these great works of literature have had through their many translations. Throughout the campaign, the hashtag #OnThisDay will also commemorate other authors, events and facts that have marked literature across Europe, linking to relevant content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/fischerdata/status/856117665764704256\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/wbdtweet2.png\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 525px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as books Europeana has numerous portraits of authors and digitised manuscripts, such as a first edition of James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, which was first published in its entirety in Paris. Some books are available to download as PDFs, for people to read on their tablets and we will be encouraging to the sharing of literary quotes and opening lines of novels, and challenging our users to take part in related quizzes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curating the content for this final phase dedicated to books has highlighted some challenges relating to textual content. Libraries were the earliest contributors to Europeana and the online arena, and are suffering now from legacy problems: what worked in 2008 does not come up to expectations with users nowadays. For instance, although text is broadly represented on the platform, most of the content is available as images rather than PDF, making it difficult for people to actually read these resources online. The campaign has highlighted the need to up the quality of library material so that it can be used more widely. Geographically, the input of the libraries is very wide, but it is not very cohesive, making pan European subject or themed campaigns very difficult. The licensing of material (sometimes under copyright), and uneven level of quality are also quite limiting for social media use. The positive is that we now know better what we need to do with our library partners to improve the use of their material online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ActuaLitte/status/855723314798637056\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/actualitte.png\" style=\"width: 581px; height: 390px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our contribution to World Book Day builds on two previous phases dedicated to <a href=\"http://transcribathon.eu/en/transcribathon/featured/love-run/\">love letters</a> and <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/transcribathon/featured/poetry/\">poetry</a>, respectively celebrating Valentine’s Day (14 February 2017) and World Poetry Day (21 March 2017). Beside social media activity, Transcribathon events invited people to produce digital versions of selected documents. These Love Letter Run and WW1 Poetry Run were both a success, over 700 transcribers took part, and completed over 4,000 documents. And we have had some great participation from our Network that exposed more of the poetry in our collections. See our <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/allez-literature.html\">Storify on #AllezLiterature.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Three innovative educational projects are launching their crowdfunding campaigns: get involved!'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>We recently announced the three innovative educational projects selected in <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">Europeana’s match funding call</a> in collaboration with the crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://goteo.org/\">Goteo</a>. Three teams from Belgium, Greece and Italy introduced below tackle different themes within fashion and history. But they all share one thing in common: they have discovered original ways to re-use digital cultural heritage content in secondary education. Now, you can get involved to help these projects reach the next level!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 26 April, these three products are launching their crowdfunding campaigns in a first round running until 5 June. If the projects meet their minimum financial goal by then, they will run in a second and final crowdfunding round from 6 to 25 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/europeana-banner-set-blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 285px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For both of these campaign rounds, Europeana will match each Euro donated by the crowd (up to a maximum of 100 EUR per individual donation), to maximise the impact of each contribution. Each project campaign may receive up to 3.500 EUR from Europeana. Their respective minimum crowdfunding goal (which might differ per project) must be achieved in order to activate the match funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get to know the three innovative educational projects and help funding them today to inspire learners with Europe’s digital cultural heritage. You can also help by spreading the word about each project’s fundraising goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meet the projects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://goteo.cc/capturingfashion\">Capturing Fashion in the 20th Century with Frieda Verhees' Study Collection</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<address>Minimum crowdfunding goal: 8.930 EUR</address>\r\n\r\n<address>Ideal crowdfunding goal: 16.130 EUR</address>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/208160327\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/208160327\">MoMu Study Collection - Frieda Verhees</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/momuantwerp\">MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A joint initiative from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp (dept. Costume Design) and <a href=\"https://www.momu.be/\">MoMu</a> (the Fashion Museum in Antwerp), this project aims to preserve the fashion collection of the costume design teacher Frieda Verhees. It will also fund a documentary project on 20th century fashion, featuring interviews with Frieda and selected objects from her collection. This documentary will be used for teaching, research and creative projects. All outcomes (database/digital files/documentary) will be made available under an open license for free re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://goteo.cc/1821theplatform\">1821 Greek Revolution History Platform</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<address>Minimum crowdfunding goal: 12.000 EUR</address>\r\n\r\n<address>Ideal crowdfunding goal: 20.000 EUR</address>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H32xmuWaDZY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project aims to develop an online platform to discover, view and share 2D and 3D content (available on Europeana) that relates to the pre and post revolutionary period of the Greek War of Independence. It will provide an educational community portal where secondary school students and teachers communicate with each other, while they explore educational materials.

The idea for this project took shape in 2016 during a seminar dedicated to animals at the front. Presented to an audience of 500 secondary school students and teachers, the topic was enthusiastically received.

        title: 'IPR knowledge at your fingertips: introducing our new training presentations'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>It can be difficult to find your way in the IPR maze. Take an example - One cultural heritage institution. One archive. Two hundred amateur videos, some dated, some undated. Multiple right holders, some named, some anonymous. How to reach the centre of the maze and navigate your way out logically and legally?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Custodians and the challenge of managing IPR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For custodians of cultural heritage, understanding what IPR means in practice is not easy when faced with olympic sized hurdles, such as how to understand your national law (which may differ from your neighbour’s), how different rules apply for different types of material (e.g. copyright last longer for artistic works than for audiovisual material), or how to proceed if you cannot trace a rights holder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s network comprises of 3,500 institutions each well versed in understanding IPR practically when managing their collections and developing digital strategies. Part of Europeana’s role with its network is to help bring people together and encourage cultural and knowledge exchange. This includes translating IPR in a meaningful way and lies at the heart of many of its policies, frameworks and standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/screenshot1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tools of the trade </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the wealth of knowledge within the network which reinforces Europeana as trusted authoritative source, it is important to build a space for shared working practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes being able to publish key IPR deliverables as outcomes of subject-specific projects such as <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Europeana%20Fashion%20IPR%20Guidelines.pdf\">fashion, </a><a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/150617-Europeana-Food-and-Drink-IPR-Guides-FINAL-.pdf\">food and drink </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/content-space/ipr-toolkit/\">IPR toolkit</a> achieved as part of the Europeana Space project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help put IPR on the map at an institutional level, to help support data partners put IPR knowledge into practice, and influence decision makers and colleagues, we are delighted to introduce <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/tools-resources/presentations-and-videos\">our new IPR training presentations and videos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/screenshot2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 334px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It’s all in the detail</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3 identified priority areas are a general introduction to copyright and the digitisation of cultural heritage, an overview of Creative Commons licenses, and a walk through the principles of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentations focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The key principles of European copyright law and related rights</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Why it is important to be legally compliant when sharing cultural content online</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Why it is important to understand the law in the context of working with Europeana and other digital platforms</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How to correctly label digital objects and metadata using the Europeana Licensing Framework</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How to work with other standards of best practice such as Creative Commons</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Where and who to go to for further help</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The presentations are now available as slides and as video presentations giving trainers and participants the flexibility to brush up their knowledge before a training session. They are also a useful tool as a follow up method of learning and ongoing engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue to work collaboratively with data partners to shape relevant tools and resources when managing IPR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, schedule your next workshop, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/presentations-and-videos\">use the new IPR presentation tools</a> and tell us what you think!</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p>This new thematic collection is a collaboration between the Europeana Foundation, who delivered the web platform, and the Europeana Fashion International Association, who has been gathering and curating digitised fashion content from the past 5 years. A non-profit organisation, the Association brings together fashion institutions to encourage the valorisation and re-use of fashion heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a> is now fully integrated into the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr\">Europeana platform</a>, living alongside <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/art\">Europeana Art</a> and<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/music\"> Europeana Music</a>. It will benefit from the technical advancements and new features developed across the platform. It also enables fashions curators, academics, students and enthusiasts exploring the Fashion collection to browse and see connections to other areas of interest. Marco Rendina, Technical Director, says <em>“we are delighted to provide access to more than a million fashion items to the bigger Europeana family, and share the powerful advantages the platform has to offer”</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection brings together an incredible wealth of content including historical clothing and accessories, contemporary designs, catwalk photographs, drawings, sketches, catalogues and videos contributed by nearly 40 museums and fashion brand archives from 13 European countries. It introduces new galleries curating the collection by themes, such as fashion illustrations, sportswear, prints, or Haute Couture, and highlights by fashion experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/pasttopresentfashionreinterpretations.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 277px;\"><em>Domino or mantle made of silk lustring, England, 1770-1780, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, CC BY-SA; Fashion show of Anne-Marie Beretta spring-summer 1983 women's ready-to-wear collection, Anne-Marie Beretta (Designer), Paul van Riel (Photographer), In Copyright </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users can search and download high quality content, and easily access what they are looking for by using new filters including designers, techniques, materials, and types of clothing. The collection features exclusive editorial content, including guest blog posts and an online exhibition “Past to Present: Fashion Re-Interpretations”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform provides a unique space for heritage institutions across Europe to showcase and share their collections online. Contributing institutions already include the Victoria and Albert Museum (UK), Les Arts Decoratifs (France), the Royal Library of Belgium, as well as fashion brand archives such as the Missoni archive, the Emilio Pucci Archive and the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, amongst others. Harry Verwayen, Europeana Deputy Director, says<em> “Europeana Foundation is very pleased to increase our collaboration with the Europeana Fashion Association, and to welcome their curatorial expertise on the Europeana platform”</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can support the launch and help us spread the word on social media using the hashtag #EuropeanaFashion, and tagging <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">@Europeanaeu</a> (Europeana) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EurFashion\">@EurFashion</a> (Europeana Fashion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>I grew up in a village: I must say that access to books was not always easy without certain efforts. Not only did I have the desire to read and get informed, but also to help more people to enjoy access to information. Since then, I have been convinced of the importance of science, culture and information for the progress and well-being of mankind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Computer sciences for knowledge management </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During my first job as a teacher in a village school, IT began to shyly assert itself in Romania. But it was not until 1989 that I started working as a programmer at an industrial company. I later became a librarian at the Central University Library of Cluj-Napoca in 1991, precisely when Romania, which had by then become a democratic country, was opening up to international collaborations and undergoing strong developments in computer sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been fascinated by libraries, which I consider to be the main repositories of universal culture. But globalisation and the accelerated technological development of the last decades have expanded to such an extent that knowledge management becomes more difficult, and leads to a drastic decrease in reading aspiration. That is why we need to organise stored information to facilitate its access for readers. In this sense, computer sciences offer unpredictable possibilities. I firmly believe that gradual digitisation of funds and databases opening to the widest audiences are necessary for the progress and education of new generations. This means free and easy access to the universal scientific and cultural resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/olimpia1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 783px;\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/x7n3pq\"><em>Károly Pap Szathmári, Ţărănci din Dâmboviţa (Peasants from Dambovita), Public Domain</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My responsibility for the Central University Library</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started my work in the library focusing on these needs, leading the institution's Informatics Laboratory, and participating in the implementation of all domain-specific systems, programs and applications. As an IT manager, I carried out the library automation (since 1992), created CDs with bibliographic databases (since 2004), digitised our main collections (since 2007), implemented the EDS portal with online catalog and subscribed databases (since 2011) ), and included our catalog in WorldCat (2014). I have contributed to building up the National Catalog in Science and Technology (NUSIDOC), among other initiatives. Since 2005, as Deputy Director, I kept on assuming direct leadership of the IT sector of the library. For the past 20 years, I also delivered computer science courses and seminars for students in the Library and Information Science field, at \"Babes-Bolyai\" University of Cluj.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these positions, I noticed both the huge progress made in the field and the limitations that occurred along the way. The main problems were met in designing domain-specific databases, as reliable and compatible with those already in place as possible. We are in charge of training our users, but we also need more and improved platforms. Last but not least, adjusting the digitisation facilities to the legal regime of publications (see the copyright laws) implies increased responsibility. Therefore, it is not surprising that, sometimes, we might be reluctant about the progress of international digitisation and cooperation, or misunderstand the new library functions nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana offers a wide range of information and documentation, and the Europeana Network Association (ENA), based on cooperation, opens up new possibilities for solving such problems. We were able to include our digital library in Europeana in 2015, and the results are encouraging: it is the Romanian institution with the highest amount of metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/olimpia2.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 491px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://goo.gl/YVbjjr\">Ştefan Luchian, Sălciile de la Chiajna (Willows at Chiajna), Limited Re-use CC BY-NC</a><a href=\"https://goo.gl/YVbjjr\"> </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My responsibilities as a councillor</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a councillor, I would like to contribute in two major directions. First, I want to encourage further development of our collections digitisation, placing them into the universal context, and facilitating free online access. In other words, raising our level of activity up to today's international standards. Equally important, my second objective is to convince as many Romanian scientific libraries as possible to contribute to Europeana with quality metadata. Such achievements will enhance the library’s role in today's society, enable Romanians to access universal science and culture, and support the European integration of our country on the field of information. The future of the library, and therefore of knowledge, requires receptiveness and cooperation. In this respect, Europeana seems to me the most appropriate tool.</p>"

        title: 'Working towards the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage'

        body: "<p>Europeana is proud to announce its support and involvement in the first official Year of Cultural Heritage, an initiative by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. Throughout 2018, a series of events and activities online and across Europe will encourage European citizens to understand the past and imagine the future in relation to cultural heritage, reinforcing the sense of belonging to a common European space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A year belonging to the cultural heritage sector</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1983, official European ‘Years’ have been encouraging dialogue between countries in addressing specific subjects like development (2015), citizens (2013 - 2014) and active ageing (2012). The idea of a focus on cultural heritage was initially raised in 2014 to strengthen the sense of a European identity, and the European Commission is currently outlining a direction for the Year and is keen that it belong to the cultural heritage sector. Organisations were invited to get involved with 35 chosen from more than 300 applicants. Calls for projects will be launched under several EU funding programmes, and we will keep our community and network informed of opportunities to join in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After taking part in the kick-off meetings for preparation with stakeholders and member states, Europeana will help to shape the next steps. We’re also thinking about what Europeana’s contribution to the Year will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A sense of shared cultural heritage </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage surrounds us in the monuments of our cities, in our landscapes and archaeological sites. It is preserved in literature and the arts as much as in crafts, food and traditions. It is safeguarded in collections managed by museums, libraries and archives; but also lives in intangible and digital forms. Through this variety of forms and aspects, it plays a valuable role in diplomacy, and contributes to the economy, directly employing over <a href=\"http://blogs.encatc.org/culturalheritagecountsforeurope//wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CHCfE_FULL-REPORT_v2.pdf\">300,000 people in the cultural sector</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recognising the central place of culture and history in the existence of the European Union, and more widely across the Council of Europe countries, the European Year of Cultural Heritage has four aims: to further engage people with their cultural heritage; to promote its social and economic value; to foster its protection and preservation; and to stimulate interest and innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Regional and transnational initiatives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To meet these four main objectives, a series of events will run throughout 2018, starting with a launch in December 2017 during the European Cultural Forum in Milan. This will include regional and local initiatives, but also national projects implemented by national coordinators designated by each of the EU member states. On the European level, it will be a joint effort by the European institutions, with up to 10 transnational projects to be funded with the support of the Creative Europe programme, Horizon 2020, Erasmus +, Citizens for Europe, and a number of other EU funding schemes. Alongside events sharing knowledge and highlighting tangible heritage, will be information and education campaigns to raise awareness and promote discovery of heritage in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understanding digital opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be an emphasis on the impact and opportunities of the digital shift, drawing attention to what the EU can do for conservation, digitisation, infrastructure, research and skills development. Technology gives unprecedented access to cultural heritage; and using innovation and science is important for better presentation of heritage. To reach out to younger generations and wider audiences, activities will also be led online and feature digitised as well as born-digital resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will play multiple roles from helping others link the physical to the digital, to running a couple of pan-European campaigns on the influence of migration on cultural heritage and the end of WW1 and the birth of nations. We are also thinking of a schools, Wikipedia, UNESCO world heritage sites and Europa Nostra campaign that allows people to actively participate in the Year of Cultural Heritage from their neighbourhoods across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>by Lisa van Winden</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year, <a href=\"https://www.heritageinmotion.eu/\">Heritage in Motion</a> rewards the best innovative multimedia projects related to Europe’s cultural heritage. Applicants can enter the competition in four categories: Apps; Website; Games &amp; Interactive Experiences; or Film &amp; Video. This year, the Heritage in Motion Award Ceremony will be held on 29 September 2017 in Skopje, Macedonia at the Annual Conference of the European Museum Academy. While the closing date for the 2017 competition was last week, we tell you a little more about <em>Strong Water: An interactive exploration on the history of the Dutch Waterline by IJswater</em>, which won the 2016 award in the Games and Interactive Experiences category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/limes.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 331px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>IJsfontein</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong Water was created for the Waterlinie Museum at Fort Vechten in the Netherlands. Visitors can experience an interactive exploration of the operation and history of the Old and New Dutch Waterline, a large-scale military defence system built in the 19th century. The makers used games, films and animation, projection on felt figures and a VR Parachute jump over the Netherlands. The Heritage in Motion jury complimented the creativity of the project and acknowledged it as <em>‘a good combination of the virtual and the physical. While the individual aspects of the exhibition are not necessarily innovative, it is the total concept that impressed the jury, combining enticing ideas such as ‘what-if’ scenarios to create an inspired interactive experience.’</em> Strong Water was also nominated for a Cinekid Leeuw for the best new media production of 2016, and the Waterlinie Museum for Best Day Out 2017 in the province of Utrecht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/strong-water.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 200px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>IJsfontein</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>IJsfontein designs and develops playful (digital) learning experiences. They create games and interactive experiences for museums; and use cross-media for primary education. Recently, they created Limes for the province of Utrecht, an interactive map of the Roman Empire. The map reacts to the visitors’ movements. It displays today’s location that slowly changes to a reconstruction of the landscape in the Roman era, allowing visitors to see what happened in their own neighbourhood in former times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage in Motion is a joint initiative of the European Museum Academy and Europa Nostra and is supported by Europeana.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>In 1981, I got a Master’s degree in art history. But for different reasons, including the economic crisis, I had to look into other fields to find a job.I started computer lessons, was unemployed from time to time, worked in museums as a guide, in computer bookshops and repair shops, and became a self-employed desktop publisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From a non-career to a dream job</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had the typical non-career of someone in between a hippy and a punk. Instead of buying a Harley Davidson during my mid-life crisis, I started studying again at the end of the nineties, this time Library and Information Sciences. I contacted the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA) regarding the use of high resolution images for research and commercial applications as I was writing a paper on a project for which they were a partner. These images would be sent to scientific and commercial users over ISDN-lines. The project did not have a follow-up, but made me discover the use of computer and internet technologies in the field of art. When they later had a job opening, I managed to get my foot in the door. And, because they were in need for people with knowledge of informatics, I also became responsible for the IT department. A couple of years later, I was officially appointed as an art historian, mainly responsible for anything linked to databases, digitisation and national and international projects in these domains. Being able to work in a prestigious institution where I could combine my interests in art, books and computers felt like a dream come true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/ebu-image1-b203357.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><a href=\"http://balat.kikirpa.be/object/20035946\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-72c222cd-20ec-8990-e1b3-36ae12d57ff7\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Les cigognes (The storks)</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, Louis Dubois, 1858 [© KIK-IRPA, Brussels (Belgium), cliché B203357] </span></span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The early days of Europeana </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2003 on, I was involved in digitisation projects on institutional and Belgian levels. When the first discussions started about a common platform for European cultural heritage, I was immediately interested. I witnessed Europeana’s evolution from the beginning. But, due to some practical restraints, I could initially only contribute as a non-affiliated partner, and later as a budgeted partner institution to some affiliated projects like Athena, Partage Plus and AthenaPlus. Today, the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage has 143,371 items in Europeana, but an update is needed, which will enable us to significantly increase the number of items contributed. This isn’t bad for a small institution with limited resources and IT!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a federal scientific institution, KIK-IRPA combines laboratories, restoration/conservation workshops, an extensive photographic archive (over 1,000,000 analog and digital-born negatives), and a documentation centre. Even before Europeana, we made our collection of images available online, with limited resolution. But recent developments have convinced us to give access to most of the digitally available mid to high resolution images in our photographic collection for personal use. Today, up to 700,000 images are downloadable in mid to high resolution at<a href=\"http://balat.kikirpa.be/\"> http://balat.kikirpa.be</a>. (The acronym, BALaT, standing for Belgian Art Links and Tools, also refers to the Belgian architect Alphonse Balat (1818-1895).)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/ebu-image2-x068928.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 558px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><a href=\"http://balat.kikirpa.be/object/11001038\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-72c222cd-20ed-9d5e-deb1-12cd1e64cffd\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Stained glass of the House with Irises in Marcinelle</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, artist unknown, ca 1904 [© KIK-IRPA, Brussels (Belgium), cliché X068928] </span></span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A lifetime’s project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, one of Europeana’s most interesting projects was Partage Plus, because it combined technological aspects (including 3D), with content coming from a period I really love and study for my own (lifetime’s) project: art nouveau. For many years, I have been working on a PhD thesis on anarchist influences in Belgian art from 1850 to 1940. The art nouveau period is an important chapter in this thesis, mainly because of Henry van de Velde’s interest in anarchism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once more I would like to thank everybody for giving me the opportunity to be part of this European adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p><em>by Sofie Taes and Valentina Bachi from </em><em>PHOTOCONSORTIUM, the International Consortium for Photographic Heritage </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/photography\">Europeana Photography </a>is now launching as the outcome of a collaboration between Europeana and PHOTOCONSORTIUM, the International Consortium for Photographic Heritage. Giving access to a vast archive of historical images, it’s a treasure trove of carefully selected pictures from the first 100 years of photography. The latest thematic collection on the Europeana platform, Europeana Photography presents high-quality images and compelling stories from Europe’s most astonishing historical picture collections. Just be warned: once you’ve stepped into our time capsule, you’ll never want to leave!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/2024914-photography-providedcho-ajuntament-de-girona-090827.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/it/record/2024914/photography_ProvidedCHO_Ajuntament_de_Girona_090827.html?q=foto+lux\"><em>Foto Lux, Ajuntament De Girona, CC BY-NC-ND</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Connecting people with their past</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Photography allows people to connect with their past, with fellow citizens, to explore distant eras and locations, and better appreciate the value of their continental, national and local cultural heritage. Images tell invaluable and complex stories: what everyday life was like for European citizens throughout history, what past times and places might have looked and felt like, what it meant to be born in glamorous Paris during the Belle Époque or to be a family on the run during World War I.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A curated experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Showcasing some of the works available through Europeana Photography is a new exhibition series. ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/industrial-photography-in-the-machine-age\">The Pleasure of Plenty</a>’ is all about opulence, with stunning vintage photographs that can be explored in minute detail. More exhibitions telling fascinating stories through vintage photography, but also focusing on the characteristics of the medium of photography will follow regularly. Themes and materials have been selected to interest everyone, from those with a passing interest, to the photography specialist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/2024906-photography-providedcho-roki-kio-kra-to-muziejus-roki-kis-area-museum-limis-60990645.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 383px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/it/record/2024906/photography_ProvidedCHO_Roki_kio_kra_to_muziejus___Roki_kis_Area_Museum_LIMIS_60990645.html?q\"><em>Onuškio gyventojai degustuoja \"Kalnapilio\" alų.

Aimed at both the general public and professional users, this online showcase enhances visibility of Europeana’s photographic collections and encourages people to use them for their own projects, as 22% of the content is openly licensed. Educators may rejoice too, as improved search tools make Europeana Photography an unmissable resource, allowing the discovery of breathtaking collections that have previously stayed under the radar.

        title: 'Gifs, apps and social media: revamping cultural heritage with digital initiatives'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Art doesn’t need to be digital native to be popular on the internet: the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/classicalartmemes/\">Classical Art Memes</a> page, for instance, has more than 4 millions followers.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Digital technologies and social media trends regularly enable users to interact with online content in playful and shareable ways - we thought you’d like to know how Europeana has been using them to promote our partners’ content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gif it up: putting classical art in motion </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now in its fourth year, <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifitup\">Gif it Up </a>takes this opportunity to give art a second life with an annual international Gif making competition. Throughout October, creatives, animators, history nuts and lovers of the internet will once more be invited to come up with new gifs exploring cultural heritage resources. Participants are asked to use public domain and openly licensed digital video, images, and text found in the four partners: Europeana, hosting this year’s competition; and also DPLA, Trove and DigitalNZ. The previous years’ editions, for instance, have seen the <a href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/91740a7bbda9982db600af2bdc0abe2d/tumblr_ogp9rgbYBZ1toclb3o4_540.gif\">state caterpillar crawl</a> and change into a butterfly or <a href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/58ef77422b84cf34aa03f20370e12788/tumblr_nz2222GAfN1toclb3o3_540.gif\">a man falling in the grand canyon</a> among other animations. In 2016, the hashtag #GIFitUP reached an audience of more than 4 million. More specifically, general Europeana content was used for 57 of the total 128 entries - 45% of all entries - including the overall winner and two of the five runners-up.Results can still be browsed <a href=\"https://gifitup2016.tumblr.com/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/tumblr-ogp9rgbybz1toclb3o4-540.gif\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 341px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“The State Caterpillar”, Grand Prize Winner, was created by Kristen Carter and Jeff Gill from Los Angeles, California using source material from the National Library of France Europeana. This gif is made available under a CC-BY-SA license.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transforming paintings with Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only can users make a painting move, but they can even make it smile. Last week, UK designer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ollyog\">Olly Gibbs</a> entertained Twitter by going to the Rijksmuseum ‘armed with FaceApp to brighten up a lot of the sombre looks on the paintings and sculptures’. Using the app that usually transforms users’ faces in photos using Artificial Intelligence (to make them look older/younger, more attractive, etc.), he managed to give a new look to grumpy looking classic portraits and sculptures with a series of pictures that quickly went viral. Following this initiative (which has its own hashtag on Twitter, search for #MuseumFaceApp), Europeana, home to a lot of public domain artworks, has encouraged users to revisit and ‘cheer up’ their favourite classic portraits themselves and share their own results on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/faceapp-1495105054904-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063623/GER_280_001.html\"><em>Self-Portrait with Fur-Trimmed Robe | Albrecht Dürer, Alte Pinakothek, Munich, Public domain</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Colouring artworks on social media</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries, archives and museums around the world are using these opportunities to get people interacting with their collections in new creative ways. Over the week long campaign #ColourOurCollection led on social media, they recently revisited another trend: colouring books. People were invited to download free books compiling public domain artworks, to colour them, and submit their own versions on Twitter using the hashtag #ColourOurCollections. Europeana took part in 2017 with the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Europeana_ArtNouveau_ColouringBook.pdf\">Art Nouveau Coloring Book</a> on the occasion on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style\">Art Nouveau exhibition</a>, and in 2016 with t<a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/EU_ColouringBook_low.pdf\">he Colouring Book for Grown-ups</a>. Other participating institutions taking part included The Met and the New York Public Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/coloringbook.jpg\" style=\"width: 424px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Boekband Metamorphose, Jan Toorop, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has your institution tried similar initiatives? What did you think of it? Let us know your thoughts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Being an academic, I teach Information Science, Online Publishing and European Cultural Policy at the Faculty of Arts KU Leuven. Originally trained as a philosopher, I have a professional background in ICT. My main interest is ICT solutions for cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Broad perspectives for education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My interest for Europeana, however, comes primarily as an end-user. Me and many of my colleagues at the university use Europeana with our students, for classes on a range of subjects, and often to replace very expensive commercial databases. The end-use of Europeana is so much more than casual searches: The collections allow for education with a broad, transnational perspective using true, untampered sources. We should never underestimate the power of the image and the damage done by faked or framed representations. I also teach about Europeana to students of the MA Cultural Studies and the MA European Studies in Leuven, in the context of a course on European Cultural Policy. To answer a question asked by my students: yes, I consider Europeana to be not only the outcome of European cultural policies, but also a key instrument for them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/2024906-photography-providedcho-kretingos-muziejus-limis-6787193.jpeg\" style=\"height: 600px; width: 441px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/2024906/photography_ProvidedCHO_Kretingos_muziejus_LIMIS_6787193.html?q=europeanaphotography\"><em>Klementina Tiškevičienė (1856–1921) | S. Rumbleris; S. Rumbler, Kretingos Muziejus, public domain </em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Telling Europe’s history through images</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a>, the organisation of which I am the current president, acts like an expert hub for photography in Europeana. It is an association that brings people from photo archives, museums and agencies together with specialists in photography. The goal is to promote photographic heritage, currently with a focus on early photography, but not limited to that. In fact it continues the work we did on EuropeanaPhotography – written as one word! – the EC-funded CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme) project that allowed us to ingest over 450,000 top images of early photography (1839-1939) into Europeana. Some of the members hold archives from world-famous photographers, but more importantly we digitised unpublished images from a host of lesser-known collections from many corners of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, photography is an art, and you can now discover breathtaking photos by Europe’s best photographers in the Europeana Photography (now written as two words) thematic collection.<br>\r\nBut it also represents shared memories: these frozen images of the past, covered by a thin layer of the dust of time, give us the opportunity to share each other’s experiences. Memory is essentially social, as it allows us to transcend our personal viewpoint and grasp an image of the world that is collectively imprinted. To me, this expresses what Europeana is for. The photo collections in Europeana are the ideal material for building stories about Europe’s many histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advising on best practices </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through Photoconsortium, we want to share not just our experience of curating stories using photography, but also our expertise, both on photographic heritage and on its preservation. We also give advice to archives on digitisation best practices. By taking responsibility for curating Europeana’s photographic collections, we hope we can grow Europeana’s impact – I am also a member of the Impact Assessment Task Force, in particular in the world of education. But by improving metadata quality, expanding on our multilingual thesaurus (currently holding 16 languages), we also aim to serve the professional GLAM sector and members of Europeana and make photography data more accessible. In fact, more work still has to be done to add metadata that really pertain to photographic qualities (such as composition, viewpoint, lighting, background/foreground), as current metadata work focuses mainly on the content of what has been photographed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope it is clear that we are passionate about photography! We would like to broaden the Europeana movement to local archives who want to contribute to this common heritage!

        title: 'How Oxford University is using social media to fund a new project'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On 5 June, Oxford University will kick off its new <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/06/lest-we-forget-oxford-university-needs-you-to-spread-the-word/\">crowdfunding campaign for ‘Lest We Forget</a>’, a new community-based initiative aiming to preserve materials held by the public from the First World War. This initiative is building on the success of ‘<a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/\">the Great War Archive</a>’, a previous mass-digitisation project that gathered over 6,500 items in 2008, and became the inspiration and model for <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>: people were invited to bring WW1 family memorabilia, and experts would give context to the object while it was being digitised. Stuart Lee, who initiated both projects, tells us how social media can help raise awareness and funds to support cultural projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was the role of social media in the Great War Archive campaign in 2008?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time social media was only beginning to emerge as a main communication channel, but we used Facebook extensively, and also blog posts to highlight major discoveries as editor’s picks. The Facebook page still continues to grow with over 3,000 followers, and we now have an extensive presence on Twitter. We use them for a range of things, such as highlighting key dates and discoveries. We are also trying new things: on the 95th anniversary of the Battle of Arras, we tweeted the event as if it was live news. In July 2016 we also tweeted the roll of honour for the fallen soldiers from Oxford colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/rollofhonor.jpg\" style=\"width: 388px; height: 411px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did people engage with the campaign on social media? Did you get support from people individually, or from institutions?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a real mixture. Individuals supported us by reposting, and retweeting, but we also became loosely affiliated to a range of institutions such as the Imperial War Museum, the Commonwealth Graves Commission and charities like Age Concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has this crowdsourced model influenced other initiatives?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, many! We have advised numerous projects internally at Oxford. We have provided training for a variety of projects in this crowdsourcing approach through the follow-on <a href=\"http://projects.oucs.ox.ac.uk/runcoco/\">RunCoCo project</a>. This includes the community collection and reminiscence project <a href=\"http://www.age-exchange.org.uk/cotgw/\">Children of The Great War </a>run by Age Exchange, and the community collection for <a href=\"http://share.merton.ox.ac.uk/\">Merton College’s 750th anniversary</a> in 2014. The model we had developed in the Great War Archive was also used for Europeana 14-18. Oxford University became their main initial partner to export the concept outside the UK. In In 2010, we teamed up and provided training and staff for the first rounds of collection days in Germany, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Italy… All materials from the Great War Archive are also available on www.europeana1914-1918.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have you changed your approach to promote the ‘Lest We Forget’ project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Social media for ‘the Great War Archive’ was about raising awareness. For the ‘Lest We Forget’ campaign, we are gearing social media towards fundraising efforts, so we are now targeting individuals who have high social media impact and also institutions with extensive networks. For crowdfunding, we are using the OxReach platform which the University has used for two successful campaigns, but both in medical sciences. We wanted to use this for a humanities/cultural heritage bid this time. Our aim at this stage is to get the word out as widely as possible and to get individuals to donate small amounts of money. To do so, we are using <a href=\"http://thunderclap.it/\">Thunderclap</a>, the crowdspeaking platform that rallies people to spread a message together. We are aiming to gather 1,000 supporters before 5 June, who will need to copy our original tweets. If we do, the message will go out from their accounts on the 6th. Other uses of social media are built into the Lest We Forget platform itself which mails networks and adds gamifications to the fundraising. We are also creating a series of pitch videos for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OxfordLWF/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WW1Centenary/status/803179724491132928\">Twitter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-05/lwf2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can help Oxford University spread the word about the ‘Lest We Forget’ crowdfunding campaign by joining their <a href=\"https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/57658-lest-we-forget\">Thunderclap</a> before 5 June !</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The annual presidency event was held on 23 and 24 May in the premises of the <a href=\"http://heritagemalta.org/venues/venues/hq-visitor-centre/\">Conference centre</a> of <a href=\"http://heritagemalta.org/museums-sites/hagar-qim-temples/\">Ħaġiar Qim</a>, while Malta is hosting the EU presidency. A high-level strategy meeting, it was primarily targeted at policymakers of EU member states as a means to raise awareness about what Europeana does in culture and education, and how it can help them in their own work. The purpose was to build on the ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">Europeana for Education Policy Recommendations</a>’ designed in May 2015 during the Italian Presidency of the EU, and more specifically ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Education%20and%20Learning%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\">Recommendation II. Prioritise the provision of ‘Fit for Education and Learning’ content by cultural heritage institutions and ministries</a>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understanding migration with digital cultural heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our main objective was to come up with concrete suggestions on how cultural heritage institutions and ministries of culture can actively help educate school kids - and more broadly European citizens - about migration, building on ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Education%20and%20Learning%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\">Recommendation II</a>’. Progress and reflection on the Italian and Latvian presidencies events (2014/2015), facilitated by the Europeana Foundation, <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> and <a href=\"http://euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a> were also evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/malta1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Strategy meeting “Migration and culture: how can our past educate our present”.</em> <em>CCby; Photographer, Sebastiaan Ter Burg</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Outcomes and recommendations will help us inform Europeana’s future #AllezCulture campaign focused on migration which will run during the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/working-towards-the-2018-european-year-of-cultural-heritage\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>. The next steps will involve the announcement of a set of implementable actions for stakeholders by September 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Highlights</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get there, the event gathered 40 participants from the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/first-meeting-european-commissions-expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\" target=\"_blank\">Expert Group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana</a> (DCHE) group and European Ministries of Culture and Education.

        body: "<p>A report out last week lists the world’s 20 most visited museums in 2016, with nine of them based in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Louvre is Europe’s highest entry, third behind the National Museum of China in Beijing and the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC. The other entries from Europe are the British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern and Natural History Museum in London, Vatican Museums in Vatican City, the State Hermitage in St Petersburg, Reina Sofía in Madrid and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report says that 2016 was a record-breaking year for museums worldwide, with over 108 million attendees, beating the previous yearly record by over one million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Top 20 museums worldwide, 2016\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/emea-museums.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 424px;\"><br><em>Top 20 Museums Worldwide. <a href=\"http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf\">Theme Index and Museum Index 2016 Global Attractions Attendance Report</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/TEA_235_103719_170601.pdf\">Theme Index and Museum Index 2016 Global Attractions Attendance Report</a> comes from the <a href=\"http://www.teaconnect.org/\">Themed Entertainment Association</a> (TEA) and the economics practice at <a href=\"http://www.aecom.com/\">global infrastructure services company AECOM</a>. It claims to be the definitive annual attendance study for the themed entertainment and museum industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"la Liberte guidant le peuple, Le Louvre\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/2063621-fra-280-009.jpeg\" style=\"width: 625px; height: 499px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2063621/FRA_280_009.html\">la Liberté guidant le peuple</a>.

The report reflects on issues we’re all familiar with - museums have been through a turbulent time recently, with recession, government funding cuts and ever-changing technology and audience demands leading to many adjustments, often very innovative ones. As the report says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>‘We have seen [museums] become more directly competitive for the leisure and family audience, and more technologically sophisticated. They have incorporated tools of themed entertainment and experience design, and embraced blockbuster exhibitions and IP storytelling. The role of the collection has likewise shifted — how it is presented, how it can be accessed. [...] A year ago, just a handful of museums were looking at VR and AR. Now, it’s pervasive — museums of all sizes are considering how to use VR either to create visitor experiences or access their collections in unique ways.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europe: a Prophecy (frontispiece)\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/2063624-uk-280-004.jpeg\" style=\"width: 396px; height: 600px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2063624/UK_280_004.html\">Europe: a Prophecy (frontispiece)</a>. http://viaf.org/viaf/54144439. <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=114621001&amp;objectid=1344764\">The British Museum</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-SA</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst this shift to technology can be exciting, the report also notes a potential danger:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>‘However, the very technology that is enabling museums to attract more visitors is also a threat to attendance, as collections and exhibits can now be accessed online from anywhere in the world.’</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>That threat is, of course, Europeana’s raison d’etre but we believe that a digital presence that leads to greater exposure is a good thing for both audiences and institutions. Read our case studies on the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Democratising%20the%20Rijksmuseum.pdf\"> Rijksmuseum</a> and a group of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Making%20Impact%20on%20a%20Small%20Budget%20-%20LSH%20Case%20Study.pdf\">Swedish museums.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Hay Wain\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/2063624-uk-280-009.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 414px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063624/UK_280_009.html\"><em>The Hay Wain</em></a><em>.

But last year, we welcomed our first submissions from some of them as part of our Europe-wide art project, Europeana 280. Masterpieces from the Louvre, the British Museum, the National Gallery and the Centre Pompidou can now be found through Europeana Collections, joining nearly 200 items from the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Biblioteca+Apostolica+Vaticana&amp;view=grid\">Vatican Museums</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Rythmes\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/2063621-fra-280-010.jpeg\" style=\"width: 469px; height: 600px;\">​<br><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2063621/FRA_280_010.html\">Rythmes</a>.

        title: 'An impact playbook for cultural heritage? This ain’t gonna be easy'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Earlier this year, Europeana and friends launched <a href=\"https://impkt.tools/\">Impkt.tools</a> (currently in beta), a community for cultural heritage professionals to learn how to understand the impact of cultural heritage. The initiative is supported by the digital heritage networks of Europe, America, Brazil, New Zealand and Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impkt.tools aims to measure and assess impact, helping the cultural heritage sector tell their stories in a way that is univocally convincing thus enabling us all to design projects that create more impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Impact methodology diagram\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/impact.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 239px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana CC BY-SA, Icons by the Noun Project</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Impkt.tool’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/impkt/the-impact-of-cultural-heritage-4a36f16cdd4e\">latest news</a>, Europeana’s Harry Verwayen discusses some of the considerations in developing a playbook that will describe and evaluate impact, providing ‘a methodology that we hope cultural innovators and the management of cultural institutions will like to use in their daily practice.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The playbook will provide a framework for thinking about questions like… ‘How do you establish what kind of impact your organization can have? And once you know what you are looking for, how do you capture that? How do you tell your story and internalize your learning points so that you will do better in the future?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/88053672\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The group is using a Theory of Change methodology, described neatly here by Nesta.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next six weeks, teaming up with <a href=\"http://www.sinzer.org/\">Sinzer</a> and 30-X, companies who have done this kind of thing before, the project will produce a beta version of the playbook. But, as Harry points out, they face some interesting design challenges along the way:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Marrying emotion and discipline - how do we bring different modes of thinking into one methodology?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Defining our point of view - circular or linear? Are we interested in assessing our current impact as an endpoint? Ir is the output of the assessment seen as input for our next round of activities?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Theorizing change - what are our outputs and outcomes? Where do we draw our accountability line?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Are we interested in social or economic impact? And what’s the difference?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>It’s a big task and as Harry says, ‘We are entering this space as passionate newbies. This has the advantage that we have a slightly naive but fresh perspective.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about the impact playbook, read Harry’s blog, <a href=\"https://medium.com/impkt/the-impact-of-cultural-heritage-4a36f16cdd4e\">The Impact of Cultural Heritage: 4 playbook design challenges (and then some)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have something to contribute, join <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017\">this LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        title: 'ENUMERATE Core Survey 4: make the case for investments in our digital activities!'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Distributed among thousands of institutions and available in 11 languages, ENUMERATE is a survey collecting information related to digitization efforts for heritage collections across Europe. As the <a href=\"https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/enumerate__core_survey_4_language_selection\">4th Core Survey</a> is open for participation until June 30, we thought you might want to know more about the learnings of the previous ones led in 2012, 2013 and 2015. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/wietske-van-den-heuvel\">Wietske van den Heuvel</a> tells us what the results say about investments in digital heritage activities so far, and what we can expect in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are these surveys trying to understand?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENUMERATE is currently the only survey that looks at the digitization efforts of cultural heritage institutions in Europe: we gather statistical informations about digitization activities, costs, access and preservation of digital heritage materials in the EU. We then use this data to understand the progress that has been made in the EU since the former ENUMERATE Core Surveys and the NUMERIC survey. Our goal is to achieve a situation in which informed decisions about national and EU policies are possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who benefits from this data?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DEN Foundation (Digital Heritage Netherlands) will analyse the data and publish a report - the raw data will also be available for download and free reuse afterwards. This is important for various stakeholders. Cultural heritage institutions can use the ENUMERATE indicators as KPIs and track their progress over the years. In the future, we would like to create a benchmarking tool, so institutions can easily compare themselves with others. Policymakers can use the data to evaluate their policies regarding digital heritage, or identify issues that need more attention. A number of ministries in Europe are very supportive of ENUMERATE. Researchers have used our data to back up their own research. For Europeana, ENUMERATE shows the potential of adding more collections: the survey is also available to institutions that have digital collections but which are not (yet) connected to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/graph1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 415px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What were some of the previous key learnings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, one of the main findings is that there is still so much to do. For example, institutions are asked to indicate how much of their collection is already digitized, still needs to be digitized and doesn’t have to be digitized. In 2015, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/enumerate/digital-heritage-indicators/digital-reproduction-of-analogue-collections\">50% still needed to be digitized</a>. This data helps to understand that preserving and opening up digital collections is never ‘finished’ as some of our policymakers want to believe. I really hope we see some progress on that!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/graph2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 397px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the current status of the investments in digital heritage activities?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/ev3-deliverable-d1.2-europeana-version1.1-public.pdf\">Core Survey 3</a>, led in 2015, we learned that the estimated average budget for digital collections is €276,471. On average, eight people are involved on a full-time basis in digital collection activities: six being paid staff and two volunteers. This figure is the same as in Core Survey 2 (2013), but the ratiowas then different, with five paid staff and three volunteers. Digital collection activities are funded by internal budgets for 88% of the institutions. About 52% of the costs are qualified as being incidental costs and 47% are structural costs. In Core Survey 3, 74% of the costs were in-house costs, and 26% out-of-pocket costs for external service providers. National public grants are available to 35% of the respondents, and 21% receive regional or local public grants. These results are very similar to the ones from Core Survey 1 and 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Has there been much progress since 2015, and are you positive about the 2017 survey results?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can’t say anything just yet, but I would like to see some progress. For instance, less than half of the institutions has a <a href=\"https://webmail.bl.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=IZD0VBgyeYYKHvV2QAWcYhlQ8a6B89Yye5ZilYZINksd0JDh36zUCA..&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fpro.europeana.eu%2fenumerate%2fdigital-heritage-indicators%2fdigitisation-policies\">written digitization policy</a>. It would also be great if more institutions published their collections on various channels, like Europeana!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All European cultural heritage institutions are encouraged to contribute to <a href=\"https://nl.surveymonkey.com/r/enumerate__core_survey_4_language_selection\">Enumerate Core Survey 4</a>: don’t forget to take part before 30 June! You can also <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/enumerate/statistics/results%20\">download reports</a> containing key findings of the first Core Surveys.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Today, 9 June 2017, is International Archives Day, and to commemorate that, we have a guest blog from Marta Musso of the Archives Portal Europe Foundation.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Revolution is often placed in an historical sequence after the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. While its overall impact on economies and human lives is arguably not as radical as the other two main human revolutions, there is one field in which the Digital Revolution has dramatically transformed things forever: archival institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Revolution has brought about the Information Age - and archives are a primary resource of information. There is perhaps no other field that is facing as many challenges as archives since the arrival of personal computers and the internet: from the enormous problem of preserving digital-born sources to archiving the World Wide Web, from digitization to data migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the Digital Age is also unquestionably the greatest way for archives and researchers to advance in their practice. The possibility of creating networks, the new tools for research (just think of Optical Character Recognition), the growing indexing standardization, interactive maps, just to mention a few. The new approaches made possible by the Digital Revolution are finally unleashing the capacity of archives to organize and make available human knowledge – especially when archival institutions come together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with these important premises that in 2009, archivists from all over Europe met to start a very ambitious project: the harmonization and digitization of all European archives in one single repository, available online. Over the years, they have worked to create what is now the largest online archive catalogues repository in the world: the <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net\">Archives Portal Europe</a>, or APE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Archives Portal Europe\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/screen-shot-2017-06-08-at-20.13.50.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 175px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The portal allows people to search thousands of archival collections from all over the world, through a simple Google-like query using keywords. This makes it easy and intuitive even for people who are unfamiliar with archival records. Furthermore, it supports multilingual search, running one query in many languages at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APE is currently standing at 255 million records, but the number is growing constantly. Several hundred institutions from more than 30 countries have uploaded their holdings into the portal, and thousands more are involved in the project. The final aim is to include any archive that holds records related to European heritage – that is to say, potentially any archive in the world. Furthermore, the portal acts as a data aggregator for Europeana, contributing historical records to its wider artefacts preservation project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"APE Network\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/screen-shot-2017-06-08-at-20.14.43.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 508px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot from APE video, graphic by Acting Out, in Turin.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2015, APE has been managed by the Archives Portal Europe Foundation (APEF), an independent and self-funded institution based in the Netherlands that coordinates the work of all who are involved in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APEF is constantly seeking new collaborations. The more institutions participating in Archives Portal Europe, the more the digital landscape of European archives will grow and diversify, and the more content will become available for scholars, researchers, and anyone willing to discover European history. Even more importantly, the heritages and cultures of more and more European archival institutions will be preserved and passed on to the new digital generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any institution interested in uploading their holding to the portal can get in touch with the Governing Board (<a href=\"mailto:president@archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu\">president@archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu</a>). Participation is completely free of charge, and it allows them to connect with institutions from all over the world (the <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/directory\">updated list</a> is available on the website) and to be part of a project that is making archival research on a worldwide scale as easy as Googling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu\">www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu</a> and our <a href=\"http://wiki.archivesportaleurope.net/index.php/Main_Page\">Wiki page</a> for the technical information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUsDb0FCn2o\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p>Thanks to the digitisation efforts of our partners, there are many classic books (such as Don Quixote, Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina...) you can<a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2014/01/europeana-your-ebook-library/\"> find on Europeana and read online for free</a>. For the past 5 months, we have been paying tribute to some of them on social media as part of #AllezLiterature, our latest campaign dedicated to the written word. As we are now wrapping up the campaign and learning from its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/allezliterature-pays-a-social-media-tribute-to-world-book-day\">challenges</a>, we take a look at other inspiring initiatives around the world making digital books and texts available for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/bovary.jpg\" style=\"width: 223px; height: 359px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/bovary2.jpg\" style=\"width: 225px; height: 353px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:right\"><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/record/9200103/ark__12148_btv1b8626154v.html\"><i><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Image: Madame Bovary,Gustave Flaubert, BNF, Public Domain</span></i></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For educators and students…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, the Library of Congress announced that it will make 25 million records from its catalogue available to download for free <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/\">on their website</a> and on<a href=\"http://www.data.org\"> data.org</a>. This is the Library’s largest release of records in its history, including 519,429 eBooks (although some are only available to users on campus). Previously accessible through a paid subscription, these resources spanning 45 years are now available to anyone for cultural, historical or literary research. Making them easily accessible and downloadable for free encourages use of the data for the formation of new knowledge.<em> ‘The Library of Congress is our nation’s monument to knowledge and we need to make sure the doors are open wide for everyone, not just physically but digitally too’</em>, says Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, President Obama and <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">the Digital Public Library of America</a> launched the<a href=\"http://openebooks.net/\"> Open eBooks programme</a> to provide students from low-income families across the US with greater access to eBooks. Gathering thousands of titles, this initiative included open content from the DPLA’s extensive catalogue, but also top-selling books in copyright donated by publishers (such as Bloomsbury, Hachette, Penguin Random House) representing $250 millions in donations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/openebooks.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:right\"><a href=\"http://openebooks.net/\"><i><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\">Image: OPEN eBOOKS homepage </span></i></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open access repositories from publishers are committed to establishing a world-class digital learning environment.<a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-press/browse-books\"> UCL Press</a>, for instance, believes in <em>‘the opportunity to revolutionise how – and how widely – knowledge is disseminated’</em>. They allow people to browse for books, journals and teaching materials (mostly in the field of scientific publications), regardless of their ability to pay. In May, they invited UCL academics to submit textbook proposals for any discipline taught at UCL in order to expand their textbook publishing programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>… art lovers...</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.guggenheim.org/\">New York’s Guggenheim Museum</a> also made more than 200 digitized art books, exhibition catalogues and monographs available to download in PDF and ePub formats. They are now available on the<a href=\"https://archive.org/\"> Internet Archive</a>, where people can read about art movements, learn more about artists, or simply look at the images in high quality. Not ideal for coffee table book lovers - but really spot on for everyone researching art history. The Guggenheim isn’t the first American museum to make their archive more accessible online: <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/\">the Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> and <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/publications/virtuallibrary/\">The Getty’s virtual library </a>have done the same in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>… and even children!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In France, about 4,500 eBooks in ePub format are available to download on <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr\">Gallica</a>, the digital library project by the National Library of France (BNF). But these resources are not all aimed at experienced readers: they also include children’s books. Recently, the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gallicadabra/id1196195810?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">Gallicadabra app </a>has been launched for kids to discover 30 stories from literary heritage which are no longer available in a printed form. From tales to illustrated books, these texts (all focusing on animals) are accompanied by a short presentation placing them back in their creation context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While bricks-and-mortar museums and libraries work with publishers and technology partners to release content electronically, digital projects are making public domain collections available online too. <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/\">Project Gutenberg</a> offers 54,000 free eBooks in English but also French, German, Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Finnish... and 40 other languages. Similarly, <a href=\"http://runeberg.org/\">Project Runeberg</a> gathers free electronic editions of classic Scandinavian literature, and the online library <a href=\"http://runivers.ru/\">Runivers</a> provides free access to books and journals from major Russian libraries and state archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has your institution made any books available for download? What feedback did you get from it? Let us know your thoughts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Copyright reform: the IMCO committee accepts changes advocated by Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Last week marked a very positive milestone for cultural heritage institutions digitizing their collections. As<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/copyright-advocacy-update-smoke-signals-from-the-european-parliament\"> we recently reported</a>, four Committees of the European Parliament are now dealing with their response to Commission's copyright reform, which includes addressing the improvements that the Europeana Network has been advocating for. On 7 June, the first of these committees voted on these suggested changes. This vote in the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee (IMCO) was eagerly anticipated: it provides a first indication that our efforts, and those undertaken by our partners from library associations and cultural heritage institutions, are starting to pay off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A broad exception for internal reproductions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of the mandatory preservation exception proposed in Article 5 of the Commission's proposal has been significantly broadened by amendments voted by the members of the IMCO committee: where the original proposal introduced an exception to the reproduction right that would allow cultural heritage institutions to make copies of works in their collections ’for the sole purpose of preservation’, the IMCO opinion proposes that cultural heritage institutions should be allowed</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>… to make copies of any works or other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections, in any format or medium, to the extent necessary for such reproduction, for the purpose of, individually or collaboratively with others, carrying out their public interest mission in preservation, research, culture, education and teaching.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allowing all internal reproductions that are in line with the institution’s public interest mission makes the exception much more useful and future-proof. In addition, it now allows digitization not only by individual institutions themselves, but also in the context of partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>A more comprehensive solution for access to out-of-commerce works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/a-better-solution-to-making-out-of-commerce-works-available-online\">in line with what we have argued for in the past</a>, the Commission's proposal for access has been significantly improved by the opinion of the IMCO committee. Through a broad compromise supported by all major political groups, the Committee voted for the addition of a fall back exception that will kick in when the licensing mechanism proposed by the Commission does not provide a workable solution. This modification of the Commission's proposal is in line <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/a-better-solution-to-making-out-of-commerce-works-available-online\">with what we have argued for in the past</a> and will ensure that the directive will provide a solution that can work for all types of collections and in all EU countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMCO opinion also contains a number of smaller improvements to the language of the licensing mechanism initially proposed by the Commission that are aimed at making these licenses easier to use. Taken together, these changes proposed by IMCO would fix the most important flaws in the Commission's proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protection for the Public Domain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the IMCO committee voted for the addition of a provision that requires EU countries to...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>recognize that once a work is in the public domain [...], faithful reproductions in full or in part of that work [...] including digitisation, shall equally not be subject to copyright or related rights.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This addition to the directive represents a welcome intervention to end the practice of claiming copyright over digitization of public domain artworks <a href=\"http://outofcopyright.eu/semi-automated-reproduction/\">that is currently enabled by the copyright laws of a number of EU member states</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The way forward</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with the forthcoming opinions of the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/cult/home.html\">CULT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/itre/home.html\">ITRE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/home.html\">LIBE</a> committees* of the European Parliament, the opinion now adopted by the IMCO committee will feed its way into the deliberations of the leading JURI committee. They will vote on the final position of the European Parliament after the summer. As such it represents a small but important step in the legislative process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the perspective of Europeana and Europe's cultural heritage institutions, it is encouraging to see that the issues we had raised with the Commission's proposal have not only been taken up by members of Parliament, but that we have managed to mobilize support across all political groups for the positions that we had brought forward. It is now up to all of us to build on these initial successes and make sure that the European Parliament as a whole will back a set of copyright rules that allows Europe's cultural heritage institutions to take their place in the digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/fixing-copyright-for-education-with-communia#sthash.WVqkcE73.dpuf\">consensus driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organizations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>* CULT: Culture and Education; LIBE: Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs; ITRE: Industry, Research and Energy</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'The British Library hosts launch of The Copyright Cortex'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Ronan Deazley, the British Library.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the British Library hosts the launch of <a href=\"http://www.copyrightcortex.org\">The Copyright Cortex</a>, a new online, open access, resource dedicated to copyright and digital cultural heritage. The Copyright Cortex has been developed to provide libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions with information and expert commentary on how copyright law affects the creation, management and use of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Welcome to the Copyright Cortex\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/copyright-cortex.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by <a href=\"http://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/ronan-deazley(55f8219d-d9b4-4192-ad7e-f10e5a7d7d0a).html\">Ronan Deazley</a>, <a href=\"http://staffprofiles.bournemouth.ac.uk/display/copdenkamp\">Claudy Op den Kamp</a>, <a href=\"http://www.create.ac.uk/team/create-pgrs/victoria/\">Victoria Stobo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.create.ac.uk/team/create-pgrs/andrea/\">Andrea Wallace</a>, The Copyright Cortex has two main features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, the Cortex is a catalogue. It brings together a wide range of material relating to copyright and digital cultural heritage: scholarly publications, practical guidance, policy documentation, and real-world case studies. The Cortex brings this material into one digital space, organized under three broadly defined headings: <a href=\"https://copyrightcortex.org/research\">Research</a>, <a href=\"https://copyrightcortex.org/tools-resources\">Tools &amp; Resources</a>, and <a href=\"https://copyrightcortex.org/policy-evidence\">Policy &amp; Evidence.</a> At present, open content is prioritized, including only catalogue material that is publicly accessible online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Copyright Cortex screenshot\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/copyright-cortex-screenshot.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 319px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Content is made available primarily through links to the original material. The Cortex does not host third-party content, apart from some national and European policy consultations for which we have gathered together material in the public interest. Whenever evidence submitted to these consultations is made available online, it is generally only available for a short period of time. We want to ensure these materials remain publicly available in the longer term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, accompanying the catalogue is an open access text for cultural heritage practitioners: <a href=\"https://copyrightcortex.org/copyright-101\">Copyright and Digital Cultural Heritage</a>. This resource is free to read online, and free to download. When complete (10 of 15 planned chapters are currently available), it will provide a comprehensive introduction to copyright law for UK-based memory institutions, focussing specifically on how copyright impacts access to and use of digital cultural heritage materials within and across national borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, The Copyright Cortex does more than comment on and collate information about copyright and digital cultural heritage. It also celebrates and promotes the use of open content and collections. Catalogue entries are illustrated with images from collections that have been made openly available by cultural heritage institutions around the world. Images are randomly allocated to catalogue cards, so every time you visit your experience will be different. And, like the use of images, the choice of typeface celebrates open content. The principal typeface used for Cortex content is Cooper Hewitt, an <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/open-source-at-cooper-hewitt/cooper-hewitt-the-typeface-by-chester-jenkins/\">open source typeface</a> designed by Chester Jenkins and commissioned by the Cooper Hewitt museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s launch marks the start of a process, not an endpoint. We will continue to develop and enhance the content and functionality of the Copyright Cortex over many years to come. If you have ideas or suggestions for material that should feature in the Cortex, we would love to hear from you. You can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@copyrightcortex.org\">info@copyrightcortex.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.snfcc.org/about/vision/the-national-library-of-greece/\">The National Library of Greece</a> (NLG) is undergoing a major transformation. After having been in a dormant state for two decades for various reasons, it is now moving to a new majestic home at the seaside of Athens thanks to a 600 millions Euros donation by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. This architectural gem is designed by the renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, and will house the National Opera together with the National Library in a 210.000m2 cultural park. A destination worth visiting on the first opportunity!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/11-snf-yiorgis-yerolymbos.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 403px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The National Library of Greece ©SNF-Yiorgis Yerolymbos</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transitioning to open principles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this transition project, I am coordinating the development of the NLG’s digital services. The national web archive, a new digital repository, a new website, a digital legal deposit platform, a new libraries’ union catalogue and a platform for lending e-books are some of the most important digital projects currently running in the context of this transition. With 40 projects in total, this shift aims to modernise the library services towards 21st century standards within a very short space of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the far-seeing support of the Library’s Director General, Mr Filippos Tsimpoglou, we have been able to integrate the full stack of ‘open principles’ in the design of the digital services, and in particular of the digital repository: open architecture and protocols, open software, open data and open content. We tried to ensure sustainability of the service and maximum reusability of the content for the benefit of all users. These principles would probably have been out of the picture if Europeana hadn’t been a catalyst for participatory digital culture among cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/05-snfcc-nikos-karanikolas.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The National Library of Greece ©SNFCC-Nikos Karanikolas</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My love story with Europeana </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve worked with many of you through Europeana. I consider myself a proper ‘Europeana kid’ and I can’t help being emotional when I speak about Europeana... I was in the first discussions when a name was sought for the new pilot service, I witnessed the initial collapse when it was first presented to the Council of Ministers of Culture in Brussels, following an unexpected high traffic at the launch of the portal, and I left when 20 millions of data records were released under a CC0 license for the public to use freely… a true revolution in digital culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in between, what a journey! Over the six years that I worked for Europeana, I was involved in or I managed over 20 European projects, and I followed innovations in every aspect of digital culture. I saw the introduction of new standards making culture more discoverable, usable and interconnected like <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">EDM</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/iiif-adoption-by-europeana-future-perspectives-for-the-network-1\">IIIF</a>. I participated in the development of the tools to reinforce Open Culture, such as the Public Domain Mark, and in campaigns to engage users with culture, including <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, the GLAM-wiki hackathons and the edit-a-thons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, I saw a movement of museums, libraries and archives that celebrate open participation in culture grow from a few dozens to a few thousands. This movement is made of highly knowledgeable people who work with skill and passion on technology, standards, law and sustainability, in order to make this happen. I feel very lucky to be part of this movement and I think that we owe a lot to Europeana for having provided a home for us all, the digital cultural heritage commoners.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>On 22 and 23 June, the Europeana Transcribathon Campus took place at the Berlin State Library, gathering people from across Europe to enrich the Europeana 1914-1918 digital archive. Over two days, teams from three generations (participants were 15 to 83 years old) coming from Germany, UK, France, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Romania and even Syria competed with each other to digitally transcribe as many World War One documents as possible, and link them to other historical sources. On the second day, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-transcribathon-campus-2017\">workshops</a> invited the audience to share their experiences about transcription, data enrichment and the linking of various historical sources. Karl Pineau from France was crowned the ‘overall individual winner’ after he completed over 100 French documents with a staggering 45,855 characters in total (<a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/transcribathon/featured/berlin2017/\">see detailed results about all the winners</a>). We asked him to tell us about the experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/222813223\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Why did you want to get involved in the Transcribathon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I discovered the Transcribathon via my work: my job is to build a collaborative transcription platform for the French national archives and the archives of the Yvelines, and we are really interested in the work achieved by the Transcribathon. We focus on wills by French soldiers from World War One, and specifically on their way of speaking about death, so both our projects are very similar. But I am also involved on a personal level, and transcribe documents from World War One with my girlfriend. It is really interesting to follow life stories of individual characters (soldiers, most of the time). Once you start transcribing a document, you want to get to the end to know the whole story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What were the biggest challenges transcribing analogue data into digital data?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcribing documents from the 20th century is actually not that complicated. The handwriting is usually recognizable and most of the time even more readable than nowadays! The most challenging part would be the indexation. It is necessary to specify the locations, the languages or the topics of a document to help index it. Sometimes, it can be hard to identify the different places described, because the document is not specific enough. Although I think people shouldn’t take it as a challenge, but more as an opportunity to discover new stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-06/35446547086-fae6e945a0-z.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sebastiaan ter Burg, CC BY. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ter-burg/sets/72157683310707250\">See more pictures of the event here </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What did you enjoy about the collaborative aspect of the event?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with many cultural heritage collaborative projects, transcription is mostly a solitary job which requires a strong focus on the document and the story. But the Transcribathon events allow you to meet people with similar hobbies, and to share experiences or feedback. It is also a good way for people who have never done transcription to discover it with the help of experienced users. Of course, the competition aspect is challenging, and it is nice to be rewarded, but meeting people is more about sharing experiences than competing against each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Among the hundreds of French documents you transcribed, are there any stories that really struck you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a complicated question! Each document is the story of a man who took part in the war, and sometimes even died, so it would be hard to say that a document didn’t strike me. If I should pick two, the first would be the story of a former French prisoner in a German camp near Berlin (Zossen) who wanted to write about prisoners’ life in camps.There is a striking moment when he explains that people don’t understand how a prisoner’s life could be hard when so many soldiers died at the front. There is also a book of poems written by a soldier before and during the war. There are almost 40 poems over 100 pages, most of them being love stories. He also drew pictures to illustrate his characters. But he never mentioned the war or the front: writing was probably a way for him to escape. The sad part is that he died during this war. His name was Léon Frédéric Boulin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why would you recommend taking part in Transcribathons?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a way to understand what war is, not from an historical point of view but from a human perspective. And it can also help research in digital humanities, and allow digital cultural heritage institutions to provide better content. There is no existing technology that reads handwritten texts, and we need help from the public to make them searchable and usable by researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We would like to thank all speakers involved for their <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-transcribathon-campus-2017\">presentations on the second day of the event</a>: Reinhard Altenhöner (Berlin State Library) and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry Verwayen</a> (Europeana Foundation) for their welcoming words, but also Frank Drauschke (Facts &amp; File</em>s<em>) who presented the future plans of Europeana 1914-1918, and Clemens Neudecker of Europeana Newspapers; <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/barbara-fischer\">Barbara Fischer </a>(Wikimedia Germany) who talked about the Wikisource/Wikidata transcription community; <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/stephan-bartholmei\">Stephan Bartholmei </a>(German Digital Library) who outlined the importance of data enrichment for the German Digital Library; and Barbara Denicolo (University of Innsbruck) who introduced the online transcription tool Transkribus.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-transcribathon-campus-2017\">workshops agenda here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ter-burg/sets/72157683310707250\">more pictures of the event here</a>.</p>\r\n</div>"

        title: 'Wrapping up #AllezLiterature: successes and lessons from our Europe-wide campaign dedicated to the written word'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>From February to July, we have been highlighting textual resources on Europeana, with a special focus on<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/europeana-launches-love-transcribathon-to-crowdsource-ww1-love-stories-for-valentine-s-day\"> love letters</a> (on the occasion on Valentine’s Day), <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/europe-s-favourite-lines-online-celebrate-world-poetry-day-with-europeana\">poems</a> (World Poetry Day), and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/europeana-launches-a-social-media-tribute-to-world-book-day-1\">books that have marked literature</a> across Europe (World Book Day). We would like to thank all our partners’ institutions for their contribution, and share this story of this latest collaboration. Here are a few highlights of the result of our work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Collaborating with institutions across Europe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate the written word in all its forms and languages, we reached out to libraries and archives across Europe and invited them to submit texts that we could share online in a literary tour of Europe. 19 institutions from 17 countries got involved, selecting content from their own collections, and providing either images of poems (including <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200575/webclient_DeliveryManager_application_DIRECTLINK_custom_att_2_simple_viewer_pid_2862370_search_terms__panel_pp_issue_2862370_page_21.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A9200575%2A\">D'Noiecht</a></em>, from <em>E' Schrek ob de' Lezeburger Parnassus </em>by Antoine Meyer), or books made available to download as PDFs (such as<em> <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/9200573/107150023.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A9200573%2A\">The Lady of the Lake</a> </em>by Walter Scott). From Homer to Gustave Flaubert and Kafka, 105 works provided were usable in the campaign, with a particularly strong involvement from the Eastern European Libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200575/webclient_DeliveryManager_application_DIRECTLINK_custom_att_2_simple_viewer_pid_2862370_search_terms__panel_pp_issue_2862370_page_21.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A9200575%2A\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/eschrek.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 598px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Engaging with users online</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mostly led on social media, the campaign invited users to interact with the content, taking part in literary quizzes or sharing opening lines from famous books using the #AllezLiterature hashtag. These activities received an encouraging response from users: there were 354 tweets from 202 contributors which reached over 600,000 people. Among the most popular ones,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu/status/875726269513703424\"> a tweet</a> linking to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000126244200.html\">Ulysses by James Joyce</a> was retweeted 47 times, and liked 28 times, reaching 45,047 people. On Facebook, the posts reached 596,413 people, with 23,263 users engaging with the content. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana/photos/a.209570118667.132127.10261403667/10154762404893668/?type=3&amp;theater\">#OnThisDay Facebook post</a> remembering the birth of Balzac received 1.3K likes, and was shared more than 120 times!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Europeana/photos/a.209570118667.132127.10261403667/10154762404893668/?type=3&amp;theater\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/balzaconthisday.jpg\" style=\"width: 493px; height: 465px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside social media activities, two Transcribathon competitions were also organised online to encourage people to digitally transcribe handwritten documents from World War One - specifically love letters (on the occasion of Valentine’s Day) and poems (for World Poetry Day). Both challenges were a success, with over 700 transcribers taking part, and more than 4,000 documents completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learning from the challenges</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are sharing the success of #AllezLiterature, we are also learning our lessons for future campaigns. The main issue we encountered, because of the short time span of the campaign, was the uneven level of quality of the content submitted. We were hoping to get resources that could be used easily, but the data quality of the material wasn’t always up to the standard needed for an online campaign, and sometimes had to be reworked. Practically speaking, this means that 99 works selected by 8 institutions (about half of the content submitted) were unfortunately not usable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The time frame was also problematic for content that wasn’t already in Europeana - such as <a href=\"https://portal.dnb.de/bookviewer/view/103252989X#page/n3/mode/1up\">Erste Gedichte by Rainer Maria Rilke</a> submitted by the German National Library. In similar cases, several libraries had to update the material to meet the requirements. Going forward with short leads in time for future campaigns, we should focus on works that are already part of the database, or set a clear deadline by when they need to be submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another difficulty was that content selected by the libraries did not always include the direct link to the digitized object (edm:isShownBy) for users to download it, as some institutions had technical limitations in their databases. This has been the case, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/2021718/items_show_72.html\">for the first book of literature to be printed in Cyprus</a>. And in terms of copyright, selected works didn’t necessarily have an open licence to be reused, for example <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064203/context_kapcsoskonyv.html?l%5Bp%5D%5Bq%5D=proxy_dc_creator%3AArany+J%C3%A1nos&amp;l%5Br%5D=38&amp;l%5Bt%5D=166&amp;q=proxy_dc_creator%3AArany+J%C3%A1nos\">this manuscript by the Petőfi Literary Museum in Hungary</a>. Despite the downside of these challenges, the positive is that many institutions opened up the material for the campaign, and as a consequence, we now have more open material in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were you part of the #AllezLiterature campaign? Please share your feedback on the campaign with us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>I have been working in the library field for a long time, and my roles always had to do with international co-operation, partnerships and engaging communities. At present, I am coordinating the International Marketing Department of the Romanian Academy Library, after many years as an exchange librarian with the the Romanian Academy. Of course, I am very happy that some of the most beautiful collections of the<a href=\"http://www.biblacad.ro/\"> Romanian Academy Library</a> can be found in<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=romania&amp;q=romanian+academy+library\"> European</a>a. But when I started collaborating with Europeana in 2012, I didn’t think it would also transform my very own life!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Engaging communities: the power of the crowd</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the four Europeana 1914-1918 crowdsourcing campaigns I coordinated in Romania, I witnessed the power the project had in engaging people - which is amazing for a former socialist country where the public involvement in community projects is still very low! From Prince Radu (the first contributor in Romania) to groups of teenagers, I have been extremely moved by the enthusiasm people showed in contributing to this impressive digital archive. It is hard to forget that a centenarian woke up at 5am to be sure he would be on time to tell his WWI family story, or the efforts by old people who travelled seven hours by train for the same purpose. During these collection days, I have also been approached by college teachers who wanted to develop some educational events and programs using the digital archive. Together, we have since organized a few workshops as part of the ‘School otherwise week’ edition of 2014 and 2015 (you can read about these events in the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/romanian-students-engage-with-europeana-wwi-content\"> blog</a>). Among many other, Europeana 1914-1918 campaigns also revealed the fascinating story of the only military enrolled nun in Romania,<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020601/contributions_15707.html?q=mina+hociota\"> Sister Mina Hociota</a>, whose life was unknown to the general public in the communist times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/cristina.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 343px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Objects and documents collected during Europeana1914-1918 roadshows in Romania</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enabling inter-generational discussions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Europeana 1989 project came to Romania, I remembered those sad days of December 1989 when my friend Andra, with whom I used to play during my childhood, died tragically. On 21 of December, she was shot in the head and the military tanks crushed her body. In those terrible days, I hadn’t been able to bring decent flowers to her funeral. But Europeana enabled me to tell<a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#!photos/index/\"> her story</a> a quarter of a century later, and also gathers many more stories of people who died young fighting for their freedom. With an entire digitization team of young people who didn’t know anything about the events of December 1989 or the communist times, the Europeana1989 campaign in Bucharest has been a very useful ‘inter-generational conversation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/minahociota.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 472px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020601/contributions_15707.html?q=mina+hociota\">Sister Mina Hociota</a> as a nun and in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020601/contributions_21112.html?q=mina+hociota\">military uniform</a>, Europeana1914-1918, public domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A transformative experience </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, collaborating on these projects was a fascinating journey and a necessary remembering of our recent communist history. But it was also an opportunity to put my creativity and other personal skills at work! I am now a big fan of crowdsourcing projects: being passionate about history, I got deeply involved as volunteer in cultural heritage projects developed by local associations. It has been quite a long trip for me, but the journey has just started and many interesting experiences and activities are to follow, especially with the upcoming 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana it not only about wonderful paintings or outstanding cultural heritage items. It is also about understanding our common past, learning how we can (re)discover shared values, and reinforcing the sense of belonging to Europe. Together with my Europeana1914-1918 family, involving the Romanian Academy’s research institutes, our network members and our local communities, I shall continue this wonderful journey, and do my best to promote Europeana as a public engagement space.</p>"

        intro: "<p>The production of high quality 3D models is still very demanding, time-consuming and expensive.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As a multimedia process, the e-documentation of Cultural Heritage assets is a great challenge: it addresses the digital representation of the shape, appearance and conservation condition of the cultural objects expected to become 3D models. The production of high quality 3D models is still very demanding, time-consuming and expensive. This is partly because the modelling is carried out for individual objects rather than for entire collections, but also because the formats provided in digital reconstructions are often not interoperable, which means they can’t be easily accessed, reused or preserved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Towards new perspectives and understandings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D reconstructions should progress beyond current levels to provide the necessary semantic information needed by researchers and creatives. For these reasons, a Task Force led by Dr. Marinos Ioannides, from Cyprus University of Technology, will develop standard guidelines and formats intended for cultural heritage communities. These will cover semantically-aware 3D objects with a view to improve their archiving, retrieval, reusability and sustainability enriching the geometrical structure(s) with related knowledge, taking into account the range of devices, models and software applications involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/2064106/Museu_ProvidedCHO_PROBADO_3D__9063.html?q=3D\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/3d.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 500px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/2064106/Museu_ProvidedCHO_PROBADO_3D__9063.html?q=3D\"><em>Luster LL1693 - 3D model for interior 3d visualization, CCO</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improving 3D objects in the framework of Europeana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force intends to make an important contribution to improving Europeana Data Quality in the area of 3D Assets and standardization (CEN). Among the expected outcomes of the Task Force are a scope determination for both tangible objects and related intangible cultural issues, as well as recommendations for the retrieval, publishing, linking and use of 3D objects in the framework of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first meeting of the Task Force last May in Olimje, Slovenia, the participants gave an overview of the issues currently existing in the area of 3D Cultural Heritage documentation. A fruitful discussion followed, covering the current 3D formats, geometrical accuracy), data quality, texture, preservation records, authentication (original copy or duplicates), and the intangible aspect (ie: manufacturing/production technology). Another important question was raised: who, in Europe and in the world, is interested to use Europeana’s 3D content? What is the main objective of harvesting 3D content to Europeana? A list of potential possible users was drawn up as a result of the meeting, which will be reviewed and extended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We need your input!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another outcome was the creation of a survey including all the questions raised during the meeting, which is currently distributed it among the members of the Task Force Group for their final review. We need your input! We are asking professionals in Europe for their participation: do you have any advice regarding the current and future e-documentation of 3D Cultural Heritage objects? We are inviting you to take this 15 minutes long survey available<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScV7ScqJdvtPOEa1x0x7WhyRjByHYzQO-N1IVRdFsfklt9vEQ/viewform\"> here</a>. The results will be presented during the next physical meeting of the group, and published before the end of 2017 on the channels of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu\">Europeana Professional</a>, <a href=\"http://cipa.icomos.org\">CIPA</a> (Comité International de Photogrammétrie Architecturale), <a href=\"http://digitalheritagelab.eu/dhrlab/lab-overview\">Digital Heritage Research Lab</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.digitale-rekonstruktion.info/uber-uns/\">Digitale Rekonstruktion</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p><strong>The second Members Council (MC) meeting of the year took place on 6 and 7 July in the beautiful building of <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/\">National Gallery of Denmark</a> in Copenhagen. The Council had the great pleasure to welcome Ms. <a href=\"http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;nodeID=3426467&amp;personID=444743\">Catherine Magnant</a> as a representative of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/\">European Commission’s DG Education and Culture</a>, responsible for organisation of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/european-year-cultural-heritage-2018_en\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/large.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 405px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/explore/galleries/european-landscapes-and-landmarks#lg=1&amp;slide=26\"><em>Copenhagen Instituut, Royal Museums Greenwich, CC BY-NC</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Magnant, who is heading the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/photo/photoDetails.cfm?ref=P-034264/00-07&amp;sitelang=EN&amp;refPhoto=P034264/00-07#0\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage Task Force</a>, presented the Commission’s plans to mobilise European citizens throughout 2018 through a series of projects, events, campaigns and involved actors. On behalf of the Commission, she expressed a strong interest in actively cooperating with Europeana Network Association, emphasizing that “cultural heritage is a pivotal component of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, which represents not only a legacy from the past, but also a resource for our future”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors, who were asked to feedback on the organisation and design of the Year, expressed a strong enthusiasm for the project. They put forward many ideas about the legacy and campaign format, and advised on how to best approach various target audiences such as the 15-20 age-group, and the professionals. Reflecting on what message to get across different European countries, they also challenged some of the core particularities that represent Europe such as national and cultural diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>State of the art for Europeana Network Association </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting then addressed other topics such as Members Council’s engagement, the Association budget, Europeana Business plan 2018, the newly-launched <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/let-s-make-next-key-decisions-together-renew-your-membership\">Membership Campaign 2017</a>, and other relevant governance matters. The Councillors also endorsed a new Joint Europeana Aspiration together with the Europeana Office and Foundation Approach statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day evolved around the overview of the Association’s existing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces\">Task Forces</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups\">Working Groups</a>. The MC went through the approval process of Task Force proposals and evaluated the final recommendations of recently ended Task Forces. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups/library-working-group\">Library </a>and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups/allezculture-working-group\">#AllezCulture</a> Working Groups presented their work progress and invited new members to join. The Councillors could also learn more about current and upcoming Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/allezculture\">#AllezCulture campaigns</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The host and Chair of the Association, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, wrapped-up the meeting by thanking the Council for participating and contributing to a very interactive and fruitful event. The presentations held during these two days can be found on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&amp;q=Europeana+Members+Council+Meeting%2C+Copenhagen\">Europeana Slideshare</a> and the minutes will be published shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong><br><br>\r\nThe next meeting will take place on 5 December at the National museum of science and technology Leonardo Da Vinci in Milan, Italy, prior to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/save-the-date-europeana-agm-2017\">Europeana AGM 2017</a>. <strong>The AGM 2017 will be an opportunity to highlight the Association’s ambition to participate in the kick-off of the European Year of Cultural Heritage and in its celebration throughout 2018.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you have suggestions about how Europeana and the Network Association could actively contribute, support and amplify the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/european-year-cultural-heritage-2018_en\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>?

Our second best contributing institution <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22National+Library+of+France%22%20OR%20DATA_PROVIDER:%22Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France%22&amp;view=grid\">with more than 2 millions objects from their collections available </a><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Biblioth%C3%A8que+nationale+de+France&amp;view=grid\">on Europeana</a>, the National Library of France is actively working on the digitization on their collections. Their current exhibition merging heritage with technological advancements pays tribute to the social aspect of libraries around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An immersive journey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by the book of the same name by Alberto Manguel, ‘La Bibliothèque, la nuit’ (literally, ‘the library at night’) is an immersive exhibition which was initially presented in 2015 in Quebec by stage director Robert Lepage and his production company Ex Machina. It is currently being hosted by the National Library of France, where visitors can discover ten of the world’s most amazing libraries thanks to virtual reality. These buildings are beautiful and they also all have a story to tell. They have been selected individually for their poetic and dramaturgic potential. For each of them, a five-minute sequence was filmed in 360 degrees, unveiling some of the unique stories of the archives: the viewer can step inside these legendary buildings, learn about their past, and explore places that they might not be able to physically visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/biblanuit1.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-830b54ac-794a-aae0-abd6-12614a856563\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Alberto Manguel - Robert Lepage / Ex Machina, Une exposition conçue et réalisée par Ex Machina, d’après une idée originale de Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, © Stéphane Bourgeois</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From Sarajevo to Ottawa to the Nautilus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the National Library of France, you can explore the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve in Paris (which is actually open at night!) and wander among the Admont Abbey Library in Austria, the world’s largest monastic library known for its Baroque architecture, before heading to Sarajevo’s national library, hosted in the historic City Hall which recently reopened 22 years after it was destroyed during the Bosnian War. Visitors can also discover <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=University+of+Copenhagen%3B+Denmark&amp;view=grid\">Copenhagen University Library</a>, the oldest library in Denmark, which is still open to the public although books can’t be borrowed or viewed anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this ambitious journey goes way beyond Europe. In America, it takes people to the Library of Congress, which is the largest library of the world, the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=University+of+Ottawa+(archive.org)&amp;view=grid\">Library of Parliament in Ottawa</a>, mostly home to legal texts; and Mexico City's Biblioteca Vasconcelos, also known as ‘Megabiblioteca’. The exhibition also recreates the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, located on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt, the Buddhist library in Hase-dera temple in Japan, preserving Buddha's teachings in the form of booklets, and even the Nautilus Library, inspired by Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, which contains 12,000 works of science and literature in a multitude of languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/biblanuit2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-830b54ac-794a-aae0-abd6-12614a856563\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Alberto Manguel - Robert Lepage / Ex Machina, Une exposition conçue et réalisée par Ex Machina, d’après une idée originale de Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec, © Stéphane Bourgeois</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shaping the future for libraries and archives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the National Library of France, the exhibition has been enriched with treasures from the library’s collection, giving a tangible introduction to the experience. While this virtual reality immersion focuses on the imaginary potential of libraries, whether real or imagined, with an invitation to travel across time and space, it also demonstrates the possibilities for institutions to share their collections in innovative ways, get greater exposure, and further engage with audiences anywhere in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has your institution been working on similar projects? We would love to hear the outcome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can visit the exhibition at the National Library of France from now until 13 August.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        title: 'The Metropolitan Museum of Art makes 140,000 images available on Archive.org'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>140,000 images from the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org\">Metropolitan Museum of Art </a>collections are now available on the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/metropolitanmuseumofart-gallery?and%5B%5D=collection%3A%22metropolitanmuseumofart-gallery%22\">Internet Archive</a>, the 'non-profit library of millions of free books, movies, software, music, websites, and more'. These artworks can be filtered by an infinite range of ‘Topics and subjects’, with categories spanning over 50 pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the Met has been highly committed to opening culture and sharing its collections online. In February, the world class New York museum made 375,000 images available for remix under a Creative Commons licence. In 2015, they released digital copies of 464 art books, making 'five decades of publications on art history available to read, download, and/or search for free.' And in 2014, they announced that more than 400,000 high-resolution digital images of public domain works from their collection could be downloaded for non-commercial use, and used at no charge. We asked Neal Stimler from the Met Digital Department to tell us what is driving these projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely online ?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing the collection is a fundamental aspect of The Met’s mission ‘to connect people to creativity, knowledge, and ideas.’ The Met Open Access initiative, launched 7 February 2017, helps achieve this mission by making images and data from the Museum's collection usable to the broadest possible public, making them widely available on the internet. As Ryan Merkley, CEO of Creative Commons, noted in his remarks at the Met Open Access launch event, ‘it's about advancing the human cause of equity and access for everyone to the greatest works of history.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are these resources available on Archive.org, outside of the Met’s website?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnerships enhance the discoverability and searchability of the Museum's collection, while creating opportunities to foster deeper connections. The Met’s collaboration with partners, including Creative Commons, Wikimedia communities, and other organizations help extend the impact of the Met's collection into communities eager to engage and utilize art in both familiar and new ways. Those interested in the Museum can access and engage with the collection whether or not they visit of the Museum’s three physical locations. And, access to the collection can happen on platforms outside or-as well as on-the Museum’s own website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who benefits from these resources, and how do they use them?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Met's Open Access images and data with the Creative Commons Zero designation can be used by anyone, without fee or restriction, for both commercial and non-commercial uses. This includes artists, designers, students, scholars, developers, businesses, etc. who find inspiration in the Met's 5,000 years of art. The Museum, in turn, gets to be inspired by user communities and learn from their innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you know of a successful project or achievement using these resources?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been interesting uses since launch that point to further possibilities. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdcutup\">Public Domain Cut-up Twitter Bot</a>, created by Matthew Miller, is a an example of a digital art project that uses software to cut-up, remix and collage together open access images from The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The New York Public Library to create new images using the Creative Commons Zero designation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/160fec70-c614-012f-b514-58d385a7bc34#/?uuid=510d47da-41af-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><img alt=\"Pont Neuf, Charles Meryon\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/nypl.digitalcollections.160fec70-c614-012f-b514-58d385a7bc34.001.w.jpg\" style=\"width: 311px; height: 319px;\"></a><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459736\"><img alt=\"Le Pont Neuf, by Hippolyte Petitjean\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/pontneufpoint.jpg\" style=\"width: 229px; height: 300px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PDCutup/status/885339830250594305\"><img alt=\"Public Domain Cup-Up of the Pont Neuf\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/pontneuf.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 595px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Public Domain Cut-up of Le Pont Neuf.

        body: "<p>I studied librarianship almost by accident. But considering my childhood hobby of cataloguing everything – from ancient Greek gods to Nazi criminals – maybe there was actually some logic behind my choice!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/300x400c/zoho_images/1482250000000339031.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My early involvement with Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing my studies, I didn’t work for a library until I was invited to oversee the digitization activities for the<a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en\"> National Library of Latvia</a> <a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en\">i</a>n<a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en\"> </a>2<a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en\">0</a>0<a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en\">9</a>. It was an offer I could not refuse, as it allowed me to apply my library background alongside my digital expertise – I had previously worked for online media, dabbled in online marketing, and implemented a digital media monitoring system at a news agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2021603/teylers_col28_dat15540_TEY001010720.html\"><img alt=\"Notebook, Riga 1925\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/1925-riga.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 459px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2021603/teylers_col28_dat15540_TEY001010720.html\"><span>1925. Riga</span></a>. <a href=\"http://www.circusmuseum.nl/teylers:col28:dat15540:TEY001010720\">Circus Museum</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nl/\">CC BY-SA</a><span>.</span></span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of my new responsibilities as the head of a digital library was to represent the National Library of Latvia in<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\"> The European Library</a> <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">p</a>r<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">o</a>j<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">e</a>c<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">t</a> – the predecessor of Europeana. Our library was also a partner of the EDLnet project, which began Europeana, and soon I became closely involved with Europeana as well. I took part in a number of projects (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeanatravel\">Europeana Travel</a>,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeanalocal\"> Europeana Local</a>,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-newspapers\"> Europeana Newspapers</a>,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-sounds\"> Europeana Sounds</a>,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-awareness\"> Europeana Awareness</a>), in the Aggregators’ Forum, and got involved in the strategy and business planning workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering this previous involvement, it seemed natural to me to step forward as a Members Council candidate when the Network Association was established. And after serving my first term, I am back for more – this time also as a member of the Management Board of the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The power of networks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most powerful thing about Europeana has always been the people it brings together. I believe that the Network Association gathers some of the most brilliant and forward-looking minds of the European cultural sector. And yet, there is still untapped potential waiting to be released, which is why I joined the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces/network-participation-framework-task-force\"> Network Participation Framework Task Force</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our group strongly believes in communities and participatory approaches, and we hope that our work will open up new avenues for professionals of different backgrounds to engage with Europeana. Historically, Europeana was created as a top-down initiative. Now that it has matured, it is about time to re-shape Europeana as a collaborative platform for engagement. Two years ago, our Annual General Meeting had the motto ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/we-are-europeana-the-europeana-network-association-agm-2015\">We are Europeana</a>’. Let us rise up to this bold statement!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2025904/_E1989_RIG044.html\"><img alt=\"Baltic Way stamps - 2 million people joined hands in a human chain\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-07/baltic-way-stamps.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 176px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2025904/_E1989_RIG044.html\"><span>Baltijas ceļam veltītas pamarkas</span></a>. <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/zbiorki/dlibra/docmetadata?id=1001\">Europeana 1989</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public domain</a><span>.</span></span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly established<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups/library-working-group\"> Library Working Group</a> of the Network Association, which I am chairing, serves as a pilot project for a more open method of engagement. Libraries have always been at the forefront of digitization, and their continued engagement is very important to Europeana.There is a need to rethink how Europeana deals with text-based materials, and I hope the active involvement of the library community can help in this regard – drop me a line if you are interested in joining the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Developing new missions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My current position at the library is Director of Development, which means that my bread and butter is visions and missions, strategies and business plans, and implementation and evaluation of both. In short, I have to make sure the National Library, and Latvian libraries in general, thrive and evolve. This also translates to my work at the Members Council. That’s why I gladly took part in the development of new mission and vision statements (now called aspiration and approach) of the Network Association and Europeana Foundation (to be approved during our Annual General Meeting this year) – I find them very inspiring and I hope that you will as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezCulture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        body: "<p>It may not be until next May, but diaries fill up fast, so put this event in yours today! Thanks to <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/author/moys/\" title=\"Posts by Moys Schuttert\">Moys Schuttert</a> at EUscreen for this event information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Prof. Dr. Sonja de Leeuw\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/sonja-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 188px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Prof. Dr. Sonja de Leeuw, EUscreen.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Date</strong>: 16 May 2018<br><strong>Time:</strong> Symposium starts at 11:00, Farewell Lecture at 16:15.<br><strong>Location Symposium: </strong>Utrecht University, Sweelinckzaal, Drift 21, Utrecht<br><strong>Location Farewell Lecture:</strong> Aula Academy Building, Domplein 4, Utrecht</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the past decade, a massive body of European audiovisual heritage has become accessible online: on video sharing sites and websites of archives, or through initiatives such as EUscreen and Europeana. Once online, audiovisual heritage circulates in diverse ways: people watch, share, like, or dislike it; they comment, appropriate, and download videos for remix and recirculation. It thus becomes part of the popular consumption of history, potentially creating new interpretations of heritage materials, challenging authorized perspectives. Heritage institutions perceive the consequences of the recent technological transformations of the sector as a major challenge and opportunity. Nevertheless, urgent questions regarding the circulation of audiovisual heritage online remain unanswered:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>How do strategies of curation shape the appropriation of digitized heritage?</li>\r\n    <li>How does digitization and online circulation of audiovisual heritage affect the mission, role, and structure heritage institutions, as well as their relationships with media producers and publics?</li>\r\n    <li>How can audiovisual archives better foster the reuse of Europe’s audiovisual heritage?</li>\r\n    <li>(How) do digital curation and other appropriations of audiovisual heritage create new perspectives on European history and identity?</li>\r\n    <li>How does online circulation of audiovisual heritage alter the power relationships between amateur and professional historians in a public history environment, potentially blurring the boundaries between authorized and popular visions of European history?</li>\r\n    <li>What new tools and methods do we need to analyse the circulation of audiovisual heritage online, and how do traditional methods have to be adapted for this aim?</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>To discuss these challenges, Utrecht University’s Centre of Television in Transition in collaboration with The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and CLARIAH will organize a one-day symposium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The symposium is held on the occasion of the Farewell Lecture by Prof. Dr. Sonja de Leeuw, Professor of Dutch Television History in the European Context at Utrecht University, the driving force behind the EUscreen projects and pioneer in the field of digital audiovisual heritage in Europe. Confirmed participants include Jerome Bourdon, Professor at the Department of Communication, Tel Aviv University; Andreas Fickers, Professor for Contemporary and Digital History and Director of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History; Johan Oomen, Head of Research and Development at Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision; Julia Noordegraaf, Professor of Digital Heritage at the University of Amsterdam; and Pelle Snickars, Professor of Media and Communication Studies and affiliated to the HUMlab Research Centre of Umeå University, Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, keep an eye on the <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen blog</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Why data partners should link their vocabulary to Wikidata: a new case study'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>For this information to be as useful as possible, we have to link it to semantically rich and multilingual resources.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana creates an expanding network of cultural heritage resources by linking Europeana objects with open datasets available online. For this information to be as useful as possible, we have to link it to semantically rich and multilingual resources. The <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">Wikidata</a> platform can make the connection between authoritative datasets and crowdsourced data. And it is now part of our knowledge graph - the Europeana Entity Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In a new case study, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/get-your-vocabularies-in-wikidata\">Get your vocabularies in Wikidata...so Europeana and others can use them</a></strong>, we describe the practical steps data providers can take to upload and align their vocabularies with Wikidata, so that we can access the links and integrate the data into Europeana. This case is based on the recent experiment by <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Spinster\">Sandra Fauconnier</a>, from the Wikimedia Foundation, on aligning the <a href=\"http://www.mimo-db.eu/InstrumentsKeywords/\">MIMO vocabulary</a> for musical instruments with Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1896_A_19368_819.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/assetimage2.jpg\" style=\"width: 394px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1896_A_19368_819.html\"><em>Samaritaans Alphabêt, Salomons Alphabêt en Oud Caldeesch Alphabêt, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain </em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, when deciding which sources to link to, we have selected large, rather generic and multilingual data sources and favoured ones that are well-connected, that is, those which indicate equivalent elements in other vocabularies. However besides our ’centralized’ enrichment, Europeana would also benefit from some of the more ‘local’ semantic resources used by our data partners, which are often the result of tremendous data curation efforts. And so we are encouraging our data partners to add these resources to Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikidata (and the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data\">Structured data</a> project) provides great opportunities for the GLAM community to share its local resources on the Web for third parties like Europeana to get access to rich and multilingual descriptions, and for Wikidata to enrich its existing knowledge base with authoritative data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in this topic, support our <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikidataCon_2017/Submissions/Structured_Data:_How_can_GLAMs_grab_the_low_hanging_fruit%3F\">proposal for the Wikidata conference</a> next October in Berlin!</p>"

        title: 'Why the Metropolitan Museum of Art is embracing open access'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In February 2017, The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) made over 375,000 images of public domain artworks in its collections available for use and remix with Creative Commons Zero. Identifying data for the museum’s entire publicly available digitized collection was also made available on GitHub development platform. We asked Neal Stimler, Program Manager for Content Partnerships, from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, to tell us what is driving these projects.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely online ?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing the collection is a fundamental aspect of <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met\">The Met’s mission</a> ‘to connect people to creativity, knowledge, and ideas.’ The <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2017/open-access\">Met Open Access</a> initiative, launched on 7 February 2017, helps achieve this mission by making <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/image-resources\">images and data from the Museum's collection</a> widely available on the internet, and usable to the broadest possible public. As <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/author/ryancreativecommons-org/\">Ryan Merkley</a>, CEO of <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a>, noted at the Met Open Access launch event, ‘<a href=\"https://medium.com/@creativecommons/knowledge-is-the-most-valuable-thing-we-have-to-give-abcc90c29778\">it's about advancing the human cause of equity and access for everyone to the greatest works of history</a>.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are these resources available outside of the Met’s website?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnerships enhance the discoverability and searchability of the <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection\">Museum's collection</a>, while creating opportunities to foster deeper connections. The Met’s collaboration with partners help extend the impact of the Met's collection into communities eager to engage and utilize art in both familiar and new ways. Those interested in the Museum can access and engage with the collection whether or not they visit of the Museum’s three physical locations. And, access to the collection can happen on platforms outside or-as well as on-the Museum’s own website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Met's partnership with Creative Commons not only helped introduce Creative Commons Zero, but also contributed to <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons Search</a>, which, \"...<a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/about\">allows for high-quality content from the commons to surface in a more seamless and accessible way</a>”. The Met is excited to be part of Creative Commons Search, along with allied institutions whose collections can also be discovered on the platform, like <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2017/04/20/europeana-search/\">Europeana’s</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation and community members, we built <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art\">GLAM WikiProject Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>. This project documents our efforts to contribute public domain images and data to Wikimedia platforms, and to undertake focused work with communities of practice locally in New York City and remotely with programs such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Met\">edit-a-thons</a>, <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Met_Open_Access_Artworks_Challenge\">challenges</a> and a Wikimedian-in-Residence. Engagement with Wikimedia communities is a shared interest of <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana\">Europeana</a>, whose work has been a source of inspiration for The Met’s own efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who benefits from these resources, and how do they use them?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Met's Open Access images and data with the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0\">Creative Commons Zero</a> designation can be used by anyone, without fee or restriction, for both commercial and non-commercial uses. This includes artists, designers, students, scholars, developers, businesses, etc. who find inspiration in the Met's 5,000 years of art. The Museum, in turn, is inspired by user communities and learns from their innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you share some scholarly and creative examples using these resources?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been interesting uses since launch that point to further possibilities. Europeana, for example, used an image of a stained glass window by Louis Comfort Tiffany from The Met's collection in its exhibition, <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/exhibitions/art-nouveau-2011\">Art Nouveau: A Universal Style</a></em>. The exhibition web page, ’’<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-2011/mastercrafts\">Mastercrafts</a>’, that contained the image of the Tiffany window, ’<a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/9819\">Magnolias and Irises</a>’, has been viewed more than 500 times by users since it was published in February, and the metadata has been translated into six languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdcutup\">Public Domain Cut-up Twitter Bot</a>, created by <a href=\"http://thisismattmiller.com/\">Matthew Miller</a>, is a an example of a digital art project that uses software to cut-up, remix and collage together open access images from The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The New York Public Library to create new images using the Creative Commons Zero designation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/pontneufgif.gif\" style=\"width: 228px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459736\"><em>Le Pont Neuf, Hippolyte Petitjean, </em></a><em><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459736\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, </a></em><a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459736\"><em>CC0</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/160fec70-c614-012f-b514-58d385a7bc34\"><em>Le Pont-Neuf, Charles Méryon, The New York Public Library</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/PDCutup/status/885339830250594305\"><em>Public Domain Cut-Up Bot, Matt Miller</em></a><a href=\"http://twitter.com/PDCutup/status/885339830250594305\">,<em> CC0</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>What is the most popular digitized artwork?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the most popular digitized artwork in the collection does vary, it is frequently <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437127\"><em>Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies</em>, by Claude Monet</a>.

        body: "<p><em>By Emma Verheijke, Managing Partner, Sinzer</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our latest survey helps us make a start towards better understanding the impact of Europeana Research and the Europeana Fashion &amp; Photography collections on the people that use them, and the organizations that contribute data. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana believes making cultural heritage digitally available and accessible is important. But why exactly? What is the value of this? Who benefits from it? What changes does it create? Or in other words: what is the impact of Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/impactpathway.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An example of a how one aspect of the impact of Europeana Photography was mapped on the Change Pathway. </em><em>Europeana, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has certain impact goals, such as contributing to creating a shared European identity. Europeana strongly believes in being specific about the changes you aim to create, and in testing whether you are indeed creating these changes. This is the reason Europeana recently engaged impact consultancy <a href=\"http://www.sinzer.org/\">Sinzer</a> and embarked on a journey to assess the impact of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a>, and the curated collections <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion </a>&amp; <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/photography\">Europeana Photography</a>. Through this, we expect to also learn some things about the impact of Europeana in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several multi-stakeholder workshops were held for Europeana Fashion, Photography &amp; Research, in which their impact was ‘mapped’ by answering questions such as: who experiences change as a result of accessing or providing data? What changes do these groups experience? How can this be influenced by changing the offering or services? Or, to be more concrete: does accessing heritage material through a Europeana service increase people’s knowledge about historic events and different cultures? And does this affect their behaviour towards others or life itself? Does Europeana through <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/photography\">Europeana Photography</a> or <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a> ‘make life easier’ for researchers and professionals who rely on cultural heritage for their work? And is this important to them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the workshops, once we had identified the activities that would ultimately lead to impact, and some of the steps in between, we turned our attention to how we could evidence this. Taking each stakeholder, we look at what changes we thought most important to measure, and identified what we could ask in a survey to gather data for those measurements. After the sessions, the impact ‘mapping’, including these measurements, were translated into several surveys, which are currently being used to collect data from a variety of stakeholders like GLAMs, researchers, designers, professionals, and general users. Results are expected to be ready in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Europeana expects that the insights from the reports will help demonstrate the importance of their collective existence and work, it will also provide tangible management information: what can they do differently in order to create more impact? So this is not seen as a one-off exercise, but rather as the start of an ongoing impact management process that stimulates continuous learning and improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you like to help Europeana in this process? Have you visited the thematic collections of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/photography\">Europeana Photography</a> or <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a>? Take the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/EFuser17\">10 minute impact survey</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Focus on Facebook #SunflowersLive: reuniting van Gogh''s five Sunflowers on social media'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Van Gogh Museum and the Neue Pinakothek tell us about #SunflowersLive, a world first virtual exhibition\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In 1888/9, Van Gogh painted five versions of the Sunflowers in Arles, in the South of France. These world famous paintings are exhibited in five museums across three continents in London, in Amsterdam, Munich, Philadelphia and Tokyo. A global collaboration is bringing them together in a way the artist couldn’t have imagined, through 15-minute consecutive Facebook live broadcasts that will feel as if they were together in one room. At 6.50PM (CEST) on Monday 14 August, viewers will be able to interact with ‘Sunflowers 360’ on Gear VR or watch a 360 video on Facebook. The experience will be narrated by the great-grandson of Van Gogh’s brother Theo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antje Lange, from the digital communication department of the <a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/sunflowerslive\">Neue Pinakothek</a> in Munich and Jacob van der Vlugt, Social Media Strategist at the <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/virtual-sunflower-360-gallery\">Van Gogh Museum</a> in Amsterdam, talked to about their collaboration on this unique virtual gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/sunflowers-email-banner-640x300.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 281px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How was the idea for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sunflowerslive&amp;src=tyah\">#SunflowersLive</a> collaboration born?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jacob van der Vlugt, Van Gogh Museum: </strong>We were approached by the National Gallery in London, and we very much liked the idea. We got in touch with the social media managers of the other museums, and through them we were quickly able to get the museums into the project. We then contacted Facebook and asked them to support the initiative. They were very enthusiastic. They built it in a month, which apparently is the fastest VR experience built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antje Lange, Pinakothek:</strong> The general idea was to fulfill the dream of 2014 of bringing together all the <em>Sunflowers</em> in one place at the same time. In 2014, an exhibition in London reunited the London and the Amsterdam version of the painting for the first time in 65 years, but not the three other ones. Those are not allowed to travel because the thick paint is very fragile and could be destroyed when moved around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0031V1962\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/vangoghmuseum.jpg\" style=\"width: 457px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0031V1962\"><em>Sunflowers, Van Gogh, Van Gogh Museum, CC-BY-NC-ND</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was the role of your respective museums in the project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jacob van der Vlugt:</strong> It was mainly a collaborative process, but the Van Gogh Museum was the main driver on the education and art history part. Our senior researchers and curators helped with the project so that we could use all their knowledge and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antje Lange: </strong>The Pinakothek worked closely with colleagues from the other museums. To my knowledge. this is the first time that the digital departments from several international museums have worked together on such a large scale campaign. A once in a lifetime chance! The important part was to provide the material necessary to build the microsite, there were a lot of design decisions and arrangements to be done. As we are the smaller partner in terms of social media following, we followed the lead and tried to keep the pace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why make the painting available outside of the museum? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jacob van der Vlugt:</strong> The museum in Amsterdam has a record number of visitors. Van Gogh is probably one of the most popular artists, and we are always full of visitors. People all over the world have visited the museum or might come one day. Everyone knows the painting, but not many people know that there are five versions across three continents. Through this innovative approach, people will get the opportunity to learn more about a very universal piece. A lot of museums are digitizing their collections, but bringing together paintings from different galeries probably never happened before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sammlung.pinakothek.de/en/artist/vincent-van-gogh/sonnenblumen\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/pinakothek.jpg\" style=\"width: 477px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sammlung.pinakothek.de/en/artist/vincent-van-gogh/sonnenblumen\"><em>Sunflowers, Van Gogh, Pinakothek, CC BY-SA 4.0</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which audiences are you trying to reach?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antje Lange</strong>: Of course we hope to gain new followers on our social channels and make enough digital noise to get some attention. It would be nice to gain more international followers and make the Pinakotheken better known outside of Germany. We have a great collection and there are still a lot of art lovers who don't know us as well as they probably should. I hope the viewers of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sunflowerslive&amp;src=tyah\">#SunflowersLive</a> will enjoy the journey around the world to the five<em> Sunflowers</em>, and learn a thing or two about Vincent van Gogh on the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you working on other similar projects?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jacob van der Vlugt:</strong> We have been doing a lot of live guided tours in the past and we will be doing more in the future. We will host a <a href=\"https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/symposium-museum-guides-now\">Symposium workshop</a> in November about Facebook guided tours. We also have a new digital team who is very ambitious, and has plans to develop further on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antje Lange:</strong> We are currently planning a new exhibition app and testing ways to use augmented reality systems in our galleries. I really hope that this is just the beginning of a new form of collaboration for museums. There are so many wonderful ways of working together, of joining our different collections, using new technologies. To promote and connect artworks is our common task and there shouldn’t be any borders for that kind of thing. The digital revolution makes those changes possible, we just have to make it happen. But there is still a long way to go. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sunflowerslive&amp;src=tyah\">#SunflowersLive</a> can be a first big step in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More paintings by Van Gogh are <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?q=van+gogh+&amp;view=grid\">available on Europeana Art</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_3262.html\"><img alt=\"Self-portrait, Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/1502709718_assetimage2.jpg\" style=\"width: 476px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_3262.html\"><em>Self-portrait, Van Gogh, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Making audiovisual media a first-class citizen in Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>As audiovisual media have become a major source of both entertainment and information throughout our 20th and 21st centuries, the Audiovisual Media Task Force present their final report and recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An upgrade for Sounds and Sights </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dedicated expert hubs, as well as singular audiovisual archives, national aggregators and topical expert hubs have contributed sounds and moving images to Europeana over the past decade. Their popularity remains uncontested. Reports consistently quote a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Content%20Strategy.pdf\">great public interest in audiovisual items</a> from Europeana visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2016, a group consisting of members from <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\">European Film Gateway</a>, and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sounds\">Europeana Sounds</a> proposed a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces/audiovisual-media-task-force\">Task Force</a> that would outline a set of recommendations to make audiovisual media a first-class citizen, both on the Europeana portal and within the wider Europeana ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/mcatala-20170129-.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 443px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Round table group shot, Montse Català</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the advancements needed are technical in nature. They relate to the time-based and complex composition of the medium. The ‘Audiovisual Media in Europeana’ Task Force sees these as utterly solvable. We live in a world that is technologically advanced enough to have video as a daily part of our learning, sharing, and communicating environments. Europeana can rely upon existing standards and partners’ best practices to improve the experience of these items for its various user groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outlining recommendations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force aimed to formulate recommendations regarding ’audiovisual content in Europeana’ in three specific areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Editorial: How to embed audiovisual content in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> and other Europeana-related sites reusing AV materials assessment of multimedia content (topics), and editorial use of AV content externally (length, edit on i.e. social media platforms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Improving the use: Improving search on time-based media (including an assessment of audiovisual media standards in relation to EDM), Multimedia hyperlinking (incl. definition of a pilot / exhibition), Crowdsourcing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Accessibility: Support of subtitles and multilinguality emerging media formats (playout on mobile devices)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This relates to work being done by neighbouring groups, such as the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-tech\">Europeana Tech</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/iiif\">Preparing Europeana for IIIF involvement Task Force</a>. A heartfelt thank you goes out to the reviewers of the document for strengthening its quality, and the Europeana Board for thinking with us about further steps for implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please find attached the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/finalrecommendationstaskforceaudiovisualmediaineuropeana-20170710.pdf\">Final report and recommendations</a> of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces/audiovisual-media-task-force\">Audiovisual Media in Europeana Task Force</a> from June 2017.​</p>"

        title: 'Meet the members Council: Jef Malliet'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Hello, I am Jef Malliet. You might already know me: I followed the Europeana CCPA/Network since its inception in 2009, and was elected in the Council of the Network Association when it was created in 2014. I worked for about 20 years at ICCROM (the International Centre for the Study of Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property). Since 2002, I have been working on the development and maintenance of a cultural heritage database for the province of Limburg in Belgium,<a href=\"http://www.erfgoedplus.be/\"> Erfgoedplus.be</a>. For almost ten years, we have been involved with and closely following the development of Europeana, especially through participation in projects that emphasize the contribution of local heritage: EuropeanaLocal, Europeana Awareness, Europeana Inside and LoCloud. Thanks to your support in my re-election as a Councillor last November, I will continue the work started in the previous years and keep being involved in the Governance Working Group, the Data Quality Committee and the Aggregators Forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consolidating the Network Association</strong><br>\r\nThe Network Association was created at the end of 2014, and is slowly growing up. We made good progress trying to understand the mechanisms forworking successfully with the Network. But still, many loose ends remain. And Europeana itself is continuously evolving: it has to adapt to new forms or requirements for financing, to a constantly changing aggregation environment, technical as well as organizational. The validity of the concept of the Association needs to be constantly monitored  and consolidated in the statutes and bylaws. This work will continue to be necessary always and will be done in the Governance committee of the Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-08/assembly.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The assembly of the order of the gold fleece (didactic print for history lessons). </em><em>Image: from Erfgoedplus.be, CC BY SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The back office of governance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help the Council and the Governance Committee understand how to make the participation from Association members more efficient and meaningful, we created a dedicated Task Force on the Participation Framework. By the end of 2017, it will present  several suggestions for improvement. The transition from a project-based model for financing and managing Europeana to a sustainable Network model with the Foundation and Association as main pillars still needs better understanding and continuous adaptations. The Aggregators Forum is where much of this work takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This all seems quite tedious stuff, as compared with making a nice website, collecting interesting data about cultural heritage, encouraging creative people to reuse these resources to create exciting or attractive projects. But these fun initiatives wouldn’t be possible without a good operational system in support of enthusiastic participation, which is what we want to build in the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the key topics I want to concentrate on during my new term as Council Member. But the issues I stressed in<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-jef-malliet\"> earlier contributions</a> certainly remain among the most important concerns for Europeana to continue its evolution. It includes the emphasis on the process (rather than on the product) for aggregating digital heritage data; on the proper recognition of human effort (rather than the technical infrastructure) as a condition for quality; and the participation of  local heritage collections, rather than the well known masterpieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the issues that will keep driving my participation in Europeana. How about you?<br></p>"

        title: 'The rise of the MOOC for digital cultural heritage'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Our colleagues at Europeana wanted to teach people about the Europeana Data Model. How did they do it? They created a MOOC - a Massive Open Online Course.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_(It’s not available just yet but watch this space, we’ll let you know when it is). And they’re not the only ones getting the MOOC bug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eW3gMGqcZQc\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOOCs have changed the student experience. Anyone who can use a computer can study pretty much anything from pretty much anywhere, usually for free. As such, MOOCs come under that buzzword heading of ‘disruptive technology’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt='Enligt tidigare notering: \"Studentgrupp, 1918.\" - http://europeana.eu/portal/record/916105/bhm_photo_UMFA54477_0508.html.

Just three years ago, researchers speaking at a <a href=\"http://nicolaosborne.blogs.edina.ac.uk/2014/02/24/moocs-in-cultural-heritage-education/\">MOOCS in cultural heritage event </a>concluded that it was ‘still early days’ and that ‘there isn’t a lot out there’ for cultural heritage. But today it’s a different story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coursera lists over <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/browse/arts-and-humanities?languages=en\">250 courses in the arts and humanities</a>. US-based <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/\">EdX</a> offers 100 courses under the heading ‘<a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/?course=all&amp;subject=Art%20%26%20Culture\">Art &amp; Culture</a>’. Then there's <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/\">FutureLearn</a>, which has more of a UK slant with partners including the British Library, British Film Institute and British Museum, has around 40 cultural heritage courses. And iversity, based in Germany, also has some interesting <a href=\"https://iversity.org/en/courses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;state=&amp;pro=&amp;language_code=&amp;search=culture\">courses for culture</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your interest is not so much in the cultural heritage material itself, but working with it from a technical point of view, there are also many courses about <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science?languages=en\">data science</a>, things like dealing with datasets and big data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who’s making MOOCs?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just the higher education establishments. The GLAM sector itself has got in on the game with courses run by the <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&amp;query=%22American+Museum+of+Natural+History%22\">American Museum of Natural History</a>, for example, or <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&amp;query=MOMA\">The Museum of Modern Art,</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a global thing. The names that recur most are the big-name US universities like Yale, Stanford, Princeton and Berklee. But Europe also features prominently with courses from universities in Amsterdam, Milan, London and Leiden, Barcelona and Rome, to name just a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global perspective is often reflected in a single course too. Because it’s an online, distance tool, the teachers can be anywhere. Take ‘<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/magic-middle-ages\">Magic in the Middle Ages</a>’, for example, it’s a course from the University of Barcelona, but it’s taught by academics from Harvard, Barcelona, Louvain and Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cultural heritage content at the heart of a MOOC</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The act of digitizing cultural heritage collections is of course a benefit to MOOCs as it means they have a huge range of material available to illustrate their topics. The more we can work at opening up collections by making high quality files available for this kind of educational use, the more MOOC makers will turn to cultural content as a resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nMOOCs on the subject of Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to take a course about Europeana, look at <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/europeana-space-creative-digital-kuleuvenx-eurospacex-0\">Europeana Space: Creative with Digital Heritage</a> on EdX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-used-in-massive-open-online-course-on-metadata\">Metadata Mooc</a> that uses Europeana in its examples too. Back when the course was first released, we talked to the course director about it. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-used-in-massive-open-online-course-on-metadata\">Read our blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we’ll let you know when you can sign up for the new MOOC about the Europeana Data Model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>We love open culture so much that this month, we’re teaming up with the Open Education Consortium, which is championing all things open in the Year of Open 2017. Each month, the Year of Open website features a perspective on a different open initiative. So far this year, it’s covered things like open source software, open science and open education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no prizes for guessing what kind of open we’re going to be talking about - open culture, of course. We want to raise awareness of the existence and importance of open culture and get people talking about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout September, we’ll be updating the Year of Open website with videos, interviews, favourite collection items and fascinating stories of how digital cultural heritage is being used across the world. We’ve talked to digital heritage professionals from Europe, the US, Australia and India for a truly global perspective. These experts tell us why they strive each day to open up culture and reveal some great things that have happened as a result of their, and their partner organizations’ hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s a teaser of some of our friends - members of the Europeana Network Association - telling us why open culture is important to them. To see more, head over to <a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\">the Year of Open</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/230750143\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/230750143\">What is open culture? Short version</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll post new content throughout the month, so please keep checking back to <a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\">the Year of Open</a>. And share with @EuropeanaEU, @oeconsortium, #yearofopen #openculture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to everyone who’s contributed to our videos and interviews - we hope you’re proud of the results. We are!</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Between 22-25 August 2017, Europeana joined the French Ministry of Education at <a href=\"http://ludovia.org/2017/\">Ludovia</a>, the annual digital education summer university for educators. Europeana was the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/merci-pour-tout-ludovia-13-encouraging-re-use-of-digital-cultural-heritage-for-education-in-france\">Guest of Honour</a> in 2016, and one year later we were pleased to return with good news to share about how we’ve been working with the French Ministry of Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana on Éduthèque</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a joint presentation with the Ministry, we announced our pilot collaboration and launched the new Europeana dedicated page on <a href=\"http://www.edutheque.fr/utiliser/partenaire/europeana.html\">Éduthèque</a>, the French national educational portal used by over 126,000 primary and secondary teachers in France. Our partner space on Éduthèque features links to a selection of fully translated galleries, exhibitions, and curated searches that the Ministry has selected as being particularly relevant for French educators. These include the translated ‘Leaving Europe: a new life in America’, relevant in the current context of migration into and across Europe, and a search for cultural heritage content related to the life and role of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/world-war-I?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+1914-1918&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;locale=fr&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=women&amp;view=grid\">women in World War 1</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this partnership, our <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/guide-dutilisation-des-ressources-europeana-des-fins-ducatives\">Guide to using Europeana in education</a> is now also available in French and the Transcribathon website now has a <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/education/education-fr/\">special area for education</a> that we premièred with French educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicoleMcNeilly/status/900659970374598658\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/ludivia14.png\" style=\"width: 579px; height: 402px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transcribathon at Ludovia 2017</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 14th edition of Ludovia enjoyed almost 1,000 attendees from across France and from French-speaking and neighbouring countries like Belgium. Held in the Pyrenees, this infamous event in the French educational calendar is a great location to work with teachers when they are relaxed and preparing to go back to school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the presentation with the Ministry, we held two <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/ludovia/\">Transcribathon workshops</a> over the Wednesday and Thursday of the conference. Amongst a packed schedule of workshops, talks and panels, we introduced educators to how they could use the Transcribathon tool in the classroom for educational benefit. The tool was well received and a number of educators signed up to start working on the available French content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/transcribathon/status/901028574811095041\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/lesmontagnards.png\" style=\"width: 580px; height: 498px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late on Thursday, as everyone was packing up, we had the pleasure of hearing two attendees, Mr and Mrs Pérez, sing <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-9013/item-106414/\">‘Les Montagnards’</a>.<a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-9013/item-106414/\"> </a>The illustrated lyrics of this famous regional song were featured as our <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-9013/item-106414/\">poster image</a> for the event. It was a fantastic finale to the conference and we hope you also enjoy the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/K2wL70uaeC0\">performance</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the rest of 2017, we’ll work with the French Ministry of Education to make Europeana content directly available through the Éduthèque search function, bringing our content to a huge educational audience in France. We’ll also collaborate to explore how a small network of French teachers could be established to develop new learning resources with Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stay up to date with all of the work of Europeana Education, join our <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332\">LinkedIn group</a>!</p>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">For World Book Day, Europeana wants people to engage with famous European texts using social media, taking them on a month long literary tour of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">23 April is the anniversary of the death of two of Europe’s best known authors: Cervantes and Shakespeare. It is also the date symbolically chosen by UNESCO to celebrate World Book and Copyright Day internationally. As part of its #AllezLiterature campaign, Europeana is joining this world-wide tribute to literature and will be sharing some of Cervantes and Shakespeare's greatest works available on the platform in various languages, including Don Quijote de la Mancha and Macbeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To highlight the variety of resources and languages available on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/allez-literature.html\">Europeana</a>, more authors and events that marked Europe’s literary History will be highlighted over the coming weeks, with the hashtags #AllezLiterature and #OnThisDay linking to relevant content. This includes numerous images and digitised manuscripts such as a first edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, which was first published in its entirety in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From Homer to Gustave Flaubert and Kafka, the campaign will feature works by authors across Europe, promoting literature and the continued relevance of these texts. We will encourage users to interact with the content on social media using the #AllezLiterature hashtag. Activities dedicated to books will include literary quizzes, and sharing opening lines from famous books. Some European classics will also be available to download as PDFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">World Book Day marks the third phase of Europeana’s pan-European campaign #AllezLiterature working with libraries, archives and the public across Europe to celebrate the written word and texts in 2017. Led on social media, the campaign explores the value of the written word in our cultural heritage through words, in all their forms and languages. The first two phases have been dedicated to love letters and poetry, respectively celebrating Valentine’s Day (14 February 2017) and World Poetry Day (21 March 2017) with social media activity and Transcribathon events. Over 700 transcribers took part, and completed over 4,000 documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMedia contacts:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCamille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation<br />\r\nE: Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation<br />\r\nE: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em><strong>Notes for the editor:</strong></em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, collecting and providing online access to over 53 million of digitised items from over 3,500 libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe, ranging from books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects.

        title: 'Europeana launches a social media tribute to World Book Day'
        posttype: Pressrelease

        intro: "<p>For World Book Day, Europeana wants people to engage with famous European texts using social media, taking them on a month long literary tour of Europe.</p>\r\n"
        body: "\r\n<p>23 April is the anniversary of the death of two of Europe’s best known authors: Cervantes and Shakespeare. It is also the date symbolically chosen by UNESCO to celebrate World Book and Copyright Day internationally. As part of its #AllezLiterature campaign, Europeana is joining this world-wide tribute to literature and will be sharing some of Cervantes and Shakespeare's greatest works available on the platform in various languages, including Don Quijote de la Mancha and Macbeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To highlight the variety of resources and languages available on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/allez-literature.html\">Europeana</a>, more authors and events that marked Europe’s literary History will be highlighted over the coming weeks, with the hashtags #AllezLiterature and #OnThisDay linking to relevant content. This includes numerous images and digitised manuscripts such as a first edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, which was first published in its entirety in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Homer to Gustave Flaubert and Kafka, the campaign will feature works by authors across Europe, promoting literature and the continued relevance of these texts. We will encourage users to interact with the content on social media using the #AllezLiterature hashtag. Activities dedicated to books will include literary quizzes, and sharing opening lines from famous books. Some European classics will also be available to download as PDFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Book Day marks the third phase of Europeana’s pan-European campaign #AllezLiterature working with libraries, archives and the public across Europe to celebrate the written word and texts in 2017. Led on social media, the campaign explores the value of the written word in our cultural heritage through words, in all their forms and languages. The first two phases have been dedicated to love letters and poetry, respectively celebrating Valentine’s Day (14 February 2017) and World Poetry Day (21 March 2017) with social media activity and Transcribathon events. Over 700 transcribers took part, and completed over 4,000 documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS<br><br>\r\nMedia contacts:</strong><br><br>\r\nCamille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu<br><br>\r\nEleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu<br><br><em><strong>Notes for the editor:</strong></em><br><br><em>Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, collecting and providing online access to over 53 million of digitised items from over 3,500 libraries, archives, audio-visual collections and museums across Europe, ranging from books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects.

        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><strong>Press Release - 4 May 2017 </strong><strong>- </strong>Fashions curators, academics, students and enthusiasts can now discover and explore more than a million fashion images contributed by nearly 40 museums and fashion brand archives from 13 European countries on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal\">Europeana platform</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a> brings together an incredible wealth of content including historical clothing and accessories, contemporary designs, catwalk photographs, drawings, sketches, catalogues and videos from museums and archives across Europe, and provides a range of exciting new features for users to explore them. The Europeana Fashion collection launches on the Europeana platform with new galleries curating the collection by themes, such as fashion illustrations, sportswear, prints, or Haute Couture, and highlights by fashion experts. Fashion lovers are invited to tailor the content themselves: they can now access exactly what they are looking for by using new filters including designers, techniques, materials, and types of clothing. The collection also features exclusive editorial content, including blog posts and online exhibitions. The first one to launch, “Past to Present: Fashion Re-Interpretations”, explores the inspiration and influence of historical costumes on contemporary fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana platform provides a unique space for heritage institutions to showcase and share their collections online, enabling visitors to search and download high quality content: users can compare fashion movements and styles across time periods and regions across Europe. Contributing institutions include public museums, like the Victoria and Albert Museum (UK), Les Arts Décoratifs (France), MoMu (Belgium), as well as fashion brand archives, such as the Missoni archive, the Emilio Pucci Archive and the Museo Salvatore Ferragamo, and archives of fashion photographers, as Paul Van Riel and Etienne Tordoir, amongst many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously hosted on an independent website, the collection is now fully integrating to the Europeana platform to live alongside Europeana Art and Europeana Music. The collection will be curated by the Europeana Fashion International Association experts, who developed and enriched it over the past 5 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco Rendina, Technical Director, says <em>“we are delighted to provide access to more than a million fashion items and join the bigger Europeana family to share the powerful advantages the platform has to offer”. </em>The Fashion collection will benefit from the technical advancements and new features developed on the platform by the Europeana Foundation. Harry Verwayen, Europeana Deputy Director, says “<em>Europeana Foundation is very pleased to increase our collaboration with the Europeana Fashion International Association, and to welcome their curatorial expertise on the Europeana platform”.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Marta Franceschini - Europeana Fashion International Association</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:mfranceschini@europeanafashion.eu\">mfranceschini@europeanafashion.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Camille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation</strong><br>\r\nE: <a href=\"mailto:Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu\">Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation</strong><br>\r\nE: <a href=\"mailto:Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu\">Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Notes for editor</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Europeana Collections</em></strong><em> are the result of a uniquely collaborative model and approach: the web platform is provided by Europeana, the content comes from institutions across Europe, while consortiums will provide the theme and editorial expertise to bring the content alive for visitors through blogs and online exhibitions. </em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/music\"><em>Europeana Music </em></a><em>and </em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/art\"><em>Europeana Art </em></a><em>were the first Europeana thematic collections to be delivered in this way.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Europeana Fashion International Association </em></strong><em>is a non-profit organisation established in order to bring together and engage fashion institutions (both GLAMs - Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums - and the creative industry) in the valorisation and exploitation of fashion heritage online.

        title: 'Europeana Photography opens up Europe’s rich photographic heritage'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Europeana and PHOTOCONSORTIUM are launching <a href=\"http://photography.europeana.eu\">Europeana Photography</a>, an online collection bringing together and sharing a vast archive of historical images. Featuring early photography from some of Europe’s finest historical collections, Europeana Photography is the latest thematic collection to be published on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a>, joining Europeana Art, Europeana Music and Europeana Fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Photography presents images from the first 100 years of photography, sourced from photographic archives, agencies and museum collections across Europe. Photography enthusiasts, students and academics are invited to explore over 2 million historical images from more than 50 institutions across 34 countries, including photographs by pioneers like Julia Margaret Cameron, Eadweard Muybridge and Louis Daguerre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Photography will be supported by compelling blog posts, themed galleries and online exhibitions. The opening exhibition,<em> <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/industrial-photography-in-the-machine-age\">Industrial Photography in the Machine Age</a></em>, is part of a series, <em>The Pleasure of Plenty</em>, which focuses on opulent and visually rich vintage photography. Future exhibitions on specific themes will be released regularly, telling enticing stories with stunning images, allowing people to explore distant eras and locations, and better appreciate the value of their European, national and local cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making heritage photography collections available on Europeana encourages both the general public and professionals to discover the images and to use them in their own projects as a fifth of the photos are openly licensed. It is also an opportunity for archives from across Europe to promote their collections on an international platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the public and private archives whose collections are included in Europeana Photography are: the world's oldest photographic agency, Fratelli Alinari (Italy), TopFoto (UK), Parisienne de Photographie (France), Ajuntament de Girona/CRDI and GenCat, (Catalunya Spain), United Archives, (Germany), KU Leuven and KIK-IRPA (Belgium); Polfoto and Arbejdermuseet (Denmark), the National Board of Antiquities (Finland), the Israel Museum (Israel), and NALIS (Bulgaria).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fred Truyen, President of PHOTOCONSORTIUM, says: <em>‘Curating Europeana Photography is an important step for us and our members. We believe telling the stories behind the images of our European past will greatly improve the visibility of our collections, while enhancing the user experience of Europeana.’</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas McCarthy, Europeana Collections Manager, says:<em> ‘We are thrilled to be working with PHOTOCONSORTIUM and their impressive network of contributors.

        title: 'Europeana launched Europeana 1914-1918 thematic collection'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana 1914-1918 thematic collection launches during Europeana Transcribathon Campus Berlin 2017</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Officially launching the new <a href=\"http://world-war-I.europeana.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918 thematic collection</a>, Europeana Transcribathon Campus Berlin 2017 marks the next milestone for the crowdsourcing digital archive dedicated to the historical conflict, and puts a spotlight on the involvement of its community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 22 and 23 June, the Berlin State Library will host the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-transcribathon-campus-2017\">Europeana Transcribathon Campus Berlin 2017</a>. Over two days, teams from three generations and several European countries will compete to digitally transcribe as many World War One documents as possible, and link them to other historical sources such as early 20th century newspapers. Transcribathons gather people from across Europe and online to create digital versions of handwritten items found on Europeana 1914-1918. These innovative events are the latest crowdsourcing initiative enriching the Europeana 1914-1918 digital archive. Since their launch in November 2016, more than several million characters and 12,000 documents, from love letters to poems, have been transcribed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank Drauschke, of Europeana 1914-1918 project team says: <em>“Most sources on Europeana 1914-1918 are written by hand, and often hard to decipher. Transcribathon aims to help us ‘polish’ a raw diamond by this making private memorabilia readable online. We utilise the power of our community to transcribe as many private stories and documents from diverse languages and regions of Europe and make them available to the public.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These unique resources found on Europeana 1914-1918 have been collected and digitized since 2011 during collection days and online uploads inviting people to submit their personal documents. During Europeana Transcribathon Campus Berlin 2017, Europeana 1914-1918, previously living on a separate website, will officially move platform and re-launch as a new Europeana thematic collection. This move onto the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Collections site</a> aims to broaden the current audience by opening up World War One related content to all Europeana visitors and to enrich their experience. People can now discover digital versions of testimonies handwritten 100 years ago, complemented by millions of digitized newspapers and documents provided by libraries and archives. Linking user generated content with other historical sources makes it possible to view them within the bigger picture. And thanks to the ability to search across the Europeana platform, people can now also easily access related items from the other four thematic collections: Europeana <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/art\">Art,</a> <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/music\">Music</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/fashion\">Fashion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/photography\">Photography</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Europeana Deputy Director, says <em>\"European 1914-1918's new site increases its potential to tell stories that really resonate with people, by helping them to make connections that otherwise might not be made. Launching  it during the Transcribathon Campus highlights just how important personal contributions and the power of crowdsourcing alongside the work of museums and libraries continue to be to the development of this important archive.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Transcribathon Campus Berlin 2017 is organized by Europeana, Facts &amp; Files and the Berlin State Library, in cooperation with the German Digital Library and Wikimedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS</strong><br><br>\r\nMedia contacts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nCamille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu<br><br>\r\nEleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: <a href=\"mailto:Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu\">Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank Drauschke - Facts &amp; Files<br>\r\nE: <a href=\"mailto:drauschke@factsandfiles.com\">drauschke@factsandfiles.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nNotes for editor</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Europeana</strong> is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, collecting and providing online access to tens of millions of digitized items from over 3,500 libraries, archives, audiovisual collections and museums across Europe, ranging from music, books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects.

        title: 'Europeana REST API wins the 2017 Data APIs category award'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>This award recognizes the exciting work of Europeana at the interface of technology and cultural heritage. At API World 2017, the API Industry’s largest award event, the<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/introduction\"> Europeana REST API</a> will be crowned API winner in the Data APIs category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among hundreds of nominations, the API World advisory board selected the Europeana API based on three criteria: reputation in the API industry, recent media coverage, and innovativeness of the API initiatives. Geoff Domoracki, Founder of API World, said: ‘Europeana REST API is a great example of how more and more of the tech industry is realizing that APIs are not just how we integrate tools and apps, APIs are the new way of doing business and building new revolutionary technologies.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Press_images/api-awards-v2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 299px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana REST API allows people to build applications that use the cultural heritage objects stored in the Europeana repository. It is open-source and the code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a>. The metadata information is structured in the Europeana Data Model (EDM), an open flexible data model featuring various types of resources and relations between them, allowing anyone to search and filter on anything. From high resolution images of artworks in the Rijksmuseum to wildlife sounds recordings, Europeana makes sure this material can be found and used, encouraging creative industries, educators and research professionals to build on the content and create amazing new products. Recently, it has supported, the new<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-content-via-the-new-creative-commons-search\"> Creative Commons Search too</a>l which lets people search a variety of open repositories through a single interface, and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/historiana\">Historiana</a>, a digital learning platform for history educators. Steven Stegers, Programme Director at EUROCLIO, said, ‘The Europeana API makes it possible to search and select items from the digital collections of heritage institutes from Europe and beyond in one go. This is of tremendous value to developers of educational tools, who can then access these collections, and find relevant information including the rights statements and the origins of the source.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The API World 2017 award is a great recognition of the efforts of Europeana’s API team to make this content accessible and reusable. Hugo Manguinhas, Product Owner for API at Europeana, said: ‘We are proud to have built a unique API for the cultural heritage sector that spans thousands of institutions across Europe, in several languages.

        title: 'Fixing copyright for education with COMMUNIA'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>The debates surrounding EU copyright reform touches many areas of the Europeana Network. The COMMUNIA International Association on the Public Domain advocates for a better copyright for heritage and education: together with 33 other organisations including Europeana, we <a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/170207_Better-Copyright-for-Education-Joint-Letter.pdf\">distributed a joint letter</a> on a better copyright reform for education in February. To foster, strengthen and enrich the Public Domain, COMMUNIA brings together a network of activists, researchers and practitioners from universities, NGOs and SME established in 10 Member States. Lisette Kalshoven tells us about their recently launched campaign rightcopyright.eu aiming to fix copyright for education. Find out how you can get involved to influence European legislators. </strong><br><br><a href=\"http://www.rightcopyright.eu\">SIGN THE PETITION</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/slogan-loop-def-1.gif\" style=\"width: 590px; height: 545px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vandejong.nl/\"><em>Vandejong</em></a><em>, CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advocating for a better copyright in education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">As it has already been documented on Europeana Pro blog, </a>The European Commission has presented a new European copyright law (Draft Directive) to the European Parliament which very much impacts education and heritage. Communia believes that the current proposal is very disappointing and does not facilitate education. Educators have embraced the modern possibilities of digital resources, and so should copyright. Therefore, <a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/\">COMMUNIA</a> has developed a campaign website <a href=\"http://rightcopyright.eu/\">rightcopyright.eu</a> to collect petitions of educators throughout Europe and let the European Parliamentarians know we need a better copyright for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European parliament will vote on the draft directive later this year, and can change, accept or reject it. COMMUNIA will present the outcomes of the petition in the European Parliament, with a goal of showing them the voice of citizens eager for a good-quality education, and an EU copyright system that enables it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consequences for education and heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright affects education. It determines the extent to which a teacher may use, share or remix any material made by someone else. In some cases, there is a special exception to copyright for education in the European Union. Unfortunately, there are still many things teachers do that are not allowed. European countries have implemented the current EU copyright laws in a different ways, which makes it very difficult for teachers to know what they can and cannot do or share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main points of the campaign is that Cultural Heritage Institutions should be included in the exception, recognising them for the great role they have in the education ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/rightcopyright.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 299px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-1f1ecce3-80ae-1c8c-547b-73687b433ef0\"><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; color: rgb(10, 10, 10); background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Legal research on the educational exceptions and limitations, Teresa Nobre, illustrations by </span><a href=\"http://steam228.com/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; color: rgb(10, 10, 10); background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254); font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>André Rocha</span></a><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; color: rgb(10, 10, 10); background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254); font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'> CC0</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>What you can do to</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please visit the campaign website <a href=\"http://rightcopyright.eu/\">rightcopyright.eu</a> and sign the petition if you support a better copyright for education. We would love it if you shared the campaign with your colleagues, friends and family via mail, social media or face to face. You can find sample tweets, posts and images on the campaign website. It is available in 12 European languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to know more about the campaign, or have questions, please contact Lisette Kalshoven at <a href=\"mailto:lk@kl.nl\">lk@kl.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note: On behalf of the Network, Europeana represents the view of Cultural Heritage Institutions in these debates around eu copyright reform.

        body: "<p><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/servus#Romanian\">Servus! </a>I am glad to be part of Europeana Network Association and to greet you as a representative within the Europeana Members Council. Since 2010, I work as a researcher and engineer at <a href=\"http://www.ait.ac.at/\">AIT</a> – Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, contributing to the development of several Europeana Network Projects.<br><br>\r\nA while ago, back in 2002, I started to get in contact with the tangible and intangible European cultural heritage, as an Erasmus exchange student in <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/place/base/42987\">Angers</a>, the capital of Region d’Anjou, situated in at the beginning of Val de Loire (France). That was happening during my engineering study at Technical University from <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/entity/place/base/38001\">Cluj Napoca</a>, the most important city within the historical province of Transilvania (Romania). One year later, I started my Phd Studies in <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/entity/place/base/81144\">Klagenfurt </a>Am Wörthersee, the capital of the Carinthia County in Austria. Here, my work focused on software engineering, knowledge management and recommendation systems research areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/e44500c2d6035c65007c06328f1b9443.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 448px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Le vainqueur au cheval blanc and Tenture de l'Apocalypse, Première pièce | Jan Bondol, PMR Maeyaert, CC BY-NC-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing services for the Europeana Platform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While enjoying the opportunity of becoming a culture snacker through my work on Europeana Network projects, my main responsibilities are still related to research work and technology development. Consequently, at AIT we are pleased to welcome the latest developments in the Europeana APIs, which aim at breaking the language barriers; improving the access and the understanding; and facilitating sharing of cultural assets.<br><br>\r\nConcretely, through the support of the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/entities\">Entity API</a>, users and third party applications are able to access contextual information about named entities used in Europeana. For the time being, semantic and multilingual information about persons, locations and classification schemes are made available. In the next months, more functionalities powered by this API will enhance the user experience in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/2022404-bjc-cs-cpo-151-jpg.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cluj-Napoca, vedere panoramică and Kolozsvár látképe, Images Of Old Cluj, Public Domain </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public release of the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations\">Annotation API</a> was set for production within the scope of Europeana Sounds project. Its functionality opens a new gate for end users, which are able now to contribute with their contextual knowledge to Europeana. In the same time, this API offers new opportunities for development of third party applications that re-use Europeana content.<br><br>\r\nSeveral successful prototypes were developed in the past years to enhance the user experience and demonstrate the potential of re-using cultural heritage objects. One of my favorites is <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23culturecam&amp;src=typd\">CultureCam</a>, which demonstrates how the access to image content can be made more attractive and interactive for the end users. Still, the underlying value of the prototype is provided by the high quality content, which was manually curated for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/prtschach-urn-nbn-si-img-j8xp7o66.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 377px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pörtschach am Wörthersee (Kärnten), National And University Library Of Slovenia, Public Domain Marked</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reinforcing the ecosystem as a software engineer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the rows above, I shortly introduced a few services and applications to whose implementation I contributed as developer. As software engineer and researcher I am willing to share my expertise within the Europeana Members Council and support the enrichment of the Europeana Platform, with more services offered to application developers and enhanced experience for end users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am looking forward to actively support the exciting activities carried out within the Europeana Members Council, and to contribute to further developments of the Europeana ecosystem. Not the last, I want to send a big thank to the individuals that supported me for getting the sit in the Council!<br><br></p>"

        body: "<p>When I was young, I loved walking through exhibitions and guided tours that made History come alive. Every time, it felt like entering a time-machine that could bring me to wherever I wanted in time and space. Growing up in the 80's meant growing up with computers and video games, which, at that time, was a completely different world. Stories from the past told by museum curators in front of hundreds and thousands years old artefacts were not intended to be part of video games. There was no way to connect the playability and the colourful graphics with the cultural heritage. I am glad this picture has changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/museum1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 349px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a88280b4-8040-7e8c-a0e7-0d03f3d249d0\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Archaeological Museum, Mexico City, Cornell University Library, No known copyright restrictions. Remix by Susanne Danelius.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Digital cultural heritage - electric dreams coming true!</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As a museum curator, I wanted to make stories come to life in exhibitions. When I started working at the archives, I saw the incredible potential of connecting all different kinds of related cultural heritage information, which were mostly described with traditional methods created over a long time. Objects and documents that were part of the same collection or held in a single institution could be fragmented across several types of organisations. At the time, creating connections meant a lot of research work for manually making those links. Slowly but surely, the cultural institutions entered a whole new digital era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started working with digitisation issues and got involved in several European projects about digital cultural heritage such as<a href=\"http://www.dc-net.org/\"> DC-NET</a>,<a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/\"> Linked Heritage</a>,<a href=\"http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/heritage-showcases/dch-rp/dch-rp-roadmap-for-preservation\"> DCH-RP</a>,<a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/\"> Athena Plus.</a> For the last five years, I worked at<a href=\"http://www.digisam.se/?lang=en\"> Digisam</a>, a secretariat responsible for the Swedish national coordination of digitisation, digital preservation and digital access to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since January, I am the project leader at Swedish National Archives to promote the state authorities efforts in creating access to digital information and open data. Part of our work is to inspire, motivate and support authorities to increase the usefulness of the information and to publish information on data availability and access. It implies collecting and publishing lists of available<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-legislation-reuse-public-sector-information\"> Public Sector Information (PSI)</a> from government authorities, encouraging state authorities to publish open data according to common guidelines, managing and developing the national open data portal<a href=\"http://oppnadata.se/\"> oppnadata.se</a>, connected to<a href=\"https://www.europeandataportal.eu/\"> European Data Portal</a>, and also managing guidelines about open data, published in a<a href=\"http://www.vidareutnyttjande.se/\"> web tutorial.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cultural heritage information and open data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, why should we publish Cultural heritage information as open data? Open data creates new opportunities for cost-effective management and increased access to information that various stakeholders can use in education, products and innovative services. To create a better understanding of the collections and help people to engage in different ways, by searching, using, re-using or developing products, the access to more open data is a first requirement. Here, Europeana has done a fantastic work pushing forward<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements#CC0\"> CC0-licences</a> for metadata, making it possible for developers and users to freely create applications based on the material from Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/picture-2-new.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-a88280b4-8042-6fa1-f9c2-a217b4c9a7e1\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Picture by Susanne Danelius, CC-BY</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Open data, semantic web, and big data technology are also opening up new possibilities for linking information across sector boundaries, which gives a deeper meaning and significance, adds value, engages users, and creates wider re-use of digital cultural heritage information. Nowadays, we can reach a wider audience, create digital stories and engage users. You can make virtual tours through museums from home, and interact with cultural institutions through social media. Games and apps about museum collections are a reality, and facilitate significance of the museums in a digital era.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the main point about open data is that cultural heritage is a part of the massive amount of societal information. Linking together different kinds of digital information creates new stories, and a whole new way of enriching our understanding of cultural heritage and its impact in society.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Inspire makers to creatively transform Europe’s digital cultural heritage'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>We recently launched the Europeana ‘makers pilot’, a programme of research and promotional activities to explore how to harness the value of Europeana’s free to reuse content for makers. The maker movement is no less diverse or easier defined than the contested market it sits within, the creative industries. However, we know that it is a dynamic, digitally connected, innovative and independent community. There is a continued need for inspiration and resource to help the movement to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/508821/the-difference-between-makers-and-manufacturers/\">disrupt</a> traditional manufacturing processes and to deliver the anticipated <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/reynolds/speaker_series/pdf/Maker%20Market%20Study%20FINAL.pdf\">third industrial revolution</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is where Europeana comes in. Europeana’s digital heritage content, drawn from the collections of over 3500 cultural heritage institutions across Europe, has the potential to inspire new designs, products and businesses. Our focus in the maker market will be high level amateur and professional makers who can demonstrate originality and excellence in using digital and technological means (eg computer-aided design, 3D printing or laser cutters) in concept, design and process to produce digital or physical products.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A focus on our content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next nine months we will run three campaigns highlighting a specific area of our content that could provide inspiration for makers. The first campaign is dedicated to Art Nouveau, to echo the respective thematic <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/02/welcome-to-art-nouveau-season-on-europeana-art/\">season</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style\">exhibition</a>. Until the end of May, we will publish regular blogs on Europeana Labs highlighting what we think is the most interesting free to re-use content for makers from our Art Nouveau collection. These content picks will come from the Europeana Labs’ <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data\">datasets</a> and our <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/\">Pinterest Boards</a> and we will coordinate when possible with the expert <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/tag/art-nouveau/\">blogs</a> written from our partners. The content focus for the second and third campaigns (July to August and November 2017, respectively) will be announced soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Events and research</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will attend a few local and international events to promote Europeana’s offer for makers, and we are keen to explore other promotional opportunities where we can reach high level amateur and professional makers. We are also planning a programme of consultation with professionals in the creative industries and peers in the cultural heritage sector with three objectives. Firstly, to explore our understanding of the makers market and how makers could use our content; secondly, to consider potential partnership opportunities; and finally, to engage our network to understand better the existing activity linking cultural heritage and makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get involved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:reuse@europeana.eu\">Email us</a> if you have ideas on the type of content makers could make use of, how makers could (re-)use Europeana’s incredible content, or to share expertise as we begin exploring this market. Join the conversation on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs?lang=en\">Twitter</a> with #MakeWithEuropeana. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Hear from The IPR community: Gordon McKenna tells us about SPECTRUM'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>We have created a small IPR community of aggregators within the DSI2 project who share best practice and draw on their experience when managing IPR in their collections and archives. Central to being able to benefit from new ways to share cultural heritage online, it is important that the underlying procedures and standards which enable access to users remain relevant. Here, Gordon McKenna tells us about SPECTRUM and practical rights management procedures.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Collections Trust is the UK-based knowledge centre for the management and use of collections and technology in museums, archives and libraries. <a href=\"http://collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum/\">SPECTRUM</a>, developed by The Collections Trust, is the UK Museum Collections Management Standard and set outs key museum procedures such as acquisitions and the information required to support these procedures. First developed in the early 1990s, SPECTRUM has evolved with participation of practitioners from all parts of the cultural heritage sector throughout the UK, including national, local and volunteer-run museums. The aim was to reach a shared understanding of how to best manage collections practically, and this has been proven to work across all areas of the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our standards are used internationally in several countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Portugal and Brazil to help make cultural heritage accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-04/eventrbrite-image-ipr2-1-.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making it easier to manage and share cultural heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as written collections management procedures, our CultureGrid platform is a central point to aggregate some three million object records representing UK collections. It makes them available to Europeana and other digital platforms. This includes the Collections Trust led Europeana<a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\"> Food and Drink</a> project. We are working on sustainable ways to link and share collections online within the emerging UK digital culture strategy and the Europeana platform. Ways to standardise, manage and share cultural heritage are embedded in Europeana’s models of best practice including the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a>. Having a streamlined approach for managing collections and in this case rights at a national level will help reinforce the importance of understanding the copyright status of collections and archives, and the role it plays in being able to share cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making it easier to manage rights for museum activities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After more than thirty years experience advising organisations on how to best manage collection information and make it meaningful, I have come to the conclusion that there are two states of mind when faced with managing rights; little awareness of what copyright is and why it is important in the context of being able to share cultural heritage; and inertia once they realise that what they did in the past with their collections may have legal implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPECTRUM’s Rights Management Procedure is designed to overcome these perceptions and support practitioners with their day to day activities. While the first two versions of SPECTRUM (1994 and 1997) didn’t feature a separate procedure for rights management, a new Rights management procedure was introduced in 2005 for the third edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the updated procedure, SPECTRUM also supports the way the rights information metadata is managed in an organisation’s collections management system. This can include information about the object itself (such as the type; title; material; dimensions; subject of intellectual and visual content), the connections to events during an item’s existence, and its connections to persons, organisations, and places. SPECTRUM also defines which units of information should be supported by terminologies or authority files, such as the object names, styles, materials, and actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will launch an updated version in June 2017, the fifth version will feature three sections: researching rights, obtaining licences or permissions you do not have (Rights in), and granting rights and permissions to others (Rights out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about SPECTRUM can be found online: <a href=\"http://collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum/\"> collectionstrust.org.uk/spectrum/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Europeana content can now be easily discovered in a new and fun way: <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/\">Kennisland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.studioparkers.nl/\">Studio Parkers </a>and <a href=\"http://www.sarakolster.com/\">Sara Kostler</a> have developed <a href=\"http://www.art-tab.eu/\">Art Up Your Ta</a>b, a new plugin for Chrome which displays a full screen painting or photograph for each newly open tab or window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plug-in selects artworks from the rich collection of Europeana: gathering approximately 30 million images, of which 200 thousand meet the (technical) quality criteria for Art Up Your Tab, it offers an easy and entertaining way to discover arts and culture in the familiar surroundings of the user's’ web browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Switching away from the blank screen users would often see when opening a new window in their browser, they can now get inspired and informed by Europeana content and easily integrate cultural heritage in their everyday activities without even having to search for artworks. The image is displayed full screen and without text, and web users are invited to click on it to find out more about the background of the specific work, their author, or the institution it belongs to. They can also download the image in full resolution, and get information about the terms of use. Launched on 28 March, the plugin already received a great response with users tweeting they couldn’t stop opening new tabs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first version of Art Up Your Tab focusses on Europeana artworks provided by Dutch heritage institutions, with more contributions by other European countries to come. The current selection of enticing images has been selected by Kennisland. Curation of specific themes or storylines might be directly suggested by cultural heritage institutions in the future, enabling digital heritage collections to increase their visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/start-art-up-your-tab/goibibekpmcmkmnopafijgckplpghpho\">Install the Chrome extension</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Between 27 and 31 March 2017, we joined educational institutions, publishers, academics, students and enthusiasts from across the world at the fifth <a href=\"https://www.openeducationweek.org/\">Open Education Week</a>. We held <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana4education-at-open-education-week-2017\">two Europeana4Education webinars</a> on Wednesday 29 March as part of this global campaign celebrating Open Education, joining a schedule of approximately <a href=\"https://www.openeducationweek.org/events\">130 local and digital events</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/7m4WGWsBr8r9bX\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\r\n<strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana4education-at-open-education-week-2017-webinar-slides\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana4Education at Open Education Week 2017 - webinar slides\">Europeana4Education at Open Education Week 2017 - webinar slides</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As an open repository or resource, Europeana’s digital content - drawn from Europe’s cultural heritage institutions - can bring value to education in many formats and settings, from the formal to the informal and from secondary education to lifelong learning. The webinars were a great opportunity to raise awareness about our goals for <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Europeana4Education\">Europeana4Education</a>, and reaffirm how we aim to achieve them through <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationalpartnerships\">partnerships</a> and the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Europeana4Educationcommunity\">Europeana4Education community</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana4education-at-open-education-week-2017-webinar-slides\">each webinar</a> we highlighted the educational potential of Europeana’s content and services. This included an overview ofEuropeana’s diversity of digitised cultural heritage content, an introduction of the free tools we provide to enable access and re-use of our content (including our manual search and download function and the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana APIs</a>); and a presentation of the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation\">financial support</a> Europeana can offer in the development of educational resources featuring our content. We had a small but engaged audience for each session, receiving questions and feedback at the end of each webinar and later by email. This included questions about educational re-use cases, and feedback such as whether we could create ‘alerts’ or updates for educators when new content is published.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/4education.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also published key resources on the Open Education Week platform; our <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana4education-introductory-leaflet\">introduction to Europeana4Education</a>, our <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/a-guide-to-using-europeana-for-education\">guide to using Europeana in education</a> and our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">Policy Recommendations for education and learning</a>. You can also find these resources on our newly launched <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Europeana4Education\">Europeana4Education</a> area on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana4education-at-open-education-week-2017-webinar-slides\">our presentation slides</a> and join the Europeana4Education <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332\">LinkedIn group</a> to get access to the forthcoming video of the webinars.

        body: "<p>I was working at the Hungarian National Gallery (Budapest) when I had my first serious experiences in the field of digitisation in 2005–2006. At that time, our task was the implementation of an integrated collection management system for all the collections of the museum. From the 11th-century mediaeval stone carvings, through the special collection of the late Gothic winged altarpieces, to the 19th-century Hungarian historical paintings, and the installations of contemporary art: I had to manage all the visual and textual data of the objects conserved in the different departments of the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coordination of the whole process led me to the special field of museum informatics, which has been in the forefront of my professional interest since more than ten years. I have spent years harmonising information of various collections and objects as a museologist, art historian by profession. In parallel, I have done research on special art historical fields, in the domains of the ornamental art, the theory of ornament, the European pattern book collections, and the history of art education. My research interest in art history met my interest in museum informatics when I started working as the Head of collection and Curator at the <a href=\"http://www.scholagraphidis.org/\">Schola Graphidis Art Collection</a> (Budapest) at the very end of 2014, in a special education-related collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__3731.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/e-310-i-033-pl-33-hero-img-schgra.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 323px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__3731.html\"><em>Plate 33. La Plante et ses applications ornementales, Paris : Librairie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, High School Of Visual Arts, Budapest, CC BY-SA</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My very first meeting with Europeana dates back to the years spent in the <a href=\"http://mng.hu/en\">Hungarian National Gallery</a>, when the institution took part in the <a href=\"http://athenaplus.eu/\">AthenaPlus</a> project. I could continue my work on same project in my next position, which is now my current role. In the last phase of the AthenaPlus project, I had the opportunity to participate in a very interesting experiment initiated and led by Regine Stein focusing on the enriched description of museum objects in LIDO, using the Getty thesauri. The consequences of this attempt were interesting, both on the collection side and for research, and led me to the elaboration of the more detailed standardised description of special object types like <a href=\"http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/UC/issue/view/464/showToc\">ornamental prints</a> and <a href=\"http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/cidoc/ConferenceGuidelines/prints_casts_lido_getty_julia_katona_end.pdf\">plaster casts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__3716.html?q=schola+graphidis+verneuil\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/e-310-i-018-pl-17.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 298px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__3716.html?q=schola+graphidis+verneuil\">Plate 17. La Plante et ses applications ornementales, Paris : Librairie Centrale des Beaux-Arts, High School Of Visual Arts, Budapest, CC BY-SA</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might sound a little bit strange, but this initiative is very similar to the thematically arranged contents of the Europeana platform. So, what makes it so interesting for us? Europeana gets to a crossroad, where the quantitative approach of mass digitisation should turn into a kind of qualitative paradigm. It can be achieved by standardising the enriched description of objects as much as possible. In my opinion, this could lead to the recontextualisation of existing digital content, and could open the path for scientific research. When I submitted my application for one of the seats in the Members Council, I have campaigned for the thematic recontextualisation of the digital items published on Europeana. Since the interpretation and reinterpretation, contextualisation and re-contextualisation are the highlighted pillars of Europeana, I hope my contribution as an art historian, curator and researcher will be useful and constructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        body: "<p>On 15 March, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/jan-mueller-elected-chairman-of-europeana-foundation\">Jan Muller</a>,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/jan-mueller-elected-chairman-of-europeana-foundation\"> </a>Chair of Europeana Foundation<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/jan-mueller-elected-chairman-of-europeana-foundation\">,</a> presented the perspective of Cultural Heritage institutions at the MEP Library Lovers event debating the effects of the EU Copyright reform. The full report is available below. If you would like to know more about EU Copyright reform and what it means for Cultural heritage institutions, a good starting point it to read <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate?utm_source=Europeana+Office+Staff&amp;utm_campaign=1d6c7ddfeb-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_01_31&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5c1a0caa5c-1d6c7ddfeb-143166889\">Europeana’s mandate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/copyrightframework.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 481px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Experts from libraries and cultural heritage institutions talked about how copyright reform could empower Europe’s over 100 million library users and address some of the challenges public libraries are currently facing in the EU.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 15 March, the MEP Library Lovers group held a debate on EU copyright reform and its potential impact on libraries and cultural heritage institutions. The debate was hosted by <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124968/THERESE_COMODINI+CACHIA_home.html\">Therese Comodini Cachia</a> MEP (JURI Committee Rapporteur) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and we were pleased to see many of her colleagues engaging in the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEP Library Lover <strong>Therese Comodini Cachia</strong> opened the session, highlighting the crucial role that libraries play in building strong local communities and a vibrant and inclusive European culture. She underlined her ambitious approach to the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, for example by increasing the number of beneficiaries to the exception on Text and Data Mining. She recognised the importance of empowering cultural heritage institutions to digitise content and make it available so that all can benefit. She declared herself a proud member of the MEP Library Lovers Group and encouraged other MEPs to join. The panel of speakers underlined the need for a change to allow on the premises access to digital works, cross-border document supply and mass digitisation of out of commerce works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben White</strong>, Head of Intellectual Property at the British Library, presented the case for an update to the copyright exception on “dedicated terminals” – a notion introduced by the 2001 Copyright Directive and one which, 16 years after, is somewhat outdated. He argued that library users should be allowed to access the library’s digital collection on the premises via secure networks but on their own devices, which makes sense for a society of smartphones and portable laptops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frédéric Blin</strong>, Director for Preservation and Heritage Collections at the National University Library of Strasbourg, pointed out that libraries are obliged to apply restrictive licenses, restraining access to knowledge and differentiating users based on country of residence, which is contrary to the principles of the EU. Cross-border document delivery among libraries is unfortunately still incredibly difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Teresa Hackett</strong>, Copyright and Libraries Programme Manager for EIFL (Electronic Information for Libraries), focused on document supply and the need for a cross-border exception. Ad-hoc cross-border document supply between libraries, for non-commercial purposes, is vital for research and makes total sense in our modern societies where the Internet has made access to information so much easier. As she said, content of historical value for some countries is often held in libraries in other countries, but the latter cannot legally provide information because the current copyright exception stops at the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jan Muller</strong>, Chairman of the Europeana Foundation, addressed the problem of out of commerce works and the difficulty of clearing rights for 20th century works, including an important range of documents that were never in commerce to begin with. Ultimately, digitisation is all about giving visibility to cultural heritage so, as <strong>Ben White</strong> added, if an adequate licence is not available, an exception for commercially unavailable material is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEP Library Lover group sponsor,<a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/4545/CATHERINE_STIHLER_home.html\"> <strong>Catherine Stihler</strong></a>, concluded that Europe needs a better legal framework for libraries. As IMCO Committee Rapporteur, she encouraged her colleagues to join her in this. She finally congratulated the speakers and organisers for their great work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find more information about the position of the European library sector in our joint position paper <a href=\"http://meplibrarygroup.eu/index.php/2017/03/17/786/\">here</a>.

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>by Roxanne Peters </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, Europeana facilitated its second national workshop at <a href=\"http://www.bne.es/es/Inicio/index.html\">The Biblioteca Nacional de España on</a> 18 January. A cross-team effort, this workshop marked Joris Pekel’s last opportunity to ‘transform the world with culture’ in a Europeana capacity and charted <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/pablo-uceda-gomez\">Pablo Uceda Gómez</a>’s success as a multi-talented facilitator, translator and tour guide all rolled into one! Representatives from the Ministry together with organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/home\">Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza,</a> the <a href=\"http://www.patrimonionacional.es/\">Patrimonio Nacional</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.man.es/man/home.html\">Museo Arqueologico Nacional </a>and <a href=\"http://platoniq.net/en/\">Platoniq</a> met to exchange their experiences of Spanish institutions’ approach to the management and sharing of their digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/madrid.jpg\" style=\"width: 553px; height: 379px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Local lessons for open data and re-use</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an introduction by Europeana on the value of using the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">publishing framework</a> to help inform institutional strategy, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/javier-espadas\">Javier Espadas</a>, Chief Technology Officer at Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (a private collection of iconic artworks), started the session with a great overview of their approach for opening data and encouraging re-use. He traced the development of their online digital presence since 1998. Outlining the organisation’s business model, Javier reaffirmed the benefits of opening data as well as balancing commercial interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paving the way for Poland following changes to the copyright law post Communist rule, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/mikolaj-machowski\">Mikołaj Machowski</a>, Deputy Manager of the Visual Documentation Department at <a href=\"http://www.mnw.art.pl/en/\">The National Museum in Warsaw</a>, also shared insights into their commitment to reach audiences on digital platforms. The institution participated in the<a href=\"http://www.partage-plus.eu/\"> PartagePlus project </a>showcasing their Art Nouveau collections, and collaborated on a Wikipedia GLAM project in 2015 . Both projects have greatly increased the visibility of the collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Identifying challenges and opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following these examples, an engaging session fuelled healthy debate! In the company of IPR specialists, discussion points included the fear of losing control and attribution when publishing online and the problems faced in interpreting complex copyright law. However people agreed that publishing online can increase visibility and reinforce the value of cataloguing good quality data, and also enables institutions to learn more about the audience behaviour, which can help to reach new users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/madrid2.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Encouraging a collective move towards openness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our recently elected councillor Dr <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/antje-schmidt\">Antje Schmidt</a>, Head of Digital Cataloguing and Collection Online at the <a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe </a>(MKG), kicked off the afternoon session. Quoting founder Rudolf Dührkoop, she highlighted that <em>‘we are custodians rather than owners of the collections’</em>, and explained the MKG’s transition to an open collections policy. She reinforced the principles of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Europeana’s public domain charter </a>together with international business models of openness and the impact these have on society. Since the MKG made public domain works available to download without any registration, there have been more than 28,000 downloads (including more than 7,600 direct downloads, sharing and access via metadata). She encouraged a collective move towards openness, inviting participants to Hamburg to start a conversation at the second <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/sharing-is-caring-hamburg-2017\">Sharing is Caring</a> event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connecting with new audiences </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led participants to further discuss ways of connecting with audiences. Museums recognised tourists as their main visitors, acknowledging that young audiences are stimulated by ways to engage digitally and quickly lose interest if they can’t reuse the content. A debate focused on ways of targeting new audiences. One recurring message was the importance of storytelling - how to connect, engage, share and inspire others with creative narratives based on the collections and archives made visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is next? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants wrapped up the session by sharing their main learnings from the workshop. They agreed on the advantages of bringing communities together, and to openly discuss current debates and decision making when it comes to opening collections at a national level. It is clear that some data partners need more support with the ingestion process, and that nuances encountered in sharing collections from different domains need to be recognised. There is still apprehension about ‘losing control’ when publishing collections online. Here, Europeana can provide tools and frameworks to help institutions adopt an approach that best works for them, and reinforce the value of the Network as an active hub of shared expertise, interests and best practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Reinforcing the European dream 60 years after the signing of the treaty of Rome'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Saturday marked the 60th anniversary of the signing of the treaty of Rome: on this occasion, the 27 national leaders gathered in the Campidoglio palace of the Italian capital, where the 6 founding states (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) signed the founding treaty on 25 March 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Presidents and Prime ministers from all EU countries (with the exception of the UK) were gathered to celebrate 60 years of European integration, peace &amp; cultural cooperation. Events were also attended by the European Parliament president Antonio Tajani; the European Council president Donald Tusk, and the European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker. A number of discussions were held to recall Europe's achievements, and reflect on Europe’s new direction with 27 member states following the Bexit, that the the European Commission introduced earlier in the month with a publication of a white paper on the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/white_paper_on_the_future_of_europe_en.pdf\">Future of Europe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/xaE4bpUPwtQqXP\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\r\n<strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/60th-anniversary-of-the-treaty-of-rome-jan-mller-25-march-2017-rome\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"60th anniversary of the treaty of Rome, Jan Müller, 25 March 2017, Rome\">60th anniversary of the treaty of Rome, Jan Müller, 25 March 2017, Rome</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/jan-mueller-elected-chairman-of-europeana-foundation\">Jan Mueller</a>, as chair of Europeana Foundation Governing Board, was invited to speak about the role of culture. His presentation ‘<em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qBb9AloSWGBvseILQOoTW9SG4iRyV13q7ssnSCQ32jE/edit#slide=id.g1f21edc255_0_0\">Digging into the origins of the European Dream</a></em>’ reinforced that the European dream is still valid. As much as the treaty belongs to our heritage, he stressed that its fundamental ideas are still very much alive. Its core values set the objective of ‘an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe’, the ‘drive to assure the economic and social progress of all countries’ and the subsequent ‘elimination of the barriers which divide Europe’. These are also values Europeana is built on. Over the past 15 years, European Member States have digitised over 300 million artworks, books, radio recordings and film footage. These resources, making heritage available to all, represent every aspect of our rich and diverse cultures: “our histories, philosophies and artistic interpretations are not only diverse, but also very much interlinked. Influential movements such as the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and Art Nouveau never started in isolation but spread throughout our continent with transformative speed”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/jeanmonnetsmall.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea of economic and social progress made possible by a common market was further extended in the Lisbon Treaty, with the ambition to invest in a strong knowledge economy. Much of our heritage is not digitised yet or suitable for creative re-use, and there are still many hurdles to overcome before we can speak of a ‘digital single market’. But our cultural institutions and creative industries will continue their efforts and keep on working together, helped by Europeana, to create completely new experiences. What for Jean Monnet was only a (desirable) utopia —\"If I had to do it again, I would begin with culture\"— is something that Europeana has been putting into practice since its launch, It is essential to keep that dream alive.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Jan Neumann, Head of Legal Affairs and Organisation at the North Rhine Westphalian Library Service Centre and Project Manager of the OER World Map project.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-left: -14pt;text-align: right;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Europeana joins 665 organisations featured on the OER World Map, and is now part of an audience including potential new partners, developers of open educational learning resources, policy makers, teachers and learners from right across the world.</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/europe-map3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 495px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Educational Resources (<a href=\"https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/What_is_OER%3F\">OER</a>) are openly licensed learning materials, which can be accessed, stored, used, modified and distributed free of charge. OER make up one important building block of <a href=\"http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC101436/jrc101436.pdf\">Open Education</a>, a broader movement aiming at innovating educational systems by using digitalisation and cooperation for widening access to education. After more than 10 years of development, the Open Education movement has grown to such a size that it is impossible to keep track of all ongoing activity. To address this challenge, the OER World Map collects and visualises data on organisations, persons, projects, services and events related to OER on behalf of the Open Education movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is in it for Europeana?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The OER World Map provides three core services for the OER movement. Firstly, for <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:2eedf9a0-0f60-4c5a-8a8b-a05af1275761\">repositories like Europeana</a>, it provides a platform that allows global users to find key information about the featured institutions’ <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:2dc5cd12-763f-4484-9929-b3b0c994e502\">offer for the Open Educational community</a> (which can be filtered e.g. by language or subject). Secondly, like a social network, it connects OER actors with each other. This facilitates the sharing of <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">experiences</a>,<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\"> </a>o<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">p</a>p<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">o</a>r<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">t</a>u<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">n</a>i<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">t</a>i<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">e</a>s<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\"> </a>(<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">l</a>i<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">k</a>e<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\"> </a>Europeana’s first <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Event#urn:uuid:fb9ce4cc-1800-49d6-8a46-30dcb207b681\">matchfunding call</a><a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?filter.about.@type=Article\">)</a> and resources. Initiatives such as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education\">Europeana4Education</a> can benefit from collective learning by both contributing their experience and benefitting from the expertise of this vast Open Education network. Finally, it demonstrates <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/aggregation/\">the scale</a> of the worldwide OER movement by providing statistics on OER, which supports policy makers in issuing and defending decisions in favour of OER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next for the OER World Map?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is always room for enhancement! During <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2017/03/20/open-education-week-2017-making-sense-of-the-oer-world-map-through-the-use-of-folksonomies/\">Open Education Week</a>, we are planning to highlight how helpful lists about key topics (like, for example, <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?q=&amp;filter.about.keywords=textbooks\">all activity related to textbooks</a> <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?q=&amp;filter.about.keywords=textbooks\">o</a>r<a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?q=&amp;filter.about.keywords=textbooks\"> </a><a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?q=&amp;filter.about.keywords=oer+research\">a list of OER researchers and research projects</a>) can be easily generated by the help of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy\">folksonomies</a>. We are also currently working on providing a country map interface within the scope of the <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/urn:uuid:3f11cdbd-a74a-4aa4-83b3-b4148bfdbe82\">OERInfo funding guideline</a>, the first major German OER program, which started at the end of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have set out our <a href=\"https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/milestones\">plans</a> to add long term value to the global Open Education movement. To achieve these, the participation of the whole OER community is needed. If you have not done so yet, follow <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/resource/?q=europeana#urn:uuid:2dc5cd12-763f-4484-9929-b3b0c994e502\">Europeana’s example</a> and <a href=\"https://oerworldmap.org/user/register\">join us</a> in mapping the world of OER today!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The OER World Map is funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and driven by the North Rhine Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) in cooperation with graphthinking GmbH and the Open University UK.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        body: "<p>We believe that Europeana’s content has value for all areas of education; from the formal to the informal, from primary education to lifelong learning. We made education our top priority reuse market in 2017, and today we are launching the Europeana4Education initiative to help us inspire learners and enrich educational resources with Europeana content. Building on our existing projects and partnerships in education, we created a dedicated <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education\">education area</a> on Europeana Pro. You can now explore our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationalpartnerships\">partnerships</a>, browse <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationcasestudies\">case studies</a> of educational applications, resources and platforms featuring Europeana content, and get practical help from our collection of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educational-resources\">useful resources</a>. We also invite everyone who believes in the added value Europeana can bring to education to join the new Europeana4Education <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/europeana4education-community\">community</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shaping innovative education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our resources range from guides and presentations to content picks and policy documents. You can find two new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educational-resources\">resources</a> that we developed specially on the occasion of the launch: a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Use_your_data/Europeanaforeducation/Resources/europeana4education-march2017.pdf\">two page leaflet</a> introduces Europeana4Education and highlights some great reuse cases; and the new ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Use_your_data/Europeanaforeducation/Resources/a-guide-to-using-europeana-for-education-march-2017.pdf\">Guide to using Europeana in education</a>’ explains the basic concepts you need to understand to start using our content in education; such as search tips, licences for educational use, the Europeana API and crediting Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/4education.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 452px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Use_your_data/Europeanaforeducation/Resources/a-guide-to-using-europeana-for-education-march-2017.pdf\">new guide</a> to using Europeana for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationcasestudies\">case studies</a> focus on inspirational educational portals, digital resources and applications that use Europeana for learning. Examples include the platform <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">Historiana</a>, which provides sources on some of the most important themes for history educators; a <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/world-war-i-battle-perspectives/id1048044178\">Multi-Touch book and an iTunes U course</a> featuring Europeana 1914-1918’s unique WW1 content; and <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/apps/faces/\">ArtStories FACES</a>, an app introducing great art in a fun and educational way to children aged 5-11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our existing governmental, commercial and noncommercial partners are profiled on our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationalpartnerships\">partnerships page</a> on Europeana Pro. We rely on their industry expertise and direct connection to educational communities to raise awareness of Europeana’s educational potential and increase the use of Europeana’s content in education. As a result, we will continue to work with new and existing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationalpartnerships\">partners</a> to increase educational access to our <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">content</a>, <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">technology</a> and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation\">funding</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get involved: join the Europeana4Education community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From policy makers to educators, we welcome everyone who believes that digital cultural heritage can enrich educational experiences. We organise the community in three ways. Firstly, you can explore our vision for the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/europeana4education-community\">Europeana4Education</a> community on Europeana Pro. We also invite you to join the community on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332\">LinkedIn</a>: this online group is open for anyone interested in discussing relevant topics and possible projects with like-minded peers, and we will encourage the sharing of best practice and case studies of Europeana content in education. Finally, engage with us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\">Twitter</a> by using the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23europeana4education\">#Europeana4Education</a> hashtag to spread the word and encourage participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We’re also holding <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana4education-at-open-education-week-2017\">webinars</a> on 29 March as part of <a href=\"https://www.openeducationweek.org/\">Open Education Week 2017</a> - register if you want to find out more!

        body: "<p>In Greece, libraries are currently in a state of development. They haven’t yet matured as much as the norm is with other European countries, which can make our work a bit more demanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a background in Librarianship, which I studied on an undergraduate level, before completing a Master’s degree in Information Technology Management. I am currently Head of Technical Services and responsible of digital projects in the<a href=\"http://mmb.org.gr/\"> Music Library of Greece</a>. My first career years were focused on describing information and making it accessible through the library’s catalogue. But things in the information era changed rapidly, and we are now facing the knowledge era: new potentials, new projects and new services were introduced for libraries and cultural organisations focusing on content and its creative use, making it usable for the community. Our main focus has become to get our collections out there instead of just reshuffling books around. Therefore, cultural heritage both on tangible and virtual forms is becoming part of our daily life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/vera.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Il codice </em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squarcialupi_Codex\"><em>Squarcialupi,</em></a><em> Ms. Mediceo Palatino 87, Biblioteca laurenziana di Firenze. </em><em>(reprint 1992), Music Library of Greece</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was around 2013 when we decided to change the Music Library’s profile, transforming our organisation towards a cultural institution that could embark in many different activities, involving digital heritage as well. We started putting up theatrical plays for children and several different music educational programmes within the Athens Concert Hall. Some of them were digital form such as <em>Mitida</em> and<em> Euterpe</em>, and received funding from national resources. Our main goals were to motivate the community to get closer to the Library, to get to know our audience better and to provide incentives for music education. For that reason, we created a network of schools and music conservatories that led us to develop new technological applications that made it easy to promote our goals outside Library’s walls. In other words, my job focus changed rapidly and decisively towards new pathways I also got involved with the fundraising team that was established within the Library’s bounds as an outcome of the organization’s restructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My involvement with Europeana came as a natural outcome and started 6 years ago, when I first visited<a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/en\"> The National Library of Netherlands</a> in The Hague (KB) for UDC Seminar as a network member. This was an experience of major impact: I had the chance to interact with people with common interests from all across Europe. The next step towards my Europeana involvement was carried out in 2014, when I had the opportunity to be part of the Content Reuse Task Force that provided input for <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. Meanwhile, the Library participated as content provider in two major Europeana projects, namely Europeana Sounds and EUScreenXL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2016, I got elected at the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/management-board-members-council\">Members Council</a>, the body that represents all those professionals involved with Europeana, and I set myself several goals to achieve. Firstly, to help find creative ways to make cultural content more visible and, even more importantly, usable for different audiences. Furthermore, I believe that it is crucial to invest on the impact of Europeana, and I will try my best to advocate for its vital role in the field of cultural heritage in Europe.</p>\r\n"

The Chair of the Europeana Network Association, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, kicked off the meeting with a very warm welcome and introduced the full two-day programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introductory session was a true ice-breaker exercise where some Councillors shared their experience: <em>“I joined the Europeana Members Council in 2015 because I found it exciting to be part of a large group of people of various backgrounds and exchange ideas on how to improve Europeana and its network,”</em> said <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/wim-van-dongen\">Wim van Dongen</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revised Strategy, Business Plan, campaigns, and more</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Management Board was formally introduced, and the Councillors were presented with some highly relevant information such as the new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/a-call-to-culture-recalibrating-our-2020-strategy-1\">Europeana strategic positioning</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/business-plan-2017-spreading-the-word\">Business Plan 2017</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General%20Assembly%20Meeting%202016/paper-6-association-provisional-budget-2017.pdf\">Association budget</a>, and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General%20Assembly%20Meeting%202016/paper-8-association-activity-plan-2017.pdf\">Activity Plan</a> for the year. They also had an opportunity to learn more about the next <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/campaigns/allezculture\">#AllezCulture</a> campaigns, including <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-allezliterature-campaign-kicks-off-with-a-love-transcribathon\">#AllezLiterature</a>, and the Association’s input for the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/culture/news/20160830-commission-proposal-cultural-heritage-2018_en\">European Year of Cultural Heritage proposed for 2018</a>. Another focus was an endorsement of the new Europeana Aspiration and Europeana Network Association Approach that were refined following the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/Members%20Council%20meeting%20minutes/mc-meeting-minutes-2016-11-07-riga.pdf\">feedback of the Council</a> at and since the last meeting in November 2016 in Riga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Association engagement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors actively participated in three different sessions designed to reflect on the best ways to increase the Association engagement and Members Council representation. This was further emphasised by <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/marcin-werla\">Marcin Werla</a>: <em>“Councillors should all actively participate within the Association and promote Europeana to their own communities!”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Task Forces and Working Groups review </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics discussed on the second day evolved around the overview and evaluation of the Europeana Network Association’s existing and proposed <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces\">Task Forces</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups\">Working Groups</a>.

        title: '#AllezLiterature uses social media to celebrate World Poetry Day  with poems from across Europe'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana kicks off the second phase of the #AllezLiterature campaign with a salute to World Poetry day. Starting today and conducted via social media over the coming month, this initiative works with libraries and archives across Europe to focus on the value of the written word in our cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Continued relevance of Poetry</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>World Poetry Day was initiated by UNESCO, in the belief that poetry reaffirms our common humanity by revealing to us that people, everywhere in the world, share the same questions and feelings. Poetry Day is also meant to encourage a return to the oral tradition: poetry should no longer be considered an outdated form of art, but one which enables society as a whole to regain and assert its identity. Europeana is proud to support this message with content that promotes the richness and diversity of our shared European cultural heritage, and fosters our understanding of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126283515.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/poetry.jpeg\" style=\"width: 432px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126283515.html\">Four Muses from BL Royal 6 E IX, f. 30 | Convenevole da Prato</a>, The Public Library, public domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Pan-European collaboration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the coming weeks, we will be posting poems from across Europe and inviting people to discover and share them on social media. To make that happen, we asked libraries across Europe to nominate poems they already had in Europeana, or to provide new material. Institutions involved contributed records from the Romantics to Constructivism and from Burns to World War I poetry, with more to come over throughout the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liaising with the various institutions has highlighted some challenges surrounding textual content in Europeana, for instance licensing of material, discoverability of collections, and gaps in available content. Much of the material submitted does not have a direct link, which makes the item more difficult to use in a social media campaign requiring the instant gratification of something visual and one click away. Equally for the material to be usable on social media platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest and Facebook, all commercial entities, the license needs to be open, this has led to us having to turn down non-commercially labeled material. In some instances, the library was able to open up the license but in others not, due to contractual restrictions. It means that we were not able to share the range of content we were aiming for, though it provides us with a direction for improvement regarding textual material in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-9490/item-88975/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/fleurstranchees.jpg\" style=\"width: 281px; height: 400px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/fleurstranchees2.jpg\" style=\"width: 279px; height: 400px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12pt; text-align: right; background: rgb(252, 252, 252); vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style='font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; color: windowtext;'><a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-9490/item-88975/\"><span style=\"color:windowtext\">Fleurs de tranchée</span></a>, Europeana 1914-1918</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Encouraging participation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on the work done for the Europeana 1914-18 Transcribathon, and following the Love Transcribathon launched on Valentine’s Day<a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/transcribathon/featured/poetry/\"> a #WW1 Poetry Run</a> has also been developed for #AllezLiterature. Users are invited to transcribe handwritten poems by combattants, but also by civilians, that established War Poetry as a literary genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the campaign also encourages interaction between institutions and users to experience poems in new ways. To this end people are invited to listen to and share poetry ‘playlists’ with recordings found on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/europeana\">Europeana SoundCloud</a>, find and share translations, and post their favourite quotes from poems with the hashtags #AllezLiterature and #WorldPoetryDay. Libraries and other institutions are asked to proactively support the campaign by promoting the activities through their own channels. The Members Council AllezCulture working group will be supporting these initiatives on their own Twitter channels, and everyone is invited to join and spread the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Celebrating the written word</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This celebration of poetry marks the second phase of Europeana’s #AllezLiterature campaign, exploring our shared human experience in 2017 through words and texts in all their forms and languages. Working with libraries, archives and the public across Europe, it underlines that Europeana’s content is broader than images. #AllezLiterature will continue into the summer with two more phases dedicated to our textual past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Data mapping can be a tedious task, but yet never boring! A crucial process that shouldn’t be underestimated, defining mappings is key to accommodate schema differences at source. These efforts imply coming up with strategies and solutions that can have a huge impact on data output quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 2013, we were already exploring the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/carare-edm\">interoperability challenges</a> raised by mapping between different data models in the Europeana data aggregation context. Despite the technologies now available to assist this process, it is clear that the expertise of data providers ensures the quality of the produced metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two case studies that we are publishing today present these data mapping efforts undertaken by Europeana data partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/\"> Specialised Information Service Performing Arts</a> <a href=\"http://performing-arts.eu/\">project</a> aggregates metadata from the performing arts domain, and chose the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) to build an interoperability layer for the project. This case study describes how the project has re-used the EDM extension created by the<a href=\"https://dm2e.eu/\"> DM2E</a> project, and discussed challenges in representing Events in the context of the performing arts. You can read the full case study <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-for-performing-arts-metadata\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 1386, the <a href=\"http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index.html\">Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg</a> is Germany's oldest university, and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. Its magnificent collection contains parchments and early printed books from the 14th century until Modern Age, which makes it a great example of ancient books digitisation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case study, we described the work undertaken on improving the mapping between the source <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/mets-schemadocs.html\">METS</a> data to EDM, as well as the data modeling required to support the IIIF resources available at the data partner’s side. The resulting collections now benefit from richer metadata, in the form of additional metadata elements and explicit links to Linked Open Data resources; but also from the visualisation features offered by the IIIF standard.

        title: 'Europeana Content Strategy: getting the right content to the right user at the right time'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana’s platform can only be as good as the content it provides access to. For that reason, our new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Content%20Strategy.pdf\">Content Strategy</a> published today will help our organisation and partners to identify what kind of content we need to expand, what content we need to limit, and who takes ownership of the decision making process. This Content Strategy was designed by a team consisting of key Europeana Foundation staff and aggregators representing the domains (museums, libraries, archives, audiovisual archives), and will support us in “getting the right content to the right user at the right time through strategic planning of content creation, delivery, and governance” (Content Strategy Alliance Charter - Content Strategy Definition).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Working towards new goals for 2020</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Content Strategy needs to flow naturally from overarching strategic aims. Following the <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9643-2016-INIT/en/pdf\">Council Conclusions</a>, our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/a-call-to-culture-recalibrating-our-2020-strategy-1\">Recalibrated 2020 Strategy</a> is clear on the direction Europeana is taking: during the next four years, we aim to increase quality over quantity, and open the data. The mechanism we use to judge technical quality is the Europeana Publishing Framework (EPF). At the end of 2016, 17% of the data in Europeana met tiers 2/3/4 criterias (tier 4 being high quality, freely re-usable content), while 83% didn’t, and is considered tier 1. We have the ambitious goal to reverse these figures by 2020, so that tiers 2, 3 and 4 represent 80% of the content, and tier 1 the other 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining guiding principles </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How are we going to get there? Europeana Foundation and the DSI partners will invest a lot of time and effort in helping cultural heritage institutions opening up their data and improve their quality. Consequently, the platform will have to prioritise the improvement of existing data over new data publication, and remove existing data no longer complying to the minimum requirements as specified by the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Publishing%20Guide%20v1.6.pdf\">Europeana Publishing Guide</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is only covering the technical requirements. How about the nature of the content itself? The responsibility for the data contributed to the platform is clearly with the cultural heritage institutions, but Europeana will actively encourage and prioritise data that fits specific themes or user demands. We will do so based on user research, statistical analysis and impact studies, and we will relay that information with our partners. By 2020, we estimate that around 20% of the new data will be ‘push’ while 80% will be actively acquired (‘pull’).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Putting theory into practice </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following these two guiding principles (Quality instead of quantity, and Demand-driven content acquisition and publication), the Content Strategy concludes the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Europeana will continue to be inclusive and in principle publish all types of content that museums, libraries, archives, and audiovisual institutions, based on their respective digital strategies, consider important enough for publication in Europeana.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Europeana is inclusive of the cultural heritage from centuries long past to modern times. Making 20th century content accessible is important to avoid limiting the value of our services.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Europeana focusses on content that is about Europe, Europeans, created in Europe or is owned by a European institution. Europeana may actively pursue content from non-European sources.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Metadata records in Europeana always need to point to a freely accessible digital object.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Europeana is unique in offering a discovery service for lesser known collections, and therefore won’t give special preference to masterpieces in the content acquisition process within a collection unless there is a specific demand.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Content%20Strategy.pdf\">Content Strategy</a> document (and its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/what-kind-of-content-is-europeana-looking-for\">dedicated page on Europeana Pro</a>) elaborates on the above conclusions and specifies how Europeana intends to put these principles into practice. It details the rationale behind each element, and indicates how it relates to <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/update/\">Europeana’s 2020 Strategy</a> and other relevant policies.The operational aspects of the Content Strategy and the data requirements are specified in a new version of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Publishing%20Guide%20v1.6.pdf\">Europeana Publishing Guide</a>. This new version also includes an update of the minimum requirements for digital objects previously published in the Annex of the Europeana Publishing Framework. As a consequence, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Publishing Framework</a> itself was updated to exclude digital object requirements.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>Europeana supports the Wikimedia community in its cultural partnerships across Europe. This is what we learned from participants after the 2nd meeting.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mid-February, more than 30 representatives from European Wikimedia affiliate organisations met at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_headquarters\">UNESCO headquarters</a> in Paris for the second <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/2017_European_GLAMwiki_Coordinators_meeting\">European GLAMwiki Coordinators meeting</a>. Both editions have been convened by <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana\">Europeana</a> as part of our ongoing commitment to supporting the Wikimedia community in its cultural partnership activities across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The audience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This edition attracted twice the number of participants as <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/2015_European_GLAMwiki_Coordinators_meeting\">the inaugural meeting of this series in 2015</a>. The two-day meeting gathered a diverse range of attendees, from Finland to Tunisia, Ireland to Macedonia. A third of them were women, which proves consistent with the 2015 event, although this latest edition counted twice as many participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/wikimedia1.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 300px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/wikimedia2.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 301px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/user:Astinson_(WMF)\">Alex Stinson</a> from the Wikimedia Foundation presenting a the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JgoSaLtaEXRdvpJP1v9ppbDb0J61KM1oGuuNB4EoAiE/edit#slide=id.g20e5ef7e12_0_85\"><em>Structured Data on Commons</em> &amp; <em>Wikicite</em> projects</a> in the UNESCO roundtable meeting-room (CC-By-SA 4.0 <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_UNESCO_conference_room.jpg\">from Wikimedia Commons</a>).

        title: '#Europeana4Education: final teachers’ workshop'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 27-28 February 2017, <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> (EUN), the international network of European Ministries of Education, hosted the final Europeana validation pilot workshop for teachers in Brussels. 19 teachers from 10 EU countries came together to test pedagogical scenarios and develop learning activities using Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these workshops, we aim to better understand the needs of educators when using Europeana content, while raising awareness of Europeana’s educational potential. The teachers were initially introduced to Europeana (most for the very first time) during our first workshop in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana4education-europeana-taster-for-teachers\">November 2016</a>. The real test, however, came next - how would schools respond to Europeana’s educational offer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learnings from the November workshop </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, when teachers shared their enthusiasm for Europeana with their students, colleagues, head teachers, peers in other schools and policy makers, the response was positive. The teachers started to use Europeana in their classrooms, and we were able to capture their feedback on what worked well, and where educators needed support. Among their remarks, curation emerged as a strong theme. But finding relevant content brought challenges as it was difficult to find enough high quality resources was licensed for educational use on certain specific subjects (hint: cultural heritage institutions, make it open!). Empty thumbnails were seen as discouraging for teachers and pupils. This feedback chimes with the Europeana T<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/seven-keys-to-unlocking-digital-heritage-for-use-in-education\">ask Force</a> report that identified seven ways to increase the re-use of digital heritage in education. The teachers most enjoyed developing learning activities relating to our existing <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\">exhibitions</a>. Teachers (and pupils!) like using <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps\">apps</a> using Europeana content in creative educational ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/ruseckas.png\" style=\"width: 426px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An image made by <a href=\"https://padlet.com/martina_teichmann/bewytx3opgit\">fifth graders</a> from the Czech Republic taught by teacher Martina Teichmannova, after the first teachers’ workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The second workshop: back into practice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having received this feedback, it was time to put the teachers’ newly found experience. After trying out new tools ( jigsaw puzzle makers, for instance) they began developing pedagogical scenarios (the context in which the lesson is taking place, including desired outcomes) in six small groups of peers teaching a similar age range. On the second day, they were asked to develop the scenario and to create learning activities that would bring Europeana content into the classroom through exercises such as quizzes or discussion questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing learning scenarios </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day ended with a presentation of the learning scenarios and activities that the teachers developed. They are aiming to finalise the following multidisciplinary and international collaborative learning activities before the end of May 2017, and use them in their classrooms:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Using the Europeana and DPLA “<a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\">Leaving Europe” exhibition</a> to explore the history and impact of migration on their country.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Using Europeana art to teach geometry: identifying and learning shapes in art and in the outdoors, and showcasing the artworks they create digitally.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Exploring the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> collection and other WW1 sources with a focus on women. Their research aims to conclude on a special presentation, such as a fashion show or silent film.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Investigating and comparing the theme of ‘spring’ in four countries, incorporating subjects like geography, science, maths, music and art, and leading to the development of a film.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Using the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/colours.html\">colour search function</a> and exploring meaning of the colour red in literature, music and art, and encouraging pupils to develop a creative augmented reality output.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Investigating the significance of sunlight in religion, ranging from the prehistoric Newgrange in Ireland to a temple in Hungary, including local field trips with geocached activities and the creation of artefacts incorporating physics and art.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/img-20170228-132625.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbara explaining her group’s approach to exploring migration with their pupils.

        body: "<p>I started working in a museum at the beginning of the new millennium. But it was only in 2007, as I got involved in a digitisation project myself, that I fully understood the steps needed to document artworks digitally, and to make them accessible to others. In the same year, we founded a working group on data exchange between the museums in Hamburg taking part in that project. Despite the different collections and various documentation systems, we wanted to make sure that we could provide the data in a shared meta-database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was trained as an art historian with a research focus on museum history, and then worked as a curator. Databases, thesauri, and things like XML exchange formats were nothing I was familiar with. To be honest, I assume it is challenging for many art historians or curators to work with databases. They are used to give their point of view in an elaborated text. Reducing their input to a word chosen from a vocabulary is not easy: they often feel restricted. Fortunately, this working group in Hamburg gave me the opportunity to learn about the benefits of shared standards, controlled vocabularies and structured data, and so did Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I perfectly remember the day of 20 November 2008, as I was busy digitising the collections: it was the birth of the Europeana Portal! I read <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/europaeische-union/digitale-bibliothek-europeana-mit-einem-mausklick-zum-kulturellen-erbe-europas-1724157.html\">this article</a> and it hit me: we were not only digitising the artworks for meta-database or collections management purposes, but to make them available to anyone interested, in any context! From then on, I perceived documentation as content creation for new audiences rather than a “task that has to be done”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/hamann.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 464px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Atelier J. Hamann, Pferd-Pyramiden der Mädchen, um 1900, Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication</em><em> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The potential of digital cultural heritage lies in its connections to other resources and contexts.<em>”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I work at the <a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg </a>(MKG), one of the most important museums of Applied Arts in Europe. I am responsible for a digitisation and cataloguing project started in 2012, and for the <a href=\"https://sammlungonline.mkg-hamburg.de/en/node/2\">MKG Online Collection</a> launched in 2015 as part of our developing digital strategy. When I first joined the MKG, one of our main goals was to publish the collection online, and to provide content to Europeana and to the national aggregator Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek. At this point, it was already obvious that the great potential of digitised heritage lies in the possibility of its reuse for multiple purposes. For that reason, the MKG decided to make their works reusable as freely as possible, and became the first museum in Germany to establish an open access policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This decision was highly influenced by the example of the Rijksstudio, and even more by council colleague <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/lizzy-jongma\">Lizzy Jongma</a> (former data manager at the Rijksmuseum), who openly shared her knowledge and experiences with me. Furthermore, case studies by<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\"> Joris Pekel on Europeana Pro</a>, and Merete Sanderhoff’s publications (such as <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/fileadmin/user_upload/Billeder/forsiden/94124_sharing_is_Caring_UK.pdf\">Sharing is Caring</a>) encouraged us to take this step. This is one of the strongest arguments to join Europeana besides the opportunity to disseminate your data: no matter which museum or institution you are associated to, you can benefit from an extraordinary network and learn a lot!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/arcimboldo.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 496px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Guiseppe Arcimboldo, Rudolph II as Vertumnus, 1590/1591, Skokloster Slot, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“When I started exploring the benefits of open access I read about the example of Skokloster Castle and how they made an impact on a small budget.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a councillor, I am now trying to share our experiences at the MKG. I am more than happy to continue Merete’s work by extending the OpenGLAM conference <a href=\"http://sharecare.nu/\">“Sharing is Caring”</a> (that she initiated in 2011) to Hamburg. On 20 and 21 April, our <a href=\"http://sharecare.nu/hamburg-2017/\">first international edition</a> will be organised in cooperation with <a href=\"https://www.fbkultur.uni-hamburg.de/vk/personen/koch.html\">Gertraud Koch</a>, University of Hamburg/Institute for Cultural Anthropology, and involve a lot of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/sharing-is-caring-hamburg-2017\">network members</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>"

        title: 'An open conversation: first Europeana national workshop on sharing digital collections in Scotland'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><strong>A new year! Time to collaborate on local soil - an opportunity for Europeana to reconnect with partners and meet new collections managers, digital strategists, and licensing specialists all keen to understand Europeana’s unique role as enablers and visionaries of sharing cultural content.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To encourage an open conversation, the workshops combine case studies from national organisations and network members. Discussion points focus on the opportunities and challenges of sharing digitised collections, and exploring for whom and how institutions make their collections available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GLAMming it up in Glasgow</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What better location for cultural exchange than <a href=\"http://kelvinhall.org.uk/\">Kelvin Hall</a>, Glasgow, which recently reopened its doors as a hub of culture, education and sport? Twenty-two participants representing collections and archives including the specialist textiles collections of the <a href=\"http://www.renfrewshireleisure.com/paisleymuseum/\">Paisley Museum</a>, the library and film collections held at<a href=\"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/\"> The University of St Andrews </a>to the more well-known art collections of<a href=\"https://art.nationalgalleries.org/\"> The National Galleries of Scotland </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/kelvingrove/about/collection-highlights/Pages/default.aspx\">Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum</a> and representatives from <a href=\"http://www.nts.org.uk/Home/\">The National Trust for Scotland </a>joined forces to share their experiences in managing both user expectations and enabling online access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adrian Murphy, our Collections Manager, and I facilitated the day. Having been in the shoes of our participants in previous roles we immediately related to our audience, ready in the wings to encourage the ambitions of those actively engaged in the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day kicked off with some scene setting, outlining the value in sharing collections via the thematic channels and exhibition platforms and reinforcing the practical support, tools and guidance Europeana can offer as an advocate for best practice(s) and international standards. For a UK audience it helped to appreciate the varying European-wide approaches to copyright law in relation to access of cultural content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Homegrown talent - the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shona Corner, Photography and Licensing Manager of NGS, then presented their recently launched <a href=\"https://art.nationalgalleries.org/\">online collection</a>. Her role is central to balancing user expectations of public online access as well as for generating income. Her great overview revealed the internal processes and decision making that influenced the successful online publication of 43,088 artworks (45% of the collections). They aim to have everything online by 2024. Of particular interest is how NGS have used their <a href=\"https://www.hlf.org.uk/looking-funding/our-grant-programmes/skills-future\">Skills for the Future programme</a> training posts to add value to achieving the discovery and engagement of their artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sharing on digital platforms - the National Library of Wales (NLW)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Daffyd Tudur, Digital Access Section Manager at the NLW, demonstrated the benefits of opening up the libraries’ collections, focusing on the value of sharing public domain collections via social media platforms such as flickr commons and wikidata as well as Europeana; sometimes you don’t have to do all the work - open your collections, publish on the right platforms and lead people back to you. Digitised collections for the NLW include 90,000 graphic works, one million archival items and thousands of hours of AV material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantages of collaborating to stimulate creativity was wonderfully highlighted by the<a href=\"http://www.erikari.it/blog/when-paintings-come-to-life/\"> use </a>of an NLW painting as part of last year’s <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2016/09/gif-it-up-2016/\">GifItUp competition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One last take-away from the NLW strategy is the idea that you can build commercial opportunities around open access via well thought-out licensing models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coming together</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four groups. Four shades of neon paper. Time to talk. The collective positivity uncovered opportunities to collaborate internally to maximise shared expertise and to think strategically about how to make cultural content discoverable, and easily outweighed any perceived barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/post-it-notex-roxanne-blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visible collections: it will lead people back to you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post lunch, time to welcome our recently elected Members Council member Dr Karin Glasemann, Digital Coordinator of the <a href=\"http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/English-startpage/Collections/\">Nationalmuseum, Sweden</a>, to share her organisation’s journey of using online platforms to showcase the collections whilst the objects remain behind closed doors until 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karin is a fantastic advocate for open access, and her practical approach is in part reliant on ‘changing the mindset rather than the technology’. A shift in policy at The Swedish National Archives helped her influence the Nationalmuseum into reviewing their online image policy for two-dimensional public domain works. This resulted in 3,000 public domain works being made openly available via Wikimedia Commons and in six weeks had an impressive 400,000 views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discoverability of cultural content and the ongoing user engagement was neatly summarised by Karin’s ‘snowball’ of digitisation, access and sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-03/diagram-roxanne-blog.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 452px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Karin Glasemann / Nationalmuseum, Sweden, CC BY SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Identifying and reaching our audiences</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As custodians of Scotland’s heritage, conversations turned to whom they are making all this cultural content visible to and how to connect. Interestingly, people approached this differently, some identifying specific sectors such as local communities and creatives and then methods of outreach. Others focused through a high-level strategic and operational lens. Discussion also centred on audience behaviour dependent on socio-economic, geographical, gender, and age perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also highlighted the achievements of Europeana’s reuse services team to support research and education as priority audiences through initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/second-challenge-2016-fashion\">Europeana Challenges</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, people recognised that connecting with your audiences is a two-way street. One example is the <a href=\"https://kelvinhallproject.wordpress.com/glasgow-street-time-travel/\">Glasgow Street Time Travel</a>, a small-scale experiment tested on the Kelvin Hall blog that focused on 50 photographs; they asked people to identify locations and scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A connection is made</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of an inspiring day a clear message emerged. This workshop sparked the beginning of a conversation. People identified with a ‘start small, aim big’ approach to fold into their digital strategies. These initial steps proved successful for <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a>, which allowed for institutions to ‘test the water’ and highlight a proportion of their collections using more open licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People want to collaborate, recognise the value in using digital platforms to promote their works and are keen to help influence sound strategic and operational decisions when prioritising digitisation of and engagement with cultural content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana can support in helping to make this happen, by direct collaboration as well as reinforcing the strength of its network as a recognised hub of knowledge, expertise and standard bearer of technical innovation and best practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With new members and aims for more openly licensed Scottish content in the pipeline, watch this space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next time… a meeting of cultural and ministerial minds in Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Copyright advocacy update: Smoke signals from the European Parliament'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Since we have <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">last reported here on the copyright advocacy activities</a> that Europeana undertakes on behalf of the Europeana Network, the European Commission's proposal for new copyright rules has continued its long path through the European Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are slowly edging towards spring the first parliamentary committees dealing with the proposal have published draft opinions that give us a first picture of how MEPs look at the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules\">Commission's proposal</a>. Currently, four Committees of the European Parliament in total are dealing with the Commission's copyright proposal: The committee for Culture and Education (CULT), the Committee for Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), the Committee for Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE ), and the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) which is the overall responsible committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A first look at what the European Parliament wants</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past two weeks the rapporteurs (MEPs in charge of the file) for both the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;reference=PE-595.591&amp;format=PDF&amp;language=EN&amp;secondRef=01\">CULT</a> and IMCO committees have published their draft opinions. Draft opinions represent the first step in formulating the opinion of a committee and largely reflect the political preferences of the rapporteurs. As such these documents will likely undergo significant changes before they become final documents representing the views of the Committees as a whole. The final opinions of the CULT, IMCO and ITRE committees will then be taken into account when the JURI committee adopts its own report, which normally becomes the position of the European Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while we are looking at the very first indicators of what to expect from the European Parliament, these draft opinions published by <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124728/MARC_JOULAUD_home.html\">MEP Marc Joulaud</a> (CULT) and <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/4545/CATHERINE_STIHLER_home.html\">Catherine Stihler</a> (IMCO) are promising. Both opinions reflect some of <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/clm/publications/copyright_proposals_-_library_and_chi_responses.pdf\">the points that Europeana and Library organisations have been making</a> over the past months in our discussions with a large number of Members of Parliament including the two rapporteurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/smoke-signals-from-the-european-parliament\">Read more here where we take an indepth look </a>at what the rapporteurs have proposed regarding the issues that are included in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/2016%20Update%20to%20copyright%20mandate/europeana-policy-updated-mandate-dec-2016-.pdf\">Europeana's copyright advocacy mandate</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These are draft opinions that mainly reflect the views of their authors. While it is encouraging that rapporteurs from across the political spectrum (Joulaud is a French conservative and Stihler a social democrat from Scotland) see the need for improving the parts of the Commission's proposal that apply to cultural heritage institutions, it is also clear that these attempts will not be met with open arms by all stakeholders and other MEPs. We will see more positions coming out of the EP in the next few weeks, both in the form of the draft report of the JURI committee, which is currently being finalised by MEP Comodini, and by proposals for amendments to the opinions discussed above coming from other MEPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this light we will continue our discussions with MEPs and other stakeholders aimed at ensuring support for our positions. Members of the Europeana Network can help by expressing support for the amendments proposed by MEP Stihler both publicly and by contacting MEPs who serve on the Committees dealing with the copyright reform proposal. Together we have the chance to affect real change here that will help all of us to better achieve our objectives of providing access to the culture held by <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/s8bsmj3aac80rrf/170517europeana_position_paper_short.pdf?dl=0\">Europe's cultural heritage institutions.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note:</em> On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">consensus driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organizations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Business Plan 2017: Spreading the Word'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Last week, we announced our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/a-call-to-culture-recalibrating-our-2020-strategy-1\">Recalibrated 2020 Strategy,</a> revising our focus for the next four years to maximise our impact towards 2020. The first expression of this strategic update, our business plan 2017 aims to implement these new ambitions. We have therefore aligned what we do with our new priorities – making it easy and rewarding, scaling with partners, engaging with people – and organised our plan around the operational shifts that will be executed throughout the year to fulfil our strategic plan, and make us more impactful as Europe’s platform for cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Towards a market oriented approach </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A central component in our approach is a market focus. We believe that if we want to be more effective, we need to become more focused on delivering value for specific audiences. For that reason, we decided to organise our work around 5 key ‘markets’ that are connected through our platform: Cultural Heritage Institutions who have data to share with us, and the audiences that want to use this content for work, learning or just for fun (General Public, Research, Education and Creative Industries). We want to get as close as possible to these audiences to gain deeper understanding of their specific needs, so that we can adapt faster and develop more targeted products and services. To understand how we are making progress against our goals we have expressed the change we aim to achieve in each market and developed performance indicators to match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What can you expect? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:62.5%;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://app.slidebean.com/embed/OiF2Rwip1i\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But all this is just theory of course. To give an idea of what we hope to concretely deliver, this document provides a taster. It includes the launch of new collections on the themes of fashion, photography and newspapers and the revamp of our professional websites Labs, Research and Pro using one back-end system to allow more seamless user journeys into our content. Highlighting the variety of content in Europeana in all forms and languages, the #AllezLiterature campaign already started to celebrate European textual treasures on social media. Building up to 2018 with the European Year of Cultural Heritage and centenary of WW1, we will plan two more major campaigns dedicated to Migration and Culture and the centenary of the end of the First World War. 2017 promises to be an exciting year for copyright reform and we will flesh out a strategy to revitalise the way we aggregate.

        title: 'A Call to Culture: recalibrating our 2020 Strategy'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Believing that culture connects Europe in all of its diversity, contributes to growth and can really transform the world underpins the work of Europeana and all her friends. It has been three years since we launched our 2020 Strategy. The technical landscape keeps evolving; user behaviour changes and information isn’t consumed in the same way anymore. Facing these challenges together, the Europeana Network, partners from cultural heritage institutions, Member States, and the Europeana Foundation took a critical look at our current strategy to see how much actually needs revising. After a yearlong conversation with all stakeholders, from users to MEPs, and curators to creatives, we think our <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/update/\">Revised Strategy</a> puts us in the best position to reaffirm our vision for Europeana, and maximise our 2020 impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/205185358\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/205185358\">'A call to culture'</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transform the world with Culture is a call to all of us</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, the Europeana Community, have got to where we are because we have worked together: we have solved issues from interoperability to data quality to funding. But this is a task that will never be finished, so the call is out to continue the good work and put even more energy behind it. In the Europeana office, we have learnt from the pain points and from user feedback; we understand that it is nowhere near easy enough to share data with Europeana. We know a clear division of roles is lacking in our ecosystem, and that our way of reaching end-users needs to be modernised. Recognising and addressing these challenges will allow us to move forward. Imagine clearly labelled material, new distribution partnerships and cool ways of engaging people. That is what is needed in today’s landscape where content follows the user. So, to make this happen, we have refined our strategy. We are supercharging our focus around three priorities: making it easier to deliver high-quality content and see the results; scaling with partners to reach wider markets; and engaging people through campaigns and meeting their need to participate with more immersive experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal was a balanced view from each of our five stakeholders: the European Commission, the Member States, the Cultural Institutions, the Europeana Network Association, and the User. To get there, our preparatory work on change priorities, taking into account user feedback was followed by a consultation process with the European Commission, the Member States, a group of Cultural Heritage Institutions, and the Network Association in November. This input was taken back to the Europeana Foundation Board for further discussion, and presented for a round of critique by the Member States. We are excited to be in the position to finally share it with you today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partly, this depends on what you can give by answering the Call to Culture. Are you able to improve the quality of your data, make your content more open so that it can be used in Education or Research? If you are a Creative, what can you do to show new uses of our cultural heritage? Whether you are a Cultural Heritage Institution, a policymaker, a researcher, or a creative, working together will help us achieve the difference we want to make. Wherever we reach new audiences, cultural heritage content inspires new creativity and greater understanding of our shared history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Living up to our individual responsibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By refocusing our priorities we also need to alter the way we work with each other. We can only achieve these ambitions and ensure their impact by combining and maximising our strength, energy and expertise. There will be organisational changes, as well as platform, product and data adjustments. We need to make cultural heritage count in a changing world, and your input to the Europeana 2020 Strategic Update reboots that journey. With the Business Plan 2017 (to be published on 28 February), and the new content strategy (to be published in March) we can mobilise the cultural community across Europe, maximise the value of our sector and increase the feeling of a shared and diverse Europe through cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dive into <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/update/\">strategy2020.europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezCulture</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Highlights from the re#MEDIA workshop: Europeana for creatives'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>As part of its activities, <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">TuEuropeana</a> reached out to creatives to test and verify the potential of archival collections serving as inspiration for new designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The workshop</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea for the re#MEDIA workshop at the <a href=\"http://sof.edu.pl/en\">School of Form</a> in Poznań, Poland, was to stimulate the creative thinking around the digital collections of Europeana. By using the tools of design research, new media, application design, as well as alternative thinking on arts and fashion design and music and cinema resources, we wanted to demonstrate the potentials of the collections’ various re-use possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop started in November 2016, after f 4 students from the university returned from the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/from-idea-creation-to-sustainable-business-models-europeana-labs-workshop-at-the-arts-fair\">Europeana Labs workshop at THE ARTS+ Fair, </a>organised as part of Frankfurt Book Fair. The group was composed of SoF students from various disciplines, such as Communication Design, Industrial Design, Fashion Design &amp; Domestic Design. The workshop was run under the TEAM.WORK creative methodology, using the members’ individual interests and skills as well as going towards common goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"337.5\" src=\"//giphy.com/embed/3o6YgnZcTknHaSnswE\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>School of Form re#MEDIA Team</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a number of classes, including topics related to copyright and technical side or archival re-use, students learned the rules of creative re-use of digital cultural assets. The workshop concluded in the creation of a dozen unique designs inspired by digital heritage. Surprisingly, most of the artists transformed the digital formats back to the analogue art, giving them a new meaning through artistic installations, prints, or domestic designs. However, it also led to artworks displaying media in public, and artistic interventions engaging artificial intelligence, or installations connecting the analogue with the digital in adding sound recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/remedia.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Exemplary re#MEDIA artwork: Digit(al) Culture by Piotr Butlewski: Short animation revealing structure of the digitized image from perspective of the machine, Photo credits: Malwina Toczek, NInA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The showcase</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the designing process were shown during a special event co-organised by the <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/\">National Audiovisual Institute</a> and the <a href=\"http://sof.edu.pl/en\">School of Form</a> in Warsaw. The showcase started with a \"guided tour\" of some of the spaces at NInA, which had been used as the setting for artistic performances and screenings. It was followed by a debate between the experts and the public about the use of digital collections in artistic activities and cultural practices by artists, designers, curators, et cetera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/showcase.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>COCOON by Zhyldyz Kozhoiarova, cocoon-like structure, which isolates you from outer world and where you are only with yourself, surrounded by tunes and sounds coming from the archive; Photo Credits: Malwina Toczek, NInA </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing together young designers, curators and GLAM representatives, the debate was centered around evaluation of the re#MEDIA. It also questioned the needs and practices of creative re-use, as well as access strategies of digital collections holders in general. The discussion tackled the specificities of a conscious, contextualised use of citations and digitised artworks, historical documents, and texts, in relation to curated contexts, copyright and innovative technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/panelists.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>re#MEDIA. debate panelists: Piotr Rypson (National Museum of Warsaw), Zuzanna Stańska, (Moiseum), Milena Popova (Europeana Foundation), Agata Nowotny (IDEPE, moderator), Krzysztof Łukomski (School of Form); Photo credits: Malwina Toczek, NIna</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also part of the core topics, education was referred as a spectrum bringing an endlesspotential for the archival reuse. However, the panelists flagged the need for a solid teaching for artists and collection holders that could lead to stronger collaborations in the future.In the coming weeks Sof, NInA and Europeana will jointly showcase all the new designs and prototypes. Please stay tuned and follow the social media channels for more updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p>Digitisation is the game-changer for heritage. It facilitates access, but also enables an explosion of knowledge. At the Europeana Network Association, we have a unique forum for creating a broad coalition of stakeholders to make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My earliest experiences with museums and libraries date from school. As an teenager, I had the chance to visit places in Europe and satisfy my appetite for seeing things for myself. As a student in Political Science in Brussels, I spent the necessary research time at the libraries. My interest in archives only came later, when I started looking at family history and – in the process –began to delve into local and public history of places all over the world. I am 55 now, and I often wonder how much better my Master’s thesis (on foreign policy processes) would have been if I had had access to the digital resources of today. Back then, I had to work my way through index cards, mainframe terminals, and microfilm systems. During my thirty years in the international IT business, I participated in the proliferation of the personal computer, and was an early user of the Internet. I used <em>Compuserve</em> to discover the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/compuserve.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 458px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This is how I discovered the Internet (don't forget the 56K modem!)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you agree that the emergence of the Internet-connected world coincides with an increasing preference for formal sciences and business studies – and an increasing neglect of the humanities? As if greater access to general knowledge made it less important to teach and debate it Instead of discussing what is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’, we should look forward. Heritage digitisation is a tremendous opportunity for the humanities to demonstrate its relevance through factual impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years ago, I joined the Europeana Network Association, as I saw it as a unique forum for encouraging new concepts. Digitisation enables us to ‘hardwire’ historical data and connect heritage with our modern world. Through the data, we can make heritage personally relevant to everyone. I recognise this idea in the proposed <a href=\"http://timemachineproject.eu/\" title=\"Time Machine FET Flagship\">Time Machine FET Flagship</a>. This consortium (supported by Europeana) seeks to apply advanced technologies to “big data from the past”. The challenge is to translate the outcomes into practical benefits – not only for research but for society-as-a-whole (a necessity to justify the funding). My own project at <a href=\"http://www.memlinq.org/\" title=\"Memlinq\">Memlinq</a> fits well with these ambitions. It shares the same societal scope. But, we conceived it as a business project in order to enable fast execution and to garner the investments needed – without being hampered by public budgets and policy-makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/george.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transformation of heritage via digitisation into practical uses requires more than technology or money. We need the enthusiasm from the general public and entice citizens to participate. We can achieve that by revealing how our collective past is personally relevant to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a business background can be useful on the council of the Europeana Network Association. I don’t have to deal with the realities that GLAMs live by (budget controls, administrative hassles, politics…). Allow me to exploit this luxury to come up with creative approaches that contribute to the realisation of Europeana’s objectives. At the Europeana Network Association, we have the opportunity to bring together not only our GLAMs, but also the creative industries, application developers, and business stakeholders that can make things happen. Digitised heritage is a game-changer for GLAMs. It helps them to re-invent their roles and expand from being places for preservation and curation towards meeting centres for knowledge creation. Through digitisation, they can go beyond the boundaries of their respective collections and disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving towards the first <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/02/09-cultural-heritage/\" title=\"European Year of Cultural Heritage\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a> in 2018, these are exciting times for digitised heritage. I’m keen on working towards a broad and active coalition of forces within Europeana Network Association to support the vision and work by Europeana and its partners.</p>"

        body: "<p>Highlighting the unique nature of Europeana content, its richness, variety and availability for reuse is at the heart of our mission. To support this, our Europe-wide thematic campaigns work with cultural institutions to reach out to wide audiences, foster engagement with users and stakeholders, and connect people to their cultural heritage. With <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/it-s-a-wrap-for-europeana280-collaborating-across-borders-to-bring-art-to-the-people\">the end of the art-based Europeana 280 campaign,</a> we are opening a new chapter of that collaboration today with the launch of<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AllezLiterature&amp;src=typd\"> #AllezLiterature</a>. Organised around three main phases, this new thematic campaign will focus on libraries and archives and run on social media in the first half of 2017. And while it continues to explore our shared human experience through culture it focuses on a new medium: words, in all their forms and languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Demonstrating the value of text</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In today’s visual world, it is easy to forget the importance and the power of words. Through #AllezLiterature Europeana wants to shine a light on the value of the written word in our shared cultural heritage, as enriched by text, literature and poetry as it is by paintings, drawings or sculptures. Texts such as <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200507/Reading_Europe_100829\">The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor</a></em> by Polish poet Bolesław Leśmian; <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126313619\">the manuscript of <em>Narcissus</em></a> by famous medieval woman author Christine de Pizan; or a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92037/_http___www_bl_uk_onlinegallery_onlineex_kinggeorge_p_zoomify82052_html\">poem by Wordsworth</a> written as a protest to the Prime Minister against a railway extension in the Lake District are just tiny glimpses of some of the treasures to be found in Europe’s libraries and archives and shared through Europeana - reflecting society through texts both epic and personal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/manuscript3.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 345px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor | Bolesław Leśmian, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/api/RbWPAapQ6/redirect?shownAt=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.polona.pl%2Fdlibra%2Fdoccontent2%3Fid%3D17330&amp;provider=The+European+Library&amp;id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeana.eu%2Fresolve%2Frecord%2F9200507%2FReading_Europe_100829&amp;profile=full\" target=\"_blank\">The National Library Of Poland</a>, public domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Building on user-generated content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what better way to celebrate the ability of text to emphasise our shared experience on Valentine’s Day than with genuine love stories from the past? To launch #AllezLiterature, Europeana is inviting users to create digital records of handwritten letters from The First World War by taking part in the <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/transcribathon/featured/love-run/\">Love Transcribathon</a>. This special edition of the crowdsourcing challenge Transcribe Europeana 1914-1918 features a selection of intimate testimonies through more than 40 letters, postcards, diaries, and other personal documents in several languages. From 14 February onwards, users are invited to discover the stories and help enrich these resources by submitting their own transcriptions, and also to document their participation on social media using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23WW1LoveLetters\">#WW1LoveLetters</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Fostering institutional engagement</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While this first phase of #AllezLiterature focuses on user-generated content, phases two and three will build on the success of working with institutions on<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/it-s-a-wrap-for-europeana280-collaborating-across-borders-to-bring-art-to-the-people\"> the #Europeana280 campaign</a> and reach out to libraries and archives. Together we want to celebrate Europe’s Poetry and textual treasures, starting respectively on World Poetry Day (21 March 2017) and World Book Day (23 April 2017). To do so, we will invite libraries and archives to support #AllezLiterature on social media by initiating conversations and activities that engage with users to highlight their text-based content. This social network activity will run throughout each phase of the campaign until June 2017. We will be working with libraries and archives over the coming weeks and will highlight that collaboration and share the successes of #AllezLiterature with you here on Pro. We hope you will follow and support the campaign through your own networks on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezLiterature!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the new Association Chair: Merete Sanderhoff'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>I’m delighted to be the new Chair of the Network Association and its Management Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am Curator and Senior Advisor of Digital Museum Practice at <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/\">Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK)</a>, the national gallery of Denmark. We house Denmark’s largest collection of art, but our museum is not primarily about the stuff we have. It is first and foremost about the people we serve and what we can learn from each other. We strive to be a facilitator of our users’ learning and creativity, and to support a more creative and reflective society. My role at SMK centers around opening up the digitised collections and inviting the public to build on our common heritage for education, pleasure, and innovation. I also initiated the <a href=\"http://sharecare.nu/\">Sharing is Caring conferences</a> to foster cross-sector dialogue on the potentials and challenges in a digital age shaped by sharing economy and remix culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/2020903-kms3696.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vilhelm Hammershøi, Interior in Strandgade, Sunlight on the Floor, 1901, Statens Museum for Kunst, public domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a first generation Europeana Members Councillor and elected member of the Board – a role that has taught me that hands-on people like each of us in the Network can take active part in shaping how we want our sector to evolve on a European level. As your new Chair, I am committed to strengthen the sense that as a Network, through our joint efforts, we are contributing to a more culturally reflective and rich society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to take this opportunity to recap what the Management Board does, and what it’s made of. We are six members responsible for managing the Network Association. We (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/max-kaiser\">Max Kaiser</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/johan-oomen\">Johan Oomen</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/uldis-zarins\">Uldis Zarins</a> and myself) also represent the Members Council and thereby the Europeana Network Association, on the Board of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/Europeana_Professional/Governing_Board/Europeana%20Governance%20Infographic%20-%20April%202016.png\">Europeana Foundation</a>. The Board is responsible for ensuring that we are all working towards achieving <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\">our objectives</a>, and it provides direct input into the governance and executive decision making of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the Board looks after the activities of the Association, accepts new members, and with the Members Council makes recommendations for how to set up task forces and working groups. We also set Association procedures, annual policy and budget, and deliver the annual report and financial report of the Association. In my position as Chair, I manage the Board, act as the voice of the Association, and chair the Management Board meetings, Members Council meetings, and the General Assembly; supported by my Vice-Chair Max Kaiser who carries out these responsibilities if I’m absent; and Paul Keller, our Treasurer, who helps trustees carry out their financial responsibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of the year, we have had two <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-newsletters\">Management Board meetings</a>, and we are currently in the process of preparing for the first Members Council meeting of the year in The Hague to address how we should all work together within the Network and what our next steps should be. You will hear much more about this in upcoming posts that we will share here on PRO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I would like to thank Max for his outstanding job as leaving Chair of the Board. Having been the Vice-Chair for Max these last two years, I know the extraordinary effort it takes to manage this amazing community we’re part of. So I’ve learned from the best, and I aim to keep learning from working with all of you in the Network. Looking very much forward to it!</p>"

        intro: "<p>Encyclopedias have always fascinated me, because of the idea that humanity simply wouldn’t give up on collecting <em>“everything the world knows about tulips”</em>, <em>“ancient Greece”</em>, or even <em>“our digitised cultural heritage”</em>.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>These projects show an unbeatable trust in the idea that collaboration across borders and generations - such as Europeana - will succeed, and that makes me happy. Isn’t it a bit of miracle that we have not given up on encyclopedias?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started using Museum Documentation Software ten years ago, I was both overwhelmed by the possibilities digital documentation offered, and struck by the thought that it could never come to an end. But we kept on going, and today, most museums have their own impressive digital encyclopedias – even if most of us tend to focus on the mountains of items that are not yet documented, let alone digitised...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/9200397-bibliographicresource-3000126282811.jpeg\" style=\"width: 536px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Map from BL Royal 12 F IV, f. 135v | Remigius of Auxerre; Isidore of Seville, The British Library, public domain. “The first encyclopedia I spent time with as historian”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professionally, I did not work with Europeana until 2012, when I joined the <a href=\"http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/English-startpage/\">Nationalmuseum</a>, Sweden's largest museum of fine art and design. Being in charge for our delivery to Europeana, and secretly obsessed with organising information, I spend a lot of time working with the Europeana Data Model and I am excited to see that a lot of possibilities for enrichment and linked data have become reality in the Europeana portal - even if it sometimes feels far from being perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not an art historian, but I can spend hours browsing through the digitised collection – and I am firmly convinced that engaging with art digitally will make you more interested in the original! Due to renovation works,<a href=\"http://www.nationalmuseum.se/sv/English-startpage/\"> Nationalmuseum</a> has been closed to the public since 2013, and won’t reopen before 2018. Naturally, we have been exploring digital ways to show the museum’s marvelous collection to the public. Well, actually... not so much. The museum was preoccupied with documenting the collection out of the main building, and displaying parts of it on Europeana was more a positive side-effect than a sharply defined goal. However, the collaborative network and the particular interest that Europeana users were showing for our materials have actively changed things .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/management-board-members-council\"> members counci</a>l, I want to raise awareness about the benefits organisations get from participating in Europeana. I believe that the thresholds for contributing data look a lot more ambitious than they actually are. Smaller institutions, in particular, often back down as they fear it would only bind up more resources without immediate benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/7afe073beafe0a01d5c2d616e1589d476f96ee80dfa7b6f294cff858214f.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:right\"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:\"Arial\",\"sans-serif\";color:black'>Zoie Ghika, Moldavian Princess | Alexander Roslin, Nationalmuseum, Sweden, public domain. “One of the paintings I look forward to seeing live again when Nationalmuseum reopens”</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience, though, was different. We learned a lot about standards and emerging technologies that we could not have focused on ourselves. But more importantly, Europeana has become a strong network which enables us to communicate our material and to engage with the public. Through Europeana, the digitised collections we hold reached a lot more people than our own audience. Collaborative campaigns like Europeana280 and Europeana 1914-1918 set aside potential rivalry between museums and focused beautifully on our common goal – providing access to knowledge, resources, art and understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since we started delivering data to Europeana, the question of open access and reuse was central for our institution: I am happy to say that Nationalmuseum has now taken clear position in favour of open access. I understand institutions can feel they are not able to take that step (yet). However, if we believe Europeana should not be an impersonal display of the past, but relevant material that we want the public to engage with, opening up our collections as much as legally possible is the only way to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do we start encyclopedic projects for, if not to use them as much as possible? I will gladly share my experiences with anyone discussing these issues at their home organizations, and hope to hear from you soon.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'From heritage collections to the dance floor: sampling archival material with RE:VIVE'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The action of remixing was born out of music. Scholastically explored by French musique concrete artists Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry in the 1940s and 50s, culturally exploited by the dance hall scene in Jamaica during the 60s and 70s, technically perfected by German krautrockers Kraftwerk or Tangerine Dream in the 70s, and finally translated for the dance floor as we know it now by the budding house and techno scenes in Chicago and Detroit. The concept of remixing is one of music’s most essential elements. Therefore, when we talk about remixing cultural heritage, music should be an explicitly targeted activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/282861847&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.revivethis.org\">RE:VIVE</a>, an initiative by the<a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl\"> Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> bringing together electronic musicians and archives to change the way we hear the past. RE:VIVE does this by facilitating and co-producing new music completely composed out of sampled archival material, and inspired by the historical themes around which those samples are curated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://lakker.bandcamp.com/album/struggle-emerge\">Struggle &amp; Emerge</a>, for instance, RE:VIVE’s first release by acclaimed Irish techno duo <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/lakker\">Lakker</a>, was composed out of audio archival material related to the theme of the Dutch and water. Lakker were invited to the Netherlands where they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-G_xArLoYk&amp;t=7s\">met with academics</a>, engineers and researchers to enlighten them on a topic they were previously ignorant of. In cultural heritage, our collective strongest asset is our access to knowledge. Combining images, footage, audio, and context, a platform like Europeana becomes “one-stop shopping” for musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/260855107&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, without open access none of this is possible. That’s why RE:VIVE champions the re-use of openly licensed materials. Opening up and making items available for download in high quality streamlines and economises the tedious and expensive processes of sourcing, accessing and clearing. Artists would rather not spend time and money on jumping hurdles to clear one sample or photo. That’s why many of them don’t. But when we’ve shown RE:VIVE artists platforms like the Rijksmuseum or the <a href=\"http://www.gahetna.nl/en\">National Archive of the Netherlands</a>, and the hundreds of thousands of freely re-usable imagery they could access, their eyes lit up like those of a kid on a Christmas morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/overstroming-van-de-wieringermeerpolder-3-.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 580px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>J. J. Bosman and P. C. Bosman, <em>De polder onder water, het verslag van de onderwaterzetting van de Wieringermeerpolder in 1945</em>, Free Media, 1995</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If opening up and making available on the web is the first step, the second step needs to be vehement community engagement. Much of RE:VIVE’s experience has illustrated that artists are very interested in working with heritage collections, but don’t know where to find them. That is why the relationships with artists need to be symbiotic, to the point where they become ambassadors of the collection. Furthermore, the engagement needs to be constant. There is already a well established community of <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons lovers</a> who are open culture artists, but they are a minority. The other part of the artist community simply does as they’ve done for years, and needs to be engaged. Doing so requires knowledge of norms, practices, standards and equal passion and love for music. RE:VIVE is working on not being an outsider engaging a new community, but to become a fixture within that community on behalf of archives worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Re-use has the power to take heritage materials and translate them for new audiences. Because music is now omnipresent, it is a perfect medium to intertwine cultural heritage into daily lives. RE:VIVE takes pride in knowing that thousands of people are enjoying rich heritage materials from the dance floor to a simple headphone commute., Archival materials are being taken outside of their vaults and placed back into the world from which they came.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'IIIF adoption by Europeana: future perspectives for the Network'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Sharing of high quality images on the Web, something many take for granted, has in recent years become a focal point for cultural heritage institutions across the globe. The Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>) is at the core of this collaborative effort. Europeana has become fully committed to IIIF, its community and its goals for the past year, and will take its engagement further with the launch of a new Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As reported in a previous blog, we have created an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/iiif-datasets-in-europeana-a-scholar-s-delight\">IIIF profile for the Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> that makes EDM interoperable with the IIIF standard. This enables Europeana data providers to reference their IIIF resources in the Europeana Collections portal and the Europeana APIs. Our approach, which was designed in collaboration with the IIIF community, is followed by others. Very recently, the <a href=\"http://nomisma.org/\">Nomisma.org</a> project has<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-in-nomisma-org\"> extended its own data model with the EDM profile for IIIF</a>, and re-used its data guidelines in order to enable IIIF images within <a href=\"http://numismatics.org/crro/\">the viewer of Numishare and Coinage of the Roman Republic Online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while Europeana Foundation and several Network institutions have signed on to and committed to implementing IIIF, there is still a large part of the Europeana Network unaware of the work being done by IIIF and how to get involved. Therefore, after hosting <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-iiif-working-group-meeting\">IIIF working group meet-ups in Amsterdam</a>, Europeana is taking longer-term actions to ensure that the Network is well informed about IIIF solutions and their benefits, and how it can be involved in appropriate developments of the technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that reason, EuropeanaTech just launched a new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/iiif\">IIIF Task Force</a>. Led by the Austrian National Library, it intends to identify the current trends and tendencies in the adoption of the IIIF technology by Europeana content providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network of content providers being so large and diverse, simply recommending partners to implement IIIF wouldn’t be that efficient. The network is at varying levels of digital solvency, and their collections include images corresponding to different kinds of cultural objects, which could benefit from the availability of specific IIIF implementation recipes. At a time when IIIF is devising extensions to cope with other types of content (e.g, audiovisual or 3D), Europeana partners owning such content in their collections could provide crucial input. In order to move forward together, an initial assessment of the landscape is necessary, otherwise there could be a risk of seeing some institutions left behind, which does little to serve our collective good of presenting cultural heritage in the best way possible. The Task Force will evaluate what requirements are necessary in terms of sharing content within the Europeana Network, and give appropriate recommendations for future application of IIIF technologies within the Europeana ecosystem - as well as for potential contributions from the Network to the IIIF community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another note, Europeana Foundation has just been nominated to join the IIIF Executive Committee, the governing body for the IIIF consortium. This nomination will ensure that the Network is appropriately represented and heard through the Foundation, and with the help of other Network members involved in the IIIF community. It is also the acknowledgement that European cultural institutions are starting to play a key role, after a phase in which the bulk of IIIF development and adoption has taken place in the US - and this is something we must feel proud of!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next <a href=\"http://iiif.io/event/2017/vatican/\">Annual IIIF meeting</a> will take place in Europe, on June 6-9 at the Vatican. <a href=\"http://iiif.io/event/2017/vatican-cfp\">Proposals</a> are still welcome: be sure to register in due time if you are interested!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can’t wait until June, the National Library of Scotland and University of Edinburgh are holding a <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iiif-technical-workshop-tickets-31536545657\">IIIF technical workshop</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iiif-showcase-improving-access-to-image-collections-tickets-31536512558\">IIIF use-case showcase</a> on 16-17 March.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'It’s a wrap for #Europeana280: collaborating across borders to bring art to the people'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>347 artworks, 146 participating institutions, 29 countries. These figures mark the success of the #Europeana280 campaign which recently came to an end. Developed to promote Europe’s shared art history and to support the launch of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art\">Europeana Art</a> in innovative ways, this Europe-wide campaign ran from April to December 2016 and featured exhibitions, events, partnerships, and social media activity, all designed to reach a wide and new audience. Looking back on what we achieved together in the past months to connect people with their cultural heritage through technology, we would like to thank everyone for all the work and share this story of successful collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Campaign highlights</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brand new Europeana Art collection and acclaimed Faces of Europe exhibition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We kicked off the campaign by inviting 28 Culture Ministries across Europe to work with their museums and galleries to deliver 10 high quality digitised artworks representing their country’s contribution to Europe’s art history. All said yes, and Norway too, delivering more artworks than the 280 expected. Reflecting the diversity of European art movements throughout the centuries, these iconic pieces of art - from Gothic to Baroque to Impressionism to Pop Art - were gathered in<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art\"> Europeana Art</a> enriching the website with iconic paintings and lesser known counterparts. Building on this wealth of content and showcasing 82 items, the online exhibition <a href=\"http://bit.ly/FacesofEurope\">Faces of Europe</a> took visitors on a seven-chapter journey through the centuries, and it has been visited by more than 58,000 people to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>#BigArtRide &amp; #JumpingJacks - on the streets with the people </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more openly licensed the artworks, the more ways we could use them: the campaign took the opportunity to bring art offline and onto the street with events designed to encourage interactions from the general public. Touring eleven cities in nine countries across Europe, the virtual reality event<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Campaigns/Europeana_280/introducing-europe%27s-bigartride.pdf\"> #BigArtRide</a> attracted crowds, with participants from different locations in Europe racing against each other through a virtual city populated with artworks from #Europeana280. Also combining art with interactive technology, the digital installation <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/get-set-europeana280-join-us-as-we-celebrate-europe-s-art-history-the-digital-way\">#JumpingJacks</a> let participants become a living part of artwork, with projections of their own body onto walls and ceilings transformed by cut-outs from the #Europeana280 art pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Social and Educational</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To take the artworks as far as possible and share them with wider audiences, we also partnered with external platforms and apps.<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge\"> The 280 Art History Challenge on Wikimedia</a> held in April and May saw 816 articles about each artwork featured in the campaign being written and translated in 39 languages, making it the largest ever GLAM wiki competition, and the second largest Wikipedia translation event. The<a href=\"https://theartstack.com/shop\"> ArtStack</a> (dedicated to simplifying art discovery) and<a href=\"http://www.getdailyart.com/\"> Daily Art</a> (focusing on one piece of art a day) apps both reused numerous treasures from #Europeana280 and shared them with their respective communities, reaching a wider network of art enthusiasts and creatives across Europe. Finally, the global partnership with annual GIF-making competition<a href=\"http://gifitup2016.tumblr.com/\"> #GiftItUp</a> helped us reach 10,000,000 people: applicants were invited to create a GIF with reusable material using #Europeana280 artworks and images available on ones of the associated platforms<a href=\"http://dp.la/\"> DPLA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\">DigitalNZ</a> and <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Creative Reuse - with ArtFaces, StoryPix and ColourApp</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Openly licensed content could also be used in apps, such as <a href=\"https://colourapp.eu/\">Colourapp.eu</a>, allowing users to create their own versions of the paintings from #Europeana280 selections, using their personal photos for colour inspiration. Users were invited to get creative, download their artworks and share it on social media. We held a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-labs-challenge-2016-winners-announced\">Challenge</a> resulting in more products using the contributed artworks, including <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/art-faces\">Art Faces</a>, an educational game allowing young kids to learn about art by playing; and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/storypix\">StoryPix</a>, designed to display artworks in high quality resolution in public spaces, on billboards and large outdoor screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Celebrating your collaboration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:62.5%;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://app.slidebean.com/embed/GKaZHqNgCk\" style=\"position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artworks contributed reached more than 20 million people on social media using the hashtags #Europeana280 and #BigArtRide. This wouldn’t have been possible without the active contribution of all institutions involved in supporting the campaign towards their own networks and communities, by hosting events, tweeting, blogging and talking to the press. Over the past ten months, we have been sharing stories about the campaign and documenting how the artworks were used. And we will go into further detail in the coming weeks with case studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are analysing what could have been done better in developing the campaign and communicating with participating cultural heritage institutions. Building on that, we will collect our institutions and partners’ recommendations to make sure we can implement the lessons learnt in future campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working closely with Europe’s cultural heritage institutions and member states, we are also planning future theme-based campaigns. In the meantime, we would like to celebrate the amazing response the campaign received, both from institutions and audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please join us, and spread the word one more time using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Europeana280.%20%20&amp;src=typd\">#Europeana280. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        title: 'From heritage collections to the dance floor: sampling archival material with RE:VIVE'
        posttype: null
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">The action of remixing was born out of music. Scholastically explored by French musique concrete artists Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry in the 1940s and 50s, culturally exploited by the dance hall scene in Jamaica during the 60s and 70s, technically perfected by German krautrockers Kraftwerk or Tangerine Dream in the 70s, and finally translated for the dance floor as we know it now by the budding house and techno scenes in Chicago and Detroit. The concept of remixing is one of music’s most essential elements. Therefore, when we talk about remixing cultural heritage, music should be an explicitly targeted activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enter <a href=\"http://www.revivethis.org\">RE:VIVE</a>, an initiative by the<a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl\"> Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> that brings together electronic musicians and archives to change the way we hear the past. RE:VIVE does this by facilitating and co-producing new music completely composed out of sampled archival material and inspired by the historical themes around which those samples were curated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://lakker.bandcamp.com/album/struggle-emerge\">Struggle &amp; Emerge</a>, for instance, RE:VIVE’s first release by acclaimed Irish techno duo <a href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/lakker\">Lakker</a>, was inspired by and composed out of audio archival material related to the theme of the Dutch and water. To gain context into their theme, Lakker were invited to the Netherlands where they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-G_xArLoYk&amp;t=7s\">met with academics</a>, engineers and researchers who ensured that the duo was not only inspired but educated. In cultural heritage, our collective strongest asset, perhaps equal to the collections we hold, is our access to knowledge. When combined; images, footage, audio, and context, a platform like Europeana becomes “one-stop shopping” for musicians. Audio to sample, footage for music videos, images for artwork and social media and the expert knowledge to tie them all together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, without open access none of this is possible. That’s why RE:VIVE champions the re-use of openly licensed materials. Opening up and making items available for download in high quality streamlines and economises the otherwise tedious and expensive processes of sourcing, accessing and clearing. Artists would rather not spend time and money on jumping hurdles to clear one sample or photo. That’s why many of them don’t. But in our experience, when we’ve shown RE:VIVE artists platforms like the Rijksmuseum or the <a href=\"http://www.gahetna.nl/en\">National Archive of the Netherlands</a>, and the hundreds of thousands of freely re-usable imagery they could access, their eyes lit up like those of a kid on a Christmas morning. According to one label manager “I never have to hire photographers ever again!”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If opening up and making available on the web is the first step, the second step needs to be community engagement. And by engagement, we mean really diving into the deep end. Much of RE:VIVE’s experience has illustrated that artists are very interested in working with heritage collections, but none of them knows where to find them. That’s why the relationships with artists need to be symbiotic, to the point where the artists become an extension of the collection - ambassadors if you will. And furthermore, the engagement needs to be constant, especially when not preaching to the converted. There is already a well established community of <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons lovers</a> who are open culture artists, but they’re a minority. The other part of the artist community simply does as they please or as they’ve done for years. This is the community that needs to be engaged, and doing so requires knowledge of norms, practices, standards and equal passion and love for music. RE:VIVE is working on not being an outsider engaging a new community, but to become a fixture within that community on behalf of archives worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nRe-use has the power to take heritage materials and translate them for new audiences who otherwise would not actively engage cultural heritage. Because music is now omnipresent, it’s a perfect medium to intertwine heritage into daily lives. With over 150.000 engagements, RE:VIVE takes pride in knowing that thousands of people are actively and passively enjoying rich heritage materials in a way they enjoy. From the dance floor to a simple headphone commute archival materials are being taken outside of their vaults and placed back into the world from which they came.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana launches its first match funding call for innovative digital education projects'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Today, Europeana launches a <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">match funding call</a> offering 10,000 EUR to co-fund up to three creative educational projects. We invite applications from creative minds across Europe that propose new ways to engage with Europe’s rich digital cultural heritage in secondary education. The match funding call closes on 15 March 2017 at 23:59 hrs (CET).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A collaboration with the <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo Foundation</a>, this five-month campaign aims to promote cross-sector innovation between the creative industries, cultural heritage and education sectors by combining resources, technologies and market opportunities. It will harness the power of alternative financing strategies, such as crowd- and match funding to deliver new growth opportunities for the creative industries and positively impact teaching and learning in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/match-funding.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 136px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A derivative work of a photograph by Gustav Borgen, Public Domain Marked, Norsk Folkemuseum. This derivative work is licensed under CC BY Goteo. </em><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2022608/NF_NFB_34431.html\">http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2022608/NF_NFB_34431.html</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Eligible projects must be digital, use Europeana openly licensed content as a central element and be relevant to a secondary education audience (pupils 11-18 years and teachers in this educational tier). We accept applications for both formal and informal secondary education. The projects can vary from digital applications, MOOCs, e-books, to documentaries, or other creative digital learning tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for proposals that are scalable and present ideas that will work across multiple countries and/or languages. It is also important that applicants demonstrate how they will reach existing audiences and new communities in order to achieve their crowdfunding goals as well as how they will sustain the project in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications should be submitted to <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education</a> no later than 15 March 2017. In the two weeks following the submission closing date, representatives from Europeana and Goteo will assess the received applications and announce the three selected projects at the end of March 2017. As a next step, Goteo representatives will run workshops with the winning teams to support the design and delivery of their crowdfunding campaigns. The campaigns will go live on 26 April on the <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo platform</a> and run for 40 consecutive days, with an option for a second crowdfunding round that lasts until 25 June. Project teams with a successful crowdfunding campaign (e.g. those reaching their financial goal) will have to deliver their projects between 15 June (resp. 1 July) and 31 December 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will our match funding work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Match funding is a method which encourages co-investment between public and private institutions and the crowd. In this call, for each 1 EUR donated by citizens, Europeana will contribute 1 EUR up to a maximum of 100 EUR per donation and no more than 3,500 EUR per project. Europeana’s match funding capital per project campaign will be allocated once the campaign achieves its minimum crowdfunding goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about the application criteria and funding rules, please read our match funding call <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know of any fascinating educational project that uses cultural content? Reach out to your communities and spread the word about this funding opportunity!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Wiki loves GLAMS! Announcing the Europeana 1914-1918 Wikimedia competition'

        intro: "<p>Europeana will showcase the collection of portfolios to demonstrate the diverse, innovative, and high-quality ways that this important period of Europe's history can be understood through open-access heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In the first half of 2017, Europeana is challenging the dozens of recognised Wikimedia Affiliate organisations to run “editathons” and upload images, transcribe documents and use the public resources of Europeana’s partner organisation to build a portfolio of activities relating to the centenary of the First World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will showcase the collection of portfolios to demonstrate the diverse, innovative, and high-quality ways that this important period of Europe's history can be understood through open-access heritage, with an emphasis on working with its partner cultural institutions across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>After five years of successful and intense crowdsourcing, content gathering and community building, the Europeana 1914-1918 project is now harvesting its fertile holdings. On the one hand this is done through further enhancement and enrichment of the available data, in particular with crowdsourced transcriptions. On the other hand the unique collection will be more actively promoted as a rich and reliable source for research and reuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana manages this by developing strategic partnerships, by paving the way for creative reuse by developers and by providing the infrastructure that offers opportunities for creating new meaningful ways to access and interpret culture. Wikipedia, and two of its sister sites Wikidata and Wikisource, offer one of the best ways to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years there have been a number of joint Wiki/Europeana initiatives, varying from targeted editathons to challenges aimed at engaging the broader public. With the First World War material from Europeana 1914-1918, special collaborative actions have also been undertaken: for instance, in the 2013 “Wiki Loves Monuments” (WLM) competition, where people could vote for the best entry in the Europeana sponsored category: First World War related photographs. With almost 2,500 submissions, the Europeana team shortlisted <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.571728856226340.1073741839.313827812016447&amp;type=1&amp;l=7a9e93cdae\">25 photographs</a>. And in 2015 <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/ww1-photos-and-memorabilia-from-the-public-now-on-wikimedia-commons\">a mass-upload of Europeana 1914-1918 images</a>, a handpicked collection of several hundred high-quality and historically significant objects with the greatest possible chance of reuse as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/herrmann-small-.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 382px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Christoph Herrmann</em><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/761\"><em>http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/761</em></a><em>,</em> <em>CC-BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most used image (from a private contributor) on Wikipedia from Europeana 1914-1918 is a picture of this British gas bomb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GLAM-Wiki initiative (institutions including, but not limited to \"galleries, libraries, archives, and museums\" with Wikipedia) helps the cultural institutions share their resources with the world through collaborative projects with experienced Wikipedia editors and encouraging them to contribute to the Wikimedia projects, including the well-known Wikipedia. <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Get_started\">This page</a> explains how Wikipedia can help make an impact in your institution.<br><br>\r\nIf you would like to contact your local Wikimedia community affiliate organisation or follow the Challenge’s progress, please visit<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18\"> the project homepage</a>, or contact <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/staff/ad-polle\">Ad Pollé</a> or <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/liam-wyatt\">Liam Wyatt</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Evaluating Europeana: what would you like to see assessed by the Commission?'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The Europeana Network Association and Europeana Foundation tried putting on your hats to come up with ways to improve the European Commission proposal for an <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/plan_2016_55_europeana_evaluation_en.pdf\">Independent evaluation of Europeana following adoption of Council Conclusions by EYCS Council on 31/05/2016</a>. The process requires consultation on what will be evaluated prior to commencing the evaluation, therefore a request for response to the proposed Roadmap, within a month, was published on 22 December 2016. The purpose of the Evaluation is to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"present to the Council an independent evaluation of Europeana and give clear orientations for the mid- and long-term development of Europeana by assessing alternatives at the EU level for the future scope, sustainable funding and governance of Europeana, including a possibility to transform or integrate Europeana into a European legal entity, whilst taking account of the dual nature of Europeana as both a cultural and digital innovation project\".</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:216.0pt;\">The role of Europeana for the digital access, visibility &amp; use of European cultural heritage Council conclusions (31 May 2016)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full responses can be found in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/europeana-network-association-s-response-to-europeana-evaluation-roadmap-18jan2017.pdf\">Europeana Network Association’s Evaluation response</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/europeana-foundation-response-to-europeana-evaluation-roadmap-18jan2017.pdf\">Europeana Foundation's Evaluation Comments</a>. We hope the Commission takes these considered thoughts into their published Roadmap on the Evaluation of Europeana, which should be available shortly. And that we were able to put on your heads, under your hats, over the Christmas period!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When finally published and the Evaluators appointed, the work will take until Q4 2017, looking at what works, what could be improved, what might have been done differently and what should be dropped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network Association reformed the small group of Councillors that had originally submitted<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/inputfromeuropeananetworkassociationfortheevaluationofeuropeanabyindepen....pdf\"> ideas on what should be evaluated to the Commission back in September 2016</a>: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Max Kaiser, Rolf Källman, Marco de Niet and Ellen Euler</a>. Together, we worked on two responses from the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Foundation, trying to be complementary but making the points that most concerned each organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this end, we thought that the Evaluation should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>be based on Refined Europeana Strategy 2020 and Business Plan 2017, to be published in February 2017, as these have been created by the Europeana Network (EN), validated by the Europeana Foundation Board (EF) and discussed with Member States; in other words developed by.individuals and professionals who understand the needs of the audiences being served and who have created plans to respond to those needs.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>recognise the dynamic nature of the organisation, as past achievements can only be a partial basis for recommendations towards the future. There is no linear path from lessons learned from the evaluation to a solid future strategy for Europeana; and external innovation outside Europeana must be considered in the Evaluation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>take on board that Europeana’s willingness and capacity to continuously develop its strategy to be better targeted towards constant changing user needs, should be seen, in this digital age, not as a sign of weakness but of strength.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Some specific measures were therefore requested:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>An evaluation of how the user needs have changed over the last 10 years as a necessary baseline.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/markets-small.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 449px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lt; Europeana | CC BY-SA &gt;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The 5 markets (CHIs, Research, Education, Creative Industries, Culture Users) outlined in Refined Strategy to define the lines of investigation for the evaluators.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Use be made of the three impact areas of the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/impact-assessment-case-study\"> Europeana Impact Framework</a>, as the draft of the Roadmap only mentions what should be examined, not how that should be done.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to be directly involved in the evaluation of Europeana please let us know and we will pass your details onto the Evaluation team.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Evaluating moral and ethical rights in heritage material'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Sounds project has felt the clear need for sector guidelines to help them make informed, mutual and appropriate decisions regarding moral and ethical rights. Read about their work.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Oral histories about HIV/AIDS affecting people’s lives, personal correspondence referring to private moments, recordings of music performed by traditional communities only meant to be heard in the context of their (religious) ceremonies... These cultural objects all have value for Europeans willing to learn about history and culture. However, they also have some moral or ethical sensitivity that would make an institution think twice whether to publish them online. These are decisions institutions make on a daily basis, often without even having the opportunity to read, listen and experience these objects entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While each institution is free to make these decisions, the Europeana Sounds project has felt the clear need for sector guidelines to help them make informed, mutual and appropriate decisions regarding moral and ethical rights. For that reason, we included this issue in our <a href=\"https://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/how-we-can-get-more-audio-heritage-online\">Europeana Sounds Policy Recommendations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moral and ethical rights often refer to the rights and interests in cultural heritage which may, under national, customary and other laws, reside with the traditional custodians of such materials. Recordings of religious ceremonies, potentially damaging testimonies by living people, as well as evolving political situations that could in retrospect make cultural work damaging are all example of situations where moral and ethical rights might come into play. A definition of this type of issues has been written by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (<a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/\">WIPO</a>), and recommends prior consent before using (part of) such material for public dissemination and commercial purposes, regardless of copyright status. See for example the Legal and Ethical information <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Information/Legal-And-Ethical-Usage\">section</a> on the British Library website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of moral and ethical rights is not limited to the Europeana Sounds project: the rights can likely exist in material across many different heritage domains. This is why we do not aim to resolve this issue within the Europeana Sounds project, but wish to broaden the scope to the entire Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to provide ourselves with tools to make moral and ethical rights known to the end-users of Europeana and other portals. As the Europeana Rights Statements refer to the copyright status of Digital Objects, placing a ‘no-reuse’ statement on all the material would not be a solution, if this is not what copyright law states. This would also limit potential interesting re-use of the objects that is appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, we suggest a task force with the aim to re-evaluate the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/pd-usage-guide.html\">usage guidelines for re-use of public domain material</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/ethics-for-europeana\">2011 Ethics in Europeana paper</a> to be in line with the WIPO-guidelines, and perhaps extend the usage guidelines to objects not in the public domain. Secondly, we suggest to discuss how we would interpret the WIPO-guidelines in our European cultural heritage context. What are the boundaries of these Moral and Ethical rights, and how can we respect them without unnecessarily limiting the enjoyment and re-use of our shared culture? How can this be accomplished in the context of mass digitisation where not every object can be examined for its content? In short: can we develop clear guidelines that help European institutions be respectful of these moral and ethical rights, without losing sight of the value of sharing our culture?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are curious to know what you think: if you or someone at your organisation is interested in participating in this task force, or if you have case studies or best practices to share, do not hesitate to contact Lisette Kalshoven (Kennisland) at <a href=\"mailto:lk@kl.nl\">lk@kl.nl</a>.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>Today, I am happy to announce the results of the 2017 <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/thumbs/1000x1000r/Europeana_Professional/Governing_Board/Europeana%20Governance%20Infographic%20-%20April%202016.png\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Management Board</a> elections. Between 1 and 15 December, eight <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/management-board-2017-candidates\">Councillors</a> came forward as new Board candidates. From 10 to 17 January, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/bravo-introducing-your-new-members-council-representatives\">36 Members Council</a> representatives were then invited to select six of them to form the new Management Board.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The Management Board is responsible for management of the Association, its members sit on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/how-we-work/foundation-governing-board\">Europeana Governing Board</a> and thereby represent the Network in the Europeana Foundation’s executive decision making. The Board oversees the activities of the Association, accepts new members, and makes recommendations for the composition of the task forces and working groups. It also sets Association procedures, annual policy and budget, and delivers the annual report and financial report of the Association. The Board is managed by the Chair who acts as the voice of the Association and chairs the Management Board meetings, Members Council meetings, and the General Assembly; the Vice-Chair who carries out these responsibilities in the Chair's absence; and the Treasurer who helps trustees carry out their financial responsibilities. These three roles will be decided upon during the first Board meeting on February 1st.<br><br>\r\nThe eight candidates who ran for the elections were <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/ellen-euler\">Ellen Euler</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/george-homs\">George Homs</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/max-kaiser\">Max Kaiser</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\">Joke van der Leeuw - Roord</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/johan-oomen\">Johan Oomen</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/uldis-zarins\">Uldis Zariņš</a>.<br><br>\r\nAll 36 Councillors participated in the election (100%); and 90% of them provided a full Management Board vote (6 candidates).The results are now in, and the newly elected Management Board representatives are (in alphabetical order):</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Max Kaiser</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Paul Keller</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Joke van der Leeuw - Roord</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Johan Oomen</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Merete Sanderhoff</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Uldis Zariņš</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Congratulations to the new Board members! We’re delighted about the outcome of these elections. Feel free to get in touch with them if you have any questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to thank all the Councillors who ran for these elections, as well as the voters for choosing their new representatives in the Europeana Foundation’s Governing Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re very grateful for your valuable time and feedback!

        body: "<p>When I started working for the German Wikimedia-Chapter 2012, I had years of experience as an art manager working on enhancing access to art and cultural heritage in different educational programmes. As curator for cultural partnerships to the Wikimedia movement in Germany, I welcomed the opportunity to reach out more horizontally. On one side the GLAM institutions looking to reach out into net-audiences and on the other side digital volunteers keen on completing the representation of all knowledge on the internet through Wikipedia and its sister projects. I am grateful to state today: I have learned a lot in those five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/orion-aveugle-cherchant-le-soleil.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 392px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<address style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3d802410-b25d-7213-8517-a59b5a357376\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Paysage avec Orion aveugle cherchant le soleil</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> by Nicolas Poussin 1658, today Metropolitan Museum of Art, public domain via Wikimedia Commons</span></span></address>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Giants’ Shoulders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Together - GLAMs, volunteers and partners such as Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek - we developed different meet-up-points. You probably heard of the hackathon on cultural heritage <a href=\"https://codingdavinci.de/\">Coding da Vinci</a>. It invites GLAM institutions to present their digital and free licensed cultural heritage data to volunteer coders to develop apps, websites and other applications and show the creative potential of digital cultural data. And perhaps you already know about the playful workshop “<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Learning_patterns/%C2%A9%C2%A9-Change_your_mind_-_a_fun_workshop_for_open_licenses\">©© change Your mind</a>” calling GLAM staff to make their choice whether to release their data as #open. Maybe you even hosted a Wikipedia-editathon or Wikimedia Commons fototour called <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Learning_patterns/GLAM_on_Tour_-_connecting_Wikipedians_and_cultural_institutions_on_the_local_level\">GLAM on Tour </a>in Germany. All these events create opportunities to spur the spread of cultural heritage through the technical means of digitization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe all agree: cultural heritage is not just a beautiful part of human knowledge but its constitutional base - the giant’s shoulders we all stand on. Thus to assure that the flow in between our cultural heritage and what is thought, developed and worked upon today - in short our knowledge production - is the duty of everyone of us. Free knowledge becomes a way to secure that flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Climbing the Shoulders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Shaping access to our cultural heritage is more than presenting it on digital platforms for people to look at it. Do not get me wrong. I do love the ease we take for granted today. All these images I find in the internet in a second. All the books and articles I can read as soon as I locate them. It is great that more and more GLAM institutions have the means to display their treasures on their websites. We are all happy for the existence of Europeana as the big show case to European cultural heritage. Yet we know it is not enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And shaping access to knowledge is more than presenting it as encyclopedic lemmata for people to read about it. Sure, Wikipedia is amazing. Hard to find a subject that has not been covered by a Wikipedia article yet. Not in one language but in more than 290. Across the world thousands of volunteers spend their leisure time to write about <a href=\"https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilitzaci%C3%B3_asteca\">Aztecs</a> or <a href=\"https://nds.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin\">Zeppelin</a>. Wikimedia embraces and supports all activities that bring GLAM content and knowledge into its projects. Wikidata, as machine readable data source, could gain a role as linking identifier. Yet we know it is not enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/caspar-david-friedrich-wanderer-above-the-sea-of-fog.jpg\" style=\"width: 468px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<address style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; text-align: right;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-3d802410-b25e-8df8-f4c4-0a180d1a9ff8\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(37, 37, 37); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> by Caspar David Friedrich 1818, today Kunsthalle Hamburg, public domain via Wikimedia Commons</span></span></address>\r\n\r\n<h2>Looking Out</h2>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We need to do more and we need to do it together. Relating to cultural heritage we only can achieve free knowledge by two things. The first has been debated for long: free licenses that can be identified as such by machines or bots and reused for any purpose. The second is located in the technical accessibility. Content needs to be found, identified as reusable and then harvested. Only then it will spread through the diversity of digital reuse. This means more and rougher standardization for files, metadata, APIs and so forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage as free knowledge means shaping access as described above, but it is not to stop there. It needs to be accessible so that artists, game designers, scientists and any citizen can freely play and work with its digital derivates. It needs to be free to become the raw material to create the cultural heritage of the future. Digital technologies are favouring mass media use. We talk about hundreds or thousands of media as stock for one application. This counts for digital humanities, for art apps, gaming, digital design and even the neighbour next door creating its own little art gallery. It may sound as an inflationary use of cultural treasures. But, hey it is not the original but its digital copy. This is adding new opportunities to the former more selective use. It opens the giant’s shoulders to more people to stand on them to look further.</p>\r\nBeing a member of the Europeana Members Council I like to share my learnings. I like to enhance the community that works to free knowledge. Let us climb the shoulders of the giants together and free the knowledge we care for.</div>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Many of you know me from the annual <a href=\"http://www.digital-heritage.org.il/digital-heritage/\" target=\"_blank\">EVA/Minerva</a> conferences on the digitisation of cultural heritage which <a href=\"https://huji.academia.edu/DovWiner\" target=\"_blank\">Dov Winer</a> and I have co-chaired since 2004. For those who have not yet joined us, we look forward to hosting you in Jerusalem on the second week of November for the years to come – save the date!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My own digital story starts even earlier than that. The Israel Museum was one of the first to go online back in 1996.Today, with more than 5 versions behind us, we are soon re-launching the new site that pulls into it over 1,200 online exhibitions, 220 exhibition mini sites, the daily calendar of events, and of course our online collections into a single, coherent platform. The site also includes a series of unique ventures, such as the wildly successful <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Dead Sea Scrolls</a> project, which received over one million unique users over the first 4 days following its launch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/goyasmall.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 367px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the Israel Museum’s yet to be launched new home page</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early days of the Europeana Network, the <a href=\"http://www.imj.org.il/\" target=\"_blank\">Israel Museum</a> joined the Minerva, and Athena projects as an Associated Member, and we uploaded our encyclopedic collections into Europeana, including our comprehensive Fine Arts, Jewish Art and Life, and Archaeology collections; our extensive holdings of biblical and Holy Land archaeology. What has always impressed me about the Europeana professional network was how all the numerous national representatives speaking more than the 24 official European languages could come together to discuss, and resolve so many critical issues. I have sat on several working groups over the years, and have listened to some of the brightest minds in Europe thrash out proposals from their own practice to scale their experience towards the magnitude of a Pan-Europeana library. And most amazingly – it all worked! Clearly there is still plenty to do, and I am honored to be able to join the Members Council and look forward to be able to make a contribution in the months to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/israelmuseumsmall.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the of Israel Museum’s new collections page</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My own activities in Europeana tended to be all about end users. After Hans van der Linden established the UGC Thematic Task Force, I took over the chair from Frans Hoving in 2011 to review the then current practices required to support content providers and aggregators define, create, moderate, and accommodate their user generated content. After much discussion between the group, <a href=\"http://www.cvce.eu/en/le-cvce/equipe/lars_wieneke\" target=\"_blank\">Lars Wieneke</a> (CVCE, Luxembourg) and I delivered our white paper, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/ugc-task-force-results.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Report on the results of the UGC Thematic Task Force</a> at the Europeana, 2012 Plenary in Leuven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana community is always concerned with crucial issues, but our leaders also know how to deliver these discussions in persuasive ways. At the Europeana plenary, still in 2012 in Leuven, I was delighted to be cajoled into acting as an honourable member in the Cultural Commons Oxford style debate to argue – <em>This House believes that: all content in the Europeana Cultural Commons should be freely available for re-use</em>. To be honest, I don’t recall which side I was supposed to be supporting; the setting was stunning and the proceedings a lot of fun. I do remember, however, that it it was diametrically opposed to my principles, but hey, when you are facing the Hon. Member <a href=\"http://disruptivemedia.org.uk/tag/gary-hall/\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Hall</a>, from the Centre for Disruptive Media, no holds are barred. For those curious to remember this entertaining debate – there is a wonderful stream of juicy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/eLeuven2012?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">tweets archived online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been interested in <a href=\"http://www.musesphere.com/about/Susan.Hazan.html\" target=\"_blank\">combining practice with theory</a>, and my academic research has focused on the impact of the mediated museum and the ways that museums are ‘performed’ in so many ways; online, over traditional media, as well as in the physical gallery. I contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.v-must.net/\" target=\"_blank\">V-Must project</a>, a Network of Excellence, funded by the European FP7 Network of Excellence that focused on Virtual Museums, and have <a href=\"https://imjnet.academia.edu/SusanHazan\" target=\"_blank\">written extensively</a> on these subjects. I hope to be able to make some sort of contribution towards this as Council Member in the months to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe is currently undergoing massive upheavals: the potential of digital delivery of its cultural heritage is almost bewildering. There is no better way to understand who we are than by connecting to our histories, and to the structured narratives that move through electronic networks to open up new pathways for self-directed learning and creative ways of thinking about self; past and present.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'And the quest for better metadata quality goes on: an update from the DQC'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In March 2016 we announced the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-quest-for-better-quality-data-has-started\">creation of a Europeana Data Quality Committee </a>(DQC) to work on the various facets of data quality. The Data Quality subject is a Hydra difficult to defeat, but the Committee is definitely challenging the beast - as proven by the work accomplished over the past year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supporting user needs with quality metadata</strong> - the need for high quality metadata in Europeana is motivated by its impact on search performance, on the overall Europeana user experience and on the re-use of the data. Rather than making it a theoretical effort, the DQC decided to focus on data quality from the perspective of its intended use. It resulted in the creation of a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ej0ouDg_uhOVnE1LE2-IEtI9xNhMpeqzNIIwSjLoAbI/edit#\">series of usage scenarios</a> reflecting information retrieval requirements. These scenarios provide context and guiding principles for the work of the DQC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining clearer requirements</strong> - a way for Europeana to improve data quality has been to define mandatory elements as part of the Europeana Data Model (EDM). However mandatoriness does not always entail good data quality: the required elements are not necessarily in the source metadata, and are often created by providers on the go, which sometimes result in duplicated values. Although our first impulse was to make more elements mandatory, we had to go against it !</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DQC agreed on two new ways of categorising the current EDM elements: mandatory elements and enabling elements. While enabling elements support definite desirable (but optional) functionalities for a specific (set of) usage scenario(s), mandatory elements are required as a fundamental minimum for all metadata descriptions. The DQC has formulated a list of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_WG/DataQualityCommittee/DataQualityCommittee-2016Report.pdf\">recommendations for mandatory elements </a>which will be incorporated into the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation\">EDM mapping guidelines</a>. These recommendations confirm some existing EDM elements as mandatory, define new ones as recommended, and remove the constraints for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step is to define a list of enabling elements. This new set of recommendations should highlight the importance of some elements in the realisation of the usage scenarios defined earlier. In the meantime, we also suggested clarifications in the definitions of some elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Measuring metadata quality </strong>- Assessing the quality of its data is crucial for Europeana. The DQC started to work on a completeness rating indicating most complete metadata descriptions. This work was highly motivated by DQC member Péter Király’s individual effort as part of his <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/pkiraly/metadata-quality-assurance-framework-at-qqml2016-full\">Metadata Quality Assurance Framework</a>. The completeness is measured along different profiles, such as the presence of mandatory fields or the appropriate tagging of field values (including translations) within a record with language tags (e.g., 'en' for English and 'fr' for French). Once complete, this work is expected to yield a metric for metadata completeness that can be used to inform data reusers and Europeana officers of the datasets quality, and to improve search and ranking on Europeana Collections. The DQC also discusses ways of visualising these calculations in charts or other graphic representations. Examples can be found <a href=\"http://pkiraly.github.io/2016/04/09/third-report/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Identifying errors in metadata values </strong>- While the completeness measure focuses on the presence of a given field in a metadata record, it doesn’t provide any quality indicator on the value a field holds. The Committee has gathered <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zoU-1uPk2O5t5zRC1-MD3LakBQGJ2hsWlSnp3XS2iAk/edit\">a list of problem patterns</a> for metadata values (e.g., data normalisation issues) that affect search and interfere with ranking algorithms. The next step will consist in testing new technologies to (1) identify the problem patterns in the data, (2) solve some of these issues (via normalisation for instance). We encourage data providers working with Europeana to help us flagging more problems so that they can be fixed as early as possible in the delivery of the data !</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions were not limited to these topics. The relation between data quality and the representation of events, dates and language normalisation as well as the distinction between type and genre information also raised attention and might be considered as topics for more work in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>You can follow the work of the Data Quality Committee <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/data-quality-committee\">here</a>.</div>\r\n"

        title: 'New interactive player Europeana Radio launches as an outcome of Europeana Sounds project'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://http://www.europeana.eu/portal/radio.html\">new application Europeana Radio</a>, powered by songs from the Europeana Music Collections and gathering audio archives from all over Europe, is launching on 12 January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This latest achievement has been accomplished after 3 years of collecting sounds archives on Europeana Music from institutions across Europe. The Europeana Sounds project involved 24 partners from 12 European countries (including national libraries, sound institutions, research centres and universities) working together to make audio and audio-related content accessible to public audiences, the creative industries and researchers. One outcome of the project, Europeana Music Collections gather music recordings, sounds, radio programmes and more musical archives enriched with meaningful contextual knowledge. To ensure the widest possible availability of this content, Europeana Radio builds on the Music Collections and provides an easy access to a wide ranging selection of sound treasures, inviting historians, academics and listeners from general audiences to experience these recordings through a player. Almost 200,000 unique playable tracks are available to browse or play on random mode on three stations - Classical Music; Traditional and Folk Music; and Popular Music. Currently, 12 institutions have made their collection available in the radio, with more to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/download.gif\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 388px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Europeana Radio is an interactive tool more than just a radio: users can contribute and enrich the experience for others by tagging the musical genre while listening. Powered by the in-development<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/annotations\"> Europeana Annotations API</a>, this user tagging feature was thought as an opportunity to increase the discoverability of Institutions’ content in Europeana, and therefore enable content to reach more users – one of the platform’s core purposes. Technically speaking, it relies on semantic tagging to allow cross-language search: the tags themselves are drawn from a multilingual vocabulary. For instance, a French user searching for “musique chorale” will find objects tagged with “choral music, the tag value having multiple labels in multiple languages.</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>To coincide with its 2017 call for entries, Heritage in Motion has launched a <a href=\"http://www.heritageinmotion.eu/\">new website</a> offering an attractive more user friendly interface including easier access for and to submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An annual competition focused on digital productions about European heritage, Heritage in Motion celebrates the best multimedia achievements raising public awareness about Europe’s cultural heritage. The Awards comprises four categories: apps for mobile devices; websites and online content; games and interactive experiences; and film and video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-01/him2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 268px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creators and users of films, games, apps and websites are now invited to submit their innovative multimedia projects for the competition’s 4th edition via the new website until 14 March 2017. Full details on how to enter and information on previous submissions - which can now be accessed by year and category - can be found <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/himedition/entries-2016\">on the new website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the 2016 edition was marked by an impressive scope of projects and diversified entries, all using innovative ways of promoting Europe’s cultural heritage. The jury awarded Provincie Limburg winner of the Best Achievement Award for “<a href=\"http://www.heritageinmotion.eu/himentry/limburg-1914-1918-small-stories-from-a-great-war\">Limburg 1914-1918, Small stories from a Great War</a>”, a multi-channel project dedicated to engage a general audience in personal memories of the Great War. Sandro Claes, Head of the Heritage department, commented: <em>“we were already tremendously proud of our remembrance project and all the (national) recognition it got. Our project has increased and strengthened the cooperation between the participating 44 municipalities. But we are very grateful of the international exposure this award gives to all our efforts, creativity and goodwill.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.heritageinmotion.eu/himentry/virtual-architecture-museum\">The Virtual Architecture Museum: Russia by Vizerra</a>, an app exploring unrealised architectural projects in a 3D game-like virtual exhibition, was the winner in the best app category. For Alexander Lavrov, CEO of Vizerra, the company behind the project, <em>“it was such an honour to take part in the competition among the best museums’ projects.

        body: "<p>Launched 3 years ago, the ambitious Europeana Sounds project has reached its goal: the new platform Europeana Radio, powered by songs from the Europeana Music Collections and gathering audio archives from all over Europe, is launching on 12 January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/europeana-radio.png\" style=\"width: 596px; height: 389px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This latest achievement by Europeana Sounds has been accomplished after 3 years of collecting sounds archives on Europeana Music from 19 institutions involved across Europe. The project involved 24 partners from 12 European countries (including national libraries, sound institutions, research centres and universities) working together to make audio and audio-related content accessible to public audiences, the creative industries and researchers. A direct outcome of the project, Europeana Music Collections gathers music recordings, sounds, radio programmes and more musical archives enriched with meaningful contextual knowledge. In the future, more thematic collections will be created such Photography in 2017, Newspapers and World War One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure the widest possible availability of this content and improve the user experience, Europeana Radio now provides and easy access to sound treasures. A selection of archive from cultural institutions across Europe is available to browse or play on random mode on two stations - Classical Music, and Traditional and Folk Music. 189,148 unique playable tracks from the sound archives collected over the past 3 years are available on Europeana radio, with sound recordings including Classical, Folk, Traditional and Popular music, Languages and dialects, Spoken-word, Soundscapes and Natural recordings. Users can also contribute by tagging the musical instruments while listening, making Europeana Radio an interactive tool more than just a radio. Users can learn how to participate in adding instrument tags here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of Europeana Radio marks the beginning of easy access to sound treasures, where listeners are free to browse, listen and tag!</p>"

        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 11 November, <a href=\"http://www.iccu.sbn.it/opencms/opencms/it/\" target=\"_blank\">ICCU</a> and <a href=\"http://www.icbsa.it/\" target=\"_blank\">ICBSA</a> collaborated with <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Italy</a> to host the 9th Europeana Sounds edit-a-thon, dedicated to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi\" target=\"_blank\">Giuseppe Verdi</a>. 21 experts from institutions from all over Italy came together to share their knowledge about Verdi and his work. With the help of books and online resources, they created 12 new Wikipedia articles and enriched 19 existing ones to bring their knowledge to a wider public. The day has been productive, and you can read more about the session on <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/21-experts-came-together-to-enrich-wikipedia-about-everything-verdi-related\">Europeana Sounds</a>. Now, let’s take a look at some figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/coordinqtion-pqge.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 256px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progetto:GLAM/ICCU/Editathon_verdiano\">coordination page</a> of the Giuseppe Verdi edit-a-thon on Italian Wikipedia.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Verdi\">article</a> about Giuseppe Verdi is available on Wikipedia in 123 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, French, Bulgarian, Korean, Urdu, and so on. The Hungarian version has been voted by its Wikipedia community as “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles\">featured article</a>”, which means that it is considered among the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, according to Wikipedia editors themselves. The English and Japanese ones received the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles\">good article</a>” status: the articles meet a core set of Wikipedia editorial standards, but are not quite yet ready to be considered “featured”. For now, the Italian article, though very exhaustive, underwent a community peer review and has been proposed as a “<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Voci_di_qualit%C3%A0\">good article</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/list-of-languages.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 358px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A list of the languages in which a Wikipedia article about Giuseppe Verdi exists</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding pages covering Verdi’s work, 18 Wikipedias at least have an article dedicated to each opera. The most translated article is <em>Aida</em> (55 versions), followed by <em>La Traviata</em> (50 versions), <em>Rigoletto</em> (49) and <em>Nabucco</em> (44). <em>Rigoletto</em>, <em>La Traviata</em>, <em>Otello</em> and <em>Falstaff</em> were made “featured articles” on at least one version of Wikipedia (respectively the German, Hungarian, Catalan and English Wikipedias). The Russian article about <em>Alzira</em>, the Japanese entry for Macbeth and the French one for Luisa Miller have been voted “good articles” by the respective communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/macbeth-japanese-version.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 340px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Japanese article about <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%AF%E3%83%99%E3%82%B9_(%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3)\">Macbeth</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In less than two weeks, the 90 files made available by ICBSA for Europeana and the Verdi Wikimedia edit-a-thon have been viewed by over 130,000 visitors! Europeana partners can enrich Wikipedia articles with audio content to make their collections available in a context relevant to the user, ensuring they reach a wider audience. As Wikipedia offers a reliable start for any encyclopedia research, Europeana enables to enrich any search by browsing millions of images, texts, audio files and videos. Considering the past nine edit-a-thons, the cooperation between these two projects is a reciprocal improvement towards the valorisation of the European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luca Martinelli – ICCU/Wikimedia Italia, Elisa Sciotti - ICCU</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>Following on from a<a href=\"/blogpost/reaching-out-to-education-professionals-highlights-from-the-tueuropeana-project-workshop-in-lubin\"> first post about education professionals</a>, this second blog focuses on cultural institutions and collection holders.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/R2Z3RSMoGfw?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=etVRq\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">TuEuropeana</a> project recently led a series of workshops in Poland, inviting potential Europeana users to exchange about their experiences. While the first sessions in Lublin focused on educational use, we invited representatives of various cultural institutions and digital collection holders to a second workshop series aimed at debunking myths and insecurities about digital access to international collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/workshop2b.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 201px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo. </em><em>Maciej Rutkowski, PSNC, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions took place in Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center, the leader in implementing innovative technologies for the national scientific network. Workshops were prepared and performed by Marcin Werla, Head of Digital Libraries and Knowledge Platforms Department in Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center, with interventions by other expert speakers - such as Joris Pekel, author of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, a useful tool for cultural institutions planning their collaboration with Europeana. About the cooperation between cultural institutions and external platforms, Karolina Tabak, a representative of <a href=\"http://www.mnw.art.pl/en/\">National Museum of Warsaw</a>, presented effects of collaboration with Wikipedia, while Maja Drabczyk from <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/\">National Audiovisual Institute</a> in Warsaw talked about benefits coming from being part of the <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen Network</a>. Participants also discussed customer experience on the basis of a survey by the <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/?lang=en\">Federation of Digital Libraries</a>: interviewees pointed out main drawbacks encountered while going through collections, such as complicated search engines and difficulties narrowing results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/blog2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 290px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo. </em><em>Maciej Rutkowski, PSNC, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museums and libraries professionals noted a paradoxical situation: although the amount of digital collections is increasing, the number of online visitors doesn’t follow. In order to design, challenge and pivot our goals, we described the process with a standard business model canvas. If cultural activities are frequently perceived in opposition to business, we realised that both share very similar intentions: reaching as many people as possible. How can we set the process in place and create value for the users? And can the process be executed in accordance with institution’s intentions and expectations of the audience? Divided in groups, participants identified different crucial areas supporting their effort - key partners, activities and resources, value proposition, customer relationships and segments, channels, cost structure and revenue streams. This approach encouraged us to weight development possibilities for these institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens next? We plan to extend the training programme to institutional collection holders and give them the opportunity to exchange views and rethink their strategy with regard to creating useful and appealing access to their online collections, in an international context.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Highlights from the TuEuropeana project workshops: Europeana for Education'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><strong>This first blog post from a series dedicated to workshops led by TuEuropeana focuses on education professionals.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DJ3nYwTB-k0?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=87dTm\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">TuEuropeana</a> project recently led a series of workshops in Poland, inviting potential Europeana users to exchange about their experiences. Created by the Polish Europeana Network, a local working group initiated by <a href=\"http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/pages/the-ministry-of-culture-and-national-heritage.php?lang=EN\">The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage</a> in 2014 and coordinated by the <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/\">National Audiovisual Institute</a>, the project gathers institutions that contribute and aggregate collections to Europeana, and others focusing on related areas. The purpose of these sessions, aimed at different groups and their specific audiences, was to enhance the communication between contributing institutions, Europeana and its users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Lublin, our first workshop series reached out to teachers, educators, and educational practitioners from various institutions gathered in two unique locations: <a href=\"http://teatrnn.pl/en/\">The Grodzka Gate - NN Theatre Centre</a> and <a href=\"http://teatrnn.pl/about-us/the-house-of-words/\">The House of Words</a>, the local museum of typography. Our main purpose was to make Europeana more accessible for education professionals, to raise their awareness about digital collections, and to inspire them with different educational tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/workshop5.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Anna Misiewicz is a legal specialist in copyright law and intellectual property who held one of the workshops lectures and answered to all participants questions. Photo. Kamil Stępień, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do so, we encouraged them to use and mix Europeana’s collections alongside other available digital collections, to demonstrate how teaching materials can be enriched with archival resources. Each participant created their own prototype of an educational tool or seminar scenarios following different paths of inspirations, such as digital storytelling, history in photography, interactive walk or digital academic collections. Playing with the Europeana portal and its content, participants made their own curator choices, and thought of possible improvements for their work and the platform functionalities. The group also discussed how to practically handle Europeana’s search engine and make collections retrieval more effective (i.e. trying various keywords, using different languages, browsing thematic collections or playing with filters!). A discussion on copyright preceded all the efforts, explaining how it applies to Europeana’s collections, and for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/workshop2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Agata Krawczyk - Ministry’s of Culture and National Heritage Europeana working group coordinator. Ph</em><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-right;\">oto. Kamil Stępień, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop confirmed a strong interest from educators to integrate digital content to their teaching materials. However, we still need to provide them with more explanation and training. Following on from this first workshop, we decided, with further support from the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, to implement in the near future a series of educational events focused on reuse of online collections for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'The latest on Copyright Reform: Europeana''s updated mandate'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Since 2014 Europeana has been advocating on your behalf for changes to the European copyright framework that better reflect the needs of cultural heritage institutions in the digital environment. As part of this we have been argued for better copyright rules that would allow Archives, Musea and Libraries to make more of their collections available online, thereby closing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">the 20th century black hole</a>. We have undertaken these advocacy activities based on the positions expressed out in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/public-consultation-on-eu-copyright-rules\">Europeana's response the European Commission's public consultation on a review of the EU copyright rules</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nOn the 14th of September 2016 the European Commission presented<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules\"> its proposal for modernizing the EU copyright rules</a> - the next step in the legislative process is for these proposals to be discussed in the European Parliament and the Council in the coming months. The proposed <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016PC0593\">directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market</a> contains proposals for addressing two of the core issues that Europeana has been working on in the past 2 years: An exception aimed at allowing digitization for preservation and a licensing mechanism for Out of Commerce Works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nIn the light of these concrete legislative proposals the Europeana Foundation board has asked the Copyright working group of the Europeana Network to produce <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/2016%20Update%20to%20copyright%20mandate/europeana-policy-updated-mandate-dec-2016-.pdf\">an updated mandate</a> that can serve as the basis for advocacy activities of Europeana aimed at improving the commission's proposals. Over the past few weeks the copyright working group has drafted an updated mandate and last week the Members Council of the Europeana Network association has formally approved the updated mandate, which identifies the issues that Europeana should focus on and for each issue it describes an advocacy objective and recommends a level of engagement for Europeana. In total there are 12 issues that fall into four categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n<strong>Issues core to Europeana and the Network</strong>, which include the above mentioned issue of online access to out of commerce works contained in the collections of cultural heritage institutions and digitization for preservation. These two issues will remain the main focus of our advocacy efforts.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Issues with direct relevance to Europeana</strong>, which include the proposed exception that would allow Text and Data mining and the proposed exception for online educational activities. In both cases Europeana will work with other stakeholders to widen the scope of the exceptions proposed by the Commission.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Issues with direct relevance to members of the Europeana Network</strong>. These include the speedy implementation of the Marrakesh treaty and restoring the ability of publishers to receive compensation for uses made under exceptions. In addition Europeana will also support library organisations in efforts to improve rules regarding on document delivery and on site consultation of works held by CHIs.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>Issues that should be monitored by Europeana</strong>. Finally the mandate identifies a number of issues that should be monitored by Europeana, but where there is no clear need to actively intervene at this moment. These issues include the duration of copyright protection the legal definition of hyperlinks, the proposals of the commission to introduce a new ancillary copyright for press publishers and to require large UGC platforms to filter user uploaded content, and the legal status of e-lending,</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>You can read the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/2016%20Update%20to%20copyright%20mandate/europeana-policy-updated-mandate-dec-2016-.pdf\"> full updated mandate here</a>. While the mandate has been approved with a clear majority (of the 29 councillors who took part in the vote 2 abstained and the other 27 approved the mandate) a small number of organisations have recorded their dissent with the mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The ministry of culture of Spain has made it clear that this mandate does not reflect its official position.</li>\r\n    <li>Similarly the <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">Bibliotheque nationale de France</a> has noted that it follows the position of the French Ministry of Culture and Communication which differs from Europeana's position on almost all points.</li>\r\n    <li>And finally the <a href=\"http://www.fep-fee.eu\">European Federation of Publishers </a>and the<a href=\"https://www.ifrro.org\"> International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations</a> are only supporting parts of the mandate (including the 2 core issues).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>All in all this signifies strong support from across the Europeana Network for the mandate, which will help us in trying to achieve our objectives over the coming months. We welcome your comments and questions on the paper - and invite you to submit these to <a href=\"mailto:copyright@europeana.eu?subject=Feedback%3A%202016%20updated%20copyright%20mandate\">copyright@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of these activities Europeana, together with IFLA, EBLIDA, Public Libraries 2020 and LIBER has <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/files/assets/clm/publications/copyright_proposals_-_library_and_chi_responses.pdf\">issued a position paper </a>with highlights the concerns that Libraries and cultural heritage institutions have with regards to the Commission's proposals.</p>"

        title: 'Using Technology for Good — Europeana is in the NT100 2016 as a leader in the field'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>As many of you know I am very keen on a Cultural Commons and the role of Culture in our society, so I am particularly pleased to finish this year with news that Europeana has been named by <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\">the Nominet Trust</a> as one of the 2016 NT100, the annual celebration of 100 inspiring tech for good projects from around the world. This is a real honouring of the work and efforts accomplished by many of you throughout 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nominet Trust rewards innovative projects providing a better access to knowledge and education, and the fostering of understanding in society. These values relate strongly to those of Europeana where promoting the richness and diversity of our shared European cultural heritage for the benefit of all, through digital technology is at the heart of our mission. Being thought of as a leading innovator in the field is recognition of the vision that the European Commission (EC) and the Member States (MS) had in establishing Europeana. A vision recently reinvigorated by <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9643-2016-INIT/en/pdf\">Council Conclusions</a> which renewed the commitment of MS, and the CEF funding which might well get us to the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This award is also a recognition of the work of our stakeholders and partners whose work contributes at so many different levels to bring our shared ideal of open and accessible cultural heritage to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural Heritage Institutions, believing in the dream to create universal access to our shared cultural heritage, have striven to improve their content this year by doubling the amount of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">tier 2</a> material available and so providing more opportunities for people to find and view it through Europeana, e.g. through our thematic collections, of which more later. This was helped by MS and their museums and libraries each delivering up to 10 high quality, open pieces of art for the successful <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/from-bikes-to-jumping-jacks-celebrate-europe-s-art-history-the-digital-way\">Europeana280 campaign</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That campaign furthered our ambition to use technology to connect people directly with their shared cultural heritage by bringing art to the streets with #BigArtRide and #JumpingJacks. And we also held our first <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a><a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/\"> Transcribathon</a>, crowdsourcing the greater use of diaries and letters from WW1 and directly engaging people with their past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use by the creative industries demonstrates the possibilities for innovation opened up when we bring technology and culture together. This has been underpinned by our challenges, awarding funding to good ideas using Europeana material helped by our partners Platoniq and Media Deals who delivered <a href=\"http://wotify.eu/\">co-creation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.media-deals.org/\">investment</a> services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to make this this public facing work possible are the taskforces and working groups of the Europeana Network Association. Their volunteering in areas such as copyright, IIIF, standardization, multilingualism and search improvement makes national patrimonies discoverable and reusable including in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Education%20and%20Learning%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\">Education</a> and <a href=\"http://jamdots.nl/view/204/Europeana---Recommendations-for-Research?divFallback=1\">Research</a> creating more equal access to knowledge and fostering, we hope, understanding in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not forgetting our wonderful Board who have helped us to refine strategy, own our position consequent to Council Conclusions and keep us on the straight and innovative path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course none of this would happen without the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/staff\">Europeana office</a> – a team who have successfully established a way to bring people together, according to their interest, with the introduction of thematic collections: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history.html\">Europeana Art</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/music\">Europeana Music</a>. A team who have brought <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/radio.html\">Europeana Radio</a> to life, who work towards making life easier for others by working on the data or with the delivery of continuous publication and innovation in the ingestion of cultural heritage data. A team that is responsible for new partnerships with Ministries of Education or <a href=\"http://theartsplus.com/\">Arts+ at the Frankfurt Book Fair</a> or showing new ways of seeing our heritage via <a href=\"http://gifitup2016.tumblr.com/\">GifitUp</a> or our <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\" target=\"_blank\">Faces of Europe</a> exhibition. A set of people who continuously look to improve our infrastructure, interoperability, quality of the data, search, user experience and services so that society can benefit from Europe’s rich cultural heritage. People who keep Europeana running even when our hosting provider suffers catastrophic failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating the societal impact of our work beyond numbers <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/impact-assessment-case-study\">the Impact Framework</a> adds to our other frameworks on copyright, publishing and <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/\">our DPLA joint venture on Rightsstatements.org</a>, putting some ‘science’ to the recognition that this award gives us and doing it in an easily digestible video: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/183833345\">Workers Underground</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping the dream alive is one thing, but we also need to share it with others and spread the word as much as possible - digital technology helps us to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with the Marketing &amp; Communications team in Europeana the #AllezCulture working group Network members enhanced awareness about Europeana with enthusiasm using the tagline I am @Europeana. During April and May people were asked to find and share their cultural hero or heroine via Twitter, encouraging both organisations and individuals to interact with our content and resulting in 10 million impressions on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And sharing Europeana content online in the places where people work and play has resulted in 175 million views this year - almost double 2015’s figure - demonstrating that our goal of providing better access is not just a dream, we are making it a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So counting down to Christmas a big thank you to all of you who have helped transform the world with culture this year, you deserve this recognition!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about NT100 and the 99 other nominees on <a href=\"http://socialtech.org.uk/nominet-trust-100/2016\">socialtech.org.uk</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezCulture!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Strike a match for education: help us find projects that reuse cultural heritage for learning'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Do you know of any fascinating projects that reuse Europeana’s openly licensed content for educational purposes? In cooperation with crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo</a>, Europeana will launch a match funding call in February 2017. Within this match funding campaign we will allocate 10,000 EUR to co-fund up to three innovative projects that reuse our content for secondary education purposes. We invite cultural heritage institutions to reach out to their creative communities and encourage them to take advantage of this unique funding opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s match funding campaign will run for five months and follow a number of steps. First, creatives will be able to submit their proposals between early February and mid March. We will then carry on with proposal evaluation and announce the selected projects by the end of March. Throughout April, the winners will work together with Goteo representatives and learn how to design a successful crowdfunding campaign. The three crowdfunding campaigns will go live by the end of April and run until June.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The eligible project proposals should meet certain criteria, such as innovation, engagement, feasibility, use of Europeana openly licensed material, and relevance for secondary education. They can vary from apps, MOOCs, e-books, to documentaries or other creative educational tools. Soon, Europeana will release more detailed information about this match funding call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why match funding?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been collaborating with Platoniq’s crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo.org</a> to promote alternative funding strategies for creative projects using digital cultural content. Recently, we introduced <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/goteo-and-the-case-for-match-funding\">match-funding</a>, a method which encourages co-investment between public and private institutions and the crowd. The crowd is invited to invest in a project through small fund donations and the institution matches these contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Match funding has proved to be a powerful tool for increasing the impact of crowdfunding. Usually, the success rate (reaching the minimum set budget) of crowdfunding campaigns on Goteo is 71%. This rate rises to 90% when match funding is introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a> (VGY)<span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></span>online service, developed within the Europeana Creative project, is an inspiring example of a match funding campaign with cultural heritage content. In 2015, The VGY team ran a successful match <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/project/vangoyourself\">funding campaign</a>; it exceeded the 5,000 EUR set budget. This campaign was supported by the International University of Andalusia (UNIA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together we can support creative communities. Spread the word about our match funding call, and help us find the best digital cultural heritage projects that require funding! If you're interested in joining this call, we would like to know who you are. Contact us to learn more and become involved!</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>GIFT is a Horizon2020-funded project exploring hybrid forms of ‘virtual museum’ experiences, which use digital formats to enable new ways to explore the museum both as a physical and a digital space. By bringing together artists, designers and computer scientists, this project will prioritise user experiences over technology, and aim to facilitate meaningful experiences that allow for personal, complex and nuanced encounters with art and cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To successfully deploy these new methods of working with cultural heritage in museums, institutions need to adapt their structures. Describing this change process is part of our research. For this purpose, a framework for tools, theories, and best practices guidelines for hybrid virtual museum experiences is developed together with museum partners in the Action Research Module (ARM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a call for partner institutions to join us in this endeavour! It goes without saying that Europeana as a partner is proud to assist in reaching out to museums and supports this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By joining the GIFT project as an ARM partner you will have the opportunity to build important skills and gain knowledge related to the creation of personalised and meaningful virtual experiences for audiences, tailored to the specific circumstances and challenges of their museum. Your institution will also have access to expert knowledge and gain insights into the approach development in this area. At the same time, the GIFT project offers an opportunity to share experiences, challenges and best practices with a small group of other museums, and, if desired, more widely with the sector. Finally, joining the project gives the ability to shape an important European project that will have a positive impact on museums’ digital engagement with audiences and related capacity building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information about the GIFT project can be found on the <a href=\"https://gift.itu.dk/\">GIFT website</a>. A <a href=\"https://gift.itu.dk/the-gift-project-is-seeking-interested-museum-partners/\">detailed document about the Action Research Module</a> is available too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your museum is interested in joining GIFT, please complete the <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/RJ5SNJ2\">Expression of Interest form</a> by 5pm CET on Tuesday, 10 January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any questions about the project or the Action Research Module can be answered by <a href=\"mailto:mpic@itu.dk\">Martin Pichlmair (mpic@itu.dk)</a>.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Twenty teachers of all disciplines from 10 EU countries took part in a workshop — from 28-29 November, led and hosted by <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> (EUN) in Brussels — to help us better understand how educators are engaging with, searching for and using digital cultural heritage content. Only a few of the teachers, a mix of primary and secondary school teachers, were aware of Europeana before the workshop. As a result, the workshop was a great opportunity to test how they responded to our educational offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were lucky to be hosted in EUN’s <a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/\">Future Classroom Lab</a>, an inspiring space that aims to redefine formal educational environments and innovate how teachers teach and pupils learn. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bartverswijvel\">Bart Verswijvel</a>, Pedagogical Advisor at EUN, first introduced the <a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/toolkit\">Future Classroom Toolkit</a> and the range of resources available to help understand and bring about innovation in a school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch, it was time to <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/eun-teacher-validation-workshop-v3\">introduce Europeana</a>. We started with who we are and what we do, the types of learning platforms where you can find and use our content (like the <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/\">Learning Resource Exchange</a> and the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/art-faces\">FACES app</a>), to the content available on our site and the best ways to find the content you need for your class.Before the workshop began, teachers were asked about what themes were most important in their classrooms at the moment. From those who responded, the primary themes emerging were the First World War and art and art history — two areas where Europeana has really strong and engaging collections. So, after showing teachers the best ways to find content, we set them a task. As groups, they had to choose a theme and find related content from either <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art\">art history</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">First World War</a> on Europeana using a variety of media — from exhibitions to letters to videos — and to create a learning activity exploring that theme and present this to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/two-screens.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><em>The teachers' tasks. Brussels 28 November 2016, CC BY-SA</em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task sounds simple but the teachers had a lot to consider in a short space of time. First, how do they find relevant content and what searches are most effective? Second, is the material suitable to be used in an educational setting (based on the licence)? Third, is the content of high enough quality to be used? And finally, how would they credit the resource? When the teachers had sourced the content, they were asked to consider the types of learning activities they could base around their theme. The themes that emerged were diverse: from the simple — horses in art history — to the complex, like representations of time in art and love and families in the First World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We also had time at the end of the day to discuss how they found the process of searching for their content. They found the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/eun-teacher-validation-workshop-v3\">introduction</a> to the licences, search tips and crediting very useful. They also loved the personally contributed stories, memories and pictures on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> that you can’t find in any other archive. The teachers were also now able to discuss the benefits of using Europeana’s search instead of an internet search. Knowing that the content is legally accessible and in high resolution is a great draw for educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>We were able to capture a lot of additional great feedback from the teachers. Their comments and suggestions will be useful to help us shape how we work with educators and educational partners. The next step is to bring the same teachers back together at the end of February 2017 to see if and how they’ve been using Europeana content, what new challenges they may have encountered and what inspiration they’ve found and want to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Gina Mihai, Bart Verswijvel and their colleagues at European Schoolnet for making this opportunity happen as part of our partnership in DSI2. Thanks also to the teachers for their enthusiasm!</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/eun-teacher-validation-workshop-v3\">Check out the slides</a> to find search tips, assistance with attributing content and an introduction to licences that can be used in education, and, last but not least: have a look at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/albums/72157673344889043\">pictures from the teachers’ workshop</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The beginning of November marked the launch of the two month RE-MEDIA: EUROPEANA program at the <a href=\"http://www.sof.edu.pl/en/\">School of Form</a> (SoF) in Poznań, Poland. This program is part of <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">Tu Europeana</a>, a campaign coordinated by the Polish Ministry of Culture and National AudioVisual Institute of Poland (NInA) to increase the awareness of digital cultural heritage available in Europeana Collections and to encourage reuse of openly-licensed materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RE-MEDIA: EUROPEANA is a series of weekly workshops on topics related to various aspects of the creative re-use: content, IPR, and prototyping. The program participants are students selected from various countries and disciplines, including Communication Design, Industrial Design, Fashion Design and Domestic Design. They will use the tools of design research, new media, application design, alternative thinking on arts and fashion design, music and cinema resources to explore the re-use potential of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the participants is also Tetiana Baran, one of the winners of the Europeana Labs mini challenge that took place at THE ARTS+ Fair in Frankfurt earlier this year. Tetiana will be able to share her first-hand experience with Europeana content and support with tips and ideas during the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Małgorzata Szynkielewska, Content and Exhibitions Coordinator at Europeana, led the second RE-MEDIA workshop on 15 November which introduced the students to the rich and diverse Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: justify;\"><span><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-12/re-media-blog-01-12-2016.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 463px;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants of the Re-media Europeana workshop.

They looked at various examples of how others have used digital collections in a creative way. Special attention was paid to the responsible use of digital content as the students learned about the different rights statements and the correct ways to credit original works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next weeks the students will develop their own projects with Europeana content. The prototypes (applications, visualisations, art and new media) will be showcased at a special event organized by the National AudioVisual Institute of Poland in Warsaw in the beginning of 2017. We look forward to seeing what those creative young minds will come up with!</p>"

        body: "<p>“The main tenet of design thinking is empathy for the people youʼre trying to design for.” <em>-David M. Kelly (Founder IDEO)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we have placed ‘design thinking’ at the centre of our product development. A problem-based approach where we empathise, understand and provide solutions to a problem. This is what was presented at the “What is a camel?” chefs table during the 2016 AGM in Riga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/person-presentation.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/process.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 745px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see design as a way to come up with a solution through aesthetic, function and form. But to be able to do so requires compromise and testing. Focusing on the problem first gives us an understanding of the needs of our users and provides valuable insights, which, in turn, help us create and increase value for the users. But in order to ensure that the quality remains high, we need to test and repeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great example is our grid view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The Europeana grid - a case study</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our core problem: this is what we promise the user</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Browse Europeana items in a more visual way; and</li>\r\n    <li>quickly scan the search results and select what you are looking for.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extra restrictions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>No cropped images;</li>\r\n    <li>satisfy all type of content (text only, title only, books, movies, newspapers);</li>\r\n    <li>no record should overshadow others;</li>\r\n    <li>differences in both quality and size of images;</li>\r\n    <li>source of image should be clear, complete, visually appealing; and</li>\r\n    <li>…the list goes on.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with research and spent time familiarising ourselves with all the solutions out there. In order to tackle the problem we broke it down into smaller digestible pieces, and we went through build, test, evaluate, and redesign iterations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/update-to-grid-display.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 478px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iteration 01: successful</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Present a grid view and see if people use it. Validate the idea (for images only).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October more than 66,500 search page views used the grid, and the number increases month after month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iteration 02: successful</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second iteration we decided to add more record types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had the design tested by an external company (other specialists and designers) with a heuristics review. Additionally, we ran some direct user testing by conducting interviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iteration 03: failed internal testing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the third iteration we wanted to push the limits and make it as dynamic as possible and include as much info as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our internal user testing failed. It was difficult to scan and the info was overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/update-last-iteration.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iteration 04: successful</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our last try, we removed the text and kept it dynamic. This pleased everyone: data providers, casual users, researchers, and, most important, us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why should you care? Well, we want to involve you more. We want to make you part of our iterations and incorporate your feedback more often in our design and product development process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our community sites – Pro, Labs, Research – will undergo a redesign process. We already started by creating a group through our network that will assist us by testing the new site and providing feedback while we improve the development process to meet your needs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please subscribe <a href=\"http://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=daf01de388\">to our user testing mail list</a> and become part of our design iterations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"_com_1\" uage=\"JavaScript\">\r\n<p></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">A new Europeana crowdsource campaign will help disclose unique testimonies from the First World War. Early November three history students from the University of Latvia could be found, somewhere in snow covered Riga, feverishly typing away on their laptops. They were not writing their thesis, involved in study research, or even on Facebook. As it happened, they found themselves completely submerged in the world of Ansis Stradnieks who lived 100 years ago. They were transcribing the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/21034\">diary</a> that Stradnieks kept from 1915 to 1917 about his daily life in the Latvian town Kurzeme, then occupied by the German army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/text-1-.jpg\" style=\"height: 476px; width: 300px;\" /><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/cover-book.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 465px;\" /><em>Cover and page from Ansis Stradnieks’ diary CC BY-SA, The Latvian War Museum</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The three students, Anna-Anita Cirule, Vineta Blitsone and Anastasija Smirnova, participated as a team in the first International Transcribathon that took place from 7-9 November 2016 at the Latvian National Library in Riga. The event was held during the course of the 2016 Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (AGM). Nine teams from across Europe put their transcription skills to the test and presented their results to an international jury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/persons.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 211px;\" /><em>Team Latvian University: Anna-Anita Cirule, Vineta Blitsone and Anastasija Smirnova, CC BY-SA Europeana Foundation</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The teams were given 48 hours each to transcribe a chosen source, and were judged for the transcription’s quality and quantity, as well as their presentations. After careful deliberation, the High Jury, composed of military historian Stephen Bull, Mia Ridge, Digital Curator at the British Library, and Harry Verwayen, Deputy Director of Europeana, awarded prizes to the best teams in the Transcription and Presentation categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Team Latvian University was the Winner in the Transcription category. The first prize for Presentation was awarded to ‘Team France’, consisting of Europeana Network members Marie-Véronique Leroi and Elisabeth Freyre, who presented an illuminating insight to the Love Letters (<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/14262\">“Correspondance amoureuse”</a>) of Denise Brüller and Pierre Fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/group-prize.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 370px;\" /><em>Prize winners and jury members of the first International Transcribathon held in Riga, CC BY-SA Europeana Foundation</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event in Riga signalled the beginning of Transcribe Europeana 1914-1918 — an online crowdsourcing campaign to unlock important testimonies of the First World War for future generations by transcribing handwritten texts that are otherwise difficult to read and cannot be searched or translated online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the help of the professional and dedicated staff from partner institutions from the Europeana Network thousands of manuscripts have been published since 2011. All first-hand accounts of people who experienced the war, unique primary sources in need of being disclosed for research and reuse: hastily scribbled postcards between soldiers and their relatives, And they come from all over Europe: the battle notes from a French officer on the Balkan front; a Romanian sailor’s diary of his years as a prisoner of war in Japan; and letters from a Belgian refugee stuck somewhere in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transcribe Europeana 1914-1918 will run as an ongoing online challenge — a ‘Transcribathon’ in which members of the public are invited to take up the challenge at <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu\">www.transcribathon.eu</a> with digital versions of the handwritten testimonies from WW1’s home and battle fronts in 22 languages. The challenge will run until 2018, the centenary that marked the end of the First World War. The website is now free to use and open to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Transcribathon is ‘run’ by accumulating virtual miles with every word transcribed. Each participant works on the transcription of selected documents, for example, a diary or a letter, in a specific language. A ‘Transcribometer’ charts their progress as they compete against others to move up in the transcribers’ league.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A simple e-tutorial teaches participants how to decipher old and difficult to read handwriting in various languages with an easy-to-use online transcription tool. We hope that the challenge and the tool will help build an international community of contributors of all ages and nationalities who can share their knowledge and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People can take part individually from home or in teams at special Transcribathon events where a jury awards points for quality, quantity and presentation of transcriptions. All future event details will be announced on <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu\">www.transcribathon.eu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a>. The first planned events will be held in Romania and Italy in the first half of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in participating in a campaign, please feel free to contact Ad Pollé via <a href=\"mailto:ad.polle@europeana.eu\">ad.polle@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Who's Using What is a blog series by Gregory Markus from The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision as part of <a href=\"/page/contribute-to-europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a>. The idea behind the series was to raise awareness about the brilliant open source software options now available to institutions, and to encourage collaboration in the digital heritage community. What better way to show off these tools than talk to the developers making use of and developing them? You can also find lots of OS options in the new <a href=\"/page/floss-inventory\">EuropeanaTech FLOSS Inventory</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this edition of Who's Using What we reached out to <a href=\"https://github.com/rsinghal\" target=\"_blank\">Rashmi Singhal </a>of Harvard University. Rashmi, along with being a developer at Harvard also serves as technical lead for the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\" target=\"_blank\">IIIF</a> platform, <a href=\"http://projectmirador.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mirador.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I work on various digital humanities projects at Harvard University. Often, these projects already have legacy databases and data entry workflows set up, so I try to find ways to expose the data in ways that make it easier to use the data without changing the workflow for the users that use the databases. I usually use a stack that includes Django and ElasticSearch to create an API into those legacy database. I like to use Varnish to improve performance where I can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have used XML databases, such as eXistDB, when working with XML documents. I was also doing quite a bit of OCR work with open source OCR engines like Tesseract to aid in the creation of TEI documents of ancient Greek, Latin, and Arabic texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3. What are you currently developing?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am working with an Egyptologist at Harvard University who has an extensive archive of data from various excavations of the Giza Necropolis. By building an API on top of that data, we will soon be able to do interesting analysis and visualizations of the data that were not easy to do in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. What would you like to see developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would love to build on the work with the Egyptologist to find ways to connect distinct archaeological datasets that are owned by different institutions and use diverse schemas. A big hurdle is that often these datasets are either not digitized or not publicly available, but for those that are, moving towards interoperability would really improve the experiences of students and scholars.</p>\r\n"

And in the meantime, feel free to get in touch with them if you have any questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elections and voting — Lessons learnt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elections ran from 8 to 14 November. Out of 1,523 eligible voters, 444 participated in the elections and voting. We recorded 23 requests to receive a new User ID and password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EuropeanaElects&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#EuropeanaElects</a> hashtag was used 277 times, reaching a total audience of 304,805 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recorded a 30 percent participation rate, which is lower than in 2015. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\" target=\"_blank\">Voting/Elections Working Group </a>will look into the participation level closely and offer its recommendations at a later stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/mb-elections-timeline.jpg\" style=\"width: 486px; height: 288px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Members Council</a> is composed of 36 elected representatives and will start working together from 1 January 2017; however, they will be asked to participate in the Management Board election that kicks off in December 2016. The Members Council will elect a new Management Board between 10 and 17 January 2017; the results of the Management Board elections will be announced on 20 January 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next Members Council meeting will take place early 2017. As with our three meetings in 2016, we’ll be putting our heads together to draw up priorities for Europeana, and look at sustainability for the future. If you’d like to learn more about how the Members Council feeds into the work of Europeana, then please refer to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/about-our-network\" target=\"_blank\">our Network page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to thank all of you who ran for this election, and we hope to see you campaigning for a seat again next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, we would like to thank those Councilors who completed their two-year term: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/rene-capovin\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-f78b7bec-8640-a42c-128d-175380738839\" target=\"_blank\">René Capovin</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/jiri-frank\" target=\"_blank\">Jiří Frank</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/kerstin-herlt\" target=\"_blank\">Kerstin Herlt</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/jana-hoffmann\" target=\"_blank\">Jana Hoffmann</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/rolf-kallman\" target=\"_blank\">Rolf Kallman</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/breandan-knowlton\" target=\"_blank\">Breandán Knowlton</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/aranzazu-lafuente-urien\" target=\"_blank\">Aranzazu Lafuente Urién</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/olivier-schulbaum\" target=\"_blank\">Olivier Schulbaum</a>, and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/saso-zagoranski\" target=\"_blank\">Sašo Zagoranski</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/good-news-and-some-homework-for-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Council Conclusions</a> recognise the value of the Network Association, and that this represents an asset of the Europeana ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Association is still young, we’re always looking to improve. I’m grateful to my colleagues in the Voting Working Group — Joke van der Leeuw-Roord (MB), Rolf Kallman (MB), Emmanuelle Bermès (MC), Laura Carletti (MC), Jef Malliet (MC) — for their work to make this year’s elections transparent, smooth and successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a final thank you to all the voters who along with choosing their new representatives also approved the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/show-us-what-you-ve-got-the-practical-details\" target=\"_blank\">eight papers</a> that were submitted. We’re very grateful for your valuable time and feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the full and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Elections%20documents/voting-and-elections-results.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">final results</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'AGM recap: Working towards better copyright rules for Cultural Heritage Institutions'

        intro: null
        body: "<p>What is happening with copyright reform? And what do Network Members have to say about what it means to them? To answer some these questions we held a copyright panel session at the AGM. I want to share the contributions made, and give a short recap of the session we held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we do that - I want to take this opportunity to encourage you to share your views on copyright reform with us, and with your networks. This is an important issue that we will be talking to you more about in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you have a question for our panelists you can ask them on Twitter - or ask us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaIPR\">@EuropeanaIPR</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/celebrating.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 254px; float: right;\">Paul Keller hosted the session and opened by encouraging us to celebrate! The Cultural heritage demands have been heard and are reflected in the Commission proposals. Whilst this a lot more work to do, this is a huge achievement and something we should all be proud to have been part of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a closer look at the commission proposals, Paul shared a short but sweet overview of our developing analysis on each of the four main areas of interest for Network Members:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Preservation of cultural works: mainly ok</li>\r\n    <li>Use of Out of Commerce works: not good enough, will not work as is</li>\r\n    <li>E-lending and remote access: missing in action</li>\r\n    <li>Text &amp; Data Mining + Education: not good enough</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/20th%20century.png\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 335px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this, our panel of representatives from across Europe’s cultural heritage institutions took turns to share their the perspectives on the copyright proposals, and how it affects their institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/frederik-truyen\">Fred Truyen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a>;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Communities have a cultural right to access their heritage and engage with it, this goes beyond copyrights who are based solely on the individual. This means cultural rights can open up and put in a broader context the copyright discussions.</li>\r\n    <li>We need a better solution for Orphan works. Most of those works were not created by a professional photographer and were never intended for commercial use. There is no economic stake that has to be protected. What is at stake here are rather issues of privacy and moral rights (people are concerned about respectful treatment of their family heritage). The current regulation is not helpful and doesn't help to unlock masses of very relevant documents currently held in archives.</li>\r\n    <li>New communities in Europe are now part of the European narrative and they want to engage with collections, eg. those on colonial history. Open access could give them the tools necessary to do so and by this way participate more actively in telling the new stories of Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Ask Fred a question or share your viwes with him at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FredTruyen\">@FredTruyen</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/liam-wyatt\">Liam Wyatt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Wikimedia \"Free Knowledge Advocacy Group EU\";</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Include a mandatory Freedom of Panorama exception.</li>\r\n    <li>Include a “no new protection on digitisations” clarification.</li>\r\n    <li>A text and data mining exception that benefits journalists and start-ups.</li>\r\n    <li>Maintain intermediary liability protection for online platforms.</li>\r\n    <li>Seriously consider the risks of a related right for press publishers</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>You can see more infomation, including contact details and full documents at; <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/EU_policy\">https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/EU_policy </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask Liam a question or share your views with him at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wittylama\">@Wittylama</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/emmanuelle-bermes\">Emmanuelle Bermes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright, a sensitive matter\r\n    <ul>\n<li>even if (digital) libraries' mission is to make culture widely accessible, they should also contribute to a sustainable production chain for cultural contents</li>\r\n        <li>you cannot transform the world with culture if producing culture is no longer a source of income for artists, writers and other stakeholders\r\n        <ul>\n<li>=&gt; need for a balanced position</li>\r\n        </ul>\n</li>\r\n    </ul>\n</li>\r\n    <li>Potential issues with Europeana's advocacy on copyright matters\r\n    <ul>\n<li>different situation in different countries or networks</li>\r\n        <li>advocacy can create hurdles in negotiations on other topics (e.g. Legal deposit)</li>\r\n        <li>CHIs may find themselves endorsing through Europeana positions that are conflicting with their government / ministry</li>\r\n        <li>such conflicting situations may lead CHIs to refrain from participating in some of the network's activities</li>\r\n    </ul>\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Ask Emmanuelle a question or share your views with her at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wittylama\">@</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/figoblog\">figoblog</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/erik-buelinckx\">Erik Buelinckx</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kikirpa.be/EN/\">Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage (KIK-IRPA)</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Europeana consists of different groups with different opinions/goals/agenda's/needs regarding copyright</li>\r\n    <li>Cultural heritage institutions are not good in lobbying at EU-level, so we depend on Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>How can we make sure (do we) that cultural heritage institutions feel enough represented by Europeana</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Ask Erik a question or share your views with him at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErikBuelinckx\">@ErikBuelinckx</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/antje-schmidt\">Antje Schmidt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MKG)</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Museums hold vast amounts of Out of Commerce works without a known rightsholder, that are not commercially exploited anymore or never have been intended to be.</li>\r\n    <li>Curators and museum employees should use time to identify creator of works of art/objects not to identify rightsholders of OoC works.</li>\r\n    <li>ECL won't work, because there is no tradition for ECL in Germany for this kind of non-art collections and would keep the process complicated rather than simplify it.</li>\r\n    <li>Only possibility that will lead to any significant results in the museum sector is an exception based approach for OoC works.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Ask Antje a question or share your views with her at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_AntjeSchmidt\">@_AntjeSchmidt</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together the presentations made it clear that copyright is still one of the most important hurdles for our sector to overcome in our efforts to provide universal access to our collections. In this light it is not surprising that Europeana Network has emerged as an important stakeholder and can make important contributions to the EU copyright reform process. In doing so we need to recognise our internal diversity as one of the assets that we can contribute to that discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the conversation at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaIPR\">@europeanaIPR</a></p>"

        intro: "<p>Winter wonderland was waiting for more than 200 members of the Europeana Network Association when we gathered in Riga, Latvia, for the 2016 ‘Show us what you’ve got’ AGM (8-9 November). It was a fabulous opportunity to welcome you all at the National Library of Latvia (LNB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to ask those who attended to share <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RZKFSWY\" target=\"_blank\">their opinion</a>, before 15 December, with us.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/img-4458.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>National Library of Latvia, Riga, Europeana, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What was this two-day meeting like? The Members Council — elected representatives of the Association who oversee the AGM organisation — met on 7 November for their third meeting in 2016. With a line-up of ten amazing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016#speakers\" target=\"_blank\">speakers</a>, 21 Ignite talks, exciting <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016#agenda\" target=\"_blank\">topics</a> at nine Chef’s tables and a visit to the fantastic Latvian National Museum of Art, it’s hard to know where to begin. Let’s just start by extending a huge thank you to everyone who came and turned it into an entertaining and positive two-day event. It was great to see how engaged and involved all of you were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/speakers.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Speakers: Shawn Averkamp, Markus Krötzsch, Effie Kapsalis, Lora Aroyo, Federico Milani, Mia Ridge, Dan Cohen, and Joan Cobb. Europeana, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in the early morning when the Chair of the Europeana Network Association, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/max-kaiser\" target=\"_blank\">Max Kaiser</a>, kicked off the day with a warm welcome and an introduction to the full programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re looking for any of the presentations that were held during these two days, you can find them on <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/search/slideshow?searchfrom=header&amp;q=Europeana+Network+Association+AGM+2016+&amp;ud=any&amp;ft=all&amp;lang=en&amp;sort=\" target=\"_blank\">Slideshare</a>; and there are some striking photographs on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157676468650896\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana's Flickr</a> too. Additionally, I recommend the movie <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/183833345\" target=\"_blank\">“Workers Underground”</a>: A visual impact assessment journey of Europeana 1914-1918 - for both its testimonies and quantitative information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Show us what you’ve got’ was the catchphrase of the event, and via five tracks this was picked up on by presenters and speakers in various ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with the General Assembly — read more about this in our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General%20Assembly%20Meeting%202016/minutes-of-the-general-assembly-meeting-riga-8-november-2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">published minutes</a> — during which Rolf Kallman asked all the Europeana Network Association members to vote for <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/show-us-what-you-ve-got-the-practical-details\" target=\"_blank\">28 new Councillors</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introductory launch of the newly developed online <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> transcription tool was a great success, and the Transcribathon was joined by several AGM attendees. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana19141918\" target=\"_blank\">Prizes were awarded</a> on 9 November to winning teams from France: Elisabeth Freyre, BnF &amp; Marie-Véronique Leroi, French Ministry of Culture, and History Students of the University of Latvia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of day one Jill Cousins handed over the <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EMA</a> award to the new winner, the Polin Museum, after which we all took off for the amazing Latvian National Museum of Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-11/network-members-group-picture.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Network Association ‘AGMers’ in the Latvian National Museum of Art, Europeana, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day revealed what exciting things are happening during Track four, Disruptive Innovation in Aggregation, such as Operation Direct. In the final track, Europeana Tech &amp; R&amp;D, a panel looked back in time and discussed what they would have done if they had the chance to do it all over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your participation, enthusiasm and efforts in promoting the event. #AGM2016, #AllezCulture and #EuropeanaElects hashtag have been used well. In short: 89 accounts produced 211 tweets that reached 128,266 people. You can reread the tweets <a href=\"http://twitter.com/i/moments/798086728515026944\" target=\"_blank\">#AGM2016</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/i/moments/798086728515026944\" target=\"_blank\">#AllezCulture</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/search?q=%23EuropeanaElects&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#EuropeanaElects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We very much look forward to seeing you next year at the Europeana Plenary to be held somewhere in the Netherlands, with most likely the General Assembly taking place alongside. We will keep you updated of course on the date and place of next year’s Plenary and General Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll also hear from our colleague Rolf Kallman on 21 November who will present the results of this year's elections. Thanks to all the fantastic candidates, and, of course, the hundreds of voters too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last, but not least, please fill out our <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RZKFSWY\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a>, before 15 December, to help us improve next year’s event. We appreciate any feedback you can offer.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>FORWARD (www.project-forward.eu) is an EU funded project that has created a system to support the rights status assessment of audiovisual works and the orphan works diligent search. Now, after three years of hard work, it will be presented to the public for the first time. We, the FORWARD project consortium, are pleased to welcome you on this occasion at the Royal Library of Belgium, in Brussels, on <strong>30 November 2016</strong>. So mark your calendars accordingly!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, the Orphan Works Directive was adopted with the aim to unlock hundreds of thousands (!) of objects preserved in Europe’s museums, archives, libraries, and cinematheques and to make them available for research, education and fun on platforms like Europeana. At the conference, professionals from the library and the audiovisual sector, policymakers and the EU Commission's representatives will discuss the challenges and prospects of this Directive. You will have the opportunity to discover new tools that help to bring more cultural heritage online: the orphan works database and the FORWARD system for Audiovisual works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To access the full programme and the registration form, please surf to FORWARD‘s website: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/z7oavr6\">http://tinyurl.com/z7oavr6</a> Registration is free of charge, but <strong>please register before 20 November. </strong>Feel free to get in touch with us for further information via our dedicated website <a href=\"http://project-forward.eu/\">http://project-forward.eu/</a>. This event is jointly organised by FORWARD coordinator CINEMATEK and the Royal Library of Belgium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to seeing you in Brussels on November 30!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>We have exciting news! The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/finding-the-right-fit-to-share-your-cultural-content\">new and updated rights statements</a> are now live and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/rights-statement-guidelines/available-rights-statements\">available to use</a>. Our collection of<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/rights-statement-guidelines/available-rights-statements\"> available rights statements</a> now totals fourteen, each with their own features. This includes the existing suite of 8 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons </a>Licences and tools, including the Public Domain Mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We have changed the names of 4 rights statement</strong>s:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>In Copyright (was 'Rights Reserved - Free Access')</li>\r\n    <li>In Copyright - EU Orphan Work (was 'Orphan Work')</li>\r\n    <li>No Copyright - Non Commercial Use Only (was 'Out of Copyright - non commercial reuse')</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright Not Evaluated (was 'Unknown')​</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We have introduced 2 new rights statements:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restrictions</li>\r\n    <li>In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, 'Rights Reserved - Paid Access' is no longer supported. All objects using these statements are, with the data providers’ agreement, now labelled with ‘In Copyright’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/screen-shot-2016-11-11-at-11.31.03.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 423px; margin: 5px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few months we have been working with data providers to ensure that the transition to the new rights statements is smooth. You can see the changes reflected on each published record, and the search facet has also been updated to reflect the newly updated rights statements. And you can still search collections or our API using the ‘Can I use it’ filter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>Are more works now openly available?</strong><br>\r\nNo. The changes have not had an immediate impact on the balance of the portfolio between open vs closed data. It does however mean that we have more accurate statements for providers to use, ensuring that users receive relevant and accurate information about the rights status and understand any restrictions placed upon the use of an object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/IPR/screen-shot-2016-11-09-at-15.03.46.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 253px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More work to be done</strong><br>\r\nIf you take a look at the portal today, you will notice that there are currently no records that use the new rights statements. We are working with data providers who we know are keen to share their data using our new more accurate and descriptive rights statements. In the coming months we will share with you more examples of how these new statements have been used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: '‘Europeana for Research’ - digitisation, copyright reform and advocacy beyond the pilot stage'
        posttype: null
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Two years ago, Research and Culture Policy makers together with Europeana and Digital Humanities Researchers created a set of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Research%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recommendations: Europeana for Research</a>. As we move away from the pilot stage of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a>, we developed an updated and streamlined set of <a href=\"http://jamdots.nl/view/204/Europeana---Recommendations-for-Research?divFallback=1\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> for action:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Implement more digitisation of cultural heritage;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- enforce copyright reform to make best use of the public investment in digitisation; and</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- advocacy on benefits of Digital Humanities Research for Society.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move away from the pilot stage of Europeana Research, we now are reviewing what has been taken up and what is useful for its future and the growing field of digital humanities research from cultural heritage. We suggest an updated and streamlined set of recommendations for action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://jamdots.nl/view/204/Europeana---Recommendations-for-Research?divFallback=1\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/research.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana for Research visual report: <a href=\"http://jamdots.nl/view/204/Europeana---Recommendations-for-Research?divFallback=1\">JAM Visual Thinking</a> - Copyright: CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barriers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Science the barriers have been overcome with the <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9526-2016-INIT/en/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Council conclusions</a> of May 2016 requiring that <a href=\"http://all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\">all scientific articles are made freely accessible</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Research and innovation provide the solutions to the social and economic challenges of the future. Open access breaks down the walls surrounding science and makes sure that society benefits as much as possible from all scientific insights. In that way, we maximise the impact of universities and knowledge institutions.” - <a href=\"http://english.eu2016.nl/documents/press-releases/2016/05/27/all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\">Sander Dekker</a>, Junior Minister for Education, Culture and Science (the Netherlands)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>If Science can, Culture should</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers of culture and research at EU and national levels hold the key to unlock two major barriers to cultural heritage becoming fully available to researchers and society:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- More public funding for digitisation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Copyright reform (to make best use of the public investment in digitisation)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Funding of digitisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers need to make more funding available for digitisation. If supported by public and public-private funds, free access to this content should be a requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing to encourage private investment remains necessary given what still needs to be digitised: “23% of the heritage collections is digitised,” [and] about 50% still needs to be digitised”. <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu/en/surveys/core_survey_3/\" target=\"_blank\">ENUMERATE Core Survey 3, May 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the digitisation is of our public collections, policy makers should insist on the use of agreed standards for formats and metadata to deliver accessibility over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Copyright reform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers need to reform copyright to allow cultural heritage institutions to digitise our heritage without the huge cost of clearing rights or any fear of litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlocking this gate permits digitisation and therefore research on 20th century material, contributing to the understanding of our most recent cultural history. This is currently seriously hampered by <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">lack of availability</a>. The reform should take into account that researchers need digital collections that cross borders for text and data mining purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally, cultural institutions should not create new rights. They should undertake to label their digital content with correct rights statements and guarantee permanent access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advocacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but by no means least, our third recommendation is that policy makers, together with researchers, give the arguments why accessible, digital cultural heritage is so important to society, its ability to understand itself, and to connect Europe through its culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers and cultural heritage institutions should publish use cases of their reuse of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission is organising dialogue meetings between DG CONNECT, DG Research &amp; Innovation, Members States, Europeana (representing cultural heritage institutions), and Researchers to improve the coordination of policy and programmes for use of digital cultural heritage by Researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, DG CONNECT is asked to set new concrete priorities and targets for digitisation, using interoperability standards for permanent access and preservation of Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana at THE ARTS+ Fair: promoting new business models using digital cultural heritage'

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>For five days, from 19 to 23 October, Frankfurt was the centre stage for business creativity during<a href=\"http://theartsplus.com/\"> THE ARTS+ Fair</a>: the first edition of an annual international event for creative industries — a side event of the <a href=\"http://www.buchmesse.de/en/fbf/\">Frankfurt Book Fair</a>. Europeana partnered with THE ARTS+ to host an interactive and interdisciplinary workshop dedicated to exploring the potential of the cultural and creative market in the digital age (THE ARTS+ Lab). We invited 19 design students from Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Poland to develop original projects reusing Europeana content. We were excited to see five early-stage prototypes emerge as a result of this event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Fair, we took the opportunity to meet with education publishers from across the world to explore potential interest in using the Europeana API and manual download functions to integrate Europeana content into digital educational resources. We were met with enthusiasm by education publishers and innovative digital educational resource providers, who quickly recognised the educational potential of our diverse collections. This includes publishers and educational resources like Itsi, Capstone Publishing, NETEX Learning, and MM Publishing. We’re now in the process of following up after numerous meetings. Some digital educational resources like Itsi are already in the process of integrating our API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-10/img-20161021-141831.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 420px;\"><br><em>Design students in a workshop during THE ARTS+ Fair. Europeana Foundation, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also captured the attention of publishers, interested passers-by and creative industry professionals with the installation of the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/celebrating-bigartride\"> #BigArtRide</a> at THE ARTS+. A result of the #Europeana280 campaign, the #BigArtRide is a practical example of Europeana content reuse. Created by the Dutch design studio<a href=\"http://dropstuff.nl/\"> DROPSTUFF.nl</a>, the #BigArtRide invited fairgoers to explore European art and culture by cycling through a virtual city filled with Europe’s shared cultural heritage. This art installation lets users experience a bike ride by means of a virtual reality (VR) Oculus Rift headset.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Labs workshop: five prototypes in three days</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop “Europeana Labs: The unexploited content of cultural institutions” lasted three days and guided design students through the process of developing product ideas to the process of preparing and presenting a pitch to business investors. On the first day, a co-creation workshop led by the Spanish consulting company <a href=\"http://platoniq.net/en/\">Platoniq </a>invited students to experiment with Europeana data using specially created <a href=\"https://issuu.com/platoniq/docs/platoniq_co-creation_eng\">Co-creation Made Agile methodology</a>. They finished the day with a cut-throat elimination of the weakest prototype ideas, focussing instead on the development of the most robust five business proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second and third day were led by <a href=\"http://www.media-deals.org/\">Media Deals</a>, a pan-European investor network. First, students took their five business proposals into a business modeling workshop and were introduced to the Lean Canvas methodology. This helped them turn their idea into viable business models. On the third day, a pitching skills training with presentations and instant feedback coached participants on how to best present their projects to financiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-10/1477566627_dsc08092.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 372px;\"><br><em>Participants receive feedback during THE ARTS+ Fair. Europeana Foundation, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This learning process concluded with students pitching their ideas at an investor forum that was open to the public. Design students presented their projects to a jury of selected investors and business experts and to many interested passers-by at THE ARTS+. The investor panel evaluated the ideas and provided them with constructive feedback to help them develop their ideas into a market-ready proposition. The jury members were: Eugene Smyth (<a href=\"http://www.aibseedcapitalfund.ie/\">Allied Irish Banks Seed Capital Fund</a>); Cathrin Frisemo (<a href=\"http://nfban.org/\">Nordic Female Business Angel Network</a>); Xavier Huerre (Interim Executive, Business Consultant, Angel Investor); Dieter Staib (Education, BBA, MBA at <a href=\"http://www.esade.edu/web/eng\">ESADE</a> Barcelona).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the five pitches, Fantasia, an app developed by a student group from Italy and Poland, was selected as the winning project. In a concise and engaging pitch, the students proposed a prototype that aims to create patterns for fashion designers from high-quality content made available through Europeana. As a reward for their great project, Fantasia will attend next year’s edition of the Europeana Fashion Conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s next? After five busy days, we will be following up with the contacts we made and looking into how we can increase the educational and creative re-use of our content through partnerships with creative industries and educational partners across Europe and beyond. Stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more, check out our <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/gp/europeanaimages2/j9151f\">Flickr album </a>and our <a href=\"https://storify.com/Europeana/europeana-the-arts\">Storify</a> on THE ARTS+.</p>"

        title: 'Effective digital storytelling: reflecting on our Faces of Europe exhibition'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<h3>On 21 September, Europeana published the seventh and final chapter of <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a></em>, the flagship exhibition of its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/get-set-europeana280-join-us-as-we-celebrate-europe-s-art-history-the-digital-way\">Europeana 280</a> campaign. In the second of two posts Douglas McCarthy, Collections Manager of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art</a> and editor of <em>Faces of Europe</em>, highlights the opportunities for effective storytelling brought by our new exhibitions platform.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, the culture ministries of all 28 EU member states, and Norway, nominated a total of<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;locale=en&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\"> 347 remarkable works</a> for our Europeana 280 campaign. We set ourselves the challenge of creating an online exhibition to showcase the diversity and high quality of the chosen artworks. The result is <em>Faces of Europe</em>. Featuring more than 80 artworks from 29 countries and over 15,000 words long, it is the most extensive exhibition Europeana has yet presented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/portraits-of-power.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 351px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do justice to the content, we published <em>Faces of Europe</em> on our new exhibitions platform. It features full-width images and supports a variety of embedded content including video, music and Pinterest boards. We believe that our new platform offers excellent opportunities for effective digital storytelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s look briefly at three examples from the exhibition. In chapter four, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/the-inspiration-of-nature/arcadian-and-romantic-landscapes\"><em>The Inspiration of Nature</em></a>, we deployed an interactive slider tool that lets the user contrast two images by moving their mouse across the picture. This provides an excellent way to compare Constable’s small <a href=\"http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1670705\">oil sketch</a> for <em>The Hay Wain</em> in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art, with the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063624/UK_280_009.html\">finished painting</a> in the National Gallery in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/the-inspiration-of-nature/arcadian-and-romantic-landscapes#ve-anchor-section_2642-js\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/slider.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 415px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Click on the image above to use the slider tool in the exhibition </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the composition of both pictures is very similar, the handling of paint and the colour palettes in each are notably different. In the Yale sketch, Constable’s brushstrokes are fluid and almost Impressionistic, whereas in the final full-size exhibition picture, they are much more precise. The digital slider tool is a simple and effective tool for analysing the artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter six, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/painting-modern-lives/painting-the-everyday\"><em>Painting Modern Lives</em></a>, includes Manet’s <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063621/FRA_280_004.html\">Berthe Morisot au bouquet de violettes</a></em>, from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. To provide some background context on the society in which Morisot and Manet lived, we embedded an informative Prezi animation (created by Dana Barocas and Taylor Bacon) concerning Charles Baudelaire’s influential 1863 essay <em>The Painter of Modern Life</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"iframe_container\" src=\"https://prezi.com/embed/jbaldhbd_vet/?bgcolor=ffffff&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;autohide_ctrls=0&amp;landing_data=bHVZZmNaNDBIWnNjdEVENDRhZDFNZGNIUE1UMnphQUtPSktSUjFoYjgyUG5aVnBBNWx6UFExVG9FbjkwOTVNQVNNVT0&amp;landing_sign=D69sOs4CJIyLRxw66TMEJojtGBk_rIBwc5G8Zl3-RPY\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same section, we presented Manet’s evocative <em><a href=\"http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16473/the-cafc-concert/\">Café-Concert</a></em> from the <a href=\"https://www.thewalters.org/\">Walters Art Museum</a> in Baltimore. The painting is set in the Cabaret de Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart and it vividly conveys contemporary Parisian society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/manet.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 243px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\"http://thewalters.org/rights-reproductions.aspx\">enlightened policy</a> of the Walters on the use of its digital images, we were pleased to be able to present these geographically distant paintings in the same space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audience feedback on <em>Faces of Europe</em> and our new exhibition platform has been very positive. Every exhibition chapter has achieved high levels of audience satisfaction and the majority of users say that they’d recommend <em>Faces of Europe</em> to their friends. We received lots of positive comments and we compiled some of these in this short film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/172597671\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana offers its partners the opportunity to publish their own online exhibitions on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a>. Later this month, we’ll publish <em>The Colossus of Leonardo da Vinci</em>, a partner exhibition developed by <a href=\"http://www.museogalileo.it/en/index.html\">Museo Galileo</a>; and we look forward to many such projects in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you again to all our Europeana 280 partners. We simply could not have done it without you!</p>"

        title: 'Pictures at an exhibition: how we made Faces of Europe'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<h3>On 21 September, Europeana published the seventh and final chapter of <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a></em>, the flagship exhibition of its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/get-set-europeana280-join-us-as-we-celebrate-europe-s-art-history-the-digital-way\">Europeana 280</a> campaign. In the first of two posts <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy-1\">Douglas McCarthy</a>, Collections Manager of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art</a> and editor of <em>Faces of Europe</em>, reflects on the exhibition’s genesis and development.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In April of this year, we kickstarted Europeana 280, our cross-border campaign to get Europe excited about its shared art heritage. We asked the culture ministries of all 28 EU member states, and Norway, to select ten artworks which had made an important contribution to art history. They responded magnificently, nominating a total of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;locale=en&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\">347 remarkable works</a>. (To find out how and why particular images were selected, and the stories behind some of the choices, read our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/tags/europeana280\">extensive series of blogs</a> by Ann Maher, Europeana 280 Exhibitions Coordinator.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/2063626-it-280-002.jpeg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 296px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063626/IT_280_002.html\">St Mark preaching in the square of Alexandria, Egypt, 1504-07</a>, Gentile Bellini, Pinacoteca di Brera, CC BY-NC-ND</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We set ourselves the challenge of creating an exhibition that would showcase the diversity and high quality of the art submitted for Europeana 280. We wanted to tell engaging stories about the lives and times of the featured artists, and to inspire our audience to delve deeper into <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art</a>. The result, <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a></em>, is the most ambitious exhibition that Europeana has presented. It features more than 80 artworks from 29 countries and is over 15,000 words long. So how did it evolve from a pool of artworks to the final exhibition?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first step was getting to know the artworks nominated for Europeana 280. They cover a vast time span, from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063609/ES_280_001.html?q=Techo+de+los+policromos+de+Altamira\">cave paintings at Altamira</a> created during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Paleolithic\">Upper Palaeolithic</a> to a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063624/UK_280_020.html?q=\">contemporary portrait</a> painted in 2012. In terms of subject and style, they vary enormously too: medieval altarpieces, Cubist portraits, social realist landscapes, illuminated manuscripts, Pop art, and much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/2063607-est-280-011.jpeg\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 650px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063607/EST_280_011.html\">Young Gardeners, 1968</a>, Malle Leis, Tartu Art Museum, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0\">CC BY-NC-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to masterpieces by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063627/BEL_280_013.html\">van Eyck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063609/ES_280_008.html\">Velázquez</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063621/FRA_280_004.html\">Manet</a>, many countries nominated fascinating pieces by lesser known artists. We sensed an exciting opportunity to present famous and less celebrated art in the same exhibition space. The pan-continental scope of Europeana 280 also encouraged us to highlight the connections between artists in different countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Faces of Europe</em>’s narrative begins in the medieval era and concludes in the present day. It’s presented in seven chapters (shown below) and arranged around a series of themes. The exhibition touches upon important elements of Europe’s art history such as patronage, education and travel. It also covers broader aspects of history, like industrialisation and the changing role of women in art and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/fefefefe.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 292px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\">Faces of Europe chapters</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Europeana, developing <em>Faces of Europe</em> with our many partners was a rewarding team effort. We discovered some amazing art in the process too. Some of my personal highlights include the work of Swedish painter <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/painting-modern-lives/changing-roles-for-women#ve-element-anchor-image_3826\">Hanna Pauli</a>, the cosmic abstraction of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/towards-abstraction/departures-from-realism#ve-anchor-section_4455-js\">Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis</a>, and the fascinating life and art of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/revolution-and-war/resistance-and-conformity#ve-anchor-intro_2336-js\">Kārlis Padegs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/2063602-swe-280-009.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 554px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063602/SWE_280_009.html\">The Artist Venny Soldan-Brofeldt, 1886-1887</a>, Hanna Pauli, Gothenburg Museum of Art, CC BY-NC</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hoped you’ve enjoyed the journey. Thank you again to all our Europeana 280 partners. We simply could not have done it without you!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana and the International Image Interoperability Framework — an update'
        posttype: null
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-aligns-with-the-international-image-interoperability-framework-iiif\">blog posted earlier this year</a> we introduced the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and its potential benefits for Europeana, its community as well as its users. IIIF in particular offers a standard set of options to serve digitised pictures and allows users to rotate, zoom, select particular areas, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since our first post, we have progressed on the plans that we outlined back then. First of all, we officially joined the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/community/consortium/\">IIIF consortium</a> as a founding member, which enshrines our commitment to the success of the technology and our will to contribute to its ongoing development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, and more directly relevant for our stakeholders, we have begun incorporating IIIF in our service infrastructure. Providers can now incorporate IIIF resources in the metadata they send to Europeana using the Europeana Data Model (see <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Share_your_data/Technical_requirements/EDM_profiles/IIIFtoEDM_profile_042016.pdf\">Guidelines for submitting IIIF resources for objects in EDM</a>). Europeana Collections will present them using a dedicated IIIF viewer, as with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/07931/diglit_wordsworth1841.html\">the digitised book from which the example below is taken</a>. Naturally, the IIIF resources can also be found in the metadata exported through the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana API</a>, making them available to a wider range of data re-users.</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"height: 300px;\">\r\n    <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td><img alt=\"original picture\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/grecepittoresque30a-original400.jpg\"/></td>\r\n            <td><img alt=\"rotated selection\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/grecepittoresque30a-selection.jpg\"/></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </tbody>\r\n    <caption><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/07931/diglit_wordsworth1841.html\">La Grèce pittoresque et historique</a>, University Library of Heidelberg, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de\">CC BY-SA</a>, Page 30a (page 377 in the Europeana viewer). On the left, the picture served in the default setting. On the right, a specific area of the picture has been selected and rotated.</i></caption>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a key step towards providing users of Europeana Collections and the Europeana API with access to rich media resources from European cultural collections. We currently provide access to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A*iiif*&amp;view=grid\">24,800 IIIF-compatible objects</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/Englisch/\">University Library Heidelberg</a> and <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/\">e-codices</a>, the Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland, hosted by the University of Fribourg. We hope this will encourage more data partners to start serving their images through IIIF, and will help further the effort and facilitate the adoption of IIIF by cultural organisations and the sharing of their IIIF resources through our services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's why Europeana is hosting this Fall's <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-iiif-working-group-meeting\">IIIF technical working group</a> that discusses the development of the IIIF technology, and helping with a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/iiif-outreach-event\">public IIIF outreach event</a> at the Rijksmuseum today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you be interested in IIIF in general, please contact us, or directly join the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/community/#how-to-get-involved\">IIIF community</a>!</p>"

        intro: "<p>I’m thrilled to announce the launch of the Europeana Network Association’s 2016 elections campaign. Forty-eight candidates stepped forward, and 1,526 Network Association members are invited to vote from November 8 to November 14 at 23:59CET.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/190546130\" title=\"Europeana Elections 2016\" width=\"492\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As you may remember, in September <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/come-forward-and-become-a-members-council-2016-candidate\" target=\"_blank\">I invited all registered Network Association members</a> to come forward as candidates for our Members Council. Today, I have the pleasure of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/members-council-candidates-2016\" target=\"_blank\">introducing the 48 candidates</a> who will be running in this year’s elections, each hoping to win one of 28 available seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Europe and beyond, the group represents a diverse mix of nationalities — and this diversity is reflected in their priorities too. Open Data, audiovisual archives, academic research, multiculturalism: there are plenty of areas these prospective Councillors are ready to get to work on. It’s a testament to the broad range of expertise in our Network Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/native.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height:

        title: 'Europeana Sounds at the Vienna Waves Music Hackday: the results'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 1 October, Europeana Sounds co-organised a full hackday as part of the Vienna Waves Music Festival. During this day we challenged programmers, developers, designers, musicians, and anybody else with an interest in music and technology to come and work on their own idea or on one of the proposed challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday evening, the organisers and participants came together in the Werkstätten- und Kulturhaus (WUK) to listen to presentations on different tools and challenges that they could work on. A mix of hardware, software and data was made available for the participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joris Pekel brought the Europeana Music Collections dataset to the event and proposed the <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/europeana-sounds-challenge-at-the-waves-vienna-music-hackday-take-part-and-help-identifying-genres-in-musical-heritage\">Europeana Sounds Genre Detection Challenge.</a> In short, for a user of Europeana Music, it is useful to be able to search for particular music genres (e.g., free jazz, Irish folk, Baroque) to find what they are looking for in this vast amount of material, currently over 200.000 items. However, this information is not always available in the data. Currently, only about a fifth of the Europeana Music Collection has been labelled with a unified genre description. The participants were challenged to come up with solutions to detect genres in the data and music files.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The results</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the hackathon, the Europeana Music dataset has been analysed in great detail. A lot of different aspects such as tempo, timbre and loudness have been processed so that the individual characteristics can be analysed. All these results have been made available on <a href=\"http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~schindler/eusounds_challenge/\">a special page</a> set up for the hackday and are available for download for anyone who wants to work with it. However, the day was too short for the hackday participants to come up with a working solution to automatically detect genres. But, we laid great groundwork for further research and work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Music Collection was of great interest, as it is openly available and ready for use by software developers, and many useful connections have been made. Especially the work done by the company <a href=\"https://www.musimap.net/\">MusiMap</a>, also present at the hackathon, shows great potential for further collaboration. MusiMap builds software to analyse music and index its characteristics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end 16 hacks were submitted to the judges for review, varying from artificial intelligence bots that can help you find the right music that complements your mood, to devices that can be attached to the body during a live performance to influence the music depending on your position. All results can be seen in the video report created by Maarten Brinkerink of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid).</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/NgF6EbAJ8Lg?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=rtTkC\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>This hackday shows that the dataset shows great potential, but in a hackday of 8 hours only the first steps can be taken. We are therefore continuing our quest to look for better ways to automatically detect genres in music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in working with us, please <a href=\"mailto:joris.pekel@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>A week after he presented the Commission's proposals for a modernisation of the EU copyright rules, Commission Vice President Ansip has followed up with <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/ansip/blog/culture-matters-going-digital-way-spread-europes-cultural-heritage_en\">a blogpost</a> in which he explains why the Commission is proposing new rules for the digitization of cultural heritage collections and for the making available of out-of-commerce works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/copyright-reform-a-first-look-at-the-commission-s-plans-for-cultural-heritage-institutions\">As we have already pointed out</a>, the proposed new rules for making available out-of-commerce works fall short of what is required to get large parts of these works online. VP Ansip's blogpost makes it clear that while the Commission has a good understanding of the challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions, it does not appear to understand the mechanics of the actual problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/ansip/blog/culture-matters-going-digital-way-spread-europes-cultural-heritage_en\"> last week’s blogpost</a> Ansip, celebrates the benefits of digital technologies in the provision of cross border access and expressly mentions Europeana as having done good work here and he correctly points out that the large body of out-of-commerce works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions present a special problem that needs to be addressed by copyright law:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><br>\r\nDigitisation becomes particularly relevant when collections are out-of-commerce, by which I mean works that are still protected by copyright but no longer commercially available to people. It is usually because the authors and publishers have decided not to publish new editions or to sell copies via standard commercial channels. These works are not generally available in any other way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they can still hold great cultural, scientific, educational, historical and entertainment value. They might also be newsreels, photos, unpublished materials, or works never intended for commercial circulation, like political leaflets. From a heritage perspective, they are still important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[...] Making matters worse are the high transaction costs that cultural heritage institutions incur to clear the relevant licensing rights so that they can proceed with digitisation and disseminating works online.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As a solution to this problem Ansip points to the 'copyright licensing system' that is part of the proposed <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-593-EN-F1-1.PDF\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</a> that the Commission presented on the 14th of September. He continues:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In general, I would like out-of-commerce works to play the full and prominent role that they deserve in our cultural heritage. And for that to be the case, they must be available and accessible online. This is why I favour a copyright licensing system that covers entire collections and gives rights holders full legal certainty across the board.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately this is where we think that Ansip (and by extension the Commission's proposal) gets it wrong. A copyright licensing system such as the one proposed by the Commission cannot produce the results that Ansip expects it to deliver. Such a copyright system will <em>not</em> cover entire collections and will <em>not</em> give rights holders full legal certainty across the board and is <em>not</em> the way for out-of-commerce works to 'play the full and prominent role that they deserve in our cultural heritage'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main reason for this is that there are many cases where <em>there is simply no-one who can grant a license for out-of-commerce works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions</em>. The Commission's proposal attempts to address this by requiring the EU member states to create a legal basis for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_collective_licensing\">extended collective licenses</a> that would allow cultural heritage institutions to make available out-of-commerce works that they have in their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/twee-manen%20cropped.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 776px;\">Image:</em> <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1903_A_23149.html\">Twee mannen in conversatie and Le Comte de Gabalis</a>, Rijksmuseum, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his blogpost Ansip points to the fact that when we are talking about out-of-commerce works we are talking about newsreels as well as \"unpublished materials, or works never intended for commercial circulation, like political leaflets\". In the majority of the EU member states there simply are no collective management organisations that grant licenses for these types of works, and as a result the Commission's proposal (which works by extending existing licenses to also cover \"rightholders of the same category as those covered by the licence who are not represented by the collective management organisation\") will not have any effect for such works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The category of out-of-commerce works is much broader than works that were commercially available at some point in the past. Out-of-commerce works include works that have <em>never been</em> or were <em>never intended</em> to be in commerce. For these types of works there are generally no collective management organisations that can be relied upon to grant licenses that can then be extended. And without collective management organisations that license these types of works, the Commission's proposal will not work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Ignoring the voice of the cultural heritage sector</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission's belief in licensing as a solution for the out-of-commerce problem is illustrative of a problematic pattern. Three years after <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/failure-of-licenses-for-europe-underlines-the-need-for-reform-of/\">the largely failed 'Licenses for Europe' stakeholder dialogue</a>, the Commission approach to tackling problems posed by copyright still follows a binary pattern: Problems can either be solved by licensing or by exceptions. In the case of out-of-commerce works the Commission has clearly decided the solution should be licensing, and has refused to even acknowledge the above mentioned problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These problems are not new to the Commission, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\">we along with leading Libraries, Archives and Museums from across Europe</a> have repeatedly presented them over the last two years. In response, the Commission disregarded our proposal that a solution for the problem should be based on an exception, where licensing solutions fall short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its Impact Assessment the Commission does not even acknowledge the possibility of solutions other than licensing for the issue of out-of-commerce works held by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only reference to the solution advocated for by the sector that is confronted by the problem, is buried in a single footnote of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/impact-assessment-modernisation-eu-copyright-rules\">the Impact Assessment</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><br>\r\nCHIs in the 2013-2014 public consultation stressed the importance of solutions covering all types of works and many of them indicated their preference for an exception, as generally did individual end users/consumers and consumer organisations. CHI respondents also referred to collective management solutions, notably ECL, as an alternative. (European Commission, Impact Assessment, page 71, footnote 212)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In an approach that seems very disingenuous, the Commission ignores these two policy options, and instead compares the same licensing based mechanism with itself and comes to the conclusion that the \"option\" that applies to more categories of works is better because it applies to more categories of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Out-of-commerce works: Option 1 required Member States to put in place legal mechanisms, with cross-border effect, to facilitate licensing agreements for out-of-commerce books and learned journals and to organise a stakeholder dialogue at national level to facilitate the implementation of that mechanism. Option 2 went further since it applied to all types of out- of-commerce works. This extension was deemed necessary to address the licensing of out-of-commerce works in all sectors. Option 2 was therefore chosen. (European Commission, Proposal for the DSM directive, page 7)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard to understand why the Commission has not analysed a policy option that <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/153088/presentations/160614exception_logic_model.pdf\">has been presented to them in detail</a>. Comparing the licensing and exceptions would not only have revealed that an exception would apply to more types of works, but also that it would produce tangible results for cultural heritage institutions much quicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4 id=\"licenses\">Licensing is only part of the solution</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also drawbacks to an exception that would give cultural heritage institutions the right to make available out-of-commerce works in their collections. In sectors with well established collective management, an exception would have a strong impact on the rights of authors and other rights holders, and it could undermine the functioning of existing extended collective licensing arrangements already in place in a number of (predominantly northern) EU member states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems that in making its choice for a solution the Commission has decided to prioritize these concerns over the concerns of the cultural heritage sector and its own initial ambition to present a proposal that works for all types of collections. In doing so it has overlooked what maybe an <em>obvious solution of combining the two approaches</em> to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to such a solution may be contained in another exception proposed by the Commission. The exception for \"Use of works and other subject-matter in digital and cross-border teaching activities\" contains a provision that allows member states to \"not apply [the exception] generally or as regards specific types of works or other subject-matter, to the extent that adequate licences [...] are easily available in the market\". This mechanism could also be employed to combine the copyright licensing system proposed by the Commission with an exception solution as proposed by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would allow member states to work with licensing based solution in sectors where such solutions exist, and to rely on an exception in sectors where such solutions do not exist and are not feasible. The exception would need to contain the same safeguards as the Commission's licensing based proposal, such as the ability for rights holders to opt out, and for the registration of out-of-commerce works in an EU wide database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without the addition of such an exception the Commission's proposal will fail to meet the objectives it’s aiming to support. It would at best constitute <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/orphan-works-compromise-fails-to-deliver/\">another partial solution</a> for the copyright issues faced by cultural heritage institutions, who would continue to struggle with copyright in their attempts to make available the rich cultural heritage of Europe that VP Ansip wants to see preserved online. And as observed by Ansip in his post from last week...</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>That is something we cannot allow to happen.</p>\r\n</blockquote>"

        title: 'Europeana Generic Services: Opportunity to fund a Thematic Collection'
        posttype: null
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">Linked to Europeana’s funding under CEF, the European Commission published on Tuesday 20th, September 2016 a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2016-cef-telecom-call-europeana-cef-tc-2016-3\">public call for Generic Services </a>to create thematic collections using Europeana’s Core Service Platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would very much like the Europeana Network to take advantage of this funding and would love to support good ideas for new thematic collections on Europeana that help users get to the rich material held in our cultural heritage institutions. The big bonus of this call is that it will support digitisation of specific collections that are needed for the thematic collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two million euros (funding is at 50% of total costs) have been set aside for ‘projects that select outstanding artefacts and works of art that show the development of cultural movements of European significance’. Good current examples are <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/music\">Europeana Music</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art</a>, but expanding these to attract new users, using the expertise that exists in the Europeana Network would be a wonderful way to showcase Europe’s rich cultural heritage. This can mean anything; for example, in areas of content strength such as literature, poetry, religion, folklore, maps and cartography or science and technology or themes where there is considerable pan-European interest such as migration or World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using Europeana’s tools and standards to develop thematic collections, the projects should take visitors on a curated journey through the heritage about these movements. The intention is that the new thematic collection will be a means for showing objects already on Europeana in a new way, combined with newly digitised material (in high-quality, of course) from the collections of Europe’s cultural heritage institutions, either already connected to Europeana or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Generic Services-call is a good opportunity for a consortium of cultural heritage institutions to develop a thematic collection on a shared, common, topic. The call requires at least three partners from at least three different European member states and compliance to our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/europeana-policy-on-thematic-collections.pdf\">policy </a>for developing and operating new thematic collections and a product<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/europeana-thematic-collections-specification.pdf\"> specification</a> for thematic collections are available on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please contact us with your brilliant ideas so we can help turn them into new thematic collections. Deadline for submission (to the European Commission) is 15 December 2016.</p>"

So, we developed a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/workersundergroundcasestudydirect\">case stud</a><a href=\"http://bit.ly/workersundergroundcasestudydirect\">y</a> that explores the journey we took from how we carried out the research to how we refined our current approach to assessing impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/183833345\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>This film and case study mark the first time we have applied our own impact assessment methodology, and we have learnt a lot from this. You can read all about what we learnt in the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/workersundergroundcasestudydirect\">case study</a>. But what will we do next? With your help, we will be developing our method into a comprehensive framework that can be used to undertake an impact assessment, as well as tools that can be used to help collect, analyse and interpret the data. We will apply this framework to two additional areas of activity, and seek to grow a community of network partners who share an interest in undertaking impact assessment in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/eu-lenses-impact-overview-v2.png\" style=\"width: 270px; height: 202px; float: left;\"><p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to watch the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/workersundergroundfilm\">film</a>, read the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/workersundergroundcasestudydirect\">case study</a> and join us on our journey of discovery of the social &amp; cultural impact of Europeana 1914-1918. We would love for you to share your thoughts and experiences with us and join our journey of discovery via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23europeanaimpact&amp;src=typd\">#europeanaimpact</a> or email us at <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu?subject=Feedback%20on%20Impact%3A%20a%20fresh%20perspective%20blog\">impact@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, please turn up the volume on your device, sit back and enjoy our film.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"

        body: "<p><em>On Europeana Labs, we are constantly seeking to inspire and encourage you to reuse Europe’s shared cultural heritage in new products, businesses and designs. Until the end of 2017, we will organise <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/makewitheuropeana-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">three campaigns</a> in which we’ll hand-pick cultural objects from our vast online repository and feature them in a dedicated blog series and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. The first campaign addresses the popular style of Art Nouveau and will run until end of May. The selected items are all suitable for commercial creative reuse and, we believe, can motivate makers everywhere to develop unique concepts. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sophisticated organic lines, floral ornaments and geometric forms. You could easily find yourself dazzled by the charm and extravagancy of the <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> movement. According to this genre’s philosophy, beauty should surround us in the most unexpected places, and artistic designs could be applied to everyday objects - for instance, furniture, decorative arts and utensils. By unifying fine and applied arts, this style serves as a great inspiration for makers who wish to re-imagine this joyful era in their artistic creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion is greatly influenced by political, economical and social factors. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style/origins-of-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Art Nouveau</a> movement took place from the 1880s until World War One, a period (at least initially) marked by peace and prosperity. Wealth and the availablity of resources played a critical role on the development of trendy garments and the way people chose to adorn their bodies. You can find an insight to Art Nouveau’s influence on fashion by checking reusable objects in our dedicated <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-fashion/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social and technological change in Europe led by industrialisation, mass production and urbanisation had an impact on women’s fashion leading to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style/women-in-art-nouveau#ve-anchor-section_8672-js\" target=\"_blank\">dress reform movement</a>. Female clothing became less restrictive, lighter and easier to wear - a direct outcome of women’s growing independence and changes in gender roles. For example, the garment displayed below represents fashion transitions and what was in vogue. Satin, a common fabric used in fashion of this time, is soft and gracious and the s-shape silhouette gives it a modern shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/image-6-.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 626px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026107/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_www_esbirky_cz_86419.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Toaleta večerní</a>, 1913. Uměleckoprůmyslové Museum V Praze. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attention to details was precious and crucial to trendy ladies of the time. Shoes adopted Art Nouveau motifs by embellishing heels. Even umbrellas and parasols deserved some extra detailing. Below, a parasol with woven motif of flowers and butterflies illustrates this dedication to details. A silver and turquoise crook adorns the end of this parasol’s wooden stick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/90402-bk-1980-6.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 578px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/BK_1980_6.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Parasol with woven motif of flowers and butterflies</a>, 1895 - 1905. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another trend of Art Nouveau fashion was clothing inspired by antiquity or Japonism as shown below in this exotic kimono made of embroidered silk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/kimono-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 594px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026108/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Digitalt_Museum_113769.html?q=Textile\" target=\"_blank\">Kimono</a>, 1800-1899. Digitalt Museum. Public Domain Marked. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Motifs inspired by nature were typical of this modern age. Shapes that resembled flowers, buds and insect wings were often used in fashion accessories. Dark colouring and geometric forms accompanied these nature themes. Take the handbag below as an example of nature-inspired work and use of dark colours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/image-7-.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 410px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026107/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_www_esbirky_cz_UPM12760.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Kabelka</a>, 1912. Uměleckoprůmyslové Museum V Praze. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To complete a true Art Nouveau look, adornments were essential. Excellent workmanship combined with innovative materials and new techniques set the tone for jewellery making. <strong>René Lalique</strong> (1860-1945) was a French glass designer whose work was quite popular at the time. He was considered an innovator for combining glass and enamel with gold, opals, diamonds, pearls or amethysts. The stunning brooch below is a creation by Lalique. It combines gold, lithographic stone and pearl with enamel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/90402-bk-1969-25.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 481px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/BK_1969_25.html?q=Ren%C3%A9+Lalique#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Broche in de vorm van een narrenkop</a>, 1897 - 1899. René Lalique. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another famous artist of the time, <strong><a href=\"http://www.jugendstilsenteret.no/art-nouveau/the-archives/gaudernack-c9940l417\" target=\"_blank\">Gustav Gaudernack</a>,</strong> was a Norwegian goldsmith. He was famous for his ‘plique á jour’ work - a vitreous enamelling technique. Check out a collection of Gaudernack’s sketches on this <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/gustav-gaudernack/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/jewell.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 357px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026108/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Digitalt_Museum_110350.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drawing</a> by Gustav Gaudernack, 1911-1914.

        body: "<p><em>A guest blog by Andrea Cioni, developer apprentice at <a href=\"http://www.oimmei.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Oimmei</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A project by <a href=\"https://www.oimmei.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Oimmei</a>, an Italian agency for web and mobile development, the <a href=\"http://www.muzeu.ms/\" target=\"_blank\">Muzeums</a> app creates interactive, fun and educational user experiences for museums and art galleries. The <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/muzeums\" target=\"_blank\">app</a>, available in iOS and Android, allows users to look for museums online, go through their catalogues and participate in experiences, such as trivia and scavenger hunts, related to the artworks in exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Muzeums has recently added a new component to its functionality: an import tool that integrates Europeana content. This new tool was created during my internship at Oimmei, as part of my computer sciences studies at the University of Pisa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana importer is primarily a tool for museum managers. It allows them to add information about the artworks on exhibition, sourcing existing data from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> rather than creating everything from scratch. It enables them to search items on Europeana by applying a number of filters and to review and enrich an item’s data information. Once satisfied the user can import the new item into the Muzeums database and use it on the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While developing the importer, we created two user interfaces on the web portal using the JavaScript library Polymer: the first one can be used to search for items, the second one for viewing, modifying and saving the information about a single item. Most of our work involved implementing the Europeana APIs on the server side in order to search the Europeana database, parse the results and display them to the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importer is out of beta stage, and it will be published with the next version of the Muzeums web portal by end of April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, contact <strong>info@oimmei.com</strong></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Low-cost, high flexibility and transportable exhibitions are an up-and-coming tool for heritage institutions who wish to present their collections outside to new audiences. But they often come at a steep price or lack the control and engagement that works within the walls of an institution. As an outcome of <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Space</a>, the three year EU-funded project aiming at catalyse the re-use of digital cultural heritage materials and pursue new business models, partners <a href=\"http://www.noterik.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Noterik</a>,<a href=\"https://www.iminds.be/en#\"> iMinds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fondazionesistematoscana.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Fondazione Sistema Toscana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/\" target=\"_blank\">KU Leuven</a> and more banded together to merge their learnings and developments. The result is <a href=\"https://www.mupop.net/\" target=\"_blank\">MuPoP</a>, a new breed of pop-up museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MuPoP aims to create the technical and material space to foster re-use of cultural heritage in a new and innovative way. A hybrid of both a digital and physical museum exhibition, MuPoP is a way to showcase many of the prototypical ideas that have resulted from the pilot projects developed during Europeana Space, including interactive TV, photography, games, dance and hybrid publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/200814036\" title=\"Demonstration of the Pop-Up Museum\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<h2>Learning from current trends</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The key values of MuPoP are mobilisation, customization and ease of use. Cost for space rental, billboards or customised tech can be a severe barrier of access for institutions aiming to present their collection outside their walls.Years ago, the situation was very similar when presenting high quality curated content on the web. But with the introduction of free and open source services such as <a href=\"https://omeka.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Omeka</a>, <a href=\"https://timeline.knightlab.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Timeline.js</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cultural Institute</a>, organisations now have numerous low-cost options that previously were only available to the major players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally, the more recent <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\" target=\"_blank\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> is creating standards and tools simplifying web presentation and transfer of images plus enrichments; while <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.archive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Archive</a> offer a free place where institutes can share their open collections with tens of millions of users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, Content Management Systems like <a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SquareSpace</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a> have made it easier than ever to create a website to share ideas and build a community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep it simple</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Embracing these trends while innovating new ways to use public and open spaces, MuPoP has succeeded in offering an ideal service for any institution, of any technical competence, and any size. The strength comes from using the incredibly powerful tool most users have in their pocket a smartphone, an inexpensive HDMI stick computer, and several TV screens with HDMI capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, one of the main issues about museum apps is about convincing users to download it. QR codes can be burdensome, and renting a device from the museum is perhaps out of the price range for some visitors. To avoid these questions and get the users engaged right away, MuPoP uses HTML5 and a web browser turning the user’s smartphone into a remote control by typing in a simple URL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MuPoP has already been used four times for <a href=\"https://www.mupop.net/\" target=\"_blank\">four curations</a> (Belle Époque: “Man meets world” Europeana Fashion, Dutch State Mines, and Hieronymus Bosch) in five different locations across Europe, with more to come. For those looking for the complete package deal, the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision has commissioned a fantastic housing unit specifically for MuPoP that can be easily transported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you an insitute interesting in using MuPoP and taking your collection to the people? Contact the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and Noterik at <a href=\"http://www.mupop.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.mupop.net</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you like to get hands on with MuPoP? Sound and Vision will be <a href=\"http://mw17.mwconf.org/proposal/mupop-the-museum-pop-up-exhibition-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">demoing the installation</a> at the <a href=\"http://mw17.mwconf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum and the Web Conference </a>on 19-22 April, in Cleveland, Ohioso be sure to swing by if you're in attendance!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The <strong>maker movement</strong> is diverse, dynamic, and digitally connected. It is an innovative and independent community that brings together both amateur and professional arts, crafts and technological practitioners. Despite its diversity, there is a continued need for inspiration and resources to help the movement to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/508821/the-difference-between-makers-and-manufacturers/\" target=\"_blank\">disrupt</a> traditional manufacturing processes and to deliver the anticipated <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/reynolds/speaker_series/pdf/Maker%20Market%20Study%20FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">third industrial revolution</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s where Europeana can help. Europeana’s <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">digital heritage content</a>, drawn from the collections of over 3.500 cultural heritage institutions across Europe, has the potential to inspire and be used in new designs, products and businesses in the maker movement. This could range from something as simple as an image from a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/T_184_1920.html?q=fan\" target=\"_blank\">17th century fan</a> emblazoned on trendy tote bags, to a 3D printed replica of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048707/library_vestibule_3D.html?q=\" target=\"_blank\">library vestibule</a> from the monastic complex of the Chartreuse of Pavia (Italy) being used in the interior design of a new café.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be inspired by our content - Art Nouveau </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until the end of 2017, we’ll highlight different parts of our collections to inspire you and your creations in three campaigns. Our first campaign highlights our <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style\" target=\"_blank\">Art Nouveau collections</a> in parallel with the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/02/welcome-to-art-nouveau-season-on-europeana-art/\" target=\"_blank\">season</a> running until the end of May. This season is centred around a fantastic <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style\" target=\"_blank\">major new exhibition</a> featuring almost fifty artworks from over twenty museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Art Nouveau </strong>movement inspired beauty in everyday life, from furniture and fashion design to architecture and advertising. On Europeana Labs, you can find Art Nouveau <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data\" target=\"_blank\">datasets</a> of high quality, free to reuse content, including <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/3d-models-of-art-nouveau-objects-from-the-isle-of-man\" target=\"_blank\">3D models of Art Nouveau objects</a> from the Isle of Man, beautiful <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/art-nouveau-ornamental-motifs-in-hungarian-style\" target=\"_blank\">Art Nouveau motifs</a> in Hungarian style, and <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/art-nouveau-posters-and-decorative-objects\" target=\"_blank\">posters and decorative objects</a>. We’ve collected Art Nouveau-inspired <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-glassware/\" target=\"_blank\">glassware</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-jewellery/\" target=\"_blank\">jewellry</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-metalworks/\" target=\"_blank\">metalworks</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-tiles/\" target=\"_blank\">tiles</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-fashion/\" target=\"_blank\">fashion</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-ceramics/\" target=\"_blank\">ceramics </a>and <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-textile-and-wallpaper-designs/\" target=\"_blank\">textile and wallpaper design</a> (and much more) on our <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest Boards</a>.

        intro: null
        body: "<p>In February, we partnered with the crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\">Goteo</a> to announce a unique funding opportunity for creatives across Europe. We launched a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/strike-a-match-for-education-apply-for-a-chance-of-getting-your-project-funded\">match funding call</a> that offered 10,000 EUR to support projects using digital cultural content in secondary education. The application round closed on 15 March with 18 submissions from across Europe which were carefully assessed by the representatives of Europeana and Goteo based on the call <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">criteria</a>, such as innovation, engagement and feasibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are thrilled to announce the three winning projects of this match funding call. Read the projects descriptions below and discover how these teams found innovative and engaging ways to re-use digital cultural heritage in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1821 Greek Revolution History Platform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/YTgRcRs8ABw?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=1E2mh\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The project aims to develop an online platform to discover, view and share 2D and 3D content based on Europeana collections related to the pre and post revolutionary period of the Greek War of Independence. It will provide an educational community portal where secondary school students and teachers communicate with each other, while they explore educational materials. In addition, teachers will be able to create a series of educational scenarios based on the platform content and the visualization of usually neglected aspects of historical interest, such as everyday life, natural and built environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform is an initiative of <a href=\"http://www.personalcinema.org/\">Personal Cinema</a>, a network specialising in the production of social-political video games, multimedia works and documentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Capturing Fashion in the 20th Century with Frieda Verhees' Study Collection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/208160327\" title=\"MoMu Study Collecting - Frieda Verhees\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A joint initiative of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp (dept. Costume Design) and<a href=\"https://www.momu.be/\"> MoMu</a> (the Fashion Museum in Antwerp), this project aims to preserve the fashion collection of the costume design teacher Frieda Verhees and create a documentary on 20th century fashion based on the interviews with Frieda and selected objects from her collection. This documentary will then be used for teaching, research and creative projects. All project’s results (database/digital files/documentary) will be made available under an open license for free re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Study Collection of Frieda Verhees will be also promoted as a secondary education tool at MoMu’s ‘Teacher Days' which are organised four times a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gli animali nella Grande Guerra/Animals in the Great War</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/210017651\" title=\"Gli animali nella Grande Guerra/ Animals in the Great War\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Animals in the Great War’ will be an eBook that studies the First World War from the standpoint of the animals that took part in it. The idea for this project took shape in 2016 during a seminar dedicated to the animals at the front. Presented to an audience of 500 secondary school students and teachers, the topic was enthusiastically received. This eBook will use free resources from the Europeana 1914-1918 collection, especially the photographic resources, which have an immediate impact in attracting students’ attention and could be easily used in developing lessons and aiding individual study. The book will be published in Italian and English and will be available for free download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project is part of a wide-ranging initiative called <a href=\"https://surianoservizieditoriali.com/2016/06/30/oltre-confine/\">Oltre-confine</a>. Developed by the Italian cultural association Se, Oltre-confine targets secondary schools and promotes studies focused on twentieth-century history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout April, the winners will work together with the Goteo team and learn how to design a successful crowdfunding campaign. The first crowdfunding round will run from 26 April to 5 June. And from 6 June to 25 June, we will promote their second and final crowdfunding round. Project teams will have six months (from 15 June, resp. 1 July 2017 until 31 December 2017) to implement their ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\">@EuropeanaLabs</a> and sign up to our <a href=\"http://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=935d4e98eb\">newsletter</a> to receive updates on the three match funding projects!</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Are you one of the art historians and data-scientists taking part in the <strong><a href=\"http://codingdurer.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Coding Dürer hackathon</a></strong>? Do you want to know what <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a> offers for research? Like the organisers of Coding Dürer, we believe that digitized cultural heritage content has huge potential for digital humanities and multidisciplinary research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana offers the hackathon participants access to more than 54 million digitised items and related metadata from more than 3500 of Europe’s galleries, museums, archives and libraries. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art</a> is our dedicated thematic collection designed to promote discovery of Europe’s art. Here you can browse 1.4m objects, get inspired by specially curated editorial features and search by topic, artist, museum and colour. Encouraging people to give new life and meaning to our re-usable content - currently <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;locale=en&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">20.8m records</a> in our entire collection - is one of the ways we can harness the full value of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2017-03/92062-bibliographicresource-1000126185482-1-.jpeg\" style=\"width: 326px; height: 500px;\"><br><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/92062/BibliographicResource_1000126185482.html\">Dürer, Albrecht</a> | Hendrik Hondius. 1598. Austrian National Library. Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Labs</a> you can access a range of resources and services to help you get working with our cultural collections as quickly and as easily as possible. There, you can find a showcase of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\" target=\"_blank\">tools and applications</a> built using the Europeana API and a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/datasets\" target=\"_blank\">series of openly licensed datasets</a> featuring the best free-to-re-use Europeana content. We have made available four <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana APIs</a> - all are free to access and use after a simple registration process. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/europeana-rest-api\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> is the most frequently used - it enables users to filter records by a variety of data fields, from date and creator, to media type and size. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/linked-open-data\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Linked Open Data service</a> allows you to explore, access, and download metadata through our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/linked-open-data#sparql-endpoint\" target=\"_blank\">SPARQL endpoint</a>. With the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/oai-pmh-service\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana OAI-PMH service</a>, users can harvest the entirety, or a selection of all Europeana metadata. Finally, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/annotations-api\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Annotations API</a> allows users to generate, update, and retrieve annotations for objects in our collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your use of Europeana data does not have to stop at Coding Dürer</strong><br>\r\nOn our platform you can also find funding and services to support creative, educator and researcher communities to reuse Europeana content. About twice a year we issue the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/take-the-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Challenge</a>, a themed call to creative professionals to present their best business ideas for the re-use of Europeana content. Outcomes are varied; business-oriented or educational, social or creative, but the proposals must be sustainable and meet the theme (which in the past has included fashion, art, and World War I). In 2017 we have also launched the first <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/strike-a-match-for-education-apply-for-a-chance-of-getting-your-project-funded\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana match funding call</a> offering financial backing for proposed secondary educational resources using Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a></strong> provides opportunities for digital humanities researchers to answer a specific research question using Europeana content and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/academic-research#explore\" target=\"_blank\">research datasets</a>. The annual <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/grants-programme\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research Grants programme</a>, first launched in 2016, is designed to support researchers employing digital humanities tools and methods to make the most of the full resources of Europeana (metadata, the API, etc.) to further their research. You can also become a member of <strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeanatech\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Tech</a></strong>, our R&amp;D community with a special focus on cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased that the team at Coding Dürer has facilitated this hackathon of art history data. We are even more thrilled that we have the opportunity to encourage you to explore beyond interdisciplinary research boundaries with Europeana’s art data. If you use our content or API, please share your progress with us on Twitter using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\" target=\"_blank\">@EuropeanaLabs</a> and #CodingDurer. We are interested in featuring any promising ideas or prototypes that come out of the Coding Dürer Hackathon on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/creative-industries\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Labs</a> - <a href=\"mailto:reuse@europeana.eu?subject=Coding%20D%C3%BCrer!\">email us</a> to show us more. For now, all the best for a productive and inspiring week at Coding Dürer - we are looking forward to seeing the outcomes. #Allezculture!</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>A guest blog by <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members/maria-drabczyk\">Maria Drabczyk</a> ( from the National Audiovisual Institute, <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/\">NInA</a>).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">TuEuropeana</a> activities, the re#MEDIA workshop at the <a href=\"http://sof.edu.pl/en\">School of Form</a> in Poznań, Poland, aimed on stimulating the creative thinking around the digital collections of Europeana. By using the tools of design research, new media, application design, as well as alternative thinking on arts and fashion design and music and cinema resources, we wanted to demonstrate the potentials of the collections’ various re-use possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TuEuropeana project started in November 2016, after four students from the university returned from<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/from-idea-creation-to-sustainable-business-models-europeana-labs-workshop-at-the-arts-fair\"> the Europeana Labs workshop at THE ARTS+ Fair</a>, organised as part of Frankfurt Book Fair. The group was composed of SoF students from various disciplines, such as Communication Design, Industrial Design, Fashion Design &amp; Domestic Design. The workshop was run under the TEAM.WORK creative methodology, using the members’ individual interests and skills as well as going towards common goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a number of classes, including alo topics related to copyright and technical side or archival re-use, students learned the rules of creative re-use of digital cultural assets. The workshop concluded in the creation of a dozen unique designs inspired by digital heritage. Surprisingly, most of the artists transformed the digital formats back to the analogue art, giving them a new meaning through artistic installations, prints, or domestic designs. However, it also led to artworks displaying media in public, and artistic interventions engaging artificial intelligence, or installations connecting the analogue with the digital in adding sound recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/dsc-6352.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 372px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>COCOON by Zhyldyz Kozhoiarova, cocoon-like structure, which isolates you from outer world and where you are only with yourself, surrounded by tunes and sounds coming from the archive; Photo Credits: Malwina Toczek, NInA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The showcase </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the designing process were shown during a special event co-organised by the National Audiovisual Institute and the School of Form in Warsaw. The showcase started with a \"guided tour\" of some of the spaces at NInA, which had been used as the setting for artistic performances and screenings. It was followed by a debate between the experts and the public about the use of digital collections in artistic activities and cultural practices by artists, designers, curators, et cetera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the coming weeks, Europeana and the School of Form will jointly showcase the best designs developed during the re#MEDIA workshop. Stay tuned!</strong></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Art, technology and storytelling. One of the winners of the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/europeana-challenges\">first Europeana Challenge of 2016</a>, Storypix combines these elements in a web exhibition platform that allows for art institutions to meaningfully present their collections in public spaces. In this interview, Paul Ruseler, part of the <a href=\"https://www.storypix.org/\">Storypix</a> team, tells us about democratising art, museum innovation and other stories.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>You are one of the Europeana Challenge winners of 2016. Why did you apply for the challenge? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It kind of came exactly at the right time. A friend had invited me to a hackathon in the <a href=\"https://waag.org/nl\">Waag Society</a> in Amsterdam that was organised by the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/\">Europeana Space project</a>. The event itself was an eye opener. I had years of experience in curating photography exhibitions, but this was a great opportunity to expand this and experiment with the potential of technology for presenting art. We came up with an exhibition model for large digital screens with mobile interaction technology, centred around personal storytelling. I believe stories are central to our human experience and with technology we can really tap into that now. Snapchat and Instagram all revolve around storytelling, people love sharing those stories and we took an approach that connected to this trend. Responses were very good when we presented it and I felt we were onto something. When the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/europeana-challenges\">Europeana Challenge </a>opened a few months later I understood they were looking for creative ideas to disclose the Europeana collection. I have always felt that archives are treasure troves of inspiration, but become daunting and inaccessible by its sheer size and kind of data driven approach. Europeanaʼs collection of artworks had so much to offer that I really wanted to dive into it and bring it to life. To connect the best of the European art heritage to a new audience and engage them with personal storytelling and great technology. This is when I decided to join the challenge and submit the Storypix concept to Europeana Labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Could you tell us about your team?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I teamed up with Jack and George, a British developers duo who, as trained as engineers, knew the importance of durability for anything that is placed in public space. They also were keen on working with the idea of personal storytelling around art and they knew the book <a href=\"http://alaindebotton.com/art/\"><em>Art As Therapy</em></a> by Alain de Botton, that served as a inspiration for the concept of Storypix. We spent many meetings drafting out the first ideas, wireframes and routings and iterated continuously throughout the process. They managed to build a platform from scratch, coding together different elements that eventually led to a responsive and robust framework and a great user experience. They were also keen thinkers in terms of design. One of the biggest challenges with new technologies is to keep things simple. Youʼre quickly tempted to include many features, but that usually doesnʼt make it better. Jack and George both had a good eye for app development so we spent many hours discussing what we could leave out, which eventually made for a more focused experience. Storypix wishes to bring art to outside museum walls, to public spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/196715607\" title=\"Storypix\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will it work? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital screen technology is now at a point where high resolution art works can be displayed with impressive effect. We looked for the best cinematic experience for this, with a fluent interaction and the immersive quality of sound. Because people have the device for this right in their pockets. To install a Storypix location, all thatʼs needed is a large screen or projection. This could be inside a building or outside, whatever works best for that environment. When someone then goes to storypix.live on their phone, the web application picks up the artwork by location and shows the interface on your screen. Now you stand in front of the artwork and your phone has turned into both a remote controller and story device. Itʼs all web based, no app is required. The visitor can now touch their phone and zoom in on the artwork on the big screen. Itʼs very intuitive and it feels like magic; you are moving a large surface with minimum movement and it allows you to see art at an incredible level of detail. On your phone screen, the bottom part has an audio player to access the stories. With a pair of headphones people can now experience art as if it were cinema, immersed in a soundtrack and moving through high resolution art pieces. The level of personal engagement is great and this creates an opportunity to connect to people. From here we can allow people to buy tickets for the museum or share their stories to their friends and families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Combining celebrated artworks with personal stories is one of Storypixʼs features. How will this enhance the user experience of enjoying art? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museumʼs are constantly innovating to reach out to new audiences (read: millennials) but their approach is often still that of an institution instead of a network of people. Information is given about the who, when and where, but itʼs quite rare that you are touched by that experience. I often felt this approach is not the purpose of the museum, which, as a “house of the muses”, is supposed to inspire our lives. The book from Alain de Botton suggests that we should ask what an artwork means to us personally. Because thatʼs what matters in the end. We are naturally inclined to listen to someone who talks about how they love someone, or what keeps them up at night. What they dream of and how they struggle to live in the city or deal with family. Simple contemporary subjects like online dating can turn into meaningful stories of life, seen through the works of art. I believe art can bring inspiration and wisdom to our lives, when we start to understand it actually is about us. This is why Storypix is all centred around personal stories from peopleʼs real lives. It even includes a functionality to add stories on the go. We believe this is a real change in terms of democratising art. We took on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history/Europeana280.html\">Europeana 280 collection</a> that has some of the best artworks across Europe, in beautiful high resolution. It proved a great collection to connect these paintings to contemporary life and we had a lot of fun thinking about how we can best do this. Finding the right combination between paintings, suggestive headlines and stories was like inventing a new type of storytelling. I canʼt wait to hear other peopleʼs stories, from the intimate, the hilarious to the honest and heartfelt. Thatʼs what I think art should be about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/storypix-interview-pic.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 762px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"I swiped right\" is a derivative of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063602/SWE_280_007.html\">\"Passionate Lovers\"</a> by Johan Tobias Sergel, used under CC BY-SA. \"I swiped right\" is licensed under CC BY by Storypix.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Storypix uses openly licensed artworks that are part of the Europeana 280 campaign. How important is for creative industries professionals that cultural heritage institutions open their content?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very important I think. Some institutions like the Rijksmuseum have understood that by giving open access to high resolution files of their collection, they donʼt compromise their function as a museum, but in fact reinforce it. By adding stories to an artwork it means that you add value to it. The artwork becomes a reference point and part of a collective memory. People will be eager to come and see the original. Rijksmuseum has invested a lot into this and its new director is going to open up even more. It has proven a very good strategy for reaching broad audiences and becoming a successful institution and now many museums are doing the same. The Europeana 280 collection is a great example of this strategy; a proof of the cultural wealth that Europe has to offer and the result is very inspiring. And Iʼm convinced this is just the beginning. I enjoy visiting museums and I know thereʼs a lot of work thatʼs still only visible to the museum visitor. I hope museums will open up more and more in this respect, because having a new generation relate to art is not only rewarding and encouraging, itʼs also a great investment in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about the technology developed for the app. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We developed a platform to present artworks at different locations at the same time. With a simple URL you connect your phone to a display that you control as if it were an advanced remote. Itʼs built with a type of web communication, originally developed for social media, that pushes data at lightning speed and which has recently become available for open source. This piece of tech gave us the responsiveness we needed. When you touch your phone screen, it feels like youʼre moving the big screen, giving the artwork a feel of tangibility. Other technologies that we included are a tiling service for handling gigapixel files and a multiple user mode to allow more than one person to join. We built a custom audio player from the ground up so we could design it as we wanted, we routed localisation through a secured https protocol and included sharing to social platforms. We worked on the back end to allow institutions to have their own account to upload content and we included a payment module for buying tickets to the museum and more - all in a deceptively simple app. Because itʼs web based we can constantly iterate, reshape the experience, collect data for our customers and update the app. It also means we are extremely flexible in terms of adding content, which is key for working with partners with various types of collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are Storypix's next steps? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to partner up with museums and art institutions to start showcase art on their large screens inside their institutions, or, take it outside. We want to start to talk to municipalities to bring these collections into the city and to connect people to art. We want to talk to billboard companies and help them understand that their screens can be more than displays for brands, that it can be a place of culture. And we want to see how we can partner with other European institutions to make use of our great cultural heritage and to and open it up to a large and diverse audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you want to learn more about Storypix app?

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><strong>Does your creative project need funding? Can you harness the power of the crowd to deliver educational outcomes from the re-use of Europe’s rich cultural heritage content?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In collaboration with the crowdfunding platform <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Goteo</a>, today we launch a<a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\" target=\"_blank\"> match funding call</a> offering <strong>10,000 EUR </strong>to co-fund up to three creative projects for secondary education. The match funding call closes <strong>15 March 2017 at 23:59 hrs (CET).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How will our match funding work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Match funding is a method which encourages co-investment between public and private institutions and the crowd. In this call, for each 1 EUR donated by the crowd, Europeana will contribute 1 EUR up to a maximum of 100 EUR per donation and no more than 3,500 EUR per project. Europeana’s match funding capital per project campaign will be allocated once the campaign achieves its minimum crowdfunding goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligible projects must be digital, use Europeana openly licensed content as a central element and be relevant to a secondary education audience (students 11-18 years and teachers in this educational tier). We accept applications for both formal and informal secondary education. The projects can vary from digital applications, MOOCs, e-books, to documentaries or other creative digital learning tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for proposals that are scalable and present ideas that will work across multiple countries and/or languages. It is also important that applicants demonstrate how they reach existing audiences and new communities in order to achieve their crowdfunding goals as well as how they will sustain the project in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our five month match funding campaign will run as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n<strong>1 February - 15 March:</strong> Application submission on <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\">Goteo.org</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>29 March: </strong>Announcement of the selected projects</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>30 March - 11 April: </strong>Workshops with Goteo’s representatives and design of the crowdfunding campaigns (winning teams only)</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>26 April - 5 June:</strong> First round of the projects’ crowdfunding campaigns</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<strong>6 June - 25 June:</strong> Second and final crowdfunding round</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Project teams will have six months (from 15 June, resp. 1 July 2017 until 31 December 2017) to implement their projects. Read more about the application criteria, funding conditions and available resources in our<a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\" target=\"_blank\"> Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and Goteo’s match funding campaign offers real business and audience engagement outcomes for the selected projects. An example of a successful match funding campaign on the<a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/discover/calls\" target=\"_blank\"> Goteo Platform</a> is the <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/project/archivo-de-estudios-campesinos\" target=\"_blank\">Archivo de Estudios Campesinos</a> project which received 7,925 EUR from the crowd and 2,500 EUR match funding from <a href=\"https://www.unia.es/\" target=\"_blank\">UNIA</a> foundation to support the organization and cataloguing of 20th century documents in Andalusia. Beyond financing, a successful campaign validates project’s concept and market potential and provides valuable insights about its audiences and how best to engage them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strike a match for education and <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\" target=\"_blank\">apply</a> for this unique funding opportunity!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\" target=\"_blank\">Follow us</a> on #Europeana4Education and #CrowdHeritage</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet VR Quiz: a virtual reality game for a compelling museum experience'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>One of the winners at <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-awards-at-loomehakk-estonia\">Loomehäkk hackathon in Estonia</a>, VR Quiz is a virtual reality game that helps visitors to make the most out of their museum experience. We talked to Õnne Mets from VR Quiz team, to find out more about this game and the plans to take the project to next level.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your prototype won the Europeana Award during the Loomehäkk 48 hours hackathon. How did you come up with the idea?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our team at Loomehäkk was one of the biggest with 9 members. Most of us did not know each other before. Some wanted to try out the virtual reality technology and some, like myself, wanted to play with Europeana content, see the event and meet new people. The amount of collections published on Europeana, the Europeana API and the enthusiastic presentation by the Europeana representative James Morley captivated our team. Today, the core team consists of 3 people: Madis Taimre (developer), Marko Pilisner (business and logistics), and myself (customers and communication).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/dsc-2174.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 315px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The VR Quiz team. CC BY-SA VR Quiz.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about VR Quiz.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VR Quiz helps museums and other exhibitors in Europe to tell the story of their exhibitions in an engaging way and educate visitors by testing their knowledge through a truly immersive experience. For now, VR Quiz is designed to be played at the venue of these cultural organizations. Visitors are invited to put on the virtual reality headset and play with the controllers. They will find themselves in a thematic environment, where they “encounter” quiz questions, each associated with images as answering options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As game administrators, museums first select 3D environments of their interest from our portfolio, for example, a medieval building, or a WW1 landscape. A simple user interface enables staff to create the quiz for the game. They type in a question, which appears in a designated spot in the 3D environment. For the answering options, the staff can use the curation tool, which queries the Europeana API for a specific search term, and then just drag and drop the suitable images and mark the right answer. We also provide an option to upload files for quiz answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did Europeana content inspire you to create the VR Quiz?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We saw a two-fold opportunity in Europeana Collections. First, they are a rich resource to tap into, when visual information is needed for creating a special virtual environment or scenery. Secondly, a great part of the Europeana Collections can be reused by anyone - thus organisations without own digitised content can display openly licensed content (Public Domain, CC0, CC BY, and CC BY-SA) provided by other memory institutions on Europeana in the game at their venue. When 3D scans become more accessible, we would like to include also the 3D objects in the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How could museums benefit from using VR Quiz?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VR Quiz is about putting the cultural heritage in the service of education, lifelong learning and entertainment. It allows museums to use cutting edge technologies to design an interactive and memorable experience to their visitors, triggering real-life sensations. For instance, the Estonian History Museum exhibiting Medieval theme, wanted to dip their visitors into these ages. They selected dark pub scene with noise of the men drinking beer, burning torches on the walls and a dragon in the corner, as well as a celebration of the nobles with musicians playing, steaming food on the table etc. The quiz asked to figure out, which cups were used and which clothes were worn at that time. Museums could also use VR Quiz as the last stop on the exhibition path - to let visitors test the knowledge that they have gained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What technology does VR Quiz employ?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For software development we mostly use the industry-leading Unity game engine. On the hardware side we use state-of-the-art virtual reality headsets (currently HTC Vive, but the program is not bound to specific hardware) alongside the recommended PC setup. The Europeana API enabled to create a simple search opportunity for the museum staff right from the system’s user interface and add the selected content directly to the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How has the product been received?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1171478069548695/\">Loomehäkk</a> we won Art special prize and Europeana Award. Since then the concept of VR Quiz has been received very well both by museum and startup communities. The team has also won <a href=\"http://www.innove.ee/UserFiles/Organisatsioonist/ESF%20tegevused/Ettevotlusoppe_Uudiskiri_nr3.pdf\">Tallinn University’s Grand Prix of the Creative Business Development Program</a> (in Estonia) and prizes of Prototron, Digix and Creative Estonia at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/ETstartercreative/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=260555194300523\">MELT Forum</a>; and access to top 100 at <a href=\"http://www.ajujaht.ee/en/\">Ajujaht</a>, the biggest business ideas’ competition in Estonia. During several discussions and demos at cultural heritage related events we have received feedback, requests, ideas and support from museums, libraries, theme parks, business developers and media. We have held close dialogue with Estonian National Museum and Estonian History Museum to understand better the business requirements. It shows us that the idea and the concept are valid, and encourages us to transfer the prototype into a complete product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You had a demo day at the Estonian History Museum. Tell us about this experience and the public’s reaction to the prototype.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been at the Estonian History Museum twice in order to test the prototype with the museum staff and visitors. We were happy to see that already setting up the hardware raised interest in the audience, who literally lined up to try it. The game attracted visitors of all ages. A boy, whom we expected to have played extreme games and maybe would find our work-in-progress-prototype a bit boring, shouted: “It was so real!”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the future plans for developing VR Quiz?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still have a lot of work to do before we can call VR Quiz a product. We want to improve the features of the game flow and create a portfolio of 3D environments, where exhibitors can choose the best match for the game they need. At the same time, we participate in business incubators of <a href=\"http://digix.eu\">Digix</a> and <a href=\"http://www.looveesti.ee/en/\">Creative Estonia</a>. We have also learned that many museums may prefer to rent the hardware together with the purchase of the VR Quiz software license. We prefer to stick to the software and looking for engaging an experienced partner in museum area, who would develop and rent the hardware solution, if needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next spring we would like to test the independent use of VR Quiz together with the foolproof hardware solution. If all goes well, we will be ready for our first customers by the end of 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If VR Quiz caught your attention, get in touch with us via email (<a href=\"http://info@vrquizlab.com\">info@vrquizlab.com</a>) to know more about our virtual reality game and future developments! You can also keep your eye on us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VRQuiz/\">Facebook</a>!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In September we launched the second <strong><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/second-challenge-2016-fashion\">Europeana Challenge</a></strong> of 2016, dedicated to fashion. We offered a share of €20.000 for the best idea(s) of how to creatively re-use Europeana and Europeana Fashion’s openly licensed fashion content in a digital product, service or business. An <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/challenge-jury\">expert jury</a> assessed applications from right across the EU and 6 teams were invited to a tough Skype interview in early December 2016. We are now delighted to present the team behind <strong>CRAFT</strong>, the winning project, who have been awarded the full 20.000 EUR challenge prize.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>CRAFT - the creative artificial fashion tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>...Imagine a web platform based on advanced artificial intelligence tools that can automatically identify clothing in photos and change their style based on Europeana’s fashion content and your preferences!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>How will it work for me?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You upload a photo containing one or more items of clothing - like a skirt, shirt or shoes - to the platform. You can select one or more of the items of clothing in the photos - CRAFT will automatically identify what they are. A choice of styles (created from Europeana’s fashion collection) is displayed on the screen, and you select which style you'd like to apply to each piece of clothing. You can also search Europeana to make your own content selection or find links that will lead you to interesting material. Styles from a wide set of Europeana content (from photography to artworks) can be applied to every kind of fashion clothing the tool can recognise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selecting a style will trigger a real-time online process which will apply the style to the item, thus creating and displaying new fashion items on your screen. The creations you make using Europeana content will be analysed in order to provide recommendations for related styles or new items from retailers. At the same time, you'll be able to save your creation, share your new favourite digital creation on social media and learn more about the fashion item by clicking a link taking you to the original record on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-12/1481885833_image-for-blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 267px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana images used in order of appearance left to right:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/record/a/fd850e10943bb8c3011ff319c197ea526973700a90970075013bf13d36449330\">Shift dress</a>.

The CRAFT tool can be embedded in the product page of online stores and provide a quality service to increase user retention and product sales. The playful feature will capture users’ attention and make them stay longer on the site, revisit and, even share their creative digital cultural heritage creation to their favourite social media platform. From a retailer’s perspective, the CRAFT tool will provide a unique understanding of their online shopping audience, help spot new fashion trends, enhance brand awareness through re-sharing of content and increase sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell me about the team!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CRAFT team is made up of four members with diverse technical and business backgrounds. <a href=\"https://gr.linkedin.com/in/rapantzikos\">Kostas Rapantzikos</a> (PhD) is a senior computer vision and machine learning engineer with experience in academia and industry, and he will lead on technical coordination. <a href=\"https://gr.linkedin.com/in/arkoumanis\">Dinos Arkoumanis</a> (PhD) is a senior software architect and as an experienced entrepreneur he will lead the business unit. <a href=\"https://gr.linkedin.com/in/varytimidis\">Christos</a><a href=\"https://gr.linkedin.com/in/varytimidis\"> Varytimidis</a> (PhD) is a computer vision engineer and will make sure that the trained models are performing well. <a href=\"https://gr.linkedin.com/in/evangelosa\">Evangelos Anagnostopoulos</a> (MSc) is a junior software architect, a skilled developer with a background in machine learning who will optimize and integrate the algorithms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2017, the team will release a demo-creativity tool that will allow the user to create photos of unique style based on free to reuse Europeana content. By the end of June 2017, we will see a user interface that can be embedded on e-retailers' platforms that will allow customers to engage with Europeana's fashion-related content in new and creative ways!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Keep following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\">@EuropeanaLabs</a> and sign up to our <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/bcPYL9\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter</a> to find out more about CRAFT as the development progresses, and stayed tuned in 2017 for more challenges and opportunities!</strong></p>\r\n"

To get this item, issue a GET request to the Record API:</p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/rwd/e377d2c0a351e958967c05ddd0e482be.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s an extract of what we get back from the API:</p>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">.gist-data { max-height: 550px; }\r\n</style>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/rwd/d3d62ef36970ce563878f6c6ed738e8f.js\"></script>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">.gist-data { max-height: 550px; }\r\n</style>\r\n<p>At this point you may wish to refer to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Share_your_data/Technical_requirements/EDM_profiles/IIIFtoEDM_profile_042016.pdf\">formal specification</a> for the metadata fields added to EDM (PDF) to support IIIF to get the full story, but for our purposes all we needed was the web resource properties named “svcsHasService” and “dctermsIsReferencedBy”. When both of those are present, then we know that the latter is a URI to the IIIF manifest, which is all that is needed by the IIIF viewer that we use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a viewer, we chose <a href=\"http://leafletjs.com/\">Leaflet.js</a> with the<a href=\"https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF\"> Leaflet-IIIF plugin</a>. As we already used Leaflet for <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063613/POL_280_009.html#map\">maps</a>, Leaflet-IIIF was a natural choice to accommodate the display of high-resolution, zoomable IIIF images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requesting the <a href=\"http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/metadata/iiif/vad-0342/manifest.json\">manifest</a> gets us a JSON-LD description of this collection of images using the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/\">IIIF Presentation API</a>. However, as Leaflet-IIIF only implements the <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/image/\">IIIF Image API</a> for the description of individual images, not the Presentation API for manifests of more than one image, we added in <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Patternlab/blob/v0.2.62/source/js/modules/eu/media/search-iiif-viewer.js#L228-L247\">a little JavaScript of our own</a> to fetch the manifest and parse it for canvases to show in the viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pass the manifest URI to the viewer, <em>et voilà!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In full, the bare minimum HTML and JavaScript needed to display this manifest would look like:</p>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">.gist-data { max-height: 550px; }\r\n</style>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/rwd/f83772e2715a4f04167d000fc9f41da4.js\"></script>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">.gist-data { max-height: 550px; }\r\n</style>\r\n<p>In summary, if you want to start providing a richer viewing experience for images where a IIIF service is advertised in the EDM, all you need to do is choose a IIIF-compliant viewer, pass it these new data fields extracted from the API response, perhaps with a little pre-parsing if the viewer does not natively handle manifests, and you’re done. It really is that simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that many of you using Europeana’s REST API to reuse our wealth of cultural heritage will join us in taking advantage of the images that already have IIIF metadata, and those that we look forward to being enriched with it in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further reading and resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/IIIF/awesome-iiif\">Awesome IIIF</a>: a selection of IIIF tools that may be of use to developers.</li>\r\n    <li>David Haskiya’s Slideshare <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/DavidHaskiya/europeana-iiif-what-we-have-been-doing-with-iiif-and-why\">“Europeana &amp; IIIF - what we have been doing with IIIF and why”</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Blog post <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-aligns-with-the-international-image-interoperability-framework-iiif\">“Europeana aligns with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)“</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

        title: 'From idea creation to sustainable business models: Europeana Labs workshop at THE ARTS+ Fair'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 19-21 October, an interactive and interdisciplinary workshop held during <a href=\"http://theartsplus.com/\">THE ARTS+ Fair</a> – a side event of the <a href=\"http://www.buchmesse.de/en/fbf/\">Frankfurt Book Fair</a> – brought together 19 design students from Italy, Poland, Germany and The Netherlands to explore how cultural heritage and technology can be combined in new business models. Five early-stage prototypes emerged as result from this creative marathon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the first day, a co-creation workshop led by the Spanish consulting company <a href=\"http://platoniq.net/en/\">Platoniq</a> encouraged students to experiment with Europeana data using specially created <a href=\"https://issuu.com/platoniq/docs/platoniq_co-creation_eng\">Co-creation Made Agile methodology</a>. The teams finished the day with a cut-throat elimination of the weakest prototype ideas, focussing instead on the development of the most robust five business proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second and third days were led by <a href=\"http://www.media-deals.org/\">Media Deals</a>, a pan-European investor network. To begin, students took their five business proposals into a business modeling workshop and were introduced the Lean Canvas methodology. This helped them turn their idea into viable business models. On the third day, a pitching skills training with presentations and instant feedback coached participants on the best way to show their projects to financiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The learning process ended with students pitching their ideas at an investor forum that was open to the public. Design students presented their projects to a jury of selected investors and business experts, and of course, to many interested passersby at THE ARTS+. The investor panel evaluated the ideas and provided them with constructive feedback to help them develop their ideas into a market ready proposition. The jury members were: Eugene Smyth (<a href=\"http://www.aibseedcapitalfund.ie/\">Allied Irish Banks Seed Capital Fund</a>); Cathrin Frisemo (<a href=\"http://nfban.org/\">Nordic Female Business Angel Network</a>); Xavier Huerre (Interim Executive, Business Consultant, Angel Investor); Dieter Staib (Education, BBA and MBA at <a href=\"http://www.esade.edu/web/eng\">ESADE</a> Barcelona).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five early-stage prototypes were presented:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The app <em>LIX-IT! </em>aims to tackle cultural differences in a playful way by engaging users to mix content from different countries.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Art out loud</em> offers an audio interpretation of artworks in order to facilitate the access to the Europeana content for the visually impaired.</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Fantasia</em> helps fashion designers to create patterns from high-quality content made available through Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Visualize</em> aims to create a unique visual experience of cultural institutions’ content by providing daily art updates to subscribers of their websites.</li>\r\n    <li>Lastly, a group of students proposed a project that has cultural heritage as a social glue and would allow creative ways of sharing knowledge.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Among the five pitches, <em>Fantasia</em> - an app developed by Viktoriia Dubinina (<a href=\"http://www.sof.edu.pl/en/\">School of Form</a>, Poland), Tetiana Baran (School of Form, Poland) and Eugenia Ioppolo (<a href=\"http://www.iuav.it/English-Ve/About-Iuav/Iuav-profi/\">IUAV</a>, Italy) - was selected as the winning project. As a reward for their great work, the Fantasia team will attend next year’s edition of the Europeana Fashion Conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/europeana-at-artsplus.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 372px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fantasia team receiving feedback during THE ARTS+ Fair.

        body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/sparql\">Europeana SPARQL endpoint</a>, a key service of Europeana’s Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, is live again. After two years being hosted by <a href=\"http://ontotext.com/\">Ontotext</a>, for which we feel really grateful, this service has now been moved to our servers under a <a href=\"http://sparql.europeana.eu/\">new address</a> and powered by an open source triple store, <a href=\"http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com/\">Virtuoso</a>. We welcome everyone to try it out and send us feedback to the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/europeana-lod\">Europeana LOD group</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/linked-open-data-introduction\">Linked Open Data</a> is a way of publishing structured data that allows metadata to be connected and enriched, so that different representations of the same content can be found, and links made between related resources. The described resources are each addressable and dereferenceable by their URIs under the data.europeana.eu namespace. You can learn more with <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36752317\">Linked Open Data - What is it?</a> from<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\"> Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a> (also <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/album/2072014/video/49231111\">en Français</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/album/2072014/video/49231110\">auf Deutsch</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/album/2072014/video/49232562\">in Italiano</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/album/2072014/video/49231112\">en Español</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana SPARQL endpoint is a way for the Linked Open Data of all the Europeana datasets to be explored and queried. It provides a simple, yet flexible, way to query LOD’s heavily interlinked, graph data into normalized, tabular data like the kind you can open up in Excel, making it a powerful tool for digital humanists but also other Cultural Heritage enthusiasts to discover resources on Europeana. The examples section on Pro gives you a glimpse of the queries that the endpoint supports and further reading to get you inspired.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Inspiration for the #EuropeanaChallenge: all that glitters...'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>Until 31 October 2016 (23.59 CET) we are inviting applications to the <strong><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/second-challenge-2016-fashion\" target=\"_blank\">second #EuropeanaChallenge of 2016</a></strong>, dedicated to the reuse of Europeana’s openly licensed content in a digital product that meets the theme of fashion. Below, we highlight some of the great <strong>reusable jewellry</strong> content you can access on our platform and view on our curated Pinterest boards. Read on to find out how #EuropeanaInspires. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bracelets, necklaces and earrings are thought to be some of the oldest jewellry worn by early humans. The importance of jewellry in society - both personally, in religion and economically - is borne true by its prominence in graves, tombs and burial chambers for millennia. More than just an aesthetic adornment for the body, historically, the type of jewellry you wore - or if you could wear jewellry at all - could tell a lot about your social status and belief system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Searching for re-usable ‘jewellry’ into the <strong><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana platform</a></strong> brings up over 1.300 entries, giving an invaluable insight into jewellry across multiple time periods, societies and traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See, for instance, the image below of a Jewish wedding ring. The tradition of having a ‘house’ on top of a ring sets apart the Jewish wedding ceremony from other faith ceremonies. In some examples of a ‘house’ on top of the ring, a hinge would open up the house to reveal a message of luck for the newlyweds but with no visible hinge, this is likely to be an older example. Although we don’t know when the item was created, it is more common to have a gold wedding ring than a silver one across most Jewish cultures so this is an interesting specimen.<br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/2048221-ka-3514-1-.jpeg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 340px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048221/KA_3514.html?q=jewelry\" target=\"_blank\">Trouwring, joods</a>. Creator and date of creation unknown. Amsterdam Museum, the Netherlands. CC0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take this example of earrings (below) from around 1830 from a Swedish Collection at the <a href=\"http://hallwylskamuseet.se/en\" target=\"_blank\">Hallwylska Museum</a>. Due to the detail and shape it’s very possible they were crafted in the Ottoman Empire. The star and crescent became associated with the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and the detail in the earrings - the small pearl details and stitching, the gold drops and the use of the colour blue - are similar to others made in that period. The main feature, the three layered crescents and star, is interesting in how it is reminiscent of the (single) crescent and star of the Turkish flag. These earrings were given as a present in Sweden in 1900. In this case, wearing the earrings may suggest that the wearer is well-travelled or has a broad world perspective and knowledge, showing that that jewellry maintains both its economic value and social meaning at this time (see our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/inspiration-for-the-europeanachallenge-swedish-fashion-from-the-19th-century\" target=\"_blank\">recent blog on fashion plates</a> for information on how fashion trends were spread and what fashion plates represented in Sweden in the 19th century).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/earrings.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 313px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064105/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Hallwylska_museet_20197.html\" target=\"_blank\">Örhängen ett par - Carola Standertskjöld</a>. Hallwylska museet, Stockholm, Sweden. CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The double lion-headed ring (or hair ornament) below is most likely from the Hellenistic period in Greece (3-4 century BC). In this period, animal or human heads were common features in jewellry making. It has been said that gold was plentiful then, so we can assume that gold was worn often by those who could afford it. The lion in this example below could have mythological or metaphorical symbolism, or simply denote strength and might.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/87614250b4b44ef5cc785ab3bde25c5a.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 250px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/565_1891.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ring</a>. 4 - 3 century BC. Creator unknown. Victoria and Albert Museum, United Kingdom. CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/2048213-m-251-1975.jpeg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 250px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/M_251_1975.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pendant</a>. 1600-1630. Spanish origin. Creator unknown. Victoria and Albert Museum, United Kingdom. CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a social signifier, jewellry often has meaning beyond aesthetics. Above is another example of jewellry bound with religious meaning (courtesy of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). This pendant features the initials ‘RVM’ or “Religiosa de la Virgen María”, an abbreviation for the Virgin Mary. It was made in Spain between 1600-1630. The crown can be understood as similarly symbolic of the ‘royal queen’. Other content in Europeana use abbreviations such as “IHS” to refer to the Virgin Mary, which you can see if you look carefully at the Swedish pendant below from around 1750-1800. Of course, wearing such jewellry would have significant social connotations by visibly promoting one’s devotion to one’s faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/2048213-415-1886.jpeg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 318px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/415_1886.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pendant</a>. 1750-1800. Swedish origin. Creator unknown. Victoria and Albert Museum, United Kingdom. CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this last ring is in honour of that spooky time of year that’s fast approaching, Halloween. Topped with a skull’s head, one could think at first glance that this was a contemporary ‘fright’ piece designed for Halloween. However, this ring is thought to be from the 1600s and is likely to be a piece of ‘momento mori’, Latin for \"remember that you have to die\". In other words, this is a reminder of the wearer’s mortality and an outward method of demonstrating humility.<br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/2048221-j06594.jpeg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 299px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048221/J06594.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ring</a>. 17th century.

Public Domain Marked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long before models and celebrities walked runways in fashion weeks across the globe, the latest fashion news and trends had to travel via very different channels. In 19th century Sweden, ladies and gentleman of high classes would get style advice for social gatherings and different occasions – be it winter sports or a costume party – from fashion plates in magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provided by the <a href=\"http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/en\">Nordiska Museet</a>, a public domain collection of <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/swedish-fashion-from-the-19th-century\">over 1,000 fashion illustrations</a> from 19th century Swedish journals showcases the fashionable looks and items of this period in Western European history. The Nordiska Musset’s collection is fascinating as, besides beautiful bonnets, corsets, petticoats and bustles, it tracks how fashion changed over a wide timeframe: from the 1810s to the 1890s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A gathering for music and dance - see the tambourine and piano on the left.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/1861.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 407px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048211/609.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2048211%2A\">Nyaste journal för damer</a>, 1861, Stiftelsen Nordiska museet.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>The <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/home.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Europeana Fashion team</strong></a> introduce some of the highlights of Europeana Fashion<strong> </strong></em><em>and tell us about the platform’s great search functionality. Europeana Labs are collaborating with Europeana Fashion on the launch of the recent <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/next-challenge-2016-open\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Europeana Challenge</strong></a> dedicated to fashion.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion platform</a> brings together more than 800.000 fashion objects from more than 35 public and private archives and museums from around Europe. Ranging from historical dresses to accessories, catwalk photographs, drawings, sketches, videos and fashion catalogues, the collection is rich and diverse, allowing any sort of project – including those we hope to attract to the recently launched <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/next-challenge-2016-open\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Challenge</a> - to find inspiration in its many items.<br><br>\r\nDigital presentations of fashion objects are a big part of the collection, covering a wide timeframe and focusing primarily on western fashion. The quality of the content provided by <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/about.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion’s partners</a> (eg high resolution with lots of metadata) makes it possible to really dig into some wonderful and often forgotten historical items. Interesting embroidery techniques, unexpected materials, motifs and fascinating details can attract generalists interested in learning something about historical fashion but can also inspire new generations of designers to weave together past and present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/jacket.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px; width: 350px; height: 467px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/record/a/72857a41a6752e9e4100294c787b4a338746524e92f8e77b21fc993af96bf503\" target=\"_blank\">Waistcoat embroidered with coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread</a>, made 1610-1615, altered 1620.

Plates range from clothing to accessories and often depict social gatherings and occasions: held together in magazines, they showcase the variety and possibilities of fashion at certain periods of time in history, and can be read as testimonies of the narrative power of fashion itself.<br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/2016-10/3d0c161cc6a8355a25c409a35cf36b55.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 503px; margin: 10px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/record/a/c58864386ab3f8a687c6f44e0cee1ffc841dbc0406a9008672e2eb94dcbbb89a\" target=\"_blank\">Prints from the journal ‘La Saison’</a>.

Rights reserved - Free access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fashion photographs</strong> are also a big part of the collection, ranging from catwalk snaps to editorial and more ‘artistic’ images. These pictures can be seen as useful references for research; for example, they provide interesting ways in which accessories and clothes can be presented in advertising, in time becoming icons capable of creating desire.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The material on the portal can be browsed through <strong>facets</strong> (powerful search filters) that are designed to make it possible to easily browse and search the collection in depth. The search can be filtered by provider, designer/maker, object type, material/techniques, colour and – a new facet much appreciated by users - date (or period). <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/searching-europeana-s-fashion-content\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more</a> about searching Europeana using the custom facets of Europeana fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Europeana Fashion we regularly promote the diversity of our content, producing <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/themeoverview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Themes</a>, <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/eurfashion/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest Boards</a>, <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr curations</a> and also original pieces of writing that serve as guidance for those interested in fashion both as passion and as academic discipline. The <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/blogoverview.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion blog</a> discusses the content of the portal and tells stories about interesting objects that are part of the collection. It is therefore a useful platform to learn how to go about finding themes and find inspiration in this unique collection of fashion-related items.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>If you are applying to the second <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/challenges/second-challenge-2016-fashion\" target=\"_blank\">#EuropeanaChallenge</a> you have until 31 October 2016 23.59 (CET) to explore and be inspired by <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/browse.html\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion’s collections</a>. Search for <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data\" target=\"_blank\">reusable datasets</a> and find out more about the Europeana Challenge on <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Labs</a>.</h3>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the 2016 Research Grants Winners: Caroline Ardrey'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In this mini interview series you will hear directly from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-grants-final-results\">winners</a> of the Europeana Research Grants. Learn more about who they are, what they do, and find out how important cultural heritage material is to their work.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h2>Introducing Caroline Ardrey, who is analysing spoken performances of nineteenth-century French poetry through her project <em>Visualising Voice</em>.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us about yourself...</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/photograph-of-caroline-ardrey-28high-res-29.jpg\" style=\"width: 240px; border-width: 0px; height: 160px; margin: 10px; float: left;\"> I’m a post-doctoral researcher, working as Research Associate on <em>The Baudelaire Song Project</em>, an AHRC-funded project, based at The University of Birmingham. My research interests lie in exploring and examining the cross-over between nineteenth-century French poetry and other art forms, with a particular emphasis on music, fashion and journalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am passionate about finding connections between texts and people. I love delving into personal and professional relationships, looking at how writers, composers, journalists and other cultural figures influenced each other, and examining how engagement with poetry has shaped reception histories. Working with the digital humanities, I particularly enjoy testing out different technologies for plotting these relationships in visually dynamic and interactive ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What made you apply for the Europeana Research Grant? What did you know about Europeana before you applied?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew from past research that there were plenty of spoken word recordings of poems within Europeana Collections, so when I discovered that Europeana were offering research grants to use their materials, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to pursue the task of analysing spoken performance of poetry, and so the Visualising Voice project was born.<br>\r\nAt the heart of Visualising Voice is the desire to make use of resources within the Europeana Collections and to encourage others to do the same. The project aims to raise public awareness of the importance of voice and vocal performance in shaping our understanding of poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Europeana-funded project is all about highlighting the fact that cultural heritage resources and digital humanities tools aren’t about us and them, that exploring the findings of research doesn’t always need to be mediated by the voice of the academic - anyone can try their hand at engaging directly with the resources in Europeana Collections, because they’re publicly available. It was essential to me to make Visualising Voice a “democratic” project, which didn’t just show a non-academic audience what people are doing in universities, libraries and cultural heritage institutions, but rather that it gave them a chance to have a go at carrying out digital archival research for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How has Europeana supported your research?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the generous funding that the Europeana research grant has provided, I have been able to undertake a project which aims to change the way people understand poetry. More importantly,I hope to make some contribution to promoting public engagement with archival materials - in this case the Europeana Sounds archives. I am sure that, discovering a small corner of the Europeana Collection can lead to bigger things, so the first task is to hook people in. Without Europeana, I wouldn’t have been able to pursue the idea of working with a developer (a non-academic) to tease out key features of spoken word recordings in a way that is accessible to non-specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding a way in is key, and it is through that first engagement with digital archival material that the resources within the Europeana Collections came to be a fundamental driver in my research. Although I have only recently become acquainted with Europeana as a platform, the archival material made available to me through resources like Gallica has answered many questions, and opened up many more, about chains of influence in nineteenth-century literature, music and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How essential is access to cultural heritage data for your research?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Access to cultural heritage data is fundamental to my research. A lot of the discoveries I’ve made and the networks I’ve been able to plot have come about by chance findings from searching library databases, digital archives and other databases. In this way, working with cultural heritage data is not only important to carrying out research, but it’s also central to motivating me as a researcher and helping me develop plans for future projects.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<h2>Introducing Dr. Timothy Duguid, who is working on a research portal entitled MuSO (Music Scholarship Online).</h2>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us about yourself...</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/duguid.jpg\" style=\"width: 230px; border-width: 0px; height: 222px; margin: 10px; float: left;\">I am a lecturer in digital humanities and information studies for the Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute (HATII) at the University of Glasgow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My current research interests lie in the intersection between digital humanities and historical musicology, focusing on issues surrounding the curation of digital scholarship in music, including access, metadata generation and peer review. I hold a Ph.D. in music history from the University of Edinburgh in early modern English and Scottish liturgical music, having published a monograph based on this research in 2014: <em>Metrical Psalmody in Print and Practice: English ‘Singing Psalms’ and Scottish ‘Psalm Buiks,’ c.1547-1640</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What made you apply for the Europeana Research Grant?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was aware of the Europeana Collections before I applied, having explored the contents of the Music Collection on numerous occasions. I applied for the grant because Europeana’s Music Collection is quite varied, including physical objects, musical scores, sound recordings, and other related items. Moreover, these items are aggregated alongside varying content from other disciplines. This is precisely what I envision for my research portal entitled MuSO (Music Scholarship Online). It will aggregate digital archives and collections, digitised printed scholarship, and born-digital scholarly resources in music alongside other humanities-related digital artefacts presently aggregated by the Advanced Research Consortium.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How essential is access to cultural heritage data for your research?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Access to cultural heritage data is critical for MuSO. In fact, the community surrounding this project is all dedicated to promoting greater visibility and access to music heritage artefacts and data. It is our goal that MuSO will allow scholars to discover high quality digital scholarship alongside primary musical resources and more traditionally disseminated forms of scholarship such as digitised monographs and electronic journal articles.<br><br>\r\nThe music community is reliant upon a number of digital resources to conduct scholarship, and this list continues to grow. Although not an exhaustive list, some of the relevant collections include the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), HathiTrust, International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), Library of Congress Music Treasures Consortium, Répertoire Internationale de Littérature Musicale (RILM), and Répertoire Internationale des Sources Musicales (RISM). These resources have also been valuable in identifying what data is relevant for the discovery of musical resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep watching this space to meet our other Grant Winners, we will be publishing more interviews soon!</h3>\r\n"

        body: "<h2>Introducing Nanna Thylstrup and Lene Asp, who together are mapping colonial Copenhagen.</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us about yourself...</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/lene-asp.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 220px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;\"><strong>Lene</strong><br>\r\nI’m a Danish writer, editor, journalist, and independent researcher. I am interested in Danish colonial heritage, history and trauma, as well as archive theory and artist-led research with a particular focus on digital dissemination. My background is within cultural studies, language psychology, and journalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/nanna.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 256px;\"><strong>Nanna</strong><br>\r\nI am a researcher based at the University of Copenhagen. My work centres around the media and its role and impact on everyday life. My research unites three media theoretical themes: the political stakes of building digital infrastructures, the sociality unfolding within these infrastructures, and their cultural expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What made you apply for the Europeana Research Grant? What did you know about Europeana before you applied?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lene </strong><br>\r\nI knew that digitised material from the Royal Library, the National Library of Denmark, concerning past Danish colonies was being added to the Europeana digital archive. I had interest in these materials and was encouraged to apply for the research grant by a colleague.<br><br><strong>Nanna</strong><br>\r\nI am currently writing a book on the politics of mass digitisation, and part of it is devoted to analysing the role and impact of Europeana in the landscape of digitised archives. I am therefore aware of the complex political aspects of archival digitisation, not least when it comes to colonial history. Europeana provides a good platform to foreground the Danish slave trade history, which otherwise tends to play a very small role in Denmark’s cultural memory. A project such as this will also serve to highlight how new digital portals such as Europeana actualise old colonial problematics as well as give rise to new methodological questions about colonial memory work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How has Europeana supported your research?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lene</strong><br>\r\nWithout the financial aid Europeana has generously provided, our collaborative research project Mapping Colonial Copenhagen would have been difficult to realise. It is our aim to create a digital map of Copenhagen where it is possible to trace the historical and contemporary presence of the Danish colonies in the urban landscape.<br><br><strong>Nanna</strong><br>\r\nEuropeana’s transnational platform makes it possible to work across national archives. This is particularly valuable when working with European colonial history that was – and remains – entangled across borders. But Europeana also provides a great opportunity to examine, not only in theory, but also in practice how digitisation not only opens up to new ways of working with colonial archives, and thus new modes of knowledge production, but also how they give rise to new ethical, political and methodological questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How essential is access to cultural heritage data for your research? What other sources do you rely upon?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lene</strong><br>\r\nCultural heritage data is essential for the presentation of material on the digital platform we are creating, of course we also rely on written sources, but the project itself would not be possible without access to digital material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nanna</strong><br>\r\nSince my work examines the politics of cultural mass digitisation, access to it remains essential. With access I mean not only access to the digitised object itself but also to its institutional trajectory, its metadata and its political conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep watching this space to meet our other Grant Winners, we will be publishing more interviews soon!</h3>\r\n"

As we received so many high quality proposals this was a tough selection process. We congratulate all our finalists and thank everyone for their interest in this Call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to be able to award more grants in future initiatives: keep following Europeana Research (also on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurresearch\">@EurResearch</a>) for updates!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Back in September, when the Europeana Research Grants Call was announced, we would never have imagined that in the course of the next few weeks we would be receiving a such vast number of enquiries and, later on, so many interesting proposals.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The <strong>160 research proposals received </strong>thoroughly exploited the Europeana ecosystem - collections, API, metadata, channels - and reviewing them took longer than expected. We were particularly thrilled to receive proposals from around the world, from researchers of all fields of the Humanities, Social Sciences and Information Technology</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with great pleasure therefore that we announce the <strong>long list of proposals</strong> we have selected. The final decision for the four projects which will receive an award will be made by the Europeana Research Advisory Board by the end of this week. Stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr>\n<td style=\"width:132px;height:21px;\">\r\n            <p>Aleksandra Nikolić</p>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td

        title: '“Digital Humanities are … Digital Humanities is … ??”*'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>“We don’t even know if it is plural or singular!” Prof. Gregory Crane said in his presentation at the DARIAH Winter School suggesting that Digital Humanities is still such a blurred field that needs to be defined.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>A group of junior and more senior researchers had the pleasure to meet last month in Prague in the context of a training initiative of DARIAH entitled <a href=\"http://datacite.hypotheses.org/\">“Open Data Citation for Social Sciences and Humanities”</a>. This Winter School, which lasted a week (October 24-28 2016), touched upon many more issues and topics than its title suggests. Briefly, some of these topics were Open Access, Open Data, Open Peer Review and Publishing, Data Management Plan and Persistent Identification, Open Data Publication, Platforms and Infrastructures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWhat was considered quite interesting in this training event was firstly the mixture of the participants and secondly the variety of the topics addressed. Regarding participants, DARIAH aimed in gathering ‘experts’ of different career status and fields resulting in a diverse group of Professors, PhD students, early career researchers, developers and teachers, librarians, editors and publishers who represented various European Universities, Research Centres and Libraries accordingly. Having people with different professional occupations exchanging views and experience on the issues mentioned before was quite promising for the discussions held. Apart from that, what I found extremely important was that some of the speakers tried to address social aspects of the practices held within the Humanities. Engaging the public to research work conducted within the field was considered as highly desirable but also essential and it should be highly prioritized in the academic agenda. It could be said that Open Access and Open Data are just one of the ways for enhancing the social impact of work conducted in the Humanities, but there is certainly room for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of this Winter School, I had the opportunity to present collaborative work conducted in Europeana Cloud and, more recently, Europeana Research, concerning case studies on digital content reuse. These case studies were built on potential topics with which Europeana could potentially be of most use, including investigations of current data reuse within the sector and the quality of the content itself. Topics were selected for trial using Europeana’s current content, and other potential resources, both of which were subjected to questioning: how useful was the data to them?; what tools or services could be used with it; what were the failings of the content and how might that be overcome? Focusing on two of these topics (Conflict-related Population Displacement and Children’s Literature), my presentation aimed in providing an overview of the potential research use of existing collections in Europeana, problems faced during these case studies and future suggestions for improving the use of Europeana by researchers. Europeana was frequently mentioned during the discussions as one of the leading and promising research infrastructures in the field of Humanities alongside CLARIN, DARIAH and other initiatives.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Two years ago, Research and Culture Policy makers together with Europeana and Digital Humanities Researchers created a set of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Research%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recommendations: Europeana for Research</a>. As we move away from the pilot stage of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a>, we developed an updated and streamlined set of <a href=\"http://jamdots.nl/view/204/Europeana---Recommendations-for-Research?divFallback=1\" target=\"_blank\">recommendations</a> for action:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Implement more digitisation of cultural heritage;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- enforce copyright reform to make best use of the public investment in digitisation; and</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- advocacy on benefits of Digital Humanities Research for Society.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move away from the pilot stage of Europeana Research, we now are reviewing what has been taken up and what is useful for its future and the growing field of digital humanities research from cultural heritage. We suggest an updated and streamlined set of recommendations for action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-10/research.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana for Research visual report: <a href=\"http://www.jamvisualthinking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JAM Visual Thinking</a> - Copyright: CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barriers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Science the barriers have been overcome with the <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9526-2016-INIT/en/pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Council conclusions</a> of May 2016 requiring that <a href=\"http://all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\">all scientific articles are made freely accessible</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Research and innovation provide the solutions to the social and economic challenges of the future. Open access breaks down the walls surrounding science and makes sure that society benefits as much as possible from all scientific insights. In that way, we maximise the impact of universities and knowledge institutions.” - <a href=\"http://english.eu2016.nl/documents/press-releases/2016/05/27/all-european-scientific-articles-to-be-freely-accessible-by-2020\" target=\"_blank\">Sander Dekker</a>, Junior Minister for Education, Culture and Science (the Netherlands)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>If Science can, Culture should</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers of culture and research at EU and national levels hold the key to unlock two major barriers to cultural heritage becoming fully available to researchers and society:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- More public funding for digitisation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Copyright reform (to make best use of the public investment in digitisation)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Funding of digitisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers need to make more funding available for digitisation. If supported by public and public-private funds, free access to this content should be a requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing to encourage private investment remains necessary given what still needs to be digitised: “23% of the heritage collections is digitised,” [and] about 50% still needs to be digitised”. <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu/en/surveys/core_survey_3/\" target=\"_blank\">ENUMERATE Core Survey 3, May 2015</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if the digitisation is of our public collections, policy makers should insist on the use of agreed standards for formats and metadata to deliver accessibility over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Copyright reform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy Makers need to reform copyright to allow cultural heritage institutions to digitise our heritage without the huge cost of clearing rights or any fear of litigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlocking this gate permits digitisation and therefore research on 20th century material, contributing to the understanding of our most recent cultural history. This is currently seriously hampered by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\" target=\"_blank\">lack of availability</a>. The reform should take into account that researchers need digital collections that cross borders for text and data mining purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally, cultural institutions should not create new rights. They should undertake to label their digital content with correct rights statements and guarantee permanent access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advocacy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but by no means least, our third recommendation is that policy makers, together with researchers, give the arguments why accessible, digital cultural heritage is so important to society, its ability to understand itself, and to connect Europe through its culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers and cultural heritage institutions should publish use cases of their reuse of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission is organising dialogue meetings between DG CONNECT, DG Research &amp; Innovation, Members States, Europeana (representing cultural heritage institutions), and Researchers to improve the coordination of policy and programmes for use of digital cultural heritage by Researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, DG CONNECT is asked to set new concrete priorities and targets for digitisation, using interoperability standards for permanent access and preservation of Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>This is the last in a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/mapsformakers\" target=\"_blank\">blog series</a> dedicated to maps and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire commercial creative reuse by makers. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the ages, cartographers found many ways of graphically representing spatial data: from maps (including three-dimensional maps) to atlases and globes. In addition to a static and fixed paper format, the advance of technology provided the means for <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/colloverviews/geography.html\" target=\"_blank\">cartographic resources</a> to become dynamic and interactive - helping us to better understand the Earth and beyond. In this last blog, we share our content picks related to different ways of visualizing geographic and celestial data. We hope you will have fun and find inspiration to<strong> #MakewithEuropeana</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Diagrams</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Medieval_diagram\" target=\"_blank\">Diagrams</a> were one of the earliest forms of cartography and data visualization. Based on the positions of stars and other celestial bodies, they helped navigation and exploration. Take a look below at a 16th century horoscope diagram for the day in which the world was created. It includes a world map within an astrological chart and personifications of winds. 12 triangles show symbolic scenes that represent aspects of life associated with the twelve astrological houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/9200397-bibliographicresource-3000126261319.jpeg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126261319.html?q=diagram\" target=\"_blank\">Horoscope diagram</a> from BL Royal 12 B VI, f. 1. 1500 - 1509. William Parron. The British Library. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Portolan charts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on compass directions and estimated distances observed by captains at sea, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/maps?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=%28what%3A%28portolan+OR+portulan%29+OR+title%3A%28portolan+OR+portulan%29%29&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">Portolan or portulan charts</a> also used to serve as navigation maps. First made in the 13th century, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portolan_chart\" target=\"_blank\">they were recognized for their accuracy</a>. Check out the example below from the 16th century - it shows the Atlantic Ocean and Northern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/-atlas-nautique-du-monde-dit-...-homem-lopo-btv1b55002606b.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000056054139.html?q=%28what%3A%28portolan+OR+portulan%29+OR+title%3A%28portolan+OR+portulan%29%29\" target=\"_blank\">Atlas nautique du Monde, dit atlas Miller</a>. 1519. Homem, Lopo. National Library Of France. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Planispheres</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like to observe the sky and learn about the movement of stars and of different constellations, a <a href=\"https://in-the-sky.org/planisphere/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">planisphere</a> is the way to go.

        title: '#MakewithEuropeana at Maker Faire Hannover'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 27 August 2017, Europeana took to the stage at <a href=\"https://maker-faire.de/hannover/\" target=\"_blank\">Maker Faire Hannover</a> (MFH) to show makers, researchers, and interested members of the public how they can #MakeWithEuropeana. MFH 2017 was estimated to bring together 20.000 members of the public as well as 800 makers across 170 exhibitions. It was a great location to explore makers practice and to get feedback on what Europeana has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was open to a huge diversity of maker practice - from robotics to T-shirt printing, to drone contests and mobility and transport innovations. Our presentation attracted a small and engaged audience which set the scene for an informal and open dialogue. None of the attendees had heard of Europeana before but they were curious of what our platform could bring to the makers movement. They left informed and inspired, after hearing about the wealth of content that is available for free reuse, the tools we provide to access this content and the services and opportunities we initiate to stimulate reuse. They left with their favourite images from the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/wotify-card-sets\" target=\"_blank\">Wotify maker cards</a> developed by Platoniq, designed to show the cultural wealth available on the Europeana platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation was followed by interesting discussions. One audience member reflected that Europeana’s offer fits with the open sharing culture of the makers movement, whereby makers release designs, code, etc., as open source or otherwise so others can actively use it. Consider this: if a maker converts a 2D image of a vase from Europeana into a 3D file, how can we take this back onto the Europeana platform or otherwise feature it? Not surprisingly, copyright also emerged as an important topic, particularly concerning ownership and rights after digitization (e.g. once a 3D model is made).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MFH’s other events proved thought provoking. One panel debate on <a href=\"https://maker-faire.de/vortrag/hannover/2017/youtube-makers-making-on-youtube/\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube Makers</a> was a great reminder that there are far more makers online that could ever be gathered in one space, and that digital platforms like Youtube are the way to reach them. We need to do more to venture into online communities as this could be particularly time and resource effective. On the other hand, one of the panel members openly thanked events like Maker Faire, noting that Europe still lacked the ‘physical’ side of the community that is more developed in regions like the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>We launched <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Makey?src=hash\">#Makey</a> into the stratosphere (35,000 km) yesterday from Maker Faire Hannover! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mfh17?src=hash\">#mfh17</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/makerfaire?src=hash\">#makerfaire</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/makerfaire\">@makerfaire</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RRwtvFmY9b\">pic.twitter.com/RRwtvFmY9b</a></p>— Maker Faire Hannover (@MakerFaireHann) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MakerFaireHann/status/901840224346570754\">August 27, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We’ll be continuing our Makers Pilot until the end of 2017. Read <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/maker-faire-hannover-27-august-2017\" target=\"_blank\">the slides</a> from the presentation in Hannover, have a look back at our most recent <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/mapsformakers\" target=\"_blank\">campaign dedicated to maps</a> and stay tuned to find out what our next social media campaign will be, launching in October 2017.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is the third in a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/mapsformakers\" target=\"_blank\">series of blogs</a> dedicated to maps and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire commercial creative reuse by makers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maps are historical documents and as such, objective geographical representation isn’t always their main goal. <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/21-bizarre-anthropomorphic-maps-that-turn-nations-into-1690313867\" target=\"_blank\">In the past</a>, cartography has been used as a form of political, economical or social propaganda - it served as the medium for spreading cartographers’ biases and believes. In this blog post, we direct our spotlight to maps that made use of satire, symbols and critique to disseminate their messages about the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europa Regina</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Map-like depictions of the European continent as a queen were popular in the 1500s. See a beautiful example below from the 18th century. In this map, the author recreated the idea of Europa Regina using Spain as queen’s head, Portugal as her crown and Italy as her left arm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/90402-rp-p-1921-1292.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1921_1292.html?q=Kaart+van+Europa\" target=\"_blank\">Map of Europe, colored as queen (...).</a> 1788 - 1792.

Eugene crossed the Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/assetimage2.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 475px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_OB_83_384.html?q=1702\" target=\"_blank\">Kaart van Noord-Italië</a>, ca. 1702 and Le Grand Teatre de la Guerre en Italie.

The lion symbol was included in the heraldry of most of the Netherlands provinces, representing the struggle for independence of the Seven Northern Provinces against the imperial rule of the Catholic Spanish (Habsburg) Netherlands (1568–1648).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/leo-belgicus-.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200246/BibliographicResource_3000051351310.html?q=Leo+Belgicus\" target=\"_blank\">Leo Belgicus.</a> 1967. Johan van Doetechum. VU University Amsterdam Library. CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Satirical maps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The comic map of the<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/comic-map-of-the-seat-of-war-with-entirely-new-features\" target=\"_blank\"> Seat of War</a> (1854) was inspired by the historical events of the Crimean War (1853–1856), in which Britain, France and their allies waged war against Russia. The four principal protagonists are depicted as animals: the British lion; the French imperial eagle; Turkey (the European part) as a turkey; and Russia as a bear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/comic-map-of-the-seat-...-btv1b530230320.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_2000081587057.html?q=what%3A%22Europe+--+all%C3%A9gories%22\" target=\"_blank\">Comic map of the seat of war with entirely new features.</a> 1854.

        body: "<p><em>This is the second in a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/mapsformakers\" target=\"_blank\">series of blogs</a> dedicated to maps and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire commercial creative reuse by makers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://icaci.org/mission/\" target=\"_blank\">Maps</a></strong> are formally defined as symbolised representations of known geographical reality. <strong><a href=\"http://cca-acc.org/resources/what-is-cartography/\" target=\"_blank\">Cartography</a></strong> combines science, art and technology in the map-making process. Despite its accuracy, maps have and continue to distort the presentation of the earth's surface. However, since early times scholars have produced maps in an attempt to refine their technique and guide us in activities such as land surveying, property ownership, and overseas navigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this blog post, we will highlight the work of notable early cartographers. We hope you get inspired by the outputs of these brilliant minds to <strong>#MakewithEuropeana</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Buondelmonti</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristoforo_Buondelmonti\" target=\"_blank\">Cristoforo Buondelmonti</a> (1386 - 1430) was an Italian Franciscan priest. He is recognized for his first-hand knowledge of Greece and the historical-geographic work the <em>Liber insularum Archipelagi</em> (1420). Below we feature a miniature of a map of the island of Andros, from this work. Perhaps simplistic to our eyes, in its time it led the innovation of cartography in the sketches and accompanying descriptions, and in these descriptions combining ‘information from the Greek and Latin classics’ with ‘<a href=\"https://books.google.nl/books?id=biglDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">authentic nautical, demographic and political knowledge</a>’. On Europeana you can explore more <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?page=2&amp;q=who%3A%28Christoforo+Buondelmonti%29&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">free to reuse maps</a> by Buondelmonti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/9200397-bibliographicresource-3000126276756.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 382px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126276756.html?q=who%3A%28Christoforo+Buondelmonti%29\" target=\"_blank\">Andros from BL Arundel 93, f. 141</a>.

He was part of the Dutch school of cartography in its <a href=\"http://www.oshermaps.org/exhibitions/maps-of-spain/iii-golden-age-dutch-and-flemish-cartography\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Age</a> (16th -17th centuries). Find below two beautiful maps by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=blaeu&amp;qf%5B%5D=map&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">Blaeu</a>. These historical documents used sailing ships and sea monsters to portray the continents of Asia and America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/asia-noviter-delineata-auctore-...-blaeu-willem-btv1b8592750q.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 430px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000051639214.html?q=blaeu\" target=\"_blank\">Asia noviter delineata</a>.

Willem Janszoon Blaeu. 1635. National Library Of France. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ortelius</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another cartographer that made use of sea monsters to represent nations was <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;page=4&amp;q=ortelius&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham Ortelius</a> (1527 – 1598). He was a Flemish￼ cartographer and geographer, and the creator of the first modern atlas, the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius\" target=\"_blank\">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</a></em> (Theatre of the World). In this 1587 map of Iceland you can see representations of whales and monstrous sea creatures, white bears (an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-36824156\" target=\"_blank\">unfamiliar sight</a>), and volcanic eruptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/islandia-ortelius-abraham-btv1b530404664.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 407px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000094792906.html?q=ortelius\" target=\"_blank\">Islandia</a>. Abraham Ortelius. 1587. National Library Of France. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Mercator</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most influential of map makers, the Flemish geographer, <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/maps/articles/the-map-of-the-world-in-the-20th-century\" target=\"_blank\">Gerard Mercator</a> (1512- 1594) is famous for developing a map projection in which mathematical calculations translated the 3D world onto a 2D surface. Discover a map that used Mercator’s projection below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/america-sive-india-nova-ad-...-mercator-michael-btv1b84685606.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 463px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_2000081611006.html?q=%28who%3Amercator+OR+what%3Amercator+NOT+who%3AJESCO%29\" target=\"_blank\">America sive India nova ad magnae Gerardi Mercatoris avi universalis invitationem... </a>Michael Mercator and Gerard Mercator. 1631.

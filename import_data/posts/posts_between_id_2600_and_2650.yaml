                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />‘All the world’s a stage’ - proclaimed the British poet and playwright William Shakespeare over 400 years ago, implying that everyday human life resembles a stage play. Often thought of as just a throwaway line, the famous quote encompasses an intriguing thought. What if we really did perceive the world as a stage and the people in it as actors in a play? What would this mean for museums and museum visitors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was the question partners of the Erasmus+ funded DREAM -&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;Reality and&nbsp;Educational&nbsp;Activities in Museums project asked themselves when they started collaborating in early 2021. Seven project partners from four European countries wanted to create a methodology for museum education that would allow for more engaging experiences and new forms of storytelling to be utilised by teachers and school groups. To achieve this, we would exploit practices commonly used in theater and cinema productions as well as Augmented Reality (AR) technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DREAM was a strategic partnership and a collaboration of the<a href=\"https://www.m9museum.it/en/\"> M9 District </a>, <a href=\"https://www.statigeneralinnovazione.it/en/\">Stati Generali dell’Innovazione</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ctk-rijeka.hr/en\">Center for Technical Culture Rijeka</a>, <a href=\"https://ppmhp.hr/\">Maritime and Historical Museum of the Croatian Littoral Rijeka</a>, <a href=\"https://mapadasideias.pt/\">Mapa das Ideias</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oeiras.pt/f%C3%A1brica-da-p%C3%B3lvora-de-barcarena\">Camara Municipal de Oeiras</a> and <a href=\"https://www.postimuseo.fi/en/frontpage/\">The Finnish Postal Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The stage is set</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use of drama is a common tool in museum education. With DREAM, we wanted to develop a concept that not only uses drama as a narrative device for learning, but also lets the performer plan out detailed, consistent and refined scenes and to build sets within a museum exhibition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the start this presented the team with problems to solve. For example, the use of physical sets and set pieces was not an option, as exhibition spaces tend to have spatial limitations. Most of the physical objects in museums are also out of reach as they are either in a showcase cabinet or hidden from the public as part of museum collections. Relevant objects can also be spread across multiple museum collections across Europe, and since they are physical objects, it is practically impossible to constantly transfer them from one part of the continent to another.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The solution? Digital tools and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The big questions of the DREAM project included: could AR technology be used to create digital sets and set pieces to support the actor and the performance as well as to change the physical exhibition in surprising and engaging ways? Would it help to break the limitations of physical exhibition spaces and further open museum collections, not just locally, but internationally, in a meaningful way? And most importantly, could a drama-based methodology combined with digital tools allow for more pervasive, accessible and fun learning experiences in museums? While the eventual answer to all these questions would turn out to be yes, the outcomes of the project surprised us all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AR enhanced narratives for learning</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the onset, the DREAM methodology was based on the idea of including teachers in the process of developing new narratives and creating dramatised and engaging DREAM performances for students. This means that the role of a director, actor or a scenographer is not reserved only for the museum professionals but is also accessible for teachers. The benefit is that the teachers are able to create performances to be acted out in a museum that directly supports their teaching in the classroom. Pupils can also take part in the performance or create AR elements, for example drawings, sounds or videos, that the AR technology will bring to life during the DREAM performance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To achieve all this, various elements had to be crafted during the project. The most important part was the DREAM methodology itself, which details a practical pathway to organise, implement and sustain a collaborative practice between schools and museums, with instructions for preparing and performing DREAM plays and using the digital tools provided by the project. The methodology is compiled into a <a href=\"https://dream-project.eu/results\">guidebook</a> that is available for free and can be implemented in a multitude of museums with ease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To host the digital objects that can be used as the AR elements during the performances, <a href=\"https://museums.ctk-rijeka.hr/login\">a digital platform was created</a>. The DREAM platform acts as a repository of cultural open educational resources (OERs) and forms the foundation for contemporary and future DREAM performances. During the project, each partner provided content for the platform and as such, it hosts a number of digital objects from museum collections across Europe. The platform makes it possible to use or mix digital content from other museums to support locally organized DREAM performances, so it is a collaborative, ever growing, Pan-European repository of cultural OERs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, a 40 hour long combined course was created to guide teachers and museum educators on their journey to create DREAM performances. 45 schools and 900 students across Europe were involved in testing the DREAM methodology and in creating the first AR enhanced DREAM performances. As a result, European teachers and schools created and performed over 40 DREAM performances, which in turn can be used as templates for future adaptations of the methodology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital learning is not the future, it is here already</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Feedback from teachers participating in the project proved that there is a demand for educational activities that help students to engage with learning through creative activities and digital technology. Being able to plan, create and customise your own museum experience was met with enthusiasm from both the teachers and the students as well as the staff of the museums. DREAM showed that while technology-based education does present challenges, they can be overcome with support and collaboration between schools and museums. DREAM may not have turned all the world into a stage, but it succeeded in doing that for museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DREAM methodology, combined course and all other materials are available for free for everyone to use from the <a href=\"https://www.dream-project.eu\">project website</a>, or for more information contact me (Olli Nordling) at <a href=\"mailto:olli.nordling@postimuseo.fi\">olli.nordling@postimuseo.fi</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />2023 is the Europeana Initiative’s fifth year marking women's history month in March. While we dedicate this month to celebrating women's lives and their achievements, how can we ensure that women’s historical achievements are highlighted all-year-round through our cultural heritage? Below, expert colleagues from across the cultural heritage sector answer the question - what steps can cultural heritage institutions take to acknowledge, surface and highlight women’s history in their own collections?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Find those stories’ - Europeana Foundation&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana's approach to surfacing women's history has been led by telling stories - through online exhibitions, blogs, email courses and social media storytelling. Organisations can begin this process by looking at their collections and asking the question: where are the women and what are their stories? Women have made an impact around the world and in all areas, LGBTQ+, Disability Heritage, Black History Month, Environmental and so on. Find those stories and especially those that showcase the various intersectional identities of women so all women feel heard, seen and represented,&nbsp;and match them with a format that suits. Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/seven-tips-for-digital-storytelling\">7 tips for digital storytelling</a> are a good place to start. It might be overwhelming to know where to begin if you have not taken any steps yet but starting small is better than not starting at all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Marijke Everts, Campaign Coordinator, Europeana Foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Look beyond the exhibitions’- The Women’s Museum, Norway</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Norway,<a href=\"https://kvinnemuseet.no/en\"> the Women’s Museum</a>, in collaboration with <a href=\"https://kvinnemuseet.no/en/national_network\">the Museum Network for Women’s History</a> has produced a book and an online resource called <a href=\"https://museumsverktoy.no/\">Museum tools</a> (currently only in Norwegian). These offer methods and examples of how to raise awareness of the lack of female representation in museum exhibitions and collections, including a set of tools to make it easier to include women’s history and culture in museum practices. Museum Tools is structured into three parts (test your museum, toolkit, and myth crushers) and offers a checklist so professionals working in cultural heritage institutions can easily check the gender (im)balance by counting the number of women and men, objects, texts and pictures, including how objects are placed in the museum space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we know, part of the problem with gender imbalance stems from the patriarchal museum structure that has given priority to artworks and objects that traditionally belong to the male sphere. So we need to look beyond the exhibitions to obtain gender balance. Gender equality is an administrative responsibility and management must work actively to ensure that gender balance is part of the museum’s strategic work. We also need to look at the practice of registering objects. Many objects have been made by or have belonged to a man, but perhaps used by a woman. Hence context and storytelling become important measures to give objects meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For further information, reach out to post@annomuseum.no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Hilde Herming, Curator and Museum Manager, The Women’s Museum, Norway</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Research, preserve and restore’ - Women’s History Museum of Zambia&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women’s stories, experiences and incontestable displays of strength are often the very backbones of many societies. This sentiment rings true of the many Zambian women who built the foundations on which we stand. However, there is a dearth of documented knowledge and information in mainstream historical narratives of (Zambian)&nbsp;women from the perspective of Zambian women themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our work as the <a href=\"https://www.whmzambia.org/\">Women’s History Museum of Zambia</a> is to research, preserve and restore Zambian indigenous knowledge and living histories focused on our women. This is achieved through the expansion and revision of cultural knowledge production and preservation through an array of projects which centre the agency of Zambian women in narrative construction. This means in our collections, Zambian women are not merely the research subjects but researchers and conduits of their own stories. There is a need for other cultural heritage institutions to employ similar methodologies, not just when it comes to the histories of women but the histories of any groups that have been excised out of the mainstream narratives which are being circulated and consumed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Banji Chona, Project Manager, Women’s History Museum Zambia</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>'Without documentation, no history' - Atria, institute on gender equality and women's history</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Too often, women, and especially women from marginalised groups (for example from the LGBTQI+ community, women with disabilities, women from the ‘lower class’, women of colour) remained underexposed in archives and collections all over the world. Rosa Manus, one of the founders of IAV in 1935 (now <a href=\"https://institute-genderequality.org/\">Atria</a>) said, 'without documentation, no history'. It underlines why having a diverse and representative collection is so important. Our collections determine which parts of history we pass on. Many stories have been overlooked in the past. But it is important to give everyone a voice: cultural heritage institutions like Atria want everyone to be able to recognise themselves in our collections. That’s when it becomes interesting: when we use our objects and their stories to reflect on and start conversations about current topics, our collections really come to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Marianne Boere, librarian and Bettemiek Grijns, archivist, Atria</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Previously hidden stories attract new audiences’ - Kvinnohistoriska</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All objects have some type of connection or relation to women – they concern, touch or affect women in some way – but these stories are often more rare in museum collections and exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Museum professionals need to stay curious and ask questions of their own collections and exhibitions. Can we give the audience a richer understanding of our history? What will future museum visitors understand about our society today? Whose voices will they find in our collections and archives? How can we enrich our collections with new perspectives connected to old or new objects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To those who have colleagues who don't want to prioritise this work, maybe an extra incentive could be that the previously hidden history attracts new audiences! Our most visited events and exhibitions, and the collections of stories where most people contributed, are those that unfold the least visible voices from today, and from the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Anna Tascha Larsson, Director, Kvinnohistoriska</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 was the Europeana Initiative’s annual conference which took place in 2021. As in 2020, participants at this wholly online conference - from Europe and across the world, from the Europeana Network Association and beyond, from many different professions and ranges of experience - met and were united by a shared interest in digital cultural heritage. This is the third report reflecting on the impact of Europeana’s annual conferences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 explored how the cultural heritage sector can recover, rebuild and grow in a post-pandemic world. It did so through a mix of keynote speeches, debates, social events and workshops. 70% of the programme for Europeana 2021 - over 30 sessions across three days - was co-created with cultural heritage professionals across the sector who responded to a call for proposals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the phases of the Impact Playbook methodology, we approached the impact assessment of Europeana 2021 as follows, building on past assessments conducted in 2019 and 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We identified stakeholders (beneficiaries) of the conference and prioritised two, the general attendees and speakers at the conference. We created a change pathway for both stakeholders. We wanted to measure similar aspects to past years, including network development, learning outcomes and indications that participants would make a change in their work as a result of the event. We also assessed satisfaction and captured feedback that could help shape future events Europeana delivers to support the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Post-event questionnaire</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We shared a post-event questionnaire with all attendees in November 2021, with separate questions for speakers. We had a response rate of approximately 25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the good response rate, we found a bias in the responding sample: more Network members responded to the survey than non-network members, which may increase the likelihood of positive bias (that is to say, that those with positive comments were more likely to respond or that Network members were, overall, more likely to respond). We therefore advise that the data presented in this report should be seen as optimistic reflections on the outcomes generated for conference attendees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Longitudinal questionnaire&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March/April 2022, we shared a longitudinal (follow-up) questionnaire with attendees of Europeana 2021. This was the first time we had taken such an approach to assessing the impact of the annual conferences. We received 50 responses, which represents a low response rate compared to the questionnaire shared almost immediately after the conference. However, such a response rate was not unexpected - in past impact assessments, namely our research into the impact of our national aggregation workshops for heritage institutions, we also received low response rates. Of those that responded, we also saw a bias in that more Network members responded to the survey than non-Network members. This, however, does not mean that the data are not useful. We report on them bearing in mind that they represent a small and likely active segment of our Network and sector, whose views should still be taken into account.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">1,685 people registered for Europeana 2021 from 86 countries. 49% of those who registered had never been to any Europeana event before and 53% were not Europeana Network Members. This represents significant reach and growth compared to the first all-digital conference, Europeana 2020, and the last in person conference held in Lisbon in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">For the first time, we investigated attendee participation in the conference in more detail. We learned that the majority wanted to attend live to some degree, but almost 60% (including some of those who attended live) rely on having access to the recordings. 10% only wanted to catch-up afterwards, for example, due to schedule clashes or time-zone issues. People attended for an average of 7.5 hours (just over one day).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">81% of questionnaire respondents who were not Network members reported that the conference motivated them to become a member (an increase from 69% in 2020). We found slightly higher growth in Network membership compared to the previous months, but not significant enough to suggest that the conference was a big driver of Network growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana 2021 created opportunities to strengthen and expand a professional network. More participants at Europeana 2021 report strengthening their existing network or expanding their network (48% on both counts), compared to 2020 (38% and 44% respectively). In addition, 81% of those attending feel like part of a community around digital cultural heritage (an increase from 74% in 2020). There was no growth in the median number of contacts made or contacts that attendees might collaborate with in future. Some participants also seemed uninterested in digital networking formats, noting that it is a struggle to build connections when meeting digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Satisfaction with Europeana 2021 was high. The satisfaction of general attendees was, at 86% satisfied or completely satisfied, slightly higher than participating speakers at 83%. 89% of those attending Europeana 2021 reported that the conference had value for them in some way either personally or professionally and 91% enjoyed themselves. Participants were most satisfied with the organisation of the event and the quality of the programme with few participants reporting being dissatisfied or completely dissatisfied in any of the conference aspects measured.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">80% of those who responded to the Europeana 2021 questionnaire reported gaining skills or knowledge that they can use in their work or professional setting (an increase from 77% in 2020). 72% report being inspired to change how their organisation uses digital cultural heritage and 63% report the same inspiration for change relating to open digital cultural heritage. However, only 59% report being more able to make a change in their organisation or otherwise professionally. This is similar to 2020, where 49% of participants reported feeling more able to make a change as a result of the conference. There are numerous barriers in place which may get in the way (e.g. status in an organisation). Attendees shared some feedback and recommended that the event could be more participatory, in-depth and focussed on training.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions and recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 was held completely online for the second time and there were high levels of satisfaction from both speakers and attendees. This was in spite of the online format, which, as some participants emphasised, struggles to replace face to face interaction. Nonetheless, the feeling of being part of a community around digital heritage increased from previous years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learning and capacity building outcomes increased in all instances measured. Even more participants report learning something that they could use in their work but, asin the past, report not being able to make a tangible change. Though barriers to creating change in heritage organisations exist that are beyond Europeana’s control, we should also consider prioritising programming that takes the participant beyond discussion to concrete mechanisms for change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Europeana Network Association should exploit the annual conference to drive Europeana Network Association growth - there is potential.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Europeana Network Association Members’ Council and Membership Working Group should address the relatively high figure of those who are unsure if they are Network members or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Future events should continue to try to balance interactivity and training with high-level discussion in order to lead to tangible change that participants can implement in practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We should reconsider the strategy for putting videos on Europeana Pro after the conference.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interpretations presented here will be shared with Europeana Foundation colleagues who organised the Europeana 2021 conference, with the selection committee, and with the ENA Members’ Council.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report and its recommendations for relevant groups (e.g. the ENA Membership Working Group, the Climate Action Community) will be shared directly by email, with an offer for a follow-up meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage is a bit of a misnomer. It was initially started by students, but now is a volunteer-run youth network dedicated to advancing the voice of and opportunities for youth in cultural heritage across Europe, with members of the organisation being students and young professionals alike. But what exactly does such a mission statement mean? With members spread across the continent, ESACH’s reach is far, with a number of projects around Europe. Our projects are varied - read on to discover them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The European Youth Heritage Ambassadors</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, ESACH has&nbsp;its third cohort of European Youth Heritage Ambassadors (EYHAs).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/supporting-new-professionals-the-european-heritage-youth-ambassadors-programme\">EYHA</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/post/supporting-new-professionals-the-european-heritage-youth-ambassadors-programme\">s</a>, in partnership with Europa Nostra and The European Heritage Tribune, learn about heritage challenges in various countries, connect through online and in-person meetings, present their perspectives, and can represent their peers. The focus of the programme is to highlight diverse voices from different backgrounds and grow a strong European network of cultural heritage advocates. The growing #HeritageAmbassadors family already counts on more than 30 members all over Europe and beyond. <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/ehya.html\">Find out more.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ESACH Talks</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What began in the pandemic as a way of boosting interconnectivity, ESACH Talks has now flourished into a quarterly discussion on a wide range of topics in partnership with other heritage bodies. With 2022 being the European Year of Youth, ESACH began its Talks series with a panel discussion from professionals in various youth-oriented heritage organisations. Following the same theme, the team joined forces with UNESCO for a discussion on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14juPP2A7FryZI5A_-KjEegUzW7wp78Kw/view\">illicit trafficking</a> and youth involvement, and with the Europeana Initiative to discuss current debates around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/esach-talks-may-2022-digital-transformation-and-cultural-heritage\">digital transformation</a>. ESACH talks is now bringing on new members to the team from different backgrounds to launch more interesting discussions in 2023! Our first talk in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.frh-europe.org/\">Future for Religious H</a><a href=\"http://www.frh-europe.org/\">eritage</a>&nbsp;took place last week, and more will be coming up!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ESACH Publications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on the experience of the <a href=\"https://heritagetribune.eu/esach-blog/\">ESACH Blog on the EHT</a> (European Heritage Tribune), ESACH has developed its digital publication to further enhance opportunities for young writers in the heritage field. <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/publications.html\">The ESACH Quarterly</a> draws together content submissions from ESACH members about their involvement in heritage projects, pieces of research, new practical approaches to the sector, as well as news related from our various member groups. The ESACH Quarterly, whose third issue is currently being developed, showcases the perspectives of young people in heritage and how this formulates its thinking and doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ESACH Communications: website, newsletter and social media</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ESACH’s main remit is to be the voice of youth and help youth promote their voice – that means sharing the projects and interests of young heritage professionals and enthusiasts, but also empowering young voices to amplify their own message through their desired platforms. ESACH does this through its social media channels (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ESACHspirit\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/esach_spirit/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/esach_spirit\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi-Xq75ID4NbkwLqBb-lAGA\">YouTube</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/68778252/\">Linkedin</a>) under the handle @esach_spirit. ESACH’s website also has a section on opportunities and sends a monthly newsletter to share news about its activities, partner initiatives, and messages of interest to the #CulturalHeritage community. The newsletter is available to members and non-members alike, so feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.esach.org/subscribe-to-the-newsletter.html\">subscribe</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Work 4 Culture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Work 4 Culture is a new initiative to help young people find jobs and opportunities in heritage. There is no centralised job board for heritage or cultural jobs and opportunities in Europe, with many jobs only shared by word of mouth. Work4Culture is an online Slack community where heritage professionals from around the world can network and share opportunities with each other. There are currently over 100 young professionals and job seekers on the platform, but we are actively trying to bring in employers onto the platform to create a more valuable space. Any heritage professionals are welcome, so&nbsp;<a href=\"http://workforculture.org/\">come join us!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking into the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the success of the European Year of Youth 2022, our goal for 2023 is to make sure that the contributions of youth to culture and heritage are not washed away after this important celebration. For this, we count with the support of like-minded organisations who back us up in this task, such as Europa Nostra, The Future is Heritage, the&nbsp;Future for Religious Heritage and the Europeana Initiative, amongst others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ESACH is a membership network with almost 700 members across Europe. We work hard to create quality content and opportunities for our members spread around the continent. If you are interested in joining, membership is free, and we invite you to reach out to us through <a href=\"http://www.esach.org\">www.esach.org</a> to join our network and grow opportunities for youth involvement around you.</p>\r\n"

The aim is to help each other by taking advantage of being part of such a broad network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can join the sessions with any type of questions that are relevant to you on the theme selected, from very specific to very broad. On each call, one or more members of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#steering-group\">Copyright Community Steering Group</a> will be there to moderate the discussions and share their thoughts, point you to relevant documentation or showcase examples. Others in the call might also have advice, and if not, we can try to find an answer together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In any case, please note that this will by no means constitute any legal advice. We will also aim to be joined at each session by one or more special guests who are particularly familiar with the selected theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year’s sessions are planned as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Copyright office hours on <strong>copyright basics</strong>, plus a programme overview for the year: 28 March 2023, 13:00 CET.

                body: "<h3><strong>Paul Morgenstern - Collections Engagement Team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During my time working with Europeana I had the privilege of writing my research thesis, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7278645\">‘Using Europeana Metadata to Analyse The EU’s Policy Effectiveness in Digitising European Heritage’</a>. It explored how the cultural heritage and public policy sectors can analyse their policies with new types of data to better understand how Big Data impacts their work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main skill I learnt from working with the Europeana Foundation was how to work with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7278440\">messy data </a>and data cleaning skills needed to produce good research data. This skill was a great addition to my research design and implementation skills, which I was able to refine while writing my thesis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I really enjoyed my time working for the Europeana Foundation, among helpful and kind colleagues. I think the most valuable skill I gained was how to be creative with the data; you have been given and be patient when the results don't turn out as you expected. It is in these moments that the most valuable sights might be found. My advice for anyone who is thinking of doing an internship or wants to write their thesis with the Europeana Foundation is don’t be shy to ask questions about how your time there can support other fields than classical cultural heritage research. Europeana has a lot of data that is open source, easily accessible and can be used to find interesting insights in many different research fields. So be creative and enjoy the learning process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Celina Bebenek - Service Experience Team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I completed an internship in the Service Experience Team where I conducted user research on Europeana users with disabilities. I have commenced my internship for the Europeana Foundation without much experience but the team was more interested in my ideas and enthusiasm for the role. During my internship I was asked my opinion on the current accessibility policy from day one and I was given the freedom to propose my own ideas. I attended scrum meetings and met a variety of people at the Europeana Foundation (graphic designers, developers, marketers, editors, and more). In addition to gaining a broad understanding of User Research, I also met interesting people, many of whom I am still in touch with today. Taking part in this project felt like an incredible privilege to me. Besides enhancing my career, it also provided me with an amazing learning experience as I was able to learn from the greatest experts in the EU in this field. It is especially recommended for people who are interested in social issues as the Europeana Foundation heavily invests into accessibility and making a positive impact on society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Julia Heras Moron - Collections Engagement Team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of my internship I supported the GIF IT UP competition in 2021. When I started at the Europeana Foundation, it was an opportunity for me to have access to the sector while studying in Madrid. My experience with the Collections Engagement team was amazing, and basically I had the opportunity to start contributing from day one. This helped me build confidence, which I really appreciated. I also was able to engage in one on one meetings with not only people from my team, but from different parts of the organisation. This helped me in having a better understanding of all the positions I could specialise in the future. Doing an internship at the Europeana Foundation,&nbsp; helped me to have a clear understanding of my future in the heritage sector and all the advances made in heritage digitisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Petra Sofia Guido - Data&nbsp;Publishing Services team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During my internship at Europeana Foundation I had the pleasure of working with both the Data Publishing Services (DPS)&nbsp;team, the Collections Engagement team, and others. I had the chance to interact with people from across the organisation to be involved in multiple editorial projects, including the editorial campaign for <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History Month</a> in March 2022 and the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/napoleon-and-urbanism-in-the-19th-century\">Napoleon and urbanism in the 19th century exhibition</a>. Because I also worked with the DPS team, I got the chance to experience how to interact with data, from the acquisition to the editorial output. It was an amazing experience to find out how these teams work on their own and with each other, to witness the Europeana Foundation’s inner workings and what it is like from the inside. I realised that it is a place I would like to work at, a great growth-oriented (both personal and professional) environment of like-minded people. It is a truly great thing to take care of cultural heritage, especially to make it available to people, and find different ways to make them engage with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Raul Gomez Hernandez - Collections Engagement Team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From September 2020 to May 2021, I did my internship at the Collections Engagement Team assisting the Education Manager in the coordination of European heritage educational projects. It gave me the opportunity to learn best practices for working on complex projects with several partners and work packages, and to interact with educators and heritage professionals around Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I had the chance to work with an amazing, open-minded and creative team and the wonderful community of Europeana Foundation staff that made me feel very comfortable and confident with my tasks from the beginning. They stimulated me to propose new ideas for improving audience interaction and the way we work all together. That was how I got involved in the Digital Storytelling, New Professionals and&nbsp;Impact Lite Task Forces, the Diversity and Inclusion working group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />I also had the chance to coordinate campaigns like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reinventing-beethoven\">#reinventingBeethoven</a>, create new content and editorial, and coordinate a roundtable and a workshop around digital heritage from the experience of new professionals in the <a href=\"https://oa.upm.es/70535/\">III Meeting of the European Student’s Association of Cultural Heritage (ESACH)</a> in Madrid. My time working at Europeana was very fruitful. There was no better place to start my professional career in digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ana Moreno - Service Experience Team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During my six months as Europeana’s Visual/Web Designer intern, I was able to learn a lot about different areas of my field, such as UI, UX, and graphic design. From day one I got challenging tasks that inspired me to improve my skills as a designer, while also learning the real life challenges that this sort of job implies. The experience made me more confident in my work, and also taught me valuable lessons that are important for any professional, such as time management and presentation skills. I was able to network with like-minded professionals, from interns to employees, that also shared my excitement for working in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, at the end of my internship a role came up, I applied for it, and after going through a series of interviews, I got the job. I am incredibly grateful for this experience, as it was definitely a game changer for my career.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in joining Europeana you can use Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/jobs\">vacancy </a>page to check for available internships. Applications are currently open for an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/job/internship-on-privacy-policy\">internship on privacy policy.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What do we mean by enrichments?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enrichments are data about a cultural heritage object (i.e. metadata) or of the object itself (i.e. its content) that augment or rectify the authoritative data made available by cultural heritage institutions. Enrichments of metadata aim to improve the object by producing new statements (adding new or refining existing information) about it, while content enrichments aim to produce alternative representations of the object. Enriching cultural heritage data has been attracting interest and offers a lot of potential for digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enrichments might include Object Character Recognition (OCR) of a book; the audio transcription of a speech; subtitles of a video; adding a new subject from a vocabulary to the object; correcting the name of an author; audio description of a painting; annotating a scientific article with background references; or adding collection-level metadata for an archival item.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why do we need a policy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As enrichments become more established and relevant in the common European data space for cultural heritage, we want to ensure that a clear purpose guides all of our enrichment efforts, while contributing to the objectives of the common European data space for cultural heritage and respecting the values we believe in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developing a policy that touches upon many areas, from ingestion to reuse, ensures that any enrichment effort is designed with an understanding of the dependencies and priorities in other areas, and conceived and developed collaboratively by stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A policy can provide a set of principles that guide enrichment efforts across projects, organisations and activities in the ecosystem in and around the common European data space for cultural heritage and ensure harmonisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Your input is key</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The policy should be developed collaboratively by consulting and bringing in the views, priorities and concerns of stakeholders and experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To do that, we invite you to answer an initial overarching survey that will help us gather various ideas, plans and concerns in the area of enrichments and digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will compile and share the results and where necessary set up further conversations with relevant stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>The meetings: strengthening current partnerships and creating new ones</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we enter a new and exciting phase of our work, we are revamping our Stakeholders' Engagement strategy to strengthen current partnerships and create new ones, striving for even greater impact and relevance. Over two days and as part of these efforts,&nbsp; the Europeana Foundation team met with a group of key decision-makers in Brussels with responsibilities for culture and digital cultural heritage. This included Sabine Verheyen, Chair of the <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/cult/home/highlights\">European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education</a>; Lauriane Bertrand, Member of Cabinet of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/gabriel_en\">European Commissioner in charge of Culture Mariya Gabriel</a>; Irene Norsted, Director of the People Directorate at the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/departments-and-executive-agencies/research-and-innovation_en\">Directorate General for Research and Innovation</a>, as well as representatives of the ongoing <a href=\"https://swedish-presidency.consilium.europa.eu/\">Swedish Presidency of the EU</a>, notably Åsa Garnert, in charge of Strategic Coordination, and Cultural Counsellors David Ek and Tobias Adolfsson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the inspiring talks, we exchanged views on the opportunities and challenges opened up by the common European data space for cultural heritage, as well as shared issues concerning the digital transformation of our sector: where we stand, what we aspire to achieve and how we can work together to progress. More broadly, discussions revolved around the contribution of culture to a healthier and more inclusive digital public sphere in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The wider picture: living up to Europe’s digital policy momentum&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Union recognises that Europe needs more than digital infrastructures, skills and capabilities to define its digital future. There must also be a fair and secure digital environment, <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-declaration-digital-rights-and-principles\">based on EU principles and fundamental rights</a>. This vision paves the way for a true ‘European way’ ’in the global digital landscape - one that is founded on the values we hold dear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative applauds this strategic direction, with the 14 Data spaces launched by the European Commission - including the common European data space for cultural heritage - as a key element in this pursuit. Through the data spaces, Europe takes the lead in creating open, safe, and trustworthy digital infrastructures in which data owners - not platform owners - come together to design a new way of working, collaboratively devising how they will control the information they share and how they will allow it to be used.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A data space dedicated to our sector offers a unique opportunity for the heritage world to contribute to shaping Europe's digital future in the way we imagine it: one with values, people and culture at its core. It is also a chance for Europe to take a leap forward in terms of democratising access to culture as an enabler of more open and inclusive societies and of a sustainable future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Living up to this digital policy momentum will require a common vision and joint commitment by all actors involved - from EU institutions and Member States to the cultural heritage sector and the Europeana Initiative, its partners and network, as we steward the common European data space for cultural heritage. The series of meetings between the Europeana Foundation and EU decision-makers in late February provided an opportunity to align views, discuss challenges and possibilities ahead, and set a common ground for future action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Connecting the dots and creating a common narrative</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In a rapidly evolving landscape, we acknowledge that the Europeana Initiative and the common European data space for cultural heritage are part of a much broader ecosystem. As we welcome an unprecedented investment by the European Union in the digital transformation of our sector - through<a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en\"> Horizon Europe,</a> <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\">Digital Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://culture.ec.europa.eu/creative-europe\">Creative Europe</a> and other funding programmes - we will collaborate more than ever with other initiatives and actors dedicated to societal change via digital cultural heritage. Together, we must ensure complementarities, maximise impact and make sure our collective efforts are well known to and seized by the cultural heritage ecosystem.

Introduction&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative builds on a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">network of national, thematic and domain aggregators</a> which enable cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) to share their content with Europeana and open it up to new audiences. Aggregators work with thousands of cultural institutions and collectors to gather authentic, trustworthy and robust data and provide it to Europeana, and from there to education and research infrastructures, creatives, developers and the general public. As an important source of expertise, aggregators offer advice and support in digitisation, content description, metadata mapping, licensing, media formats accessibility, multilingualism and domain and subject vocabularies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) coordinates all activities required for the effective functioning of a pan-European, cross-domain aggregation ecosystem at operational and strategic level. At operational level, accredited aggregators ensure the development and uptake of standards and frameworks and have an active role in shaping the aggregation process and outcomes. At a strategic level, we function as an advocacy body for pan-European aggregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, we collaborate closely with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">Europeana Network Association (ENA)</a>, and together with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation (EF)</a>, we work towards the overall strengthening of the Europeana initiative.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As one of the three pillars of the Europeana Initiative, the EAF contributes to the implementation of the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\"> Europeana strategic plan 2020-2025</a>, and the deployment of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2021, the European Commission has published the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade\">Digital Decade</a> and the <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en\">Data Strategy</a>&nbsp; putting the user at the core of its digital policies and fostering the creation of common European data spaces. The Commission’s DG Connect stated that the Europeana initiative will be at the heart of the common European data space for cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>2. Main areas of activity</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Common European data space for cultural heritage&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In early 2022, members of the Europeana Initiative participated in workshops and meetings to define the vision for the common European data space for cultural heritage. Aggregators took part in these workshops. In June 2022, the EAF also contributed and reviewed the final proposal for the tender supporting the deployment of the common European data space for cultural heritage</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2022, the consortium led by the Europeana Foundation, in collaboration with 18 partners from nine EU countries, and supported by the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and Europeana Network Association, won that tender. In the coming years, the data space will fundamentally change the world of digital cultural heritage as we know it. The role of the EAF, together with ENA and EF is to develop a vision and a strategy for this data space and its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-space-deployment\">deployment</a>. In 2022, the EF organised workshops for aggregators on the common European data space for cultural heritage, we discussed it in EAF meetings, and it was the driving force behind the organisation of two EAF outreach events. While the concept of the data space still needs to be refined, the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-proposes-common-european-data-space-cultural-heritage#:~:text=What%20Will%20Be%20The%20Data%20Space?\">EC Recommendation</a> related to the common European data space for cultural heritage has defined some clear objectives, such as to increase the amount of high quality content available through the Europeana website, in particular 3D content by 2030. Aggregators and CHIs play a crucial role here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Conference held within the French Presidency</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In collaboration with Mobilier National and the French Ministry of Culture, and under the auspices of the French Presidency of the Council, Europeana organised an online <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/building-the-common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage-together\">conference</a> on 1 March 2022 (09:00-16:30 CET). The conference 'Building the common European data space for cultural heritage together: The role of Europeana, content aggregation and strategic frameworks' explored&nbsp;the creation of the data space for cultural heritage. It took place in the context of the European Commission’s Recommendation 2021/1970 of 10 November 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Around 400 people participated in the conference, including members of&nbsp; the European Commission’s Expert Group on a common European data space for cultural heritage (CEDCHE), delegates from the French Ministry and French cultural heritage institutions, aggregators and other professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the first time, this presidency event was completely public and open to aggregators as aggregation was one of the key elements that was discussed in the perspective of the common European data space for cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>Accreditation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF has an established accreditation process in order to accept new members. New applications for accreditation are evaluated by the EAF Steering Group and approved by the General Assembly of the EAF during the two EAF meetings in spring and autumn of each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No new aggregator has received accreditation in 2022, but we see a number of new aggregators emerging. Arts Council Norway has finalised the process to bring back the data from Norwegian museums via the DigitalMuseum infrastructure. Slovakiana and Catalònica have made good progress to establish infrastructure and processes to deliver data to Europeana. With the impulse of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-proposes-common-european-data-space-cultural-heritage#:~:text=What%20Will%20Be%20The%20Data%20Space?\">EC Recommendation</a> and the funding possibilities from the Resilience and Recovery Facility, some new aggregators are in the making. These promising activities should lead to a growth of the EAF over the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Steering Group meetings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF Steering Group aims to meet about once a month and has held a total of 10 meetings in 2022. These meetings saw the preparation of the bi-annual EAF meetings and the preparation of the two EAF outreach events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Initiative wide aspects have also been dealt with during Steering Group meetings, including the alignment of activities with the ENA Management Board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Members of the Steering Group are Marie-Véronique Leroi (Chair), Kerstin Herlt (Vice-Chair), Nicole Emmenegger and Henning Scholz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF meetings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF held its spring meeting on 4 - 5 April in collaboration with EF and the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. It was a hybrid event with 32 participants (including EF staff) attending the event in Hilversum and 55 colleagues joining online. Out of the 40 accredited aggregators, 35 were represented with one or more colleagues during the meeting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On day one, we had the EAF General Assembly, followed by a session on making Out-of-commerce Works available online. We had updates from the Aggregators’ User Group, the Digital Transformation Task Force and the Enumerate Survey. Participants also discussed how the EAF and its members can support CHIs in Ukraine. Day two was focussed entirely on the development of the common European data space for cultural heritage and the role of the EAF. In a series of workshops, we discussed different scenarios for how aggregators can contribute to its development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 18-19 October, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) got together for a hybrid meeting to celebrate its 10th anniversary. In total, 56 aggregator representatives joined the meeting, 19 of them in the EF office in the National Library of The Netherlands. 31 out of the 40 accredited aggregators attended and contributed to the meeting. The core topic was the development of the common European data space for cultural heritage, in order to raise awareness of the EC recommendation and discuss needs and next steps for aggregators. In that context we also focussed on concrete outcomes of the implementation plan that have an impact for the work of the aggregators, e.g. working with the Metis Sandbox and developing dissemination activities for data and content. Since work has been done on diversity, equity and inclusion by DSI aggregators last year, the EAF meeting provided the stage to also share the Recommendations for identifying and managing diversity in cultural heritage data with national aggregators and start the discussion on this important topic on the EAF level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF outreach events</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022 we started a series of outreach events, for aggregators to engage with the cultural heritage sector, the European Commission and important stakeholders. The first outreach event took place on 11 July 2022 and it was held online. The purpose of the outreach event was to raise the visibility of aggregators and the aggregation workflow, and to consider the challenges and opportunities regarding aggregation in the context of the data space. With this event, the EAF went back to the basics of aggregation in terms of technical processes and organisation. The agenda and more information are available on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/eaf-outreach-event\">Europeana Pro</a>. This first introductory event was open to all stakeholders involved in the Europeana Initiative and the upcoming common European data space for cultural heritage. We had 129 participants from 34 countries (including 23 EU Member States) across all stakeholders and concluded with a satisfaction rate of 84% with the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the following four events we plan to introduce the main phases that are essential for content and data aggregation. At the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/eaf-outreach-event-december2022\">second outreach event on 15 December</a>, we invited aggregators to share their experiences in collecting new content and maintaining data up-to-date; we also discussed how established processes and workflows might change in the context of the common European data space for cultural heritage. We had 92 participants across all the stakeholders and concluded with a satisfaction rate of 70% with the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For both events, the EAF Steering Group invited representatives from DG Connect to introduce the EU’s digital policy for cultural heritage and to answer questions from the audience on the data space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Task Forces and Working Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Aggregators User Group</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Aggregators’ User Group was set up in 2020 to provide and channel feedback to the EF on its range of products (including the Europeana website, Metis and the Europeana Pro website). The group met seven times in 2022. The agenda included: multilinguality, the development of the aggregation strategy, the development of the entity flow feature of the Europeana website, and the further development of Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Data Quality Committee</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee (DQC)</a> is a EuropeanaTech working group, where the EAF is represented by a number of active members. It is a standing committee that works on the various facets of data quality with a particular focus on reuse and discovery of cultural heritage objects. Over the course of last year, it contributed, for example, to the work on problem patterns and the requirements to implement more detailed data quality reports to the Metis Sandbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>IIIF and Europeana Working Group</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/iiif-europeana-working-group\">IIIF and Europeana Working Group</a> was first proposed at the autumn 2019 EAF meeting and started work in 2020 with a series of training workshops. In 2022, the working group organised a training session for aggregators to get started with IIIF and prepared <a href=\"https://training.iiif.io/europeana/\">training materials</a>. The goal of the training was for people to create a IIIF manifest and an EDM record, and to preview the result in the Metis Sandbox. The working group has reviewed its membership and now consolidated on a group that will focus on another training session to support aggregators scaling the work with IIIF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Libraries Working Group</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The idea to set up a Libraries Working Group (LWG) under the EAF was proposed in 2020. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/libraries-working-group\">LWG was launched in May 2022</a> to support (national) libraries to engage with the Europeana Initiative. Since then, we have started to engage with several libraries, but tangible results of this are not available. After the end of The European Library, it still takes some time for the libraries to focus on a new relationship with the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>SOLID-based Decentralised Aggregation Task Force</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/solid-based-decentralised-aggregation-task-force\">Task Force</a> (run by the EAF) studies the feasibility of moving forward to decentralised (e.g. SOLID-based) aggregation. It will look at technological alternatives to decentralisation and the issues accompanying a possible transition to a new form of aggregation especially in terms of governance and organisation. This Task Force is complementary to the Linked Data Task Force led within the ENA EuropeanaTech community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Digital Transformation Task Force</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2021 the Europeana Initiative set up a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/digital-transformation-task-force\">Digital Transformation Task Force</a>. The Task Force ran until March 2022 with an aim to build capacity for digital transformation, and produced an action plan as a unified approach for adoption across Europeana Initiative stakeholders. Kerstin Arnold and Chiara Latronico represented the EAF on this Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Diversity and inclusion Task Force and DSI aggregator’s working group</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/diversity-and-inclusion-task-force\">Diversity and Inclusion Task Force</a>, active throughout 2022, developed and managed a consultation on behalf of the Europeana Initiative to address diversity and inclusion across its operation. It was a joint Task Force from the EF, the ENA and the EAF. Valentina Bachi and Julia Welter represented the EAF on this Task Force.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the context of the DSI-4 project, the Aggregators Working Group (WG) with participants from EUScreen (NISV), European Film Gateway (DFF), Photoconsortium, MUSEU (MCA), OpenUp! (AIT-Graz), Archives Portal Europe (APEF), European Fashion Heritage Association (EFHA) and Europeana Sounds (BL) explored this theme and the&nbsp; specific challenges related to aggregation and working with content providers. The group concluded their work in August 2022 and&nbsp;produced a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DOuJ04K-jZvp38Z546UkZ0RSwP9c9Adh21gn60mMXAs/edit\">Case studies report</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vC2tFgg6SCZeHidZNroHoGWMrrIwQDTY3Cmb2a9xro8/edit\">Recommendations on “Identifying and managing diversity in cultural heritage data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF collaboration with ENA and the Europeana Foundation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Joint meetings</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The three Europeana Initiative pillars have been regularly working together to make sure their priorities and actions are aligned and carried out in a concerted effort. Throughout 2022, representatives of the EAF Steering Group, the EF senior management team and the ENA Management Board met on a monthly basis to discuss issues of common interest and strategic importance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>EAF’s role in cross-Europeana Initiative Task Forces and Working Groups</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The closer alignment of the three Initiative pillars is also reflected in the launch of several cross-Initiative Task Forces, which allow us to optimise performance and our individual and collective actions across the Initiative (see above).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/supporting-the-digital-cultural-heritage-of-ukraine-working-group\">supporting the digital cultural heritage of Ukraine Working Group</a> aims to support existing initiatives and develop new, concerted actions that respond to the current needs of the Ukrainian digital heritage sector. It is a joint Working Group from the Europeana Initiative and Hélène Bergès, Maria Carlsson, Tetiana Kysla, Margret Plank, Corinne Szteinsznaider are active EAF members in this working group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Capacity Building Working Group was <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/capacity-building-working-group\">founded at the end of 2022</a> and aims to support the implementation of a capacity building working plan for the common European data space for cultural heritage. Kerstin Arnold, Valentina Bachi, Antonella Fresa and Tom Miles represent the EAF in this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Involvement of the EAF Steering Group in EF and Initiative actions</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Corinne Szteinsznaider from MUSEU represented the EAF on the Selection and the Programme Committee for the 2022 Europeana Conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EAF Communication</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EAF continues to use Basecamp for communication towards and between its members, including separate groups for aggregators who are part of the DSI and the data space consortium. We continue to share public news relevant to aggregators through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/aggregators-forum\">Europeana Pro</a>, in the ENA newsletter and, where relevant, through social media messages. More targeted messages are sent to promote events and news of interest to aggregators such as announcing new accreditations or funding opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interviews with Aggregators</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In November 2022, the Steering Group started conducting interviews with all 40 aggregators, to gain a better understanding of topics like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">what was the motivation to become an aggregator for Europeana;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">how aggregators are organised in terms of staff and budget;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">what kind of services they provide, or would like to develop further;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">what are the data quality and data management procedures aggregators have developed on their side and&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">whether they have any questions regarding the common data space for cultural heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interviews will be continued in 2023 and summarised in a final internal report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outlook to 2023</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>EAF Steering Group elections</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In February 2023, we will run elections to fill two vacancies in the Steering Group. Nicole Emmenegger stepped down to enter a new phase in her professional development, and the three year term for Kerstin Herlt is coming to an end in April 2023. Four EAF members have submitted their candidacies, elections will take place between 8 and 15 February.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Events and meetings</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023 we again plan to have a spring and autumn meeting of the EAF. The spring edition will take place online on 4 - 5 April. The autumn edition will take place as a hybrid event, with the physical part in Budapest from 2 - 3 November. It will be organised in collaboration with the Hungarian Aggregators’ Forum, which is an alliance of all of the Hungarian aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will also organise two more EAF outreach events. The third event in this event series will be on 15 June and will focus on data processing; the fourth event in the series will be on 23 November and will focus on data publication.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Europeana’s<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\"> ‘Built with Bits’ programme</a> invited students and educators to combine collaborative learning experiences and digital technologies with the values of accessibility, inclusivity and sustainability at the heart of the New European Bauhaus movement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second iteration of the programme took place in late 2022 and early 2023. The winner of the ‘Beyond Borders’ project was Dr. Emma Duester, Lecturer at RMIT University Vietnam School of Communication &amp; Design, in collaboration with Mr. Ondris Pui Lecturer at RMIT University Vietnam School of Communication &amp; Design and Ms. Michal Teague Lecturer at RMIT University Vietnam School of Communication &amp; Design. Hear about their project below!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Congratulations on your success in Built with Bits! Can you tell us about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.rmit.edu.vn/\">RMIT University Vietnam</a> is an Australian university in Vietnam. We work in the school of communication and design. We worked with the <a href=\"https://baotangphunu.org.vn/en/home/\">Vietnamese Women’s Museum</a> for this project, which is a national museum in the capital city of Hanoi. Their mission is to raise awareness of women's history and contemporary life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I put in the proposal because I wanted to raise awareness internationally about the lack of online resources around Vietnamese culture,which our research project aims to achieve. I thought that the Built with Bits initiative would be a suitable outcome for our project in that we could produce an accessible virtual exhibition of part of Vietnamese culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about your winning entry!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Vietnam, the areca nut and the betel leaf are such important symbols of love and marriage that in Vietnamese the phrase ‘matters of betel and areca’ (chuyện trầu cau) is synonymous with marriage. Areca nut chewing starts the talk between the groom's parents and the bride's parents about the young couple's marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the project, we went through a process of digitising a betel nut collection. We started by photographing the artefacts and then used free software to stitch the photographs together. We then uploaded these onto Sketchfab, a free hosting platform. We then converted them for the Mozilla hubs platform. We arranged them in a culturally relevant environment as well, including silhouettes for scale, maps and information around the 3D models. The virtual exhibition includes 10&nbsp;3D models. You can walk around and play with the models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As a University, why did you want to partner with a cultural heritage institution - the Vietnamese Women’s Museum - for this project?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think it is important to raise awareness about women's history and contemporary life. There are not many specifically womens museums, which makes it a rare but important case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the value of using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important and valuable for Vietnamese students to see their own culture represented in class rather than only using resources from abroad. It allows students to see and use cultural heritage in class in a relevant way, using new digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>With March marking Women’s History Month, what steps do you think that cultural heritage institutions can take to acknowledge, surface and highlight women’s history in their own collections?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They could highlight certain pieces that respond to this theme. I went to an exhibition recently about ‘women through history’, which brought together paintings by women artists through history, highlighting their contributions.</p>\r\n"

We discussed the importance of good, open and interoperable data, particularly around reuse; how self-assessment can help us improve digital strategies and organisational practices; and how more holistic indicators might help us not only monitor progress but also design for more impact, helping heritage institutions to improve the lives and wellbeing of Europe’s citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital transformation is a key element in the data spaces initiative, which aims to create ‘a genuine single market for data, open to data from across the world’ (A European Strategy for data, 2022). We want to be able to use more holistic data collected about digital cultural heritage and its reuse to paint the current picture of the digital transformation of the sector. In doing so, we gain insight into what issues our sector faces and how these might be addressed in and through the data space. This ‘baseline’ will also help us measure and assess progress - and our impact - as we move into the cultural heritage data space. Key to this are participatory, or bottom-up, methodologies where digitisation activities are planned with, by, and for the communities who have a vested interest in their existence and reuse. We discussed various data gathering activities taking place throughout Europe and internationally, the positive outcomes they generated, and how data gathering can help support participatory practices and the digital transformation process.</p>\r\n"

To make this happen we need data in the data space, and not only the data that make up the digital collections themselves, like the metadata (data about digital collections), but also:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Survey data (data directly from those delivering digital transformation, including digital collections, and users and beneficiaries);</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Auxiliary data (data from secondary sources about the cultural sector and its audiences, e.g. economic data and national datasets);&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opis-2022-0129/html?lang=en\">Paradata</a> (e.g. data about how digital collections were created, or data about how surveys were run); and&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Passive data (such as digital activity/behavioural data that show us how collections are being used/re-used).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We already know why the data are important. Data gathered from cultural organisations about their current practices in digitisation and digital collections work can help us to measure and assess where capacity building activities might be targeted, or where potential sources of untapped data lie. Data collected on types of digital objects and digitisation can inform new strategies and help us track progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, in the coming years of the data space, there will be a strong focus on increasing the number of 3D digital collections items available through the Europeana website. Success in this area depends on various factors such as the uptake of 3D digitisation in the sector and the availability of 3D digital collections. Data we collect from audiences can tell us what kind of 3D objects people need and how they might use them, as well as helping us to assess their impact. In the upcoming conference under the Swedish presidency, on accelerating 3D in the common European data space for cultural heritage: why 3D matters?, this theme will be explored in more detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The search for more holistic indicators of digital transformation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The existence and quantity of digital collections have long been considered a major indicator of the digital transformation of the sector. But what other indicators are there, and how can we better understand the impact of our actions?</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Painting the picture of digital transformation in partnership</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The discussion at the symposium highlighted current challenges around collecting data. This includes, for example, the difficulty of sharing data between organisations or Member States, or a lack of interoperable measurements/indicators meaning that data cannot be easily compared between datasets. There are potential difficulties gathering or sharing data in specific countries or domains. All of this means that currently our ‘picture’ of the sector lacks crucial detail and perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interoperability will be a key tenet of the common data space. We can use this focus as a catalyst to work towards having an open dialogue and shared space for cultural heritage data of all types. Working together with more holistic indicators, which can be agreed upon by stakeholders across Europe, will enable us to ‘speak the same language’ of data. There is a compelling need to establish best practices and collaborate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Partnership across countries and initiatives is needed to design holistic indicators and to collect better data more sustainably. Cultural organisations can monitor and report on indicators that help measure their impact. But we must ensure that we give value back to those from whom we collect the data. Data should be collected ethically, with full informed consent, and presented anonymously for the mutual benefit of us all. Sharing these data more widely, and making it available for local, national and international comparison and learning, can help us understand and demonstrate the value of digital cultural heritage for its users and in our society. By knowing more about the impact of our work, we can learn and improve, and create more impact in the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this way, sharing is caring. If we get this right, we can paint a more detailed picture in all its richness, from which we can learn and create meaning for our audiences, the people of Europe, and the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is only the beginning of the conversation. We collected feedback from the audience about the types of indicators they think should be measured in a more holistic approach to measuring digital transformation in the data space. We did so as part of our longer term commitment to further improving the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Europeana Impact Framework</a> and the ENUMERATE Self-Assessment Tool. You can download the results from the interactive components of the symposium below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to get more involved in this journey, for example, as an academic institution or partnership, as a heritage institution, or a professional working in a Member States ministry interested in measuring your digital transformation and its impact, or other topics of relevance in the cultural sector, explore our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Impact Framework</a>, or contact us via <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">impact@europeana.eu</a>. Europeana Network Association Members are frequently the first to know about our progress, so <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">join us</a> and get involved!</p>\r\n"

It ended seven years of work leading the consortium to deliver the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure and saw us mature into stewards of the common European data space for cultural heritage.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Europeana Foundation - on behalf of the Europeana Initiative and as steward of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a> - was invited to contribute to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/a-cloud-for-all\">A Cloud for all</a>&nbsp;event organised by the European Commission on 15 March 2023. The event took place online and aimed to kick off the formation of a community of practice for the future European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage, addressing challenges, expectations and opportunities. The Collaborative Cloud - funded under the <a href=\"https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en\">Horizon Europe</a> Programme of the EU - will be a digital workspace for cultural heritage professionals, researchers and scientists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the event, Europeana Foundation’s Sebastiaan ter Burg, Knowledge Development Specialist, Ariadna Matas, Policy Advisor, and Alba Irollo, Research Coordinator shared their experience of capacity building, collaboration in the management of copyright and open policies, and building a community of practice for and with users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Talking collaboration: distinct remits, a common goal&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The common European data space for cultural heritage will be the main access point to cultural heritage data with a focus on reuse and discovery purposes within and across sectors. As called for in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-data-strategy_en\">European Data Strategy</a>, it will interact with the other 13 interconnected data spaces, pooling European data in key sectors. The Cloud will be a workspace for heritage professionals and scientists to access advanced technologies for cultural heritage preservation, conservation, and restoration purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As custodians of different kinds of cultural heritage data, and with distinct missions and target audiences, the data space and the future Cloud can support each other for mutual benefit. This was a key message put forward by Europeana Foundation colleagues during the ‘A Cloud for All’ event in mid-March. How precisely do we envisage this cooperation? Here are three concrete ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Through community and capacity building</strong>: the Europeana Initiative has a well-established network that can play a role in connecting the future Cloud to heritage professionals. Think of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators' Forum</a>, which acts as a direct intermediary with cultural heritage institutions, or the Europeana Network Association's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Research</a>&nbsp;communities, also well-placed to build these bridges. Conversely, the future Cloud will support the Europeana Initiative and the data space in reaching out to heritage professionals that are not yet part of our communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>By exchanging data</strong>: content and metadata relating to digitised cultural heritage objects from the data space can be used by the Cloud as source material for its research activities, while content, research outputs and data produced in the Cloud can be used by the data space. Together, we should ensure data is shared on the basis of common principles, including FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Using interoperable frameworks and standards</strong>: Europeana’s frameworks - in particular on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Licensing</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Publishing</a> - can underpin the work of the Cloud to ensure the implementation of digitisation and rights management standards that support interoperability, re-use&nbsp; and openness.

                body: "<p>Our mission as the <a href=\"https://www.whmzambia.org/about\">Women’s History Museum of Zambia</a> is to research, preserve and restore African indigenous knowledge and living histories focused on women. We introduce new cultural and historical knowledge through demystifying, popularising and functionalising indigenous knowledge (putting it into action in everyday contexts); and by setting an agenda for how African history on women is learned, consumed and functionalised. We use both digital and physical frameworks to reorient and decolonise the fragments of Zambian history focused on empowering women’s narratives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In line with our mission to cultivate cultural heritage preservation, in 2021, the Women’s History Museum and <a href=\"https://www.varldskulturmuseerna.se/en/#\">The National Museums of World Cultures in Sweden</a> joined forces to bring to life a collaborative project entitled&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/sharedhistories\">Shared Histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shared Histories is a collaborative digital platform centred around cultural object repatriation through digital means. It works to address the gap in cultural knowledge by providing and increasing accessibility to Zambian cultural objects which have, over centuries, found their way outside of their communities of origin and thus have been inaccessible to most. The experiences and contributions of owners of heritage and objects have been erased from the mainstream socio-economic and cultural history in Zambia as a result of the country’s colonial legacy and post-colonial tensions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the heart of the project is the goal to connect Zambian artists and the general Zambian population to Zambian historical artefacts and artwork held by the museum in Sweden. The museum currently holds 800 objects and artefacts collected over a period of 100 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Effects of colonialism</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our current sociocultural climate, Pan-African Consciousness is becoming more widespread across the continent. This sense of consciousness permeates across many frameworks of ideology and action. One such ideology is reclamation; the conscious act of revisiting, reframing and reabsorbing a particular way of thinking or being; a culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To this end, digital platforms are shifting the paradigm of identity and correcting historical asymmetries as they allow African people to be custodians of their own histories. Digital platforms and African communities in cyberspace reclaim agency by assuming the active role of the researcher or the archiver, in contrast to previously being the passive research subject or topic of archives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zambia was first subject to imperial conquest in 1888 when the British South Africa company secured mineral rights in the area. It subsequently became a British protectorate in 1899. Throughout our tumultuous colonial history, we have been a casualty in the displacement of artefacts, distortion of culture and the dilution of records by many imperialist missionaries and traders. The fabric of Zambian cultural identity has been hijacked, stolen and demonised. External intervention has created and continued to perpetuate disillusionment and a lack of understanding of the Zambian collective and the Zambian self. Zambia's identity has become muddied and fragmented. The lack of understanding could additionally be attributed to socio-economic problems, lack of infrastructure and the plaguing effects of neo-colonialism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the rise of the digital era has helped to combat the lack of access to our histories and the instability and fracture in identity (especially within the younger generations), as digital frameworks foster African people regaining the keys to their cultural background. There is an urge to reclaim artefacts and champion communities within these histories who were disenfranchised and disregarded due to one tracked systems of knowledge production.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is on this note that The Women's History Museum of Zambia assumed the position as a catalyst for change within the continent. We intend to continually shift the spaces of storytelling, identity and subsequently nation building through our institutional frameworks. Our research-driven projects actively combat the lack of awareness of these histories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital restoration&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use of digital frameworks has brought a unity grounded in the accessibility of the internet and social media channels, which connect the African diaspora to a closeness never achieved before. Over the last couple of years, Africa has been subject to the most exponential growth rates in internet penetration and therefore in the use of the internet. Statistics given in a <a href=\"https://wearesocial.com/uk/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018/\">report collated by We are Social</a>, show that the number of internet users across the continent saw an increase of more than 20% in 2018. The number of people with access to the internet in Mali increased sixfold since January 2017 and doubled in countries like Mozambique, Benin and Sierra Leone (S. Kemp, 2022).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The increase in rates of internet penetration on the continent can be attributed to diverse technological trends, initiatives and developments, for example, the continued cost reduction in computing and communication capabilities and access to cheap smartphones and mobile data. This being said, it is crucial to acknowledge the existing gaps which are still present within the use of digital frameworks as decolonial tools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A planned extension of the Shared Histories project is the facilitation of technology literacy workshops in remote areas of the country, which can be said to have high concentrations of relevant living histories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Imagining the future&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As The Women’s History Museum of Zambia we imagine a future of equity and one of&nbsp;a rejuvenated sense of collective and individual identities, without the overbearing sense of external intervention. A future of Zambian histories written by Zambian people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you wish to empower our projects and further enrich the cultural understanding of Zambian history within our communities, <a href=\"https://www.whmzambia.org/donate\">please donate</a>.

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My profession is teaching, specifically history and language. I am strongly connected to immaterial and material culture, approaching the past and the present through language, literature, art, heritage, monuments and museums, artifacts and tradition, archives and music, storytelling and films. There are a lot of teachers in my family and I have loved teaching since I was a student. I have been a secondary education teacher, a teacher trainer and occasionally a post-secondary education lecturer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently I work as a member of the Directory Board of the Association for History Education in Greece. I have just been re-elected as president for my second term. At the moment, we are implementing two big projects, alongside various small scale ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, we are working with selected schools in underprivileged areas in Athens, alongside the University of Patras (specifically the Department of History and Neaniko Plano Creative Group for Audiovisual Communication and Expression of Young People). We are exploring innovative history teaching through the creation of short films based on local history, heritage and oral testimonies. With this, we hope to build a bigger and more inclusive picture of history. This is a three step project, which includes online seminars for participating teachers; the production of supportive educational material; the creation of a website; workshops on filming for the pupils; and the production of short films on special topics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our second project takes place on a European scale. We are cooperating with museums, civil society organisations and universities, using oral testimonies, storytelling and filming of historical sites to explore a special topic. This has just kicked off and the subject and partners are amazing and passionate!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also feel like mentioning a smaller project, for which we are preparing a publication on new and innovative approaches to ancient history teaching. We are deconstructing national myths and using a fresh approach to archaeology in schools - which includes graphic novels! - to approach special and controversial topics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of your favourite elements of your role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of my role, I coordinate and organise events, seminars, publications and projects. My favorite element of this is finding the right partners, ensuring that they share the vision and passion for a better historical and cultural education, and inspiring teachers to use the means and resources that an organisation such as Europeana offers. I also enjoy trying to implement the new materials in class!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My previous experience as a board member of the Euroclio Association helped me to understand that international cooperation and new means of enhancing educational approaches are very important, and an asset to teachers who are struggling with strict descriptive curricula and centralised educational systems. The wealth of Europeana’s collections and projects must be disseminated to as many teachers as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I plan to cooperate with all colleagues and members to improve inclusion, innovation, multiperspective and alternative history, and cultural and heritage education in schools. I believe that this is strongly connected with cultivating historical consciousness, active citizenship and responsibility to young people - something that we desperately need at the moment, while populist and far right political parties seem to gain power in politics. Education is more important than ever in a digital environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This hybrid conference, which will take place on 18 April 2023, is hosted by the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm and is <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-europeana-conference-under-the-swedish-presidency-of-the-council-of-the-eu\">open to the public </a>online. It is made possible thanks to the support of the Swedish Ministry of Culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference will focus on 3D, exploring three-dimensional digitisation of cultural heritage as one of the main aspects of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a> - a flagship initiative of the European Union to support the digital transformation of the heritage sector. The Europeana Initiative, together with its partners, is currently deploying this data space. A major goal of the data space will be to source and make available high-quality, usable and accessible 3D cultural data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why 3D matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The need for 3D digitisation of cultural heritage is more relevant than ever. Recent devastating events like the destruction of cultural property in Ukraine or natural hazards caused by changing climate conditions remind us that <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">cultural heritage is fragile and at constant risk</a>. Digital technologies, including 3D, play an important role in the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage, offering a regenerative lifeline for sites facing man-made and natural threats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Commission has set ambitious 3D targets for 2030, and the Conference aims to support their achievement. As called for in the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-proposes-common-european-data-space-cultural-heritage\">Commission Recommendation of 2021</a> establishing the creation of a common European data space for cultural heritage, in the course of this decade <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/member-states\">EU Member States</a> should digitise in 3D all monuments and sites deemed at risk, and 50 % of the most physically visited.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3D technologies are already being used to support the preservation of Europe’s shared cultural heritage in the face of growing natural and manmade foes. 3D applications also offer unprecedented opportunities for cultural heritage institutions to fulfil their mission of broadening access to culture and information in the 21st century, staying relevant in today’s fast-changing world. Lastly,&nbsp;3D can be used to capture imaginations, enhance engagement and public understanding of cultural assets, and foster their reuse within the cultural sector and beyond - from education and research to tourism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Europeana Conference under the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU will support cultural heritage professionals and policymakers in better understanding the relevance and use of 3D to address some of the key challenges faced by the sector and society as a whole. It will provide a platform to share knowledge, experiences and new insights to inform future action and policy direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The common European data space for cultural heritage opens up an exciting opportunity for our sector to fully harness the potential of emerging tech priorities like 3D for the benefit of Europe’s rich cultural heritage. And much more: it will allow us to better capitalise on our shared cultural resources to advance towards a more open, knowledgeable and creative society. We are thankful to the Swedish National Heritage Board and the Swedish Ministry of Culture for their commitment to this vision and look forward to continuing working closely with the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU and with EU Member States to live up to this momentum,‘ said Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Digital transformation is crucial to keep cultural heritage relevant and expand its possible uses. The Swedish National Heritage Board views digital transformation as the most important challenge for museums in Sweden today, and we consider this a strong priority for the coming years when supporting the museum sector. Digital heritage holds no traditional boundaries and therefore we regard our work with the Europeana Initiative and the common European data space for cultural heritage as a vital part of our path forward. The expansion of 3D content opens up even more possibilities for gaining knowledge and reaching new audiences. We are excited to expand our cooperation both during the Swedish Presidency and further on into the future,'&nbsp;said Eric Fugeläng, Head of Department at the Swedish National Heritage Board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-europeana-conference-under-the-swedish-presidency-of-the-council-of-the-eu\">Get involved and find out more at the conference on 18 April</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Underrepresentation of women artists&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the topic of gender equality is currently much discussed, the number of permanent works of art by women in museums remains low across the globe. In the art departments of German institutions (taking the example of where the fair share! alliance is based), there is hardly any art created by women before the 1970s. A museum such as the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin, which research shows, has <a href=\"https://blog.smb.museum/kein-raum-fuer-mich-allein-kuenstlerinnen-in-der-alten-nationalgalerie/\">about 1.5% women artists in its collection</a>, is representative of comparable collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is also an acute need to catch up in the contemporary field. According to our own research, at the Hamburger Kunsthalle, only 19% of the contemporary artworks are by women, and only 14% of the works on show in the Collection of Modern Art at the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich are by women. To give another example, research in 2017 showed that <a href=\"https://museumsdienst.koeln/2019/12/19/kunstlerinnen-im-museum-ludwig\">only 11% of the artists at the Museum Ludwig were women; since 1989 solo exhibitions by women artists have accounted for only 20%</a>. This is despite the fact that the majority of art school graduates in Germany have been female for years <a href=\"https://www.bbk-berlin.de/sites/default/files/2021-03/spartenbericht-bildende-kunst-5216102219004.pdf\">(59% in 2018/19)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the fair share! alliance, we advocate for more visibility of female artists in the art scene. We demand a quota in all areas of contemporary art as well as a revaluation of historical positions of female artistic creation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Raising awareness of the issue</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The alliance was founded by Ines Doleschal and Rachel Kohn in 2020. We organise events and performances to draw attention to the issue of lack of representation of female artists and advocate for change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the modernist collections of the National Museums in Berlin are presented in the basement of the famous building by Mies van der Rohe. Our research shows that there are currently 22 women artists out of 110 artists on show, and of the 250 works on display, 14% were created by women artists. According to the director, <a href=\"https://www.monopol-magazin.de/neue-nationalgalerie-will-mehr-kunst-von-frauen-zeigen\">only 9% of the artworks in the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie are by women artists</a>. These include Hannah Höch, Natalja Goncharova, Lotte Laserstein, Lou Loeber, Marg Moll and a further 17 artists of Expressionism, Surrealism, Constructivism and Dadaism. In the run-up to the opening of the building, the fair share! alliance called for a greater presence of women artists in the permanent collection through a spontaneous nocturnal art action where we pinned 800 names of women artists to the building’s fence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every International Women’s Day, the Berlin action fair share! alliance also prepares a performance. In 2022, addressing the imbalance described above, it focused on forgotten female artists that should be included in the collection of the Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin. We suggested ‘A woman in every window’, where 110 female artists and cultural workers walked around the museum to represent female artists of the classical modern era. On their shirts they wore the name of a woman artist of classical modernism who could be represented in the show collection - if her works had been collected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the day of the performance, each participant became an expert on ‘her’ artist. After the performance, visitors could contact the participants and ask them about their lives and work. This created a pool of information that makes many undiscovered, long-forgotten and strongly underrepresented women artists visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023, fair share! activists gathered directly in the centre of political decision-making near the Bundestag. This year they demanded fair payment for their work, greater visibility and the recognition of women’s potential in the visual arts. fair share! activists dressed in pink letters with a variety of slogans, while at a ‘Feminist Corner’ other activists articulated demands in various formats. A special highlight were activists on a boat passing by and shouting slogans such as ‘fair pay for women artists’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Changing approaches for the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we aim to raise awareness of this issue and encourage change, there are a number of steps that cultural heritage institutions around the world can take to increase the representation of women in their collections, including: &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Acknowledge the past and present achievements of women artists through<br />\r\n    a reassessment of your archives, art repositories and acquisitions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Incorporate a gender-sensitive design of acquisitions and exhibitions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Buy art from woman artists: increase their works in your collections and exhibitions - aim for 50% in contemporary art</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Conduct or join research projects and promote publications on women artists</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Contribute to the revision and supplementation of art-history publications and textbooks in education</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Advocate for more targeted subsidies and prizes for women artists of all ages</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lift age restrictions for calls of proposals</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Support programmes for artists with child-rearing and care responsibilities, and develop targeted support schemes for re-entry after family leave</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Promote specific funding and grants for women artists with care responsibilities</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use arts research networks to participate in debates, share knowledge and resources</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In Germany specifically, support the creation of a project to create a nationwide database of women artists and monitoring office, to analyse the representation of women artists in German museums and collections, based in the Federal Ministry for Culture and Media</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For more about our actions <a href=\"http://www.fairshareforwomenartists.de\">visit our website.</a> You can also <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/womens-history\">explore Women’s History on Europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Europeana Translate</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The eTranslation CEF Telecom project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate</a> aims to strengthen the&nbsp; connections between the eTranslation Infrastructure and the common European data space for cultural heritage, deployed by the Europeana Initiative, for the benefit of both. On one hand, the project aims to improve the usability of cultural heritage resources by enriching cultural heritage datasets with multilingual metadata. On the other, it enhances the language resources made openly available through the <a href=\"https://lr-coordination.eu/\">European Language Resource Coordination</a> with metadata from millions of cultural heritage objects, which were carefully selected, cleaned and normalised so that they become amenable for training purposes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For these purposes, Europeana Translate has developed and deployed machine translation tools adapted to the needs of the cultural heritage sector. The tools are being applied to translate the metadata of more than 25 million records currently <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">available through Europeana’s infrastructure </a>from 22 official EU languages to English, improving the multilingual experience provided to its users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the course of the project, partners <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-on-state-of-the-art-machine-translation-services\">trained a set of translation engines</a> provided by partner <a href=\"https://pangeanic.com/\">Pangeanic</a> with a selection of metadata selected from the Europeana infrastructure, including bilingual and monolingual data as well as multilingual vocabularies. Additional data selected from the <a href=\"https://opus.nlpl.eu/\">OPUS</a> collection website were also considered for languages that were not sufficiently represented. A number of experiments were performed to decide on the best combination of training data and set-up of the engines for each language. By splitting data between training and test sets, an automatic evaluation based on standard metrics (such as BLEU and TER) was performed for all language pairs. The results demonstrate considerable improvement compared to the generic Pangeanic models (before the in-domain training) and the eTranslation DSI for most languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Evaluation of the automatic translation by human experts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The automatic translations also underwent extensive evaluation by linguists and cultural heritage experts. Evaluators were asked to rate the automatic translations into English on a scale from 0 to 100, considering aspects such as fluency (grammatical correctness), accuracy (general meaning), and adequacy (proper use of terminology). They were also asked to provide additional feedback, including reporting important and recurrent errors. Three crowdsourcing campaigns were organised through the <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/translate-dutch\">CrowdHeritage</a> platform to engage members of the cultural heritage sector. Overall, these saw the participation of 44 expert linguists and 29 cultural heritage professionals, who gave quite high ratings (above 80%) for the majority of the 22 languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results obtained by human evaluation provided us with insights about the behaviour of the machine translation engines for different languages. An in-depth statistical analysis of the assigned ratings from humans, in correlation with the automatic confidence scores calculated by the machine translation engines, allowed us to determine appropriate quality thresholds for publishing translations from various languages to the Europeana infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Benefits for users and cultural heritage institutions&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The translation engines are being used by the Europeana infrastructure to produce, index, share and display automatic English translations of metadata, which will allow people to better discover, analyse, and reuse material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The positive impact that this work is having has been confirmed by an impact assessment survey filled in by 27 linguists and 18 cultural heritage experts. When asked about the added value that automatic English translations can bring to the search and display of cultural heritage items on the Europeana website, both communities considered it important. They also reported that they appreciated the expected increased amount of search results, which would include cultural heritage items that are not currently returned when searching in English: 83.4% and 62.9% of the cultural heritage experts and linguists respectively considered this improvement valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, the translation engines set up by the project can be useful to data providers who wish to translate the metadata of their collections to English, improving their collections’ accessibility. Users of the <a href=\"http://mint-wordpress.image.ntua.gr/\">MINT</a> aggregation platform can make direct use of the existing API-interlinking with the engines, while cultural heritage institutions with technical expertise can take advantage of the readily deployable machine translation engines made openly available on the <a href=\"https://live.european-language-grid.eu/\">ELG repository</a>.&nbsp; All cultural heritage experts who participated in the survey declared that they would consider using the Europeana Translate tools to enrich the collections of their organisation with automatic translations to improve discoverability.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Translate Event - how machine translation &amp; multilingual access impacts cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in learning more about the Europeana Translate project, its methodology and results? Would you also like to deepen your knowledge of state of the art machine translation technologies and how it can be applied in the cultural heritage sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then join us at the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/projects/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate Event - How machine translation &amp; multilingual access impacts cultural heritage</a>. This is an online event taking place April 13, 2023, from 14:00 to 17:00 CEST. You will hear project partners explain in detail the methodology and results obtained in these two years of work. Similar projects will also be discussed, always critically considering the importance of automated translations of cultural heritage data/metadata with reflections on future steps, usability and challenges of AI-technology for the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the calls&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/eit-culture-creativity\">EIT Culture &amp; Creativity</a> is a knowledge and innovation community launched by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) in June 2022. It aims to strengthen and transform Europe’s cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI) by increasing their innovation capacity and competitiveness. Europeana Foundation is one of the 50 partners in the consortium implementing EIT Culture and Creativity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EIT Culture &amp; Creativity has just released its first calls for proposals for funding. The calls invite applications that aim to address key challenges in education, business and society in Europe, and that will harness the unique position of the CCSIs to accelerate Europe’s Green, Digital and Social Transitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The calls for proposals will award €10.45 million in total, with individual project funding ranging between €250,000 and €500,000 per year (depending on the call). Education-related calls are 100% funded, whereas the rest require a co-funding rate (varies per call).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The calls are open for submission till 31 May 2023. All CCSI stakeholders and legal entities in the EU and Associated Members of the Horizon Europe Programme are eligible to apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Areas in focus</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This EIT funding round is organised in five calls for proposals:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Talent Scaler | Focus area: Higher education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This call aims to develop master’s programmes strengthening students’ skills in entrepreneurship as well as linking sustainability, aesthetics and inclusiveness (inspired by the values of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Skill Fitter | Focus area: Lifelong learning</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This call aims to develop CPDs (Continuing Professional Development) courses in five critical areas: digital (use of digital tools), data-driven methods and practice, business skills, sustainable development and design thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Breakthrough Lab | Focus area: Innovation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposals under this call aim to deliver innovative products, processes, services, or business models in the audiovisual and media, architecture, fashion and textile, design, and cultural heritage sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Venture Factory | Focus area: Business creation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This call aims to develop fit-for-purpose incubation and/or accelerator programmes for CCSIs businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community Catalyser | Focus area: Society</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposals under this call are expected to develop innovative solutions to place-based challenges related to the Triple Transitions (digital, green and social) and to increase social cohesion and sense of belonging in local communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Application process and project duration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The application process is designed in one or two steps. Talent Scaler, Breakthrough Lab and Venture Factory calls support one-step procedure and request a full proposal to be submitted to EIT Culture and Creativity by 31 May. Applicants under Skill Fitter and Community Catalyser calls are invited to submit a short video pitch as expression of interest by 31 May. If accepted, they must deliver a full proposal by 4 August 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Awarded projects are expected to start in January 2024 and have a duration of one or two years, with exception of projects under Talent Scaler programme which can run for up to four years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more and apply</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The aspirations of EIT Culture &amp; Creativity are very much aligned with the mission of the Europeana Initiative and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a>, to accelerate digital transformation in the cultural sector and contribute to green, inclusive, and resilient Europe. This first funding round provides a concrete and unique opportunity for members of the Europeana Network Association, Europeana Aggregators'&nbsp;Forum and the wider cultural community to connect to creative players across borders and industries, and bring to life their ideas for new ways of working, community engagement and a sustainable future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find more information on call conditions <a href=\"https://eit-culture-creativity.eu/calls-for-proposals/\">on the EIT Culture &amp; Creativity website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality reality (AR) create distinct experiences by merging the physical world with the digital. They offer the opportunity to engage audiences with cultural heritage in new ways, and offer exciting possibilities for education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These possibilities have been fully demonstrated by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a>, a mentoring programme and educational challenge for students and educators, organised by the Europeana Initiative. The second edition, run by partners <a href=\"https://www.somosmacedonia.com/\">Macedonia Studio</a>, took part in the second half of 2022. It trained 262 students and 19 educators and cultural heritage professionals to use Mozilla Hubs (a virtual world platform) to develop virtual spaces which used cultural heritage resources to offer a creative solution for a local issue. In doing so, the programme fostered collaborations between schools, universities, local museums and libraries, digital artists and UX designers, researchers, historians, architects, local authorities and tourism centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The projects developed for the programme are varied and inspiring and provide rich answers to the question: why use immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>1. Immersive technologies allow you to bring digitised items together in one space to engage students (and communities) in their cultural heritage.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is what Ioannis E. Tsioptsias, a primary school teacher in Ptolemaida, Greece, aimed for with his institution’s <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/rPozdDM/museum-g\">Virtual Museum of Natural History</a> project, which created the first immersive cultural experience of his city. Together with nine students in primary education, Ioannis made 2D and 3D digitisations of exhibits from the local city museum to create a digital museum on Mozilla Hubs. The project was awarded the <strong>Best Digitisation project prize</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ioannis says, ‘The Virtual Museum of Natural History envisions a museum open to the local community. It is a fantastic digital version of my city's museum. As a teacher interested in creating bonds between the students, parents and local community, I proposed it because it created an excuse to involve all the students of my school in a united proposal to ask the local municipality to repair the actual museum. In this way, we spread the message of cohesion in the community’.</p>\r\n"

Immersive technologies offer a way to test new digital solutions, services and products for people with special needs, making cultural and educational offerings more accessible to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finding a place to teach life skills to students with disabilities was the main aim of Maria Antónia Brandão, teacher in Aves Portugal - Agrupamento de Escolas D. Afonso Henriques School, who created the project <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/BjWhTic/flat-portugal\">Virtual Flat</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘This is a project which consists of a digital \"space\" for disabled students to be in contact with basic household skills, like vacuuming, sweeping, dusting, setting and clearing the table, washing and putting away the dishes, caring for family pets. As a headmaster deputy responsible for the teaching and learning of children with specific needs, I thought it would be interesting to provide this space that could stimulate the autonomy and confidence of those children and young people’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To establish the basics&nbsp; for the space, she asked colleagues including Elisabete Sousa (coordinator of the multidisciplinary inclusive education team at her school) what they thought students needed, consulted with students and invited parents to express their opinion. The project came to reality thanks to the technical assistance of two external collaborators: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gmedranotic?lang=en\">Guillermo Medrano</a>, PhD Engineer and Master in Teaching and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/raul-gomez-hernandez?fbclid=IwAR3UyF4miXaJsZI8zO-uKTXMvHatOvDk19wHxxhVZ0PYt-x0HpJ2RwMnQxE\">Raul Gomez Hernandez</a>, Graduate Teaching Assistant at Complutense University of Madrid. Their joint effort received the <strong>Best Special Needs project award</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Immersive technologies allow you to bring architectural beauty and uniqueness to new audiences in a different dimension, by recreating a real space and site.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is what Donata Federici and her 17 students in their third year of high school from Liceo Linguistico N. Copernico Bologna (Italy) planned for their project <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/BHAtmQo/room-of-mutual-respect\">Bologna Untold</a>, which won the <strong>Best Architectural Recreation project</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She says, ‘The project aimed to provide a sustainable, virtual tour of Bologna, a town in Northern Italy, to help people appreciate its beauty and nature. As Bologna is already a pedestrian-friendly town, thanks to its many porticoes (which are part of a Unesco World Heritage Site), with my students and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DFEstefany\">Estefany Duran Fonseca</a> (Digital Product Designer &amp; Project Manager), we created a tour of the most iconic places in the town, which can be visited easily on foot or by bicycle. Some of these spaces, like Le Serre or Piazza Carducci, are well-aligned with the principles of New European Bauhaus, given they are eco-friendly, accessible and inclusive. Going on a sort of treasure hunt to a few, selected spots which are well represented by the pictures found on the Europeana website, the visitors will discover the endless opportunities Bologna has to offer to tourists and city-dwellers alike’.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The need for 3D digitisation of cultural heritage is more relevant than ever, with recent devastating events like the destruction of cultural property during armed conflicts or natural hazards caused by changing climate conditions reminding us that <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">cultural heritage is fragile and at constant risk</a>. Digital technologies, including 3D, play an important role in the preservation and restoration of cultural heritage, offering a regenerative lifeline for sites facing man-made and natural threats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But what is needed for the successful 3D digitisation of cultural heritage? A study, led by Cyprus University of Technology and published in 2022, identified all key and relevant elements for successful 3D digitisation of cultural heritage, classifying them by degree of complexity and purpose or use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The study provides a definition and criteria for quality in a 3D digitisation project and makes an inventory of existing formats, standards, guidelines and methodologies used in the industry. It also collects a number of past digitisation projects, existing 3D models&nbsp; and success stories serving as benchmarks for 3D digitisation of tangible cultural heritage. It demonstrates how a successful 3D digitisation project relies on a subtle balance between the complexity of the object (whether it is a building, a site or a small object) to be captured, the quality of the model to be achieved and the resources available to fund the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The study on quality in 3D digitisation of tangible cultural heritage provides a framework for cultural heritage professionals and institutions to define and produce high quality 3D models.&nbsp; It was made possible thanks to funding by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT). <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-quality-3d-digitisation-tangible-cultural-heritage\">You can read the full study here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in learning more about 3D and digital cultural heritage, don’t miss the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/the-europeana-conference-under-the-swedish-presidency-of-the-council-of-the-eu\">Europeana conference under the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU</a>, 'Accelerating 3D in the common European data space for cultural heritage: Why 3D matters.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference will focus on 3D, looking at aspects, insights and inspirations on 3D as one of the main facets of the common European data space for cultural heritage and the digital transformation of the sector. Dr. Marinos Ioannides of the Digital Heritage Research Lab (DHRLab) at Cyprus University of Technology and Director of UNESCO Chair on Digital Cultural Heritage (CH), who led the study on quality in 3D digitisation of tangible cultural heritage described above, will speak at the conference - don’t miss your chance to learn more!</p>\r\n"

In the context of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a>, we see new opportunities to further develop our offer for academic and research communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One particular opportunity can be found in datasets created from cultural heritage data by cultural heritage institutions and users. While we are already working together with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/dariah\">DARIAH (Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities)</a>, one of our data space consortium partners, to facilitate dataset-level access and reuse, we recognise not all users have the same needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, we would like to consult those who already reuse cultural heritage data through digital methods and tools about their experiences, starting with a simple question: what is a dataset to you?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is a dataset to you? What to consider</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think about a recent scenario where you needed to use cultural heritage data. Ask yourself:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What sort of data structure did you prefer?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What sort of information did you need or want about the dataset?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What kinds of digital cultural heritage objects were part of your dataset?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Who created the dataset (you or someone else, e.g. a cultural heritage institution)?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How large was the dataset? How typical is this for datasets that you have used in the past? How large do you imagine you could ever need them to be?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">When you were using that dataset, what made your research or teaching activities easier?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What, if any, obstacle did you encounter in trying to reuse that dataset?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Share your views&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you are a staff member teaching at a university, a researcher, a university student, or a cultural heritage domain expert supporting research or educational use of digital cultural heritage, we want to hear from you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please share your answers to the questions above, and specify in what context you use datasets (for example, your academic field, your research interests, or your university teaching activities). And, of course, tell us if you have already used Europeana data!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please share your experience in up to 250 words <strong>by Tuesday 12 May 2023</strong> by emailing <a href=\"mailto:research@euroepana.eu\">research@europeana.eu</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality reality (AR) create distinct experiences by merging the physical world with the digital. They offer the opportunity to engage audiences with cultural heritage in new ways, and offer exciting possibilities for education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These possibilities have been fully demonstrated by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a>, a mentoring programme and educational challenge for students and educators, organised by the Europeana Initiative. The second edition, run by partners Macedonia Studio, took part in the second half of 2022. It trained 262 students and 19 educators and cultural heritage professionals to use Mozilla Hubs (a virtual world platform) to develop virtual spaces which used cultural heritage resources to offer a creative solution for a local issue. In doing so, the programme fostered collaborations between schools, universities, local museums and libraries, digital artists and UX designers, researchers, historians, architects, local authorities and tourism centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The projects developed for the programme are varied and inspiring and provide rich answers to the question: <strong>why use immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. They can bring together institutions to work on common projects for the sake of the community.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The library of the ‘Lucian Blaga’ University of Sibiu, Romania, is an educational, scientific, and cultural institution of major importance in the city. It has an academic community of approximately 14,000 people who offer information and documentation services for the entire local community. As part of Built with Bits, the library worked with a group of 10 students from the local 'Gheorghe Lazăr National College to create an online space which reimagined the library, ensuring that it better met the needs of people with disabilities and making it more welcoming for students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Camelia Mihaela Volosciuc, Head of Service at the university wanted to participate in the Built with Bits programme in order to, ‘reconfigure the library space in accordance with the principles and values promoted by the European Commission within the New European Bauhaus program, such as aesthetics, sustainability, and inclusivity, to better meet the needs of people with disabilities in Sibiu’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monica-Maria Oancea, the teacher coordinating the students’ involvement, underlined how the programme demonstrated that all students could get involved in supporting their community. 'In the Romanian language there is a saying - man sanctifies the place! It refers to the fact that no matter where you are born, what family you come from, regardless of the degree of social welfare, you can do something good, sustainable, thorough and responsible, if only you care.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/i4t25Dn/crimson-gorgeous-get-together\">Reconfiguration of the library space at Lucian Blaga&nbsp;University</a> was awarded the Best Cultural Heritage Institution Collaboration to recognise the synergies between the university library and the ‘Gheorghe Lazăr’ National College.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>5. With immersive technologies, you can make original and creative reuse of some of the digital collections on Europeana.eu. More than 40% of these have licences that allow for educational use.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An example of this reuse could be found in the project <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/ijGkHtE/caprera-war-and-peace-museum\">Caprera War and Peace Museum</a>, a collaborative effort from 171 students of teachers Luigia Palumbo (IC Capozzi-Galilei - Valenzano), Daniela Brogna (IC Pimentel Fonseca - Pontecagnano), Maria Luisa Onida (IIS Leonardo Da Vinci - Lanusei), and external designer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DFEstefany\">Estefany Duran Fonseca</a>. To reinforce the rigorous historical approach, <a href=\"http://www.sardegnafortificata.it/\">Mattia Collaro</a>, Councillor of Assam (Association for studies of military history and architecture) and <a href=\"https://www.gaiainstitute.com/chi-siamo.php\">Dr. Giuseppe Spinetti,</a> graduate in Architecture at the University of Florence, also collaborated on the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the Museum, students and teachers created a fascinating and complex space which presents several items from the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=collection%3Aww1&amp;query=&amp;reusability=open&amp;view=mosaic&amp;api=metadata\">First World War collection in Europeana.eu</a>. The items focus on user generated content, including <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/2020601/https___1914_1918_europeana_eu_contributions_6188\">sentimental postcards</a>&nbsp;written during the war, which were digitised and contributed by citizens all over Europe. The project received the Best Europeana Use project for their original choice of materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Luigia Palumbo tells us, ‘this project aimed to explore the recovery, conversion and enhancement of Monte Rasu battery, a large and beautiful military fortress of the late 19th century (now abandoned) located in Caprera. I proposed it because I am interested in educational projects aimed at civil coexistence, including the redevelopment of the territory. We created a virtual museum which aimed to emphasise the \"man\" beyond the soldier with objects that illustrated their daily life; invite the visitor to immerse themselves in the site’s outdoor spaces; and encourage them to build a better future through understanding the past.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have an M.A. in Publishing, Media and Journalism, and for more than 15 years I have been working as a project manager in the framework of various financing instruments of the European Commission, with a particular focus on digital and social innovation. Aiming to increase the impact of my projects at the local level, 12 years ago I launched the <a href=\"http://www.egina.eu/\">European Grants International Academy</a>, which operates as a training agency in the Vocational and Educational Training (VET) and adult education sectors. It is a think-tank for the design and implementation of European and international projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a sociologist and communicator, I deeply believe in transformative social change, and four years ago, I was captured by the magical world of Hackathons. I’ve since organised the first <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SHUMBRIA/\">Social Hackathon Umbria</a>, a 48-hour digital marathon for the co-creation of innovative solutions aimed at solving different societal challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am also a member of national associations and networks in the field of innovation and I am part of the board of international organisations including <a href=\"https://all-digital.org/\">All Digital</a> (for the promotion of digital skills) and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/education\">Europeana Education Community</a>.&nbsp;Through my work as Chair of the Community, I have had the chance to promote and witness the success of several initiatives aimed at enhancing the cooperation between educators and GLAM practitioners such as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-low-code-fest-2022\">Low-Code Fest</a> programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I gain satisfaction working with and for different target groups, always starting from the assumption that high-quality education and training are fundamental to individual realisation. ‘Education for all’, in my case, has meant in particular developing training courses and other formative interventions for disadvantaged groups. Unemployment, disability, gender and racial discrimination, from one side, can be dismantled with adaptability, guidance and social inclusion from the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being part of the Members Council gives me the opportunity to share my experiences directing digital innovation towards transformative social change within the cultural heritage sector. We are currently experiencing a paradigm shift that determines the need for a new approach in the management and participatory governance of cultural heritage. This profound change requires a new cultural approach, particularly towards international participatory governance models. This can be explored through a more aware and proactive use of cultural and artistic heritage, supported by the new ICT applications and tools, which I hope my experience can support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an ENA Members Councillor, I will foster the role of digital cultural heritage in enhancing social cohesion and sustainable development in Europe. On the one hand, the digital native generation, who are currently in school and university education, need to develop their own ways of approaching cultural heritage inherited from the past. On the other hand, the current global scenario, marked by social, political, environmental and financial crises, increased migration flows, acts of radical violence and violation of human rights, requires civil society and cultural organisations to assume greater responsibility than ever in ensuring that people of all ages and backgrounds can develop into informed, critically literate, socially-connected, ethical and engaged global citizens.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality reality (AR) create distinct experiences by merging the physical world with the digital. They offer the opportunity to engage audiences with cultural heritage in new ways, and offer exciting possibilities for education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These possibilities have been fully demonstrated by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a>, a mentoring programme and educational challenge for students and educators, organised by the Europeana Initiative. The second edition, run by partners <a href=\"https://www.somosmacedonia.com/\">Macedonia Studio</a>, took part in the second half of 2022. It trained 262 students and 19 educators and cultural heritage professionals to use Mozilla Hubs (a virtual world platform) to develop virtual spaces which used cultural heritage resources to offer a creative solution for a local issue. In doing so, the programme fostered collaborations between schools, universities, local museums and libraries, digital artists and UX designers, researchers, historians, architects, local authorities and tourism centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The projects developed for the programme are varied and inspiring and provide rich answers to the question: why use immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>7.&nbsp;Virtual spaces can connect you with the New European Bauhaus movement and its values of sustainability, inclusivity and togetherness.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is how <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/katalin-lorincz\">Kati Lőrincz</a> developed her project, <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/UQvkkWM/\">New European Bauhaus Treasure Hunt</a> with more than 50 students of the Szabó Lőrinc Bilingual high school in Budapest and two external collaborators, the 3D artist Alexedu Cabanillas and <a href=\"https://ekinbaskentli.wordpress.com/\">Ekin Baskentli</a>, an architecture student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kati says, ‘The New European Bauhaus Treasure Hunt&nbsp;was built on the idea of celebrating art and culture and linking sustainability and inclusion to our local treasures. Our school is in the Bauhaus area near Napraforgó Street, a pleasant and unique street with houses made from modern materials which use state-of-the-art structural designs by the era’s notable architects. I planned the project around learning not only a new vocabulary related to technology, architecture and styles but also culture, European values, sustainability, SDGs and inclusion. By completing this project, students not only learned and practised English but also became acquainted with the European and Hungarian Bauhaus movement and local history’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Guess what? The space was awarded with the Best New European Bauhaus project. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">Find out more about New European Bauhaus.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Students can lead on using immersive technologies - and become teachers themselves!&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When working with immersive technologies,&nbsp;educators may end up learning the most challenging technical aspects from their students, acting as&nbsp;mentors rather than lecturers. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/rafael-montero\">Rafael Montero</a> - secondary school teacher at Corazon de María in Gijon - and his students worked in this bottom-up way, and <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/scenes/i7CFjaX\">Caminos Sostenibles CODEMA</a> is the fantastic result of this approach to projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The space was fully developed by Álvaro Puebla and Javier Yañez, both 17 years old. Rafa explains how, ‘This project consists of a large-scale model that contains a circuit with information and interesting facts about our city and its future sustainable paths. As students interested in sustainable mobility, we proposed it because we think this could be a great project to make in real life. This way, we can help children and families to come to school safely’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project received the award and special mention for Best Only Students project, which was more than deserved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

As a teacher interested in the enhancement of natural and cultural heritage, I proposed it because it concerns a space that is abandoned but has a large potential and could play an important role in tourism. The project includes the creation of a centre for the study of the marine environment and pollution in the area of the former maritime station. The Red Rocks square would become a place for eco-friendly tourism. It will also represent the centre of a system consisting of the port area, the main street of the village and the square.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the project, they contacted associations that deal with sustainable tourism (such as Società Turistica Salinas SNC) to research the territory. They also collaborated with regional media to find documents on culture, local traditions and the environment, earning the special mention for the Best Local Impact project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The recovery of the cultural heritage sector after the most restrictive phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has been analysed from many different angles, such as<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/iflb/48/1\"> innovation in libraries</a> or <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373530\">digital delivery in museums</a> during the pandemic. The eCHOIng project, however, has taken an unconventional approach by seeking to identify how <a href=\"https://echoing.eu/openinnovation_main/\">open innovation</a> can help in the process of post-pandemic recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The term ‘open innovation’ refers to a situation where an organisation doesn’t just rely on internal knowledge, sources and resources (such as its own staff or R&amp;D) but also uses external sources (such as customer feedback, published patents, competitors, external agencies, the public) to drive innovation. In the cultural heritage sector, it means initiatives or activities where institutions co-create or co-develop project ideas in collaboration with citizens, students and institutions from other sectors or industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This may look like a paradox: after all, open innovation practices rely on the engagement and wider participation of citizens, and the pandemic restricted various forms of communication! However, exploring the activities of a sizable group of small cultural heritage organisations, eCHOIng identified that many are actively looking for ways to re-engage citizens and are keen to explore more opportunities for engagement and innovative services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bringing together cultural heritage institutions and higher education&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project found that despite many cultural heritage institutions looking to explore engagement, small institutions face the difficulty of relying on compact numbers of staff members. Collaboration with academia can therefore be vital to implement new projects. Besides co-creation of joint innovative projects, higher education institutions can support the upskilling of staff from the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">eCHOIng took a two-pronged approach to this topic by exploring working models of collaboration between academia and cultural institutions, and also answering some of the emerging educational gaps. Unsurprisingly, many higher education curricula have yet to offer up-to-date modules related to digital transformation. Such topics would also be in demand within the context of continuous professional development of professionals, especially from smaller cultural heritage organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The training modules</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To address this need,&nbsp;eCHOing has developed a number of training modules for students of higher education institutions, as well as staff from the cultural and creative sector and cultural organisations. The modules are designed to inspire and equip cultural heritage organisations with the tools and resources needed to effectively conceive, develop, and manage open innovation collaborations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The<a href=\"https://echoing.eu/results-table/\"> project website</a> provides a complete picture of the process followed, which resulted in the development of <a href=\"https://sisu.ut.ee/echoing/course-modules?lang=en\">six training modules</a> responding to needs within the current recovery process, from craft as an empowering tool to co-designing projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/glossary\">Glossary of Terms</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Impact Playbook</a> were very helpful while working on the modules’ content, both in terms of positioning concepts within the modules and as inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lessons learned</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The online modules were finalised through internal and external reviews, and run in four different university courses during the spring semester of 2023. They were embedded in four different courses where 120 students were trained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some of our reflections from the work on the modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the current setting, we need training which follows an agile approach and allows us to identify and quickly develop content on emerging topics. Identifying these topics in the case of eCHOng involved a co-creation process where needs from the cultural heritage sectors were compared with topics within the helm of academic research.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Agile approaches with frequent revisions are needed for this type of content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This approach possibly could lead to identifying microcredentials (qualifications) which can be offered to both students and professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Delivery online requires more preparation than face to face – the biggest time investment is planning activities and exercises to monitor progress.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There are plenty of current developments of MOOCs, digital courses and continuous professional development. It would be beneficial to exchange more experiences and introduce quality standards for courses which require expedient preparation and frequent updates.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Share your thoughts!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can share your thoughts on this work by providing feedback to the <a href=\"https://sisu.ut.ee/echoing/partners-presented?lang=en\">project team</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>What is Earth Day?</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earth Day takes place every year on the 22 April as an important global reminder about environmental protection and an invitation to take part in preserving our planet. It is a powerful social movement that encourages us – individually and collectively – to protect Earth and nature. The main purpose of Earth Day is to raise awareness of the environmental challenges our planet faces and to promote solutions for a sustainable future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The history and impact</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970 in the United States. After expanding into an international campaign in 1990, it is now observed globally and has since become an important event to raise awareness and inspire action. Over the years, Earth Day has played a key role in helping to shape public policy and raise public awareness about issues such as climate emergency, pollution, oceans health and habitat destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Earth Day in 2000, the issues of global warming and cleaner energy sources were brought to the forefront. With its mission to diversify and activate the environmental movement across the globe, Earth Day has mobilised civil society to advocate for climate action.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Sustainable Development Goals were put into place in 2015 by all the member states of the United Nations to collaborate and ensure a sustainable future. There has already been some progress in environmental protection since the inception of Earth Day: renewable energy, agroecology, zero-emissions mobility, and promoting environmental justice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Earth Day 2023: Invest in Our Planet</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year the theme of Earth Day 2023 is ‘Invest in our planet’. There are many ways that all individuals can celebrate Earth Day 2023 and contribute to the investment in our planet, for example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Become more aware, and share and raise awareness of the environmental and climate challenges, and what we can do to help</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reduce our CO2 emission</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reduce our energy consumption&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Demand and encourage the development and use of renewable energy sources</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Make eco-friendly choices</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Reduce, reuse, recycle and compost</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Advocate for a green sustainable future&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to get involved and participate in Earth Day, have a look at the <a href=\"https://earthday.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8d15cc3da12d4338a109c7d64c97c02a\">interactive Earth Day map</a>.

Our first session of 2023 aimed to cover questions about the basics of copyright law - read on to discover what was discussed!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Your new best friend for EU copyright basics - Copyright User EU</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The session started with an introduction to <a href=\"http://copyrightuser.eu\">copyrightuser.eu</a> by our Copyright Steering Group member Bartolomeo Meletti (University of Glasgow). This online platform was launched in March 2023 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.recreating.eu/\">Recreating Europe</a> consortium. Together with its sister website <a href=\"http://copyrightuser.org\">copyrightuser.org</a>, which covers UK copyright law, it aims to make European copyright law understandable and accessible to everyone. We highly recommend these two websites to anyone interested in learning the basics of copyright law or seeking guidance on what they should consider while approaching copyright-related issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The EU and the UK - how Brexit affects copyright&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The distinction between the two separate Copyright User websites, one covering the EU and the other UK copyright law, raised the question of how UK and European copyright laws interact. Bartolomeo Meletti gave us a brief overview on the matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We discussed how, despite the UK’s exit from the European Union, the copyright system of the UK is largely in line with EU copyright law. This means that the main exclusive rights copyright grants (like reproduction right, right of communication to the public), which allow the commercial exploitation of the copyrighted work and enable rightsholders to prevent certain uses of their work by others without their permission, are still observed under UK copyright law.&nbsp; The same applies to the originality criteria as developed by the Court of Justice (CJEU) judgements. CJEU’s judgements and interpretations of EU law dating up to the end of the Brexit transitional period (31 December 2020) still continue to apply in the UK. However, things may change and in the future, the copyright rules of the UK may be altered and diverge from the rules of the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The harsh truth - copyright is territorial&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the fundamental facts about copyright law is that it is territorial in nature. While copyright rules in the European Union are largely harmonised, for economic rights in particular (such as the right of reproduction or communication to the public), the rules may still change from member state to member state. This means that, for example, though one work is protected by copyright in one country, it may not be in another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fragmentation of copyright rules in the EU is evident particularly in moral rights, which protect authors´ non-economic interests in their work, as well as in the exceptions and limitations to copyright. The 2001 <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029\">Information Society Directive</a> explicitly leaves moral rights out of the scope of the Directive and leaves their regulation to the national laws of member states. As for copyright exceptions, it is also important to consult the national laws of member states. Most exceptions are optional under EU law and therefore may not have been transposed at the member state level (i.e. added to the national laws of a given member state) or may have been implemented with variations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Copyright and use of copyright-protected works - back to basics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During these copyright office hours, a participant asked whether a filmmaker could use a TikTok collection held by an audiovisual archive (created by third parties for which the archive does not have the rights) in a <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/7180853#.ZEVFPHZBw2y\">documentary film</a>. Bartolomeo Meletti walked us through what one should pay attention to before using someone else's copyrighted work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/identifying-copyright-in-collection-items\">default rule</a> is that anyone wishing to use a work protected by copyright should obtain permission of the copyright owner to do so. This can be done by obtaining a license through which the rightsholder gives permission only for certain uses of his work while still enjoying copyright ownership. Another way to obtain the rights is by way of assignment, where the copyright holder transfers the entire copyright or only certain exclusive rights copyright grants to someone else. However, obtaining permission from the rightsholder may not always be possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For certain uses, one might not always need the permission of the copyright holder, and EU copyright law provides various opportunities for this. To start with, using a trivial or insignificant part of a copyrighted work (“<a href=\"https://copyrightuser.eu/use/the-public-domain#de-minimis\">de minimis use</a>”) might be possible without the need to obtain the permission of the rightsholder. Also, copyright law limits the exclusive rights of the rightsholder by allowing third parties to use the work for certain acts without permission, like for review or criticism, teaching and research or for preservation of cultural heritage. Moreover, a copyrighted work might be used without obtaining permission if it is made available under an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/open-and-reusable-digital-cultural-heritage\">open license</a>. When this is the case, the user knows in advance that certain uses of the copyrighted work are already allowed by the rightsholder. This is mainly the case with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">Creative Commons Licenses</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us in the upcoming sessions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Did you enjoy this post? Then join our upcoming Copyright Office hours! You can see an overview of all upcoming sessions <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-2023-copyright-and-policy-office-hours\">here</a>, and&nbsp;the next one take place on 16 May.

                body: "<h3><strong>About EuropeanaTech 2023</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For almost 15 years, the Europeana Initiative has fostered collaboration, innovation and development across the cultural heritage sector. As the steward of the common European data space for cultural heritage, we will continue to lead on, and promote, the use of digital technology to make cultural heritage available online, and accessible, traceable and trustworthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The frameworks and standards that the Initiative has developed around <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">data publishing</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">data licensing</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/metadata\">data modeling</a> which underpin this work are the result of the engagement of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech community</a>, the Europeana Network Association’s collaborative and specialist group of R&amp;D professionals who have led on developments in the sector for over a decade. We are delighted that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">EuropeanaTech 2023 - Explore, Engage, Experience: cultural heritage in the data space and beyond</a> will give the floor to this community, and the new developments and technologies that will support the growth of the data space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you are a&nbsp; Tech-minded professional, developer, researcher or student working in and around digital cultural heritage, EuropeanaTech will be a fantastic opportunity to meet with, learn from and work with your peers. If you're new to EuropeanaTech, this is your opportunity to become part of a much larger community dedicated to Tech in culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But we don’t just want to see you there - you are also invited to submit your idea for how to enrich the conference! Read on to discover how.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Themes for the call for proposals&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explore&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to help people explore cultural heritage online and discover Europe’s rich heritage, cultural heritage institutions work tirelessly to structure, enrich and link their data to make digital cultural heritage more findable, accessible and interoperable. The use of automated approaches like AI assisted&nbsp;enrichments of data offers opportunities&nbsp;for new ways of interacting. The emergence of new types of data, such as 3D, also pushes us to rethink and upgrade our current process and workflows.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this conference theme, we are interested in interventions around:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Processes and workflows which facilitate the digitisation, creation,&nbsp;enrichment and management of data (including 3D)&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Standards and protocols which support the creation, sharing and reuse of Linked Data</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">New, automated approaches towards the enrichment of content and metadata including machine learning, computer vision&nbsp;and natural language processing</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engage&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage enriches lives. Access to cultural heritage in all its richness helps us learn about who we are, where we’ve come from and what we can become. The ways cultural heritage institutions provide access to cultural heritage data, and are set up to preserve, curate and deliver that data, is increasingly determining the relevance of the cultural heritage sector. Is developing decentralised models a way to make the cultural heritage sector stronger and more prominent in society? How can technology facilitate the participation of diverse audiences and communities? What advancements can be used to create a&nbsp; space for others to share their own pieces of cultural heritage with the world?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this conference theme we are interested in receiving proposals related to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Models of developments and&nbsp;collaborations between cultural heritage professionals which support better sharing of, and access to, cultural heritage data as well as increasing its impact</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Developments around user interactions and applications which support new ways to search, browse and interact with cultural heritage data (for example, through immersive experiences)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Projects and tools which facilitate the participation of audiences in the curation, enrichment, reuse of digital cultural heritage&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Activities related to open access, public domain&nbsp;and Creative Commons, making collections more accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital cultural heritage is no longer limited to 2D content, a link to a webpage and a couple of metadata fields. The diversity of data (from transcriptions and annotations, to 3D models) and the increased number of available technologies coupled with high-quality digitisation and AI have transformed the experience we can offer to audiences. We have gone beyond the paradigm of search and browse, and can now look to build rich, interactive and immersive experiences which let people explore, engage and experience the past as never before seen possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under this theme we are looking forward to hear about inspiring presentations about:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Usage of cultural heritage data (image, text, video, audio and 3D) to build user interaction and experience&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Collaboration between cultural heritage institutions and creative industries&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">New types of interactions supporting users in their interaction with cultural heritage (e.g AI chatbot, assist tools)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to apply&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To submit your application please read the detailed information on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference-call-for-proposals\">call for proposals page</a> and then complete our form through the link below. The deadline for applications is&nbsp;30 May 2023, 23:59 CEST. We can’t wait to read your proposal!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why is story important?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In one of our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h3a0hB6PzU\">recent webinars</a>, we heard from oral storyteller Claire Murphy, who summed up the answer to why story is important. She told us that telling stories is in our DNA as humans, that ‘Stories activate the brain’ and ‘create empathy’. She shared that, ‘the more you use story, the more you’ll start to see that it brings people’s attention up, it makes people buy-in and often makes people want to know more. So if you’re not using stories, you’re working harder than you have to.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through our blogs, galleries and exhibitions on the Europeana website, the Audience Engagement team at the Europeana Foundation use Europe’s cultural heritage to tell stories all the time. But we wanted to see if we could explore more creative storytelling within our exhibitions, starting with story and concentrating on creative collaboration. So for our latest exhibition for Women’s History Month - ‘<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/a-female-lens\">A female lens - Women, society and the history of photography</a>’, &nbsp;we tried out a new creative workshopping process, which also built on our&nbsp; ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/seven-tips-for-digital-storytelling\">Seven digital storytelling tips for the cultural heritage sector</a>’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

And that can be a bit scary. Not many people are trained in telling stories. It might even be something they haven’t done since they were at school. And so asking people to try something new and to leave their comfort zone is no small thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The structure of the workshops - which was set out at the beginning of the project - helped everyone to know where we were in the process, and provided time to address questions and concerns together, and to have a safe space for thinking creatively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of the workshops included moments to check in with each other, finding out how everyone felt about the current step of the process or our progress so far. The process was designed to make sure we were sharing responsibility, with no single person carrying the full responsibility for a chapter, for example. Ideas were generated and responded to together; writing and editing were collaborative, and at&nbsp; the end of each session, we asked people to make their own commitments about what they would do next.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Concept.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Brainstorm ideas</strong>: For us, this meant sharing what we already knew or were interested in on the subject of women and photography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Identify themes</strong>: Here, we saw how our ideas were naturally falling into distinct areas such as first photographs, photography for activism, or self-portraiture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Consider available content</strong>: For us, this meant looking at the content available on Europeana.eu and thinking about issues around copyright - what we could and couldn’t use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Audience connection</strong>: Here, we reminded ourselves of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/seven-tips-for-digital-storytelling\">seven digital storytelling tips</a>, and we used the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook’s</a> Empathy Map to think about the audience experience. We discussed what makes an exhibition engaging and shareable for our audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Next steps</strong>: Here, each person noted down the role they wanted to take and what they could realistically commit to doing before the next workshop.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our homework was to research the themes we identified and explore some stories that&nbsp; might be included in the exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Workshop 2. Shaping.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Review progress</strong>: As each person shared the stories they had discovered, the others listened and added words, phrases or ideas that stood out to them to our ‘Board of excitement and intrigue’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Devise structure</strong>: Together, we organised these stories and ideas into chapters.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Next steps</strong>: Each person decided what to take on next in terms of writing texts and further research.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our homework next was to write initial drafts of the chapters we had discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Workshop 3. Reflections.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Review progress</strong>: Having shared the draft texts, we reflected on what was remarkable or interesting about the ideas so far, what questions and concerns we had (for example, what was missing from the stories) and what actions we could take to remedy them.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Audience connection</strong>: We revisited the storytelling tips and shared ideas about how to apply them in this instance, for example, to include personal quotes from the people we were writing about, and to make our images work harder - we noted for example how effective it is when the text makes direct reference to a photograph, rather than having the photograph simply lie alongside the text as an illustration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Next steps</strong>: Together, we decided on editing responsibilities, making sure that nobody edited the chapter they drafted. This way, we had fresh eyes and ideas on every section.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once this round of editing was complete, we asked two external readers to proofread the texts and also make any observations they had about the content and structure and what might be missing. From here, the exhibition went into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jolan Wuyts, Collections Editor, was part of the exhibition team. He says, ‘I really enjoyed the story-first approach of this creative process. We started with the interesting individual narratives and stories we found in Europeana's database and then worked together to embed those stories into a coherent whole. This allowed me to focus on just one or two petites histoires that I was enamoured with, and then place that in the larger historical context that the rest of the exhibition provided.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The data space supporting <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/de-bias\">DE-BIAS project</a> aims to promote a more inclusive and respectful approach to the description of digital collections and the telling of stories and histories of minoritised communities. The project began in January 2023, and over the course of two years, will develop an online tool to automatically detect problematic terms in cultural heritage metadata and provide information about their problematic background. As the project starts to undertake this work, we consider it important to outline the project’s understanding of the words, concepts, and even of the mottos we use in our journey towards progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Nothing about us without us’</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Nothing about us without us’ is a motto said to have originated in early European politics (dating as far back as the 16th Century) and was first invoked by the South African disability rights movement in the 1990s. It is used to communicate the idea that no policy should be decided by any representative without the full and direct participation of members of the group(s) affected by that policy. The words strongly state the pivotal role of participation; they acknowledge the importance of taking steps to meaningfully embed community representation&nbsp; and push us to reflect on the idea that services and policies should involve members of groups and communities affected by that policy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the cultural sector, community engagement - something we see as central to the DE-BIAS project - is generally understood as a community-centred orientation based on dialogue. It aims to enable community members to better understand topics and contexts and therefore facilitate stronger relationships and participation among the cultural sector and minoritised communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But&nbsp; what about the link between these ideas and that of audience development, another central concept for European cultural policies? <a href=\"http://engageaudiences.eu/\">To the European Commission</a>, audience development is defined as a strategic, dynamic, and interactive process of making culture widely accessible. It aims at engaging individuals and communities in experiencing, enjoying, participating in and valuing the arts through various means available today for cultural operators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The definition is quite broad and aligns with that of community engagement: it refers to access, participation, and representation, the lack of which are the main barriers preventing people from taking part in cultural life. However, the term ‘audience’ could imply a passive attitude, and the term ‘development’ recalls the idea of cultural organisations as developers of visitors or spectators, with a paternalistic and top-down approach, constructing a hierarchy that we would like to see dismantled soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

This can be done through different means. Developing meaningful partnerships is surely one of them. Partnerships mean networking, creating strong relationships with different stakeholders in society, and getting in touch with diverse groups of people or communities through mediators, whose role is central to build trust and avoid biases from the very start.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Co-creation is another one. Co-creative processes entail active participation not only in activities but also in decision-making processes; this means sharing power, and although this might be a new approach for some cultural institutions, it is important to understand how communities evolve and how their evolution can be matched (and sustained!) by the institutions surrounding them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The concepts of partnerships and co-creation imply quite radical choices for cultural institutions and they are both rooted in the idea of a deep organisational change and a revolution in terms of their social, economic, and cultural accountability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ultimate outcome of both concepts-turned-actions is to create social capital and stronger relational networks within society. This is why we agreed to develop the DE-BIAS project around a strong core: the work with communities, aimed at promoting a more inclusive and respectful approach to the description of digital collections from cultural heritage institutions. Only this kind of collaboration can lead to a thorough understanding of heritage, and therefore a more enjoyable, real and respectful experience for those who engage with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can find out more about the DE-BIAS project on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/de-bias\">project page</a>, and and follow our hashtag #DeBias on social media to stay updated with our future activities.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, on 8 May 2023 the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek presented the results of the project <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/blog/sammlungsvielfalt-partizipative-kulturvermittlung-digitalisierungsfoerderung-die-deutsche-digitale-bibliothek-erhaelt-mittel-aus-neustart-kultur\">User-oriented Restructuring of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a> at a ceremony in the James-Simon-Galerie in Berlin. Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation delivered a keynote address on this special occasion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other contributors to the ceremony included the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media Claudia Roth and imminent figures from key German cultural institutions including the<a href=\"https://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/\"> Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz,</a> the<a href=\"https://www.dff.film/\"> Deutsches Filminstitut &amp; Filmmuseum </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.landesarchiv-bw.de/\">Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg</a>, to name but a few. Here’s a glimpse of what happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking back at a decade of partnership</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Germany has been a key Europeana supporter of the Europeana Initiative&nbsp; since its establishment 15 years ago. In 2005, together with five other EU Member States, Germany<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/timeline-digitisation-and-online-accessibility-cultural-heritage\"> urged the European Commission</a> to create a publicly-funded counterpart to the then-new Google Library project, giving birth to the Europeana Initiative.&nbsp; Germany has steadily supported our work ever since, consistently featuring among the top contributors to Europeana’s infrastructure both in terms of quantity and quality, with<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=COUNTRY%3A%22Germany%22&amp;query=&amp;view=grid\"> over 6 million objects</a> from more than 200 institutions available through the Europeana website. We are grateful for the contribution and commitment of the more than 250 members of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">Europeana Network Association</a> based in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As our main partner in Germany and as an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/german-digital-library\">Europeana accredited national aggregator</a> since 2012, the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek has played a leading role in this process. 10 years ago, the Europeana Initiative accompanied the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-public-beta-version-of-the-deutsche-digitale-bibliothek-is\">launch of the first public beta version of its portal</a>. This paved the way for bringing all of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions and their digitised inventories closer together, and for their integration into Europeana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In his keynote address, our General Director Harry Verwayen, highlighted, ‘Opening-up their local, regional and national collections to Europe enabled German cultural institutions to make a significant and concrete contribution to the European project: one with our shared culture at its heart. One decade later, we are proud to celebrate the relaunch of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek&nbsp; portal, centred even more on people, fostering more participation, and designed with the principles of open access right at its core.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have a PhD in archaeology, and have been working with and for GLAM institutions for over 10 years. I am currently a researcher in librarianship and archiving at the Department of Historical Studies of the University of Turin. I deal with digitisation, digital strategies and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2016 I have been the coordinator of the digital technologies commission of ICOM Italia and since 2022 I have also been a board member.&nbsp;I am general secretary of AVICOM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My research project 'Models of representation and communication of cultural heritage: innovation, sustainability, participation'&nbsp;starts from the comparative analysis of the standards and formats related to the management of cultural heritage objects. The project analyses the relationships between the models of documentary representation in the archival, bibliographic, museum fields and advanced digital technologies, including Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to promote understanding of the dynamics of interaction in Digital Libraries, and ensure that the reuse of data and crowdsourcing is seen as an innovative and sustainable tool for an inclusive dissemination and communication of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The projects in which I work are strongly multidisciplinary and one of the most challenging and interesting aspects is mediating different languages and needs in order to be able to create a good, sustainable and accessible project. My training as an archaeologist has also favored the development of interdisciplinary skills that support dialogue and mediation between different disciplines. My <a href=\"https://www.historicalstudies.unito.it/do/home.pl\">University department </a>in Turin, which is also a <a href=\"https://www.historicalstudies.unito.it/do/home.pl/View?doc=dipartimento_eccellenza.html\">department of excellence</a>, promotes dialogue and mediation with disciplines and training.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being part of the Members Council gives me the unique opportunity to share my experiences on digital strategy and digital accessibility and to be in an environment of dialogue with professionals and experts with whom I can exchange experiences, ideas and work together to support the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I will promote the importance of digital inclusion and accessibility through ever greater digital usability and understanding and accessibility of content. The accessibility of content also relates to Open Access and participatory strategies of crowdsourcing, so I hope that with this work we can make citizens increasingly aware and the main players of their own heritage.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier this year, the European Commission launched an exploratory <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/consultations/future-electronic-communications-sector-and-its-infrastructure\">consultation</a> on the future of the electronic communications sector and its infrastructure. The consultation considers the potential need for all players benefitting from digital transformation to fairly contribute to Europe’s required investments in this area in the coming years. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a> was pleased to partner up with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/\">International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions</a> (IFLA) to submit a joint response to the consultation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our joint submission, we welcome the efforts made by the European Commission to examine how to expand broadband access and ensure the capacity of networks continues to expand and support helpful innovation. On the other hand, we express our concern that this might lead to a new legal basis for telecom companies to require payments from content and application providers for sending and ‘generating’ traffic. This could have a negative impact on net neutrality and on a healthy internet which is based on openness and fairness, values that the three submitting organisations deeply cherish and defend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The joint submission highlights the particular impacts this development would have on knowledge and cultural heritage institutions. The Europeana Foundation, Creative Commons and IFLA represent galleries, libraries, archives, museums&nbsp;and other institutions and individuals that facilitate the sharing of knowledge and culture, also online. We play fundamental roles in serving communities across Europe, providing resources and services for enjoyment, education, research and the advancement of knowledge, and stimulating creativity and innovation in the service of an open, democratic and trusted digital environment. The Europeana Foundation concretely works towards this vision in its role as steward of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a>, and all three co-signatory organisations work towards a digital environment where access to culture is not jeopardised or monopolised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the institutions and communities we support, these new tolls would pose particular concerns. Knowledge and cultural institutions act as repositories for large amounts of data — we are responsible for collecting, storing, and making available all sorts of media and information to the general public, often under public mandates. While an individual user may not make use of the entire catalogue of information, collectively serving our communities can mean serving large amounts of data. Moreover, knowledge and cultural institutions serve academics and researchers who do require access to large amounts of the corpus for their public-interest activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We fear that, under this premise, such institutions could be considered ‘large traffic generators’ and forced to pay new fees. As public serving institutions, they already face significant budget strains, and new fees would inevitably mean limiting the services we provide, and using our resources to bolster the turnover of telecom operators rather than to deliver on our missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we note in our joint submission, there are many other ways to support open, robust and affordable internet access, including expanding access for wireless services and community networks, modernising universal service funding, and collaborating with knowledge and cultural institutions, which in some cases already work to provide Internet access to surrounding residents. We hope these and other ideas will become the focus as this consultation moves forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Foundation, Creative Commons and IFLA stand ready to work with the European Commission and other stakeholders on alternative ways to ensure open internet and equal treatment of data traffic for all, in line with the principle of net neutrality.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Building a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage\">common European data space for cultural heritage</a> where data can be easily shared for reuse requires organisations that create data infrastructures&nbsp; to rely, as much as possible, on unique and persistent identifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the steward of the data space, Europeana Foundation, together with the 18 consortium members, is investing resources in reviewing the adoption and implementation of persistent identifiers in the cultural heritage sector. Read on to discover what persistent identifiers are, how we are doing this, and how you can get involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is a persistent identifier?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Persistent Identifier (PID) is a globally unique and long-lasting reference to potentially any sort of digital or non-digital entity, providing the information required to reliably identify, verify, locate and access it. They ensure that the digital entity is ‘set in stone’ and can always be findable through that identifier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Examples of PIDs are <a href=\"https://arks.org/about/\">Archival Resource Key (ARK)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.doi.org/\">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/references/best-practice-for-national-bibliographic-agencies-in-a-digital-age/resource-description-and-standards/identifiers/national-bibliography-number-nbn/\">National Bibliography Numbers (NBN)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pidconsortium.net/\">Persistent Identifiers for eResearch (ePIC)</a>, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To see how they work in practice, take, for example, the Mona Lisa (La Joconde). The painting is identified by an ARK persistent identifier, ‘ark:/53355/cl010066723’. If this persistent identifier is entered into relevant software (in this case, it can be resolved via the <a href=\"https://arks.org/about/n2t-global-resolver/\">N2T global resolver</a> to ‘<a href=\"https://n2t.net/ark:/53355/cl010066723\">https://n2t.net/ark:/53355/cl010066723</a>)’ it then presents the webpage from the Louvre where the digitised object is presented alongside its digital representations. La Joconde will always be identifiable and findable on the web through this identifier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why are persistent identifiers important for the data space for cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Persistent identification sits at the foundation of the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">FAIR principles</a> which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The adoption of persistent identifiers by cultural heritage institutions with digital collections shows commitment towards interoperability and data access that in turn builds trust in the institution and the data it creates. Adoption of persistent identifiers will also support the dissemination and reuse of cultural heritage objects, helping to make them more accessible to audiences across the data space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not assigning persistent identifiers to digitised cultural heritage objects can also have a negative impact. The most common manifestation of the absence of a persistent identifier strategy are broken links which, besides affecting all forms of (re)use, also negatively impact the traffic towards the institution’s website and its SEO ranking amongst search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Your input is key</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to establish a consolidated and more robust persistent identification framework for the data space, and to do that, we need to understand your practices and activities towards the creation and management of persistent identifiers. Easier access to cultural heritage data, interoperability within and beyond the data space, discovery and reuse of cultural heritage data depend on it!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you work in the technical or operational teams of a cultural heritage institution, and know how your institution manages identifiers for digitised objects, or if you are running an aggregation service, we invite you to take approximately 15 minutes to answer our survey. Please also share it with other colleagues that are most involved in this work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The deadline for survey responses is <strong>30 June 2023</strong>. Thank you in advance for your participation!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

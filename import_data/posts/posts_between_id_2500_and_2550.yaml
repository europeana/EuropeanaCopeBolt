                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Minoritised communities often feel that their heritage and its meaning is misunderstood or misrepresented in digitised collections, particularly when they do not see themselves represented by official institutions in the member states of the European Union, like the Romani people. Europeana offers a particularly interesting opportunity to address this, as dispersed collections are brought together from different sources, and can form a more complete picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/\">WEAVE’s</a> series of 25+ LabDays brought concerned communities and heritage institutions together&nbsp;to understand how institutions can improve their strategies, approaches and workflows to make sure community collections are better collected, described and made visible.&nbsp; The hope is that the ingredients from each of the LabDays can be sources of inspiration for other organisations and the wider arts and policy sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The&nbsp;examples below highlight how 3D modelling tools can prompt users to rethink space within the cultural heritage sector, and also discuss language in relation to bodies, archives and disability. Throughout, we see that the need to bring together people from diverse backgrounds is essential to regeneration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Brave conversations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Navigating equality, inclusion and diversity themes can bring up dense and hard-to-swallow thoughts and emotions. Organisations, individuals,&nbsp;community members and artists might feel the need to ‘walk on eggshells’ rather than&nbsp;confront&nbsp;issues straight on.&nbsp;However, within WEAVE we wanted to speak respectfully, bravely and candidly about Equality Diversity Inclusion (EDI)-related topics and the emotional labour attached to these conversations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of this work, in February and March 2022, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-weave-event-series-on-diversity-and-inclusion\">Europeana WEAVE event series</a> for cultural heritage professionals gave&nbsp;participants the necessary tools to understand the effects of historical representation of underrepresented communities, and also&nbsp;to reflect on how cultural heritage institutions can support diversity and inclusion and&nbsp;the role of Europeana in this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The series created a sustainable capacity building resource for cultural heritage professionals, including videos&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Europeana_GS_meeting/WEAVE-workbook.pdf\">facilitator’s handbook</a> to repeat the workshop in their own community or organisation. The event was supported by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-weave-event-series-on-diversity-and-inclusion-workbook\">workbook</a> that attendees could use for the entire series, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-weave-event-series-on-diversity-and-inclusion#europeana-weave-final-cafe\">recap videos are available</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Digital annotations for dance&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dance is central to WEAVE's work and, along with other types of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), is an important component of our research into 3D modelling. We recently ran an event with the <a href=\"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FS00016X%2F1\">SCHEDAR</a> project, whose team is equally interested in dance and is&nbsp;committed to devising a set of guidelines and frameworks for tools that influence existing intangible cultural heritage motion databases. Both projects aim to facilitate the preservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage while also ensuring that technology develops in accordance with the needs of key stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At a <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/2022/01/25/capacity-building-ws4/\">LabDay on this topic</a>, the WEAVE team shared a demonstration of the WEAVE Toolkit, including the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/motionnotes\">MotionNotes annotator</a> and 3D modelling tools, and demonstrated how it can be used to annotate traditional Portuguese folk dance. This was followed by a demonstration on how the MotionNotes tool can be used within 3D modelling environments. Stephen Jürgens, a researcher at <a href=\"https://www.unl.pt/\">Universidade NOVA Lisboa</a> (UNL), and the&nbsp;WEAVE team spoke about co-design sessions with dance experts from <a href=\"http://pedexumbo.com\">PédeXumbo</a>, explaining how UNL's team entered into dialogue with the Portuguese traditional dance community to inform design elements of the digital annotation tools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Dance, archives, disability and able-bodied-ness</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thinking about archives, dance, disability and able-bodied-ness raises several questions in terms of narrative, language and equality. The COVUNI team curated a <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/2022/01/10/capacity-building-ws/\">capacity building event</a> with this in mind, bringing together researchers, artists, activists and practitioners to reflect on the intersections and challenges of archives, dance and disability. Among other topics, the event considered questions around the vocabulary used to talk about disability, dance and archives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fundraising</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Produced in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.onedanceuk.org\">OneDanceUK</a>, a further capacity building webinar aimed&nbsp;to support UK-based <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pulse/global-majority-we-need-talk-labels-bame-campbell-stephens-mbe/\">Global Majority</a> dance artists to better understand the current UK fundraising landscape and to discover how to navigate their own narrative of being a Global Majority practitioner when creating a case for support. These ‘Fundraising 101’ training sessions grew directly out of an urgent need expressed by freelance artists and dance companies who have been struggling to sustain themselves in the last five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event aimed to support participants to build confidence and knowledge and, most importantly, join the conversation on how to weave the vital experiences, identities, and expertise of&nbsp; Global Majority communities into potentially successful funding bids.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about these events and access resources from WEAVE, <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/\">visit the project website.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Enabling automatic translation for enrichment&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An API tool developed by project partner Pangeanic detects the language used in Europeana metadata, and allows it to be machine translated. Named the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/heritage-metadata-automatic-translation-system\">Heritage Metadata Automatic Translation Service (HM ATS)</a>, this tool is part of a suite of semantic enrichment tools developed by Europeana XX.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To create the tool, Pangeanic built 10 neural machine translation engines (translating Italian, German, Czech, Greek, French, Swedish, Catalan, Dutch, Polish, and Spanish to English). They used training data from Pangeanic’s own repositories and open data on the internet. Pangeanic also employed translators to translate a limited amount of records from Europeana repositories in order to have Europeana specific training data for several languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The tool was used to translate and enrich approximately two and a half million records during the project. Pangeanic successfully extended and fine-tuned the tool to fit the performance requirements of such a massive volume of data. <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/jhn-ngo/hmats-xx\">Use the API code yourself.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To evaluate and validate the quality of machine translation, partners also set up a translation validation system (based on <a href=\"https://labelstud.io/\">LabelStudio</a>). Cultural heritage professionals and native speakers of relevant languages have validated more than 2,700 translations using this system. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, confirming the high quality of the neural machine translation and and that it works well for the domain of digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Validated translations will be used to further improve machine translation engines in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate project</a>, in which Pangeanic is also involved. The goal of this project is to help Europeana progress on the implementation of its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-multilingual-strategy\">multilingual strategy</a>, by providing metadata translations that will enable better search and display of its collections across their native languages and the users' languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Enrichment for datasets</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/sage\">SAGE</a>, a web-based tool for producing, enriching, publishing, accessing and managing RDF datasets, was developed by the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) for Europeana XX. RDF (resource description framework) is a language used to represent the content of a dataset. RDF data can be directly imported or generated from diverse data sources and formats, organised in datasets, and enriched using annotators. These&nbsp; enrichments can then be manually validated. All datasets, including any annotations, can be published in RDF stores, indexed and accessed through API calls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to SAGE, selected parts of published datasets can also now be annotated and enriched through external API services, such as tools linking data to relevant Wikidata, DBPedia, Geonames and other resources, or tools that detect occurrences of vocabulary terms in the data.&nbsp;Once enrichments are made in SAGE, they are then manually validated through a system that allows bulk validations using text grouping and text frequency sorting, assignment of validation tasks to multiple users, and close monitoring of the overall validation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The SAGE tool was also used in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/pagode-europeana-china\">Pagode project</a> to automatically enrich more than 20,000 records. It will also be used in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted\">CRAFTED project</a> to analyse metadata fields and text extracted from Artificial Intelligence content analysis tools in order to identify and remove uncertainty from named entities. The ultimate aim is to enrich more than 100,000 records and enable user validation and assessment of automatically extracted entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can explore all of the tools developed under the Europeana XX project (and other Generic Services projects) on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/services-and-tools#tools\">Europeana Services and Tools page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I love the route I followed to my profession in cultural heritage! It’s been a quest through very different routes that brought me – finally! – to discover my real passions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coming from a family of anesthesiologists, pharmacists and doctors my life seemed already written and it was no surprise that I studied Pharmacy at university. In Italian there’s a saying, ‘Impara l’arte e mettila da parte’ (literally ‘Learn the art and put it apart’), meaning that it’s good to acquire a new skill and then use it when you need it - or never! I learned chemistry and never spent a day in my life in a laboratory, at least not a chemical one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During my studies I started working in the hotel industry. I fell in love with all the things that attract people to different destinations and enjoyed creating experiences for them (at that time I wasn’t calling them ‘experiences’ but suggestions of things to do). At the same time, I was exploring all the possibilities that the internet offered to promote the business I was working in. I was one of the first hoteliers to use Facebook, even when the business pages didn’t exist yet. I have wanted to understand every aspect of the digital world since I received my first email (yes, I’m that old!) and had to build a new website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this context, after years of self-training, I co-founded <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-invasioni-digitali-s-marianna-marcucci-guest-speaker-for-europeana-communicators-solve-it-session\">‘Invasioni Digitali’ (Digital Invasions)</a>, a project which aims to promote the value of, and engagement with, local cultural heritage by combining social media and storytelling. Finally, I was back to my Humanist persona combined with the ‘new’ skill of Digital Media Curator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m actually working on a few different projects with some amazing international partners. I just want to mention two of them: the first is related to capacity building for young women from disadvantaged areas and post-conflict&nbsp;countries. It aims to improve their social and professional integration by improving youth workers’ capacity to engage them in grassroots projects for the sustainable development of local communities. Young women living in post-conflict countries or in countries facing profound social transformation will become real changemakers, and working on establishing a grassroots project will support them to develop their capacities and skills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second project focuses on implementing EU policy recommendations by developing the digital skills of heritage house owners in Europe. The project works to provide training to owners and their employees so that they can overcome the negative impacts of the COVID-19 crisis by developing digital activities related to communication and cultural heritage. It aims to foster the development, commercialisation&nbsp;and promotion of tourism connected to cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are living a very intense period in terms of rethinking human interactions within the digital world. As a ‘digital hybrid’ I feel all the excitement of these new opportunities now as I did when I first received my first email! I think the biggest (and my favourite) challenge&nbsp;in my work is to put the human at the centre of the ‘Uni-Meta-verse’ when speaking about our cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve been a big fan of Europeana since I discovered it and joined the Europeana Network Association. I thought this was the right moment to go one step forward– well more as I’m also in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a>! –&nbsp; to mix my experiences with those of the many talented professionals in the network. My goal is to share and learn as much as I can!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor and Management Board member?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I will try to promote diversity, change, and innovation. These are the drivers of my motivation. What inspires me to work every day is to build the future believing, as I do, that through culture and communication it is possible to make society and the world better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Empowerment through collaboration: I will try to help to grow the Europeana Network Association and support it to be more and more innovative!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

For example, if you’re looking at the ‘art’ collection, you’ll find stories related to art just after the search results. Linking these different kinds of content invites people to explore the richness of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can now also search for stories within a collection (content&nbsp;organised by topic, century or organisation - find links to these on the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections\">Collections</a> page). Let’s take the art collection as an example again. When you search for ‘Frida Kahlo’ within this collection, you’ll discover both search results for ‘Frida Kahlo’, and stories related to ‘Frida Kahlo’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And it works the other way around too! You can find links to relevant collections on exhibition pages and blog posts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Updated collection page design</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have also&nbsp;updated the layout of the collection pages. All essential information, such as the collection title and description, is now more prominent,&nbsp; including the links to related collections. Plus, a ‘Share’ option beneath the description let’s you easily share these fascinating pages on social media.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/digital-transformation-task-force\">Digital Transformation Task Force</a> built on the work that Europeana has undertaken to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">build digital capacity</a> across the cultural heritage sector, which has included identifying capacity building needed to support the sector in its digital transformation. The goal of the Task Force was to collectively understand current challenges of the cultural heritage sector and to work together on mapping out a clear, practical plan of action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Task Force was the first to be run across the Europeana Initiative, involving representatives from the Europeana Network Association, Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, Europeana Foundation and two independent members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why was a Europeana Initiative-wide Task Force initiated?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no one-size-fits-all solution for the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector - it will take a different form for every individual and every organisation. However, by taking a united and collaborative approach we can gain a shared understanding of how to harness the potential that digital transformation offers our sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This collaborative approach was something that we hoped to work towards through running an initiative-wide Task Force. Only by working together - and in this case, by including independent members - can we determine collaborative actions that will have a bigger impact than within our respective organisational bodies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What were the results from the Task Force?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Task Force has resulted in three pieces of work: the ‘Guide to Digital Transformation in Cultural Heritage’ which summarises the learnings we had during the course of the Task Force; the 'Digital Transformation Report’ that details the actions this Task Force undertook; and an internal draft action plan that is currently being discussed in the Europeana Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/Guide_to_digital_transformation_in_cultural_heritage.pdf\">The Guide</a> is a deliberately bold and ambitious piece of work, offering recommendations that frame an approach to digital transformation for the whole cultural heritage sector. The approach it recommends is values-led, guided by a commitment to be purposeful, inclusive and ethical so that we can address wider societal issues such as social justice, equity and the climate crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana_Network_Task_Forces/Final_reports/Digital_transformation_report.pdf\">The Report</a> sets out the thinking behind the Guide and the research and work carried out by the Task Force that led to its creation. It also includes recommendations for actions to ensure that the Guide has the reach and impact needed to successfully support the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plan describes how to start working on the recommendations in the guide. It supports the Europeana Initiative's mission to ‘empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation’ and its view that digital transformation is ‘made possible through capacity-building efforts that lead to actions, outcomes (changes in behaviour and attitudes) and impact’. It will be used internally to create an Initiative-wide agenda for digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was our experience of running a Europeana Initiative-wide Task Force?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One important learning was that clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the Task Force representatives was key. We discussed questions like: what decisions can they make? What are the processes to go back to their stakeholders? How much time can each of the participants spend on the Task Force? Knowing and discussing the answers to these questions was essential for the success of the Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A further learning of the Task Force was around the importance of a shared vocabulary (something which Europeana has been working towards with our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/glossary\">Glossary of Terms</a>). One its first activities was to agree on definitions of the topics we were tasked to work on. Ensuring that we agreed on their interpretation was a key step to collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also found that for a Europeana Initiative wide Task Force, having an independent party with relevant expertise involved was very helpful. This Task Force relied on the support of independent charity <a href=\"https://www.culture24.org.uk/\">Culture24</a>, who were contracted to guide the Task Force. Having a neutral party supporting the Task Force meant that Europeana Foundation staff could contribute unambiguously, and roles were separated better. Culture24 had also been involved in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-digital-transformation-agenda-and-glams-culture24-findings-and-outcomes\">earlier relevant activities</a> so could bring in their expertise and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The clear benefit of an Initiative-wide Task Force was that it allowed us to share experiences and gain insight into opportunities and challenges across the Initiative and cultural heritage sector. This will hopefully result in actions that have wide support and are achievable for all stakeholders. We strongly support the initiation of future Initiative-wide Task Forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the next steps?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Task Force concludes its work with this news post and by publishing the outcomes. The next step for Task Force members is to involve the rest of the Europeana Initiative to solidify the plans the Task Force has drawn up. Thanks to all the Task Force participants for their contribution and Culture24 for their support!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We encourage you to download the Task Force Report and Guide through the link below,&nbsp;and to join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association\">Europeana Network Association</a> to hear about opportunities to join future Task Forces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

For the first time in 100 years, researchers will be able to ‘step back in time’ to explore a virtual recreation of the Public Record Office of Ireland and its collections which were destroyed in a fire on 30 June 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 1922, the Public Record Office of Ireland stored over seven centuries of Irish records dating back to the time of the Normans in Ireland. Hundreds of thousands of precious historical documents relating to all aspects of Irish life were lost, including invaluable census records dating from before the Irish Famine in the 1840s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland has been developed by <a href=\"https://beyond2022.ie/\">Beyond 2022</a>, an international collaborative research project working to create a virtual reconstruction of the destroyed Public Record Office of Ireland. Beyond 2022 has been developed by historians in Trinity College Dublin and computer scientists in the Science Foundation Ireland ADAPT Centre, in partnership with five core partners: National Archives, Ireland, National Archives, UK, Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, Irish Manuscripts Commission and the Library of Trinity College Dublin.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-383301f4-7fff-77cd-e3ce-52822de8eaf7\">Rich collections and digitally reconnected archives</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://virtualtreasury.ie/\">Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland</a> now provides access to 50 million words of searchable text spanning seven centuries; 150,000+ database records; 6,000+ maps; and 2.7 million knowledge graph triples.

Digitally reconnecting archival sources is for me the epitome of digital transformation, and only made possible by the diligent work of archivists, librarians and conservators, who everyday preserve, catalogue and digitise collections, making our shared history accessible for everyone. The Beyond 2022 project is an exemplar in international cooperation and its immersive 3D repository is a model that Europeana and the cultural heritage sector should explore and develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explore the archive</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Virtual Record Treasury is an open-access resource, freely available online to all those interested in Irish history around the world - <a href=\"http://virtualtreasury.ie/\">explore it now</a>.</p>\r\n"

It will bridge regional innovation gaps and harness the power of these sectors, as key drivers of economic growth and job creation, to support Europe’s cultural leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Culture is not only our common language, it is also an innovating ecosystem,’ says Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner. ‘The new EIT Culture &amp; Creativity Innovation Community will capitalise on the unique richness of European diversity to guarantee that creatives are ingrained in the pan-European Innovation Ecosystem. I look forward to observing the growth of this sector's innovators and start-ups under EIT's innovative approach, which has had a significant impact on the lives of Europeans over the previous decade.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Along with our long-standing collaborative partner, <a href=\"https://www.timemachine.eu/striking-change-in-europe-the-eit-culture-creativity/\">Time Machine Organisation</a>, Europeana Foundation is delighted to be a part of ICE - Innovation by Creative Economy, the <a href=\"https://eit.europa.eu/sites/default/files/winning_consortium_factsheet.pdf\">consortium of partners</a> that has won the bid to deliver this initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Networks and partnerships</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has been strengthening Europe’s capacity to innovate since 2008. With a network of 3,000 partners and over 60 innovation hubs spanning the continent, the EIT is the largest innovation ecosystem of its kind. The <a href=\"https://eit.europa.eu/news-events/news/multi-million-euro-partnership-culture-and-creativity-launched-eit-culture\">announcement of the EIT Culture &amp; Creativity</a> brings the total number of&nbsp;EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities to nine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bernd Fesel, spokesperson for ICE- Innovation by Creative Economy, said: ‘We can’t wait to start work and to lay the foundation for our vision. Our 50 Partners across 20 nations have bold and brave ideas for the role of innovation in these sectors and industries and we are very much looking forward to uniting and excelling creatives with Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation, said: ‘We are delighted to be part of EIT Culture &amp; Creativity, which will create fantastic opportunities for both new and established professionals across the cultural and creative sectors. By joining forces with our long-standing colleagues at the Time Machine Organisation, and other institutions in the partnership, we will be able to share its benefits with the thousands of cultural heritage professionals in our joint networks.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Frédéric Kaplan, President of the Time Machine Organisation, said: ‘With the new EIT Culture &amp; Creativity the different players in this sector can look forward to a new era of collaboration, innovation and support. Time Machine Organisation is proud to be actively involved in this adventure, working side-by-side with our partner Europeana Foundation as members of EIT Culture &amp; Creativity and reaching out to an ever-growing community of cultural and creative players, eager to advance the innovation in the European cultural heritage sector together with us!’</p>\r\n"

They can bring history to life with first-hand accounts and add value to education by fostering critical thinking and stimulating creativity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One way to help the public engage with this heritage can be through activities related to subtitling, which encourage people to dive into audiovisual clips in detail in a friendly and fun way while enriching the clips for future use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subbit! is a perfect example of such an activity. Through in person events, an online campaign and competition, Subbit invites people to edit and correct AI-generated subtitles of archival audiovisual clips from various European heritage collections available on the Europeana website. These include Spanish programmes, Italian newsreels, Dutch documentaries, and much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subbit! is an initiative of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled</a> Generic Services project, which focuses on the theme of ‘Broadcasting Europe’. The project highlights the social, political, and economical changes that shaped European history, as documented on television from the 1930s onwards. It adapts AI technology to cultural heritage audiovisual material to produce high-quality closed captions and English subtitles for selected video content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who can take part?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Language and media enthusiasts, translation lovers, and advanced language students - as well as students of media and technology - fascinated by European television stories are invited to take part in the Subbit! campaign.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Embedding impact in the Europeana Initiative&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our impact word of the last 12 months has been ‘<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/embedding\">embedding</a>’ - embedding impact design, measurement, narration and evaluation approaches to different areas of work in the Europeana Foundation and across the Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, we now evaluate all Zoom events and webinars by using the Zoom post-event survey functionality, which allows us to monitor satisfaction rates across our capacity building activities and to iteratively collect feedback and implement improvements. We use impact to help us manage and develop Europeana’s Frameworks and we are thinking about impact when designing a holistic approach to products which support&nbsp;data and metadata quality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We already see the results of our work to highlight the value of an impact-focussed approach to project design and delivery. For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX project</a>&nbsp;has followed all four stages of the Europeana Impact Playbook and used the&nbsp;impact findings to shape a final presentation to the European Commission. Two Generic Service projects, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enricheuropeana\">EnrichEuropeana+</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate</a>, have both had impact workshops at an early stage and are moving on to data collection. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/jewish-history-tours\">Jewish History Tours</a> Generic Services project is using an impact lens to consider legacy and to feed into the sustainability plan due later this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sharing knowledge about our impact as a convenor of digital cultural heritage professionals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As well as sharing how we are embedding impact, we have to think about what we are learning through it. Since 2019, we have been collecting data about the impact of our annual conferences and how they contribute to building capacity for digital transformation, and this year is no exception. At <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2022</a> we will conduct our fourth impact assessment of our annual event, giving us four years of data with which we can compare the impact of convening the Europeana Network Association.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Similarly, we&nbsp;conducted a satisfaction and impact survey of Europeana Network Association (ENA) members in 2020 and 2021. We published the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europeana-network-association-2021\">Impact Assessment of the ENA in&nbsp;2021</a> late last year and we are currently analysing the data from 2022. We can already see increased satisfaction with the Network and similar numbers of Network members suggest that the Network is important for their daily work. As with our annual conferences,&nbsp;monitoring the satisfaction of ENA members and the impact of membership helps us to improve outcomes for Network members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Developing the Europeana Impact Framework</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2022 we published the final phase of the iterative four-phase Europeana Impact Playbook! <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-four\">Phase four</a>, dedicated to the evaluation of your impact assessment approach, was steered by a group of external advisors and has had feedback from across the Europeana. Phase four sets out three ways you can evaluate your impact assessment processes, from a light touch debrief to a survey of your colleagues to a Team-Based Inquiry cycle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Phase four, we also build on ‘embedding’, looking at what this means. We introduce our Theory of Change and set out five principles to guide the Europeana Impact Framework:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Stakeholder-focussed</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Participatory and inclusive</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reflective and critical</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Efficient and effective</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Useful and proactive</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These principles will shape our revision of Phase two later this year (<a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a> if you’d like to help out!) and it has guided the ongoing development of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-standardised-question-bank\">Europeana Standardised Question Bank</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They also inform the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-lite-training-community-building-taskforce\">Impact Lite Training and Community Building Task</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-lite-training-community-building-taskforce\"> Force</a>. With over 20 active participants and observers, the Task Force meets monthly to guide the design of an impact lite methodology - namely, a streamlined approach to the Impact Playbook phases - alongside capacity building resources to skill you up quickly in the key components of each phase.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nurturing an Impact Community</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, the Europeana Impact Community aspires to stimulate reflective, considerate and purposeful discussions around the topic of impact assessment and to empower the digital cultural heritage sector with the skills and resources they need to apply an impact approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having had a busy year in 2020/2021 with the launch of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars#impact\">Impact webinars</a> and a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/research-and-digital-cultural-heritage-new-impact-horizons\">collaboration with the Research Community</a>, 2021/2022 has mostly been focused on the Impact Lite Task Force. We have published our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-community-work-plan-2022\">2022 work plan</a> and plan to nurture connections between Community members through networking events later in 2022. We also welcomed new members to our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community#steering-group\">Steering Group</a> and the Community continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re not already a member, we warmly invite you to join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community</a> via the Europeana Network Association. You can also join our <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017/\">LinkedIn group</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those that are interested, this is the third ‘impact review’ we have completed - read about what we learned in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-europeana-s-impact-introducing-our-impact-assessment-reports\">2019/2022</a> and in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/highlights-from-a-year-of-working-on-impact-for-cultural-heritage\">2020/2021</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also download the Impact Playbook, including the newly published Phase four. If you have any feedback on the Playbook, or any aspect of our impact approach, don’t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Producing the tours</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jewish History Tours is co-led by <a href=\"https://jhn.ngo\">Jewish Heritage Network</a>, which operates the Jewish aggregator of Europeana (Judaica Europeana), and its technological partner <a href=\"https://pangeanic.com/\">Pangeanic</a>. Thanks to the partnership with <a href=\"https://jewisheritage.org/\">AEPJ</a>, a network of Jewish organisations, the project is developing a network of self-guided tours across multiple locations in Europe, all with a rich history of Jewish life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, halfway into the project, partners have developed tours in more than 10 locations in Europe and its vicinity: Berlin, Barcelona, Lublin, Sighet, Halberstadt, Ismir, Minsk, Polotsk and Baku.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The tours are produced by local partners, building on their knowledge of local Jewish history and the sites telling those stories. Often the tours include items from digitised collections made available by the project on Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a tour is prepared by the local partner, the project enhances it using a powerful suite of AI-powered tools: <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />the tours are translated into European languages and an AI-generated voiceover is added. Both the translation and the voiceover are of near-human quality. The tours mentioned above will shortly have translation and voiceover added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Supporting tourism&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Strengthening the connection between heritage and tourism is a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/tourism/offer/cultural_en\">strategic priority of the European Union</a>. Jewish History Tours addresses this priority by establishing a strategic cooperation between Europeana and <a href=\"https://j-story.org/projects/jewish-history-tours\">Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe</a>, a powerful network of more than 40 European touristic routes, collectively representing several thousand destinations and sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each tour from the Jewish History Tours project is published on platforms aimed at tourists. All the tours are published on <a href=\"https://cliomusetours.com/contributor/jewish-history-tours/\">Clio Muse Tours</a>, an award-winning Greek startup and a partner of the project, and on <a href=\"https://izi.travel/nl\">izi.Travel</a>, the open storytelling platform. The tours will also be published on local platforms (such as <a href=\"https://azerbaijan.travel/\">Azerbaijan Travel</a>) and platforms dedicated to Jewish heritage tourism (<a href=\"https://www.worldjewishtravel.org/\">World Jewish Travel</a>). The project is actively exploring partnerships with commercial partners in the tourism world (hotels, travel companies) to increase the reach of the developed tours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana is a strategic partner in this project, not only publishing a wealth of new materials about <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/jewish-heritage\">Jewish life in Europe</a> but also enjoying its innovative technology for location-based enrichment of digitised collections. As part of the project, Europeana is working to enhance the API with an ability to query by location.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more and get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />As the project continues building self-guided tours in various European locations (soon to be expected: Alsace, Moldova, Malaga), we are inviting other heritage organisations, platforms for tourists and tourist businesses as well as destination marketing organisations to reach out by emailing <a href=\"mailto:info@jhn.ngo\">info@jhn.ngo</a> to explore partnership opportunities with the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also <a href=\"https://j-story.org/projects/jewish-history-tours\">explore and enjoy the tours on the J-Story platform</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am a history nerd and bookworm. As a child, I was obsessed with the Habsburg dynasty - I borrowed all the books from the library and read every piece I could find.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the ‘dark’ nineties, the only thing (without internet) available to me was an encyclopaedia. I flipped through the pages and read dates and facts, feeling that everything about the world, stories about famous people, culture, was available to me in my living room. I was obsessed and began to love history - I wanted to understand the past and the present, not knowing what would be possible only ten years later with the world wide web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be ‘closer’ to facts and history, I started studying archives and information science in Marburg, to learn how to read old manuscripts and understand how files and information were stored and how to access and structure them. I then worked in the German Federal Archives and was responsible for the documents in the Military Archives Department and especially about the Second World War. I assisted users in the investigation of National Socialist crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The archive could not quench my thirst for knowledge, and my curiosity brought me back to the university, where I did my PhD in Military Cultural History and Cultural Anthropology. I visited archives on two continents (Europe, Russia and the US) and was still searching for more data and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My expertise in WWII and archival science was again in demand when I was responsible for a scanning project at the GHI in Moscow and for a project at the Archives Nationals in Luxembourg.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2018, I have been at the University of Luxembourg at the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History and can once again combine my areas of expertise - information/data management and Second World War/military history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the <a href=\"https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/projects/warlux-soldiers-and-their-communities-wwii-impact-and-legacy-war-experiences-luxembourg\">WARLUX project</a>,&nbsp;I am investigating the war experience of Luxembourg's wartime generation. I coordinate the collection of ego-documents (diaries, letters, memoirs) via a crowdsourcing campaign and I lead the digitisation and curation of the documents. We are currently starting an HTR process to make the war letters machine-readable and prepare them for more extensive textual analysis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the indexing and HTR process, we also already have to think about the sustainability and accessibility of the collection. With the crowdsourcing campaign, we have created a unique collection of war stories of Luxemburgers. We are a research institution, so we are not an archive - we have a research data repository, of course, but it is not meant for public access. We have to find a solution to make the digital collection accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are some practical challenges in the work that we are undertaking. After digitising the documents, especially the war letters, which was relatively quick, the tricky part began: indexing and curating the letters. We have received over 5,000 letters; the documents were structured according to the origin, but within the individual collection, we could not go too deep into the inventory for reasons of time and personnel. For some collections, we had to prepare the analysis, indexing each letter (sender, recipient, place, date, keywords, brief content), which takes a lot of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, we started the HTR process with Transkribus. Some handwriting can be handled very well with the software, for others, are more challenging, for example, multilingual text sections. A Luxembourgish language model does not yet exist - we hope this will change in cooperation with the Department of Computer Linguistics at the university.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My favourite part of this process is interacting with the families and the donors. The crowdsourcing process was very interactive, and participation can be seen as an additional resource. For example, we got a lot of photo albums where we didn't know who was who - the son or daughter of the person in question could explain the context or even tell us stories about the family. Secondly, the digital heritage aspect is fascinating about my work. After the HTR process, we can visualise and ‘map’ the biographical stories of the people to see the letters and the single stories in another light.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I already knew Europeana from my years of working in the cultural sector - but the 1914/1918 project and the crowdsourcing campaign impressed me - and I thought: ‘WOW, I want to do that too!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What caught my attention was the participatory aspect of working with the public. Europeana showed me that it is not only made for professionals, but also for you and me and everyone in Europe and the world,&nbsp;to share, exchange, preserve and benefit from cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Council Member, I would like to connect science with cultural heritage by engaging in collaboration with university students and researchers with Europeana collections - and advising cultural heritage institutions on how they can improve their catalogues for research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, I would like to connect the Europeana network with colleagues in Ukraine to support the preservation of Ukrainian online cultural heritage, offer training or share expertise.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> is an online learning platform developed by EuroClio - European Association of History Educators, Europeana, USE and Webtic, to support the use of cultural heritage collections in education. Historiana curates source collections, which provide teachers with a ready made group of sources they can use in their lessons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historiana’s new source collection, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/european-association-of-history-educators/the-1920-antwerp-olympics\">The 1920 Antwerp Olympics</a>, tells the story of a historical Olympic Games, hosted in the vibrant but, at that time, war-ravaged city of Antwerp, Belgium. 25 original photos of this collection provide a glimpse into how sports games have been evolving over time, the daily life of Europeans in the 1920s, and the aftermath of World War I. Read more about the stories behind the source collection in this <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/the-1920-olympics-games-in-antwerp\">Europeana blog</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new collection is inspired by a project created by students in Mechelen&nbsp;under the guidance of sports historian Jurryt van der Vooren. Jurryt shares his experience of creating the collection with his students and gives inspiration for further activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Virtual visits for education</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Covid-19 pandemic was truly a challenge for history teaching and learning. History lessons became even more distant, because pupils could not go to cultural heritage sites to see, touch and feel historical objects. But at the same time, it prompted educators to get creative: to discover and make use of digital repositories - which is what Jurryt has done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During his time teaching in Mechelen, Jurryt wanted to visit&nbsp;Sportimonium, a Belgian sports heritage centre, where a collection of 300 - 400 images is available, with his students Unfortunately, it was closed due to the pandemic. This brought Jurryt to Europeana, where the museum's collection <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/collections/organisation/1482250000004514696-sportimonium\">can be ‘visited’ online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using Europeana, he tasked each student with finding four pictures about the 1920 Antwerp Olympic Games. The students were also asked to include a short explanation of why they were interested in the photos they chose.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A student-made source collection</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the research, one student found out that he was now living right at the place where the cycling events were held in 1920. The champion, Maurice Peeters, was born in Antwerp, but won the race as a Dutch sportsman. At moments like this, when the findings became personal for the students, Jurryt felt that his learning activity had achieved its goal. How amazing it is to discover that the history of the Olympics is somehow connected to your personal history!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some students, who themselves do sports, even wrote down small stories of how they had also been part of the Belgian national team. They enjoyed looking back to the events organised more than 100 years ago, and reflecting on&nbsp;how some things were different but some still stayed the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These personal thoughts and ideas, instead of the champions or the number of medals, were what Jurryt wanted the students to write about. 'There is no official history,' he remembered telling the students. 'There is just your own version of history, and you are part of it.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another class activity that Jurryt enjoyed was to have the students imagine: 'if you were responsible for building a national sports museum, what would you like to show?'&nbsp;This exercise often stirred up heated class discussions. For example, the students debated the questions of whether to showcase the French part or the Dutch part of Belgium's sports history. They also had many opinions on the question of having foreign players in the Belgian national football team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jurryt always reminded the students that there was no good or bad answer. 'You are&nbsp; teaching me,' he told them. 'Now I am not your teacher. You are my teachers, telling me your opinions about sports and about Belgium.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building your own source collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This learning activity is not something reserved only for the 1920 Olympics. As long as enough source materials are available, it can also be done about other countries and about tournaments. The important thing is to not look only at the sports itself, but be aware also of aspects such as sexism, racism, or political influences&nbsp;during research and discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jurryt offered his ideas about potential topics. The <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/the-1928-olympic-games-in-amsterdam\">1928 Olympics in Amsterdam</a>, for instance, was viewed as an important event for Germany because it marked their return to the Olympics after World War I. Having students research the German view of the 1928 Olympics, then compare it to the Dutch or the French perspectives, would be a stimulating class activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jurryt built this activity for students between 18 and 21 years old, but it can also be done with other age ranges. Students&nbsp;grow up in a digitised world; what educators need to teach them is not how to use the internet,&nbsp;but about how they can find the right sources of information, and how to evaluate the reliability of these sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are and educator and are interested in incorporating cultural heritage collections into your curriculum then visit Historiana, which offers a wide range of curated sources accompanied by detailed explanations of the sources’ history contexts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Last year over 1,600 people from 86 countries registered for our annual conference, and we can’t wait to welcome you back for Europeana 2022. Over three days we will explore the opportunities and challenges facing our sector, give voice to cultural heritage experts and provide plenty of opportunities for you to network and make new connections. This year you can join us in The Hague, or online. Read on to find out more about the options available to you, and what to expect at the conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Data space, storytelling and EuropeanaTech</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2022 will offer the opportunity to discuss and hear from experts on some of the biggest topics in digital cultural heritage today. We have an exciting three days of exploration planned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming years, the development of a number of European data spaces will boost the movement of information across Europe, enabling different sectors to connect, create, improve and thrive. At Europeana, we are excited to start exploring how we can build the common European data space for cultural heritage and <strong>day one</strong> of Europeana 2022 will highlight the fantastic opportunities it presents. Join to find out what a <strong>data space</strong> means in practice and for Europeana as we know it. Gain a wider understanding of data spaces overall and where Europeana and the data space for cultural heritage fits into that picture. Discover practical examples of the opportunities for engagement, funding, learning and creation the data space can offer and how we can collectively use this to promote the meaningful use of cultural heritage data in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Join us on <strong>day two</strong> to explore stories, culture and society. At Europeana we often talk about putting digital cultural heritage to good use in the world - we want it to bring communities together, to foster shared identities, to create connections. On day two we’ll hear from people who are doing just that - using shared cultures and their own <strong>storytelling</strong> expertise to bring people together, to experience a sense of connection and co-creation, and to make difficult things a little easier to talk about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally on <strong>day three</strong> we will hear from <strong>EuropeanaTech </strong>on how technology paves the way to digital inclusion and cultural heritage preservation. Learn from experts about the technical aspects of digitisation and conservation of cultural heritage worldwide. Discover new initiatives and developments in technologies, hot topics and areas in R&amp;D, questions around the digital divide and other socio-economic perspectives, and opportunities for collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There will be opportunities to interact with each other, for you to ask questions, and to share your thoughts about the topics of each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A hybrid experience</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In designing Europeana 2022 we have built on the experiences of our previous two digital conferences and are looking to explore new models for our annual conference that better reflect the world we live in. Our aim is to ensure we provide a rewarding and fulfilling experience regardless of how you choose to participate, so this year we’ve designed two different experiences for you to choose which one suits you best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our morning sessions will see keynotes and panels from some of the leading thinkers and doers in the sector. These sessions will be open to all, equally accessible whether you are in The Hague, watching from your home or in the office with your colleagues. In the afternoon sessions will be split between on-site and online, and guests who join in The Hague will also get opportunities to network and socialise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are looking forward to seeing an exciting mix of cultural heritage practitioners at the conference, and encourage both those new to the sector - including students - and a regular at Europeana events to join us and connect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Secure your place now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You have two options to book your ticket;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">&nbsp;Do you want to attend online?&nbsp; That’s free to everyone and tickets are unlimited!&nbsp;Register now for your free online ticket.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Do you want to join in on-site?

                body: "<h3><strong>The transposition process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A draft Bill for transposing the CDSM Directive in the Netherlands was published in July 2019. It was accompanied by a public consultation from July to September 2019, which was answered by three umbrella organisations of libraries, museums and archives with a shared <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/libraries-archives-and-museums-working-together-on-copyright-the-dutch-example\">submission</a>. Debates in the two chambers of the Dutch Parliament followed and the final text was adopted by the First Parliamentary Chamber in December 2021, accompanied by an Explanatory Memorandum which provides interpretations where the legislative text is not clear enough. The provisions concerning cultural heritage institutions went into effect on 7 June 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions were recognised as stakeholders in this process and were given the opportunity to comment on confidential drafts during meetings with both the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the implementation process was finished,the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science initiated a stakeholder dialogue on the topic of out-of-commerce works, as mandated by the Directive. This dialogue is still ongoing, and another on the topic of text and data mining will soon be initiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Text and data mining</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The two exceptions to copyright for text and data mining in the CDSM Directive allow for the creation of reproductions for this purpose without the need to ask the rightsholder for permission, under certain conditions. Their transposition into Dutch law resulted in changes being made to the Dutch Copyright Act, the Neighbouring Rights Act and the Databases Act. The transposition of both exceptions generally follows the text of the Directive closely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first exception allows research organisations and cultural heritage institutions to mine any type of material. The transposition text did not put conditions for storing and retaining copies made in this process. The second text and data mining exception allows for the mining of text and data by anyone (not limited to research organisations or cultural heritage institutions) as long as the rights owner does not ‘expressly reserve’ these rights. No indication was provided on what an ‘express reservation’ means or on whether it should specifically mention text and data mining. Neither of the exceptions require paying compensation to right holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preservation of cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before the transposition of the Directive, Dutch copyright law foresaw an exception to copyright which allowed cultural heritage institutions and some educational establishments to make copies of works in their collections for preservation purposes without rightsholder permission. This included making both physical (for works threatened by imminent decay) and digital reproductions, without a maximum number of copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transposition of the preservation exception brought various changes. Materials that can be preserved now also include databases, but educational establishments unfortunately are no longer beneficiaries (though archives and libraries of educational establishments are). The condition of imminent threat of decay justifying physical copies no longer applies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exception only applies to materials that are permanently held in the collections of the cultural heritage institution, understood as for example ‘owned’ or received in a loan for an indefinite period of time. A provision was added that a contractual clause that forbids a cultural heritage institution to make copies for preservation purposes is not enforceable. Unfortunately technological protection measures can still block the possibility to make copies for preservation purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital and cross-border teaching activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dutch copyright law already foresaw an exception allowing the use of copyright-protected materials for teaching purposes by educational institutions, without the need to ask for permission. This was subject to remuneration (except for when using databases), and implicitly included digital and online uses. When transposing the Directive, the Dutch legislator chose to update this exception instead of switching to a licence-based model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result, educational establishments can now make use of copyright-protected materials for teaching purposes, on their premises or elsewhere (made implicit), offline and online, including via ‘secure electronic environments’ for pupils, students and teaching staff. This can be across-borders too, and cannot be overridden by contractual measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Dutch legislator also brought in conditions such as the need for works to have lawfully been made available to the public, and the need to respect moral rights. Only part of a work can be used unless it concerns a short work or a work of visual or applied art or a photograph.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Out of commerce works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of commerce works are in copyright works in collections of cultural heritage institutions that are no longer, or were never, available commercially. In line with the Directive, Dutch copyright law now provides for a system based on a licence and an exception to allow cultural heritage institutions to make out of commerce works available online. The text does not introduce any definition of out of commerce works beyond the text of the Directive, but the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science may introduce regulatory measures in this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In line with the Directive, the Dutch text establishes that rights holders can opt-out of their works being shared under this system, and adds that the cultural heritage institution at play must be given a reasonable term to act upon it.

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en\">Museum für Naturkunde Berlin – Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science</a> is an integrated research-based museum within the&nbsp;Leibniz Association. It is one of the most important research institutions worldwide in the areas of biological and geological evolution and biodiversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our mission is to discover and describe life and earth – with people, through dialogue. As a research museum and innovative communication platform, we want to engage with and influence the scientific and societal discourse about the future of our planet, worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did your funded project focus on? And how was it developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project built on a series of three workshops focusing on the question how the Anthropocene, the ‘Age of Humankind’ in which human activities impact the Earth system dramatically, will affect and change our practices and the organisation of knowledge in museums and archives. I was responsible for the Europeana grant related activities together with my colleagues Elisabeth Heyne, Project Lead of ‘Changing Nature Collecting the Anthropocene Together’, and Elisa Hermann, Head of Department Discovery Service and Information Management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our institution runs ‘<a href=\"http://changing-natures.org/\">Changing Natures. Collecting the Anthropocene Together</a>’, a collaboration with the Muséem national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris, France, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (MESR). Taking an open science approach to collection development, collaboration invites members of the public to contribute to a digital collection on the subject of environmental change by sharing personal objects and the stories and memories linked to them. The aim is to encourage experimentation with new collecting practices, narratives and representations of the Anthropocene and open opportunities for a broader dialogue that engages actors from society and science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The series of workshops we organised with the support of a Europeana grant are connected with and provide input to this bigger project. In addition, the questions discussed during the workshops drive the museum's <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/science/collection-discovery-and-development\">Collection discovery and development project</a>. Socially relevant research questions are our central drive here. As a modern research and information infrastructure, our collection will be fully integrated into the European landscape and made interoperable in both analogue and digital form, thus enabling holistic access.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the outcome - how can someone use it?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshop results provide a comprehensive interdisciplinary overview and introduction to current discussions on the Anthropocene and museum practices. We published the <a href=\"https://riojournal.com/article/89446/\">workshop report</a> on RIO | Research Ideas and Outcomes platform so it can be used by anyone to to approach and explore the topic of the Anthropocene and cultural heritage, and to reflect on their own work from this point of view. It also provides ideas for further collaborations. Europeana Pro audiences can also benefit from an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research-collaborations-museum-fuer-naturkunde-berlin\">abridged version of the report</a>. The results of the workshops also provide ideas for further collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have you learned from this experience about crowdsourcing for cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshops have successfully demonstrated that the engagement with Anthropocenic objects can provide a compelling gateway to reflection on current practices in cultural heritage. Crowdsourcing projects can address topics from different perspectives. At the same time, they bring with them the challenge of combining different professional languages, as well as professional and public discourse and cultural contexts. Projects should focus much more on multiperspectivity and acknowledge the importance of notions and language in order to create mutual understanding and dialogue – and crowdsourcing can be an important factor here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">H<strong>ow can crowdsourcing initiatives be designed to meet the needs of researchers?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our workshops have shown that it is essential to include the perspective of many and to reflect constantly on which perspectives are missing, overlooked or even excluded in the project design. The needs of scientists must therefore be only one part of the design of crowdsourcing initiatives. From my perspective, it would be important to be able to know who is contributing to a crowdsourcing initiative and with what intention. This information should be less about personal data and more about the context of the contribution and the contributor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are your plans for the future of the project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We see the workshops as a starting point for further discussion and collaboration. Through the publication of the workshop report, we want to make the results usable for both science and practice and stimulate further exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you for telling us about the project!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to find out more about the participatory project at Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, visit the <a href=\"https://www.changing-natures.org/\">collection platform “Changing Natures”.</a>&nbsp;You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">join the Europeana Research Community</a> to be the first to hear about further opportunities for collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>What is Outcome Harvesting?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outcome Harvesting is a methodology developed by evaluator and consultant Ricardo Wilson-Grau and colleagues. It can help you to understand and verify whether change has occurred as a result of your actions in complex and long-term situations where it may be difficult to define specific goals for an activity. This could be, for example, when objectives or goals hadn’t been determined in advance of the activity beginning, or when it evolved over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outcome Harvesting is a six-step evaluation methodology that can be used in more complex situations <a href=\"https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/outcome_harvesting\">‘where relations of cause and effect are not fully understood’</a>. Information about outcomes are ‘harvested’ and analysed across different steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Map the users of the Outcome Harvest and identify stakeholders</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Define the research question</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Map the outcomes (document review, consultation with partners)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Substantiate the outcomes with your stakeholder(s)&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Interpret and analyse your results</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use the findings</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is an outcome in Outcome Harvesting?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike simple descriptive outcomes that identify changes in behaviour or attitude (for example, increased likelihood to visit an exhibition), an outcome in Outcome Harvesting is rich and descriptive. It can range anywhere from a sentence to several paragraphs long. It should cover the who, what, why, where and how. The ‘who’ is particularly important - those involved have to be identified to help with the substantiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When should Outcome Harvesting be used?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outcome Harvesting can be used when you are focussed more on outcomes (effectiveness) than activities (efficiency) and when, for example, activities might develop organically over time; when you want to know more about processes of change; and when the relationship between cause and effect is complex. You can find out more on the <a href=\"https://www.betterevaluation.org/en/plan/approach/outcome_harvesting\">BetterEvaluation website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did we use Outcome Harvesting in Europeana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we felt that Outcome Harvesting was a suitable and exciting approach to pilot in our impact assessment of Europeana and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a>’s contribution to the implementation of IIIF (a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale). The descriptive ‘outcome’ that we investigated was if the adoption of IIIF by the Nationalmuseum, Sweden’s museum of Art and Design (2016-2017) was thanks to Europeana’s promotion of the tool and support from Europeana in implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As this was a new methodology for us we sought advice and coaching on the methodology from an external expert. It took a lot of time and we relied on the participation of partners involved in or connected to EuropeanaTech and IIIF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We interviewed seven stakeholders in interviews lasting from one hour to 90 minutes. Interviews proved to be an effective way to introduce the interviewees to the methodology, though, interestingly, we learned that Outcome Harvesting most commonly captures written responses using surveys or other methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, we found that we could not substantiate this outcome in a verification interview. This means that we couldn’t prove that the museum adopted IIIF as a result of Europeana or EuropeanaTech’s actions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did we learn?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we couldn’t substantiate our outcome, by asking other questions around the Outcome Harvest data collection, we did, however, have other learnings. For example, we could see in an in-depth case study that digital change can take place very slowly, and that it can take a lot of time to adopt new technology. We identified some of the many different factors that influence an organisation’s digital transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We concluded that without the work of the EuropeanaTech Community, there would be no IIIF data on the Europeana platform. EuropeanaTech increased the momentum and visibility of IIIF amongst the cultural heritage community, facilitated exchange between Europeana, cultural heritage institutions and tech professionals, and provided a space for experimentation and technical advancement. Yet we lack the data that would help us investigate if and how EuropeanaTech contributed to an increase in IIIF-compliant data on Europeana. The lack of data is the result of the time it takes to make new or adapt existing technical infrastructures. This time frame, and the complexity of the context, also makes attributing one factor or trigger for change very difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our original brief did not fully anticipate the complexity of the research area. Though the Outcome Harvesting methodology was ultimately not suitable for investigating change in this context, it helped us to identify tangible outcomes and check whether these had been achieved with relevant stakeholders. Though Outcome Harvesting is designed for complex situations, we noted that it has limitations when used in a complex context with a slow pace of change and many other influencing factors. Further research, and a longer-term perspective, would be needed to adequately address the research question we asked.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more detail about how we applied Outcome Harvesting in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech impact assessment</a>.

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://historia.uw.edu.pl/\">Faculty of History of the University of Warsaw</a> is one of the leading humanist research centres in Poland. It aims to educate professionals who can explain the present by following the course of social, political, economic and cultural processes in societies throughout history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many prominent historians participate in the research and teaching activities of the Faculty of History. It conducts unique research on the ancient world, non-European civilizations, as well as on the auxiliary sciences of history. The results of this research, to a large extent, shape the image of Polish historical science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did your project focus on? And how was it developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Geographic data is important in many areas of cultural heritage, from the use of 3D models of excavation sites in archeology, to guided tours through cultural landscapes using the abilities of smartphones. With the support of the Europeana research grant, to connect researchers and professionals from the GLAM sector we created a workshop on 'Cultural Heritage Geodata Citizen Science: Polish Perspectives', which was held at the University of Warsaw in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshop explored current questions around crowdsourcing cultural heritage geodata, especially Polish perspectives on providing geographical data. It looked at&nbsp;crowdsourcing for cultural heritage, data infrastructure guidelines and best practices, institutional perspectives and the way forward for cultural heritage geodata in Poland. The workshop also encouraged an exchange of experiences, networking, and highlighted the importance of coordination among cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the outcome?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the workshop, we issued the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/6814297#.Yue32HZBy5c\">Warsaw Statement on Cultural Heritage Geodata</a>, which&nbsp; provides an overview of the themes addressed on that occasion, as well as additional information and resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have you learned from this experience about crowdsourcing for cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage is a large and diverse field. The challenge is that the issues are complex. During the workshop, when we discussed crowdsourcing, we were reminded how important individual situations and contexts are. Not just the individual people, but the relationships among people participating in a project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can crowdsourcing initiatives be designed to meet the needs of researchers?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Involving researchers early and often is critically important in crowdsourcing initiatives. Institutional, cultural and political aspects are very significant and require considerable attention throughout the design and implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are your plans for the future of the project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We now refer professionals working in Polish cultural heritage institutions to the Warsaw Statement on Cultural Heritage Geodata (with Polish translation) and the recap video of the workshop. We will also share the document with international colleagues. We see the Warsaw Statement as a reference for the development of our future cooperations with cultural heritage institutions in Poland and around Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the missions at the core of Europeana is to enable archives, libraries and museums from across Europe to showcase and share their collections online. At Photoconsortium, we believe in the importance of publishing high quality data to enable reuse, following the guidance of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. As an accredited Europeana aggregator, we work with Europeana data partners and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum to make this happen, so that cultural heritage data is aggregated, enriched and shared for others to benefit from.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Exploring all things golf</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An example of the immense possibilities for reuse of high quality content comes from <a href=\"https://museodellagrafica.sma.unipi.it/en/\">Museo della Grafica in Pisa</a>, a long-term partner of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/photoconsortium\">Photoconsortium</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the occasion of an important golf cup in Pisa, Museo della Grafica organised and is hosting a new exhibition entitled <a href=\"https://museodellagrafica.sma.unipi.it/2022/06/golf-is-art-immagini-e-storie-di-sport/\">Golf is Art. Immagini e storie di sport</a>, to share golfing history and stories The title of the exhibition recalls Rudyard Kipling’s words (‘Why Golf is Art and Art is Golf / we have not far to seek…’, 1898), and the selection of prints and objects it offers takes visitors through a distinguished and surprising journey, showcasing imagery of golf in arts, literature, fashion and tourism. The exhibition opened on 1 July 2022 and can be visited until September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The artworks exhibited were selected from private collections in Italy, including prints, posters, drawings and other artifacts related to golf from the early modern age to the present day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Incorporating Europeana content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to offer the visitors a more international experience, Museo della Grafica decided to include a number of reproductions of artworks sourced from Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the first step, a diligent search was performed on the Europeana website to select prints, posters and photographs about golf from various collections. Photoconsortium also collaborated with the museum’s staff to search for items that offer possibilities of reuse in a public exhibition and which are represented by digital objects of sufficient quality, suitable for print. Photoconsortium also suggested the most appropriate credits for the images that clearly indicate the content holder and the license. The digital files and the full captions were downloaded from Europeana and then printed and framed to be included in the physical exhibition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Executive summary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report presents findings and outcomes of the discussions from the French Presidency Europeana Conference ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/building-the-common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage-together\">Building the Common European Data Space for cultural heritage togethe</a>r’ on 1 March 2022. This digital conference was delivered as part of Europeana DSI-4 . It was held under the auspices of the French Presidency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture of France and the Mobilier National.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital ambitions and priorities of the French Presidency include: laying the foundations for a European industrial data-sharing culture, supporting the creation of European data spaces; keeping up the momentum on the digital decade; accelerating the twin green and digital transitions; and reinforcing Europe’s security in the digital age. France hopes to move forward two major pieces of EU legislation on digital protections - the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) while Paris holds the EU chair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana conference involved 330 participants from 43 countries across the sector. The event brought together policymakers from European ministries of culture, the CEDCHE Expert Group, representatives of the European Commission, aggregators, and professionals from cultural heritage institutions. The conference aimed to stimulate reflection and dialogue around the creation of the common European data space for cultural heritage - the needs, the key challenges and the aspirations for achieving it. It aimed to create a basis for collaborative ongoing dialogue among the stakeholders and actors in efforts towards the building of the data space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event explored the speakers’ and participants’ visions for the data space for cultural heritage, its building blocks and how they’re interconnected, as well as its aims and desired features. It looked at some of the aspects of the European Commission’s recommendation for the creation of the data space and Europe’s support instruments and mechanisms. Participants also discussed the process of contributing to the creation of a data space for cultural heritage compared to the current process of contributing to the Europeana Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The data space aims to make digital content available for access, use and reuse, provide new services and products, and create data for SMEs and startups. For the data space to succeed, a robust infrastructure, high quality data, rules on access and engagement, governance, multilingualism and interoperability are required. The participants envision a value-driven common European data space for cultural heritage: a safe, democratic, inclusive and reciprocal public digital space. Building a data space is an ambitious vision by definition, but the sector is not starting from scratch. It’s building on what has been developed in the past decade by the Europeana Initiative. However, building on what exists does not imply that it will be an easy task; transforming the current infrastructure into a data space will be challenging. The participants acknowledged that the building of the data space will be a work in progress for some years before getting fully functional. The participants agreed all actors and stakeholders need to work collaboratively in the same direction for the success of the data space. It requires the entire sector to be both invested&nbsp; and active, and to embrace the contribution of other sectors and the public. The added value that the data space for cultural heritage can bring to other data spaces is in sharing best practices, models, standards and frameworks as well as sharing the data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the most important elements for the development of the data space were considered to be: a robust technical and technological infrastructure, interoperability, connection to other data spaces, multilingualism, 3D, long-term digital preservation, data quantity and quality, bridging gaps in capacity and funding, aggregation and aggregator communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the challenges ahead were identified to be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Data quality constantly evolves and criteria become obsolete</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Standards and technologies around data aggregation and sharing evolve and impact infrastructures and data quality&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">National strategies go in different directions, aren’t harmonised and in some cases lack alignment with the vision for the data space</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Multilingualism</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lack or shortage of resources</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the needs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Shared understanding and vision</p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n        <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A shared understanding of requirements and rules for participation and engagement</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n        <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Motivation of cultural heritage institutions&nbsp;</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Policies</p>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n        <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Harmonisation and alignment&nbsp;

The summary stays loyal and honest to what emerged from the discussions, but some reorganisation and synthesis has been applied to encapsulate the ideas that stood out so that they become useful concepts for further discussion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are no ‘final conclusions’. We consider this report to be the basic findings that all stakeholders and actors can continue to work with to develop new insights and refine their thinking as the work on designing and building the data space progresses. This event was the first organised after the publication of the Recommendation by the European Commission related to the European Common data space for Cultural Heritage. This Presidency conference set the scene for the transformation of the Europeana Initiative and initiated the conversation with relevant stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative will continue to facilitate conversations on a common European data space for cultural heritage, building on the outcomes of this meeting. Together with stakeholders and members of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation will explore what was missing from the conversation and where the Europeana Initiative can be most effective, and support the development of the data space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most important outcome of this conference was the call for unity and action. Only if all actors and stakeholders work together collaboratively, can we ensure the success of the common European data space for cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Download the full report below.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for having me! <a href=\"https://esm.ee/about-us/introduction\">Estonian War Museum – General Laidoner Museum</a> is a rather small memory institution operating under the administration of the Estonian Ministry of Defence and focusing on researching and popularising Estonian military history. Despite our small numbers, we have been quite successful in recent years in international cooperation: we have an ongoing project with Latvian partners on military heritage tourism. An annual Baltic military history conference that we are hosting with the Baltic Defence College, has already become a custom. At the same time, everyday work continues with the museum's collections. And that’s what got us interested in crowdsourcing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did your project focus on? And how was it developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We wanted to know why Estonian museums and memory institutions are not very keen on starting crowdsourcing projects, even if involving volunteers in museums’ activities is quite common. We also wanted to explore how to highlight the idea of crowdsourcing, which could be very beneficial for museums as well as for volunteers, to both parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We came up with a questionnaire that we distributed among museums. Based on the feedback of 19 different institutions, we learned more about their experiences as well as hesitations or prejudices related to crowdsourcing. In spring we had a two-day workshop with Dr. Mia Ridge from the British Library, where we discussed the results of the survey and learned a lot more about developing crowdsourcing plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the outcome - how can someone use it?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First and foremost, the project produced five crowdsourcing plans, in various stages of development. But, more importantly, preparing these plans provided an opportunity for participants to think about and to become aware of different aspects of a crowdsourcing project as well as different meanings of success in this regard. And now that these plans are ready, they could encourage museums that participated to take the next step to really start with their own crowdsourcing project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have you learned from this experience about crowdsourcing for cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It all comes down to planning. Planning is the key element to the success or failure of a project. And by that I don’t mean only budget or Excel sheets, but preparation for working with volunteers, considering their needs during the project and being there for volunteers when they need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, it was encouraging to learn that when planning has been done properly, even small museums and memory institutions can launch a crowdsourcing project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can crowdsourcing initiatives be designed to meet the needs of researchers?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Close cooperation between the project development team and researchers from the start would be the perfect solution here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are your plans for the future of the project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m happy to announce that two out of five crowdsourcing plans developed this spring are going to become real crowdsourcing projects already this year. The Estonian National Museum starts with a project that aims to collect people’s stories and experiences about gardening and edible plants in September. If everything goes as planned, we are going to start with our project about the Estonian Defence League photo collection later this autumn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bringing together events professionals at the start of the pandemic&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the two and a half years since COVID-19 entered our lives, the world has been trying to manage and adjust. There has been a plethora of research, articles and blog posts about how we experienced the pandemic, and the changes made to the way we fundamentally exist, meet and do business with each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the pandemic broke out, event professionals were tasked with a next-to-impossible task overnight; cancel everything and set up virtual alternatives. To accommodate these changes, online event programme tools proliferated and new approaches had to be developed. You can read some of our reflections on these changes in an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-is-here-to-stay-the-impact-of-the-new-normal-on-meetings-and-events\">earlier Pro news post</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it became clear that things would not get back to ‘normal’ for a while, the Europeana Events team started to reach out to other event professionals working in the cultural heritage sector to organise regular informal virtual coffees. With this, a small community was born. Within the group, it was easy to talk to each other, share concerns, and most importantly, experiences! Researching and trying all kinds of new tools and programmes was an easier task as a group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using our learnings - the move toward hybrid events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fast forward two years, our communities are now accustomed to not travelling, and interacting with each other online, via a diverse range of online tools. Yet with the possibility of events happening in person again, event professionals are heading to a new challenge of organising professional, engaging on-site events with an equally engaging virtual alternative running simultaneously!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, this change isn’t an easy one. Depending on the quality you are aiming for and to make sure that both your audiences are getting the same experience, hybrid events take a lot more effort and a significantly larger budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking back at previous on-site-only events, the biggest difference is probably that most roles and responsibilities have been duplicated. So start early by recruiting the help of colleagues to run your hybrid event in the smoothest way possible. Not only do you need people looking after your on-site guests but also people looking after your online guests at every single session are needed. Clear communication between those two groups is key to creating a successful event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This does not only apply to the plenary or parallel sessions but also to coffee breaks and lunch. Think about running a nice video for your online guests while your on-site guests are having a coffee or lunch and make those breaks longer so people get enough time to network or can get away from their computers. With regards to the technical support at your venue, we advise working with a company that has experience in bringing both audiences nicely together on one platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have recently added guidance for running hybrid events to the Europeana events toolkit, so if you are looking for guidance to organise a hybrid event, make sure that you <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/events-toolkit#hybrid-events\">check out the webpage</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building on our learnings, we are pleased that this year’s conference Europeana 2022 - making digital culture count - is hybrid and available to attend on-site or online. <a href=\"https://pretix.eu/Europeana-Foundation/europeana-2022/\">Register now to attend.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally, over the last two years, our Event managers' support group has grown into a great community of peers, a place to meet, learn and share. Right now, the group represents a wide range of cultural heritage organisations and is more than happy to welcome any new members. If this caught your attention and you are interested in learning more, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:gina.vanderlinden@europeana.eu\">gina.vanderlinden@europeana.eu</a> We look forward to meeting you!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is Historiana?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost 10 years ago, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/euroclio\">EuroClio</a> set out to create an online education platform that could help teachers promote multiperspective history. We aimed to give them access to curated and ready to use transnational source collections, organised around specific themes: Conflict and Cooperation, Ideas and Ideologies, Life and Leisure, People on the Move, Rights and Responsibilities, The Environment, and Work and Technology. It was 2013, and <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/historiana/\">Historiana</a> was born.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historiana&nbsp;has now evolved into EuroClio’s online alternative to a European history textbook for secondary schools. It is an engaging and interactive platform which seeks to promote critical thinking and multiperspectivity. Most importantly, it is flexible: as history is an ever evolving subject, our digital source collections, modules, and (e)Learning Activities can be easily updated to reflect our new understanding of past events.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Time is of the essence: live sessions to spark inspiration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every time we develop a new functionality or new content for Historiana, we do it in cooperation with teachers and educators from across Europe. This helps&nbsp; to ensure that they are easy-to-use and useful for students and education professionals in multiple educational contexts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, in the field of education and of cultural heritage, time is of the essence: curricula are packed, new exhibitions requiring the development of educational processes approach quickly, and there are only so many hours in a day. Not many educators have the time to explore Historiana to understand how to engage with the platform to develop educational content from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For this reason, in addition to offering ready-to-use content like <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/historical-content\">Source Collections</a> made with cultural heritage content from Europeana, over the past few years we have decided to offer an increasing number of live events. Formats like webinars, in-person workshops, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/realising-the-potential-of-glam-collections-through-partnerships-between-educators-and-cultural-heritage-professionals\">co-creation meetings</a> dedicated to cultural heritage institutes help to create a spark and inspire educators on new ways to approach digitised sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making resources available - at all times&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We try to plan at least two online and one in-person workshops per year. But what should educators do if they would like to learn about using Historiana at a time when one isn’t planned? We are happy to answer that question by announcing the launch of three Historiana Youtube playlists which can be accessed by educators on demand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The playlists cover a variety of topics. In the,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBO8poGFF8AbLtPEknrv4FW3sFWRkckaI\">What is Historiana?</a>, playlists, you will find short animations that walk you through each of the main sections of the platform (Historical Content, Teaching and Learning, the eActivity Builder, and the Search Sources section). This is a great place for educators to start&nbsp; if you are new to Historiana and need an introduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The playlist on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBO8poGFF8AaANBYruTHbsVZqj-I5pSTD\">Historiana Tutorials</a>&nbsp;is the place to go if you are using the platform for the first time, and want to be sure that you know how to make an account, develop eLearning Activites, and share them with your students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, in the playlist on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBO8poGFF8Abpf77oaHqBU3O-zF5Qg9lX\">Teaching with Historiana</a>&nbsp;you can find the recordings of all the webinars we have hosted in the past two years. Each recording lasts around one hours, and focuses on a theme or event (such as, the First World War, the Reformation, or the Rise of Medieval Universities), on a Historiana functionality (such as the Sorting or the Discovery Tools), or on a specific historical thinking skill (Change and Continuity, or Perspective Taking, for example). All the webinars were recorded live, and present practical examples that you can use to develop your own content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Help us shape the future tools and sources of inspiration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to our playlists, educators can always access our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teacher-training-guide\">Teacher Training Guide</a>, or reach out to me at <a href=\"mailto:alice@euroclio.eu\">alice@euroclio.eu</a> to set up a personalised co-creation meeting. Co-creation meetings bring together cultural heritage institutions and educators from across Europe to engage with high quality visual sources and create educational resources that can help enrich the classroom practice together. Have a look at <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/realising-the-potential-of-glam-collections-through-partnerships-between-educators-and-cultural-heritage-professionals\">this recent post</a> to learn more about what this entails.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September, we will also begin work on three new elements that we will add to Historiana’s resources: a self-paced course on how to develop quality education materials; a guide on ‘the Art of Questioning’, and a series of animations on specific historical concepts (such as multiperspectivity, propaganda, or mass media).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can stay up to date with Historiana’s work by following the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/174903892528456\">Historiana Facebook Group</a>, or <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/newsletter/?_ga=2.155024122.373450154.1661263444-1343332279.1661263444&amp;_gl=1*1qtiong*_ga*MTM0MzMzMjI3OS4xNjYxMjYzNDQ0*_ga_YVLRV8F5ZS*MTY2MTI2MzQ0NC4xLjAuMTY2MTI2MzQ0NC4wLjAuMA..\">register for the EuroClio Newsletter</a> to receive dedicated Historiana spotlights.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The effort, which was supported by a group of resourceful Europeana educators, engaged more than 1,600 primary and secondary school teachers, museum educators, and other cultural heritage professionals. This enthusiastic community created educational resources with Europeana content or used them in formal and non-formal educational activities, impacting almost 13,000 students. What innovative activities did Europeana and European Schoolnet organise to ensure this engagement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>'Digital Education with Cultural Heritage' MOOC re-run</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 'Digital Education with Cultural Heritage' MOOC re-run offered participants the chance to deepen their knowledge of digital cultural heritage in four languages: English, Italian, Greek and, for the very first time, Croatian. The English version kicked off in early February and ran until late March, while the other language versions started a few weeks later and ended in mid-May.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">About 2,500 educators registered for the MOOC re-run, which presented updated content and new activities compared to the 2021 edition. Over one fifth of participants successfully completed the online course, which attracted educators from more than 50 countries, mainly secondary school teachers. Participants were invited to explore ways to bridge the gap between formal and non-formal education, using digital cultural heritage and innovative pedagogies. The course also showcased examples and good practices to inspire and help participants design their own learning experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Teaching with Europeana blog</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With more than 98,000 page views and over 34,000 users accessing its content between September 2021 - June 2022, the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana</a> blog has been shown to be a valuable tool for educators. It provides a free space to discuss and reflect on educational practices, while showcasing a wide range of learning resources to easily integrate digital cultural heritage into everyday educational practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since September 2021, about 100 new learning scenarios and over 20 stories of implementation have been produced for the blog. These offer inspiration and guidance to educators who want to bring cultural heritage into their activities, overcoming the gap between formal and non-formal education. The significant number of new contributions is the result of the engagement and work of a large community made up of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education-ambassadors-network\">11 teacher ambassadors and three museum ambassadors</a>, 99 Europeana User Group teachers, 13 Europeana User Group museum educators and participants of the ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/sign-up-now-for-the-europeana-mooc-digital-education-with-cultural-heritage\">Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ MOOC re-run</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Education Competition 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Education Competition 2022 invited primary and secondary school teachers, non-formal educators and cultural heritage professionals to find innovative ways of using artistic and scientific educational heritage in their activities. 111 entries were submitted from 18 different countries, and the authors of the 21 best resources were rewarded with an invitation to a face-to-face workshop at the <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/professional-development/future-classroom-lab#:~:text=Created%20by%20European%20Schoolnet%2C%20the,and%20design%20in%20their%20classrooms.\">Future Classroom Lab</a> in Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Europeana workshop</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After two long years, the first post-pandemic face-to-face workshop organised by European Schoolnet with the support of Europeana took place between the 10 - 11 June. 35 Europeana educators, including 14 Ambassadors and the 21 winners of the Europeana Education Competition 2022 met at the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/european_schoolnet/albums/72177720299781127/with/52145308466/\">Future Classroom Lab</a> to share their experience and be inspired. On the first day, participants discussed the differences and similarities of their educational contexts, explored Europeana future developments and shared perspectives on digital resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the second day, participants worked collaboratively to give tips and share their pedagogical experiences about creating resources, mentoring programmes, and interdisciplinary approaches to digital cultural heritage. Then, they moved to the <a href=\"https://historia-europa.ep.eu/en/welcome-house-european-history\">House of European History</a> where they attended <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/built-with-bits-brussels-kicks-off-at-festival-of-the-new-european-bauhaus\">a workshop dedicated to Built with Bits</a>, a mentoring programme related to New European Bauhaus.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The National Museums of World Culture is responsible for the non European collections in Sweden. Inside this administration there are four museums: in Stockholm, the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, the Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities, and the Ethnographic Museum; and the Museum of World Cultures in Gothenburg.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does your work focus on? And how was it developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together, the National Museums of World Culture of Sweden and the University of Gothenburg lead a project entitled ‘Digital Repatriation of Cultural Heritage in the Global South’. This project focuses on the Swedish&nbsp;database for museum collections <a href=\"https://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-vkm/web\">‘Carlotta’</a>, in particular on digital representations of objects originally belonging to indigenous communities in the Brazilian Amazon, especially Wai Wai.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past few months our aim has been to experiment with a tool to improve decolonisation of data, in terms of changing the balance of who is producing knowledge for and to whom. The Western idea of the archive and museological traditions that Swedish collections reflect can bring with them problems of inaccurate or problematic categorisation and the traces of racist beliefs. For example, the Carlotta database does not allow users to create new paths that link objects stored in Sweden to indigenous people and communities, to whom the project aims to give a voice as the most important stakeholders. In the image that leads this post, you can see&nbsp;Eliane Waiwai, telling the myth of the production of manioc through the objects. The objects were previously labelled by the function (producing manioc) but with Eliane's input we understand their relevance to&nbsp;history, a myth of creation. The new context is not 'only functional'&nbsp;but places the objects in the history of Wai Wai people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In cooperation with scholars from the University of Brasilia, the project team started a pilot project that makes use of an open source tool developed by them - <a href=\"https://tainacan.org/en/\">Tainacan</a> - that allows to create digital collections on the internet,&nbsp;opening up new possibilities of dialogue and discussions about power in data in terms of decolonisation of collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the outcome - how can someone use it?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We worked on the report with the conviction that our experience with Tainacan could encourage new ways of co-curating&nbsp;and re-categorisation of cultural heritage, and open dialogue via digital means. We hope that other institutions will be able to use the tool and test it on other collections, based on our findings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have you learned from this experience about crowdsourcing for cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have learned that while there has been much written about decolonising databases, it is not easy to find practical examples. With Tainacan and the new plug-ins created by the team it feels like we have a real opportunity to involve people through crowdsourcing. We needed a tool that can be used with bad internet, in areas with poor connection, like Amazonas in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can crowdsourcing initiatives be designed to meet the needs of researchers?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this case it is a must. Without the involvement of researchers, we never could have the discussion inside our institution, not only because of resources, but ideologically we needed ideas coming from outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are your plans for the future of the project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have plans to continue exploring the possibilities that were opened in this process. We have created a prototype of a database but needs to be tested by many actors. We are currently looking for funding sources, and with that we hope to develop our pilot project in a more structured way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you for telling us about the project!</strong></h3>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Begin the day with inspiring keynotes&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana 2022, we aim to explore how we can collaboratively build a common data space for cultural heritage and the role digital cultural heritage plays in today’s and tomorrow’s world. Each day will begin with a keynote speech and panel session setting the scene for a different theme. Whether you are joining us on-site at the Royal Library of the Netherlands in the Hague or online, you will be able to watch our sector-leading speakers in action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Wednesday 28 September, we will explore <strong>Making digital culture count: perspectives and provocations on the data space for digital cultural heritage</strong>. We are delighted that Rehana Schwinninger-Ladak, Head of Unit 'Interactive Technologies, Digital for Culture and Education' at the European Commission, will open the conference and then hand over to our first keynote speaker, Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation. Building on discussions begun at Europeana 2021, he will explore the data space in practice, what it means for Europeana as we know it - and share why it’s something that institutions across the cultural heritage sector should be excited about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thursday 29 September sees us focus on <strong>Making digital culture count - stories, culture and society</strong>. Our keynote speaker is Olia Hercules, author of the award-winning cookbooks Mamushka, Kaukasis and Summer Kitchens. Olia was born in Ukraine, and is co-founder of a global fund-raising initiative #CookForUkraine. She has received the Champions of Change award as well as a place among 25 most influential women as chosen by British Vogue in 2022. Her talk will explore how social media, storytelling and that wonderful intangible heritage - food - can bring people together and create positive change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, on Friday 30 September we will be turning to EuropeanaTech to explore how technology paves the way to digital inclusion and cultural heritage preservation in <strong>Making digital culture count - technology matters</strong>. Keynote speaker Caitlin Southwick, Executive Director of Ki Culture, an international nonprofit working to unite culture and sustainability, will begin the day. Her talk will explore climate data and technology in the cultural heritage sector, followed by a panel discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is with great pleasure that we can announce that our two main hosts for the conference will be Europeana Foundation Collections Engagement Manager, Douglas McCarthy, and Medhavi Gandhi of the Heritage Lab, who will lead us through the days and be present on-site. We are also excited that data poet Mr Gee will join each day of the conference to reflect on our programme in a unique and exciting way!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Choose from a wide range of exciting afternoon sessions&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">70% of the programme for Europeana 2022 - over 30 sessions - was co-created with cultural heritage professionals across the sector who responded to our call for proposals. This has resulted in a rich afternoon of presentations, workshops and activities. We will host two hybrid sessions which participants can join both on-site and online, alongside a number of online only talks on a diverse range of topics. There will be ‘silent rooms’ available for those joining the conference in person who would like to watch online sessions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Participation of young people is in focus as, honouring 2022 as the European Year of Youth, several sessions will look at youth involvement and explore the specific role which youth can play in building the data space. Digitisation, 3D and IIIF are all on the menu as EuropeanaTech takes centre stage, and there are plenty of sessions to inspire cultural heritage institutions about how to encourage reuse of their collections - through storytelling, education and tourism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recognising some of the most pressing issues of the present day, climate change is in focus with presentations from Europeana’s Climate Action Community. And we will hear from Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) about the collaborative preservation of social heritage, alongside sessions which will explore how cultural heritage can be protected in crisis situations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">See a full list of speakers on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">conference page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join special events on-site</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the afternoon programme, two special sessions for on-site attendees offer participants an opportunity to develop their creative and strategic thinking. A Serious LEGO play workshop will be happening on-site on Wednesday 28 September in the afternoon, moderated by Michael Edson and Lauren Vargas, while on Thursday 29 September, participants can join Flickr Foundation’s George Oates for a workshop on how to write ‘a 100 year plan.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On-site participants will also be able to meet fellow conference participants at evening receptions, make new connections and share thoughts on the day’s experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explore the full programme</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You can see the full programme for Europeana 2022 <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Europeana/2022/Europeana-2022-Digital-Programme.pdf\">here</a></strong> - please be aware that times are still subject to change, and we will be adding details of more sessions in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>If you want to attend these exciting sessions, book your ticket for Europeana 2022 now!</strong> You can register to attend online for free, or join in on-site. Early bird tickets are now sold out, with remaining tickets priced at 180 euros, with a 50% discount (90 euros) for members of the Europeana Network Association.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>New questions for the cultural heritage sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fast advance of new digital technologies and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, have encouraged many cultural heritage institutions to make their collections digitally accessible and reusable. In the last two decades, millions of objects - artworks, documents, and media - have found their way into the digital realm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the same advance of new technologies has prompted changes in digitisation processes and raises questions about how to manage digital heritage, its reuse, copyright and the way audiences interact with it. How can cultural heritage institutions keep up with the latest digital technologies and trends? How can they organise and develop an impactful digital workflow? How can digital collections enhance audience engagement and participation? How can cultural heritage institutions manage, apply and make the users aware of intellectual property rights? How can cultural heritage institutions manage, apply and make the users aware of intellectual property rights?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the MOOC</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These and a plethora of other questions are addressed in a new, free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), ‘Developing digital transition strategies for cultural heritage institutions’. The MOOC is organised by the <a href=\"https://indices-culture.eu/resources/\">inDICEs</a> project, which has received funding from the European Union for 2020-2022 under the Horizon 2020 programme. A MOOC allows large numbers of participants to learn new skills and develop their knowledge through online teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YzpKqECWBfU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Developing digital transition strategies for cultural heritage institutions’ is in English and will be hosted by KU Leuven via the edX platform. It is aimed at cultural heritage professionals, students, policy makers, and anybody with an interest in discovering how to tackle the challenges of digital transformation. Guided by experts from varied fields (from cultural economics to sociology, from communication to intellectual property rights), participants will learn how to design, assess, and improve digital transformation strategies. The course will provide insights and tools and framework for assessing the impact that cultural heritage institutions’ mission and activities can have thanks to new technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How the MOOC will run</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course will run from 26 September 2022 onwards and will cover six modules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Transformation &amp; Self-Assessment </strong>is an introductory module partly focused on the concept and importance of digital transformation in the GLAM sector, and partly on self-assessment and monitoring strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital trends and Culture 3.0</strong> examines the main transitions of the web, from its use as an information source (web 1.0) to the adoption of social and interactive elements (web 2.0). It also explores the concept of Culture 3.0 in which active participation is essential, analysing it in correlation with societal challenges. Different domains and types of impact of digital cultural participation, as well as trend watching practices are focal points.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Empowering IPR for the commons</strong> explores how cultural heritage institutions can make reuse of digital content clear from a legal perspective. How can institutions navigate EU legislation with regards to digital cultural collections and what are the fundamentals to understand when it comes to intellectual property rights?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Strategic skills, collaboration &amp; organisation growth</strong> discusses how&nbsp; participation in networks can increase organisational capacity and help to optimise the impact of cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Impact assessment</strong> introduces good practices, tools and methodologies to assess whether a strategy is working or needs to be refined or redirected. In this module, special attention is given to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> and its application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Approaching technological innovation</strong> investigates the notion of ‘innovation’. It then focuses on what that means for designing a comprehensive digital strategy, including ways of reaching out to audiences via online communication channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each module is enriched with lectures, interviews with experts, and readings. Learners will be encouraged to apply their newly acquired knowledge and set their critical thinking skills in motion through multiple choice quizzes, and reflection assignments. They will also have the opportunity to interact, discuss and share experiences and thoughts with the other students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The MOOC is instructor-paced and will run for 8 weeks. Participants will be able to discover a module per week during the first six weeks, and dedicate the remaining time to attempt the final exam if they wish so, or to revisit once again the previous learning activities. Learners are expected to dedicate three - four hours to each module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All the material offered by this edX course is freely accessible. However, participants will always have the opportunity to receive an official certificate for a fee, upon passing a final exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Register now!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in this course? <strong>Developing Digital Transition Strategies for Cultural Heritage Institutions will start on the 26 September, and you can enrol up until 20 November</strong> (although please note that you will need to complete the MOOC by this date). Enrol now on <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/developing-digital-transition-strategies-for-cultural-heritage-institutions\">KULeuvenX.</a></p>\r\n"

We are excited that we will be continuing our work at the heart of a data space for cultural heritage under the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\">Digital Europe Programme</a>, which focuses on bringing digital technology to businesses, citizens and public administrations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming years, the programme will oversee the development of 14 data spaces in strategic sectors and key areas of public interest (health, energy, culture, and more). Data spaces seek to harness the value of data for the benefit of European society and economy by deploying data sharing tools and services, developing data governance structures and improving the availability, quality and interoperability of data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Commission’s 14 interconnected data spaces will grow at their own rates, going from zero to fully interoperable within a decade. But the data space for cultural heritage has a head start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With Europeana - with over a decade of experience - at its heart, we lead the way in terms of infrastructure, governance, collaboration and experience supporting a sector in its digital transformation - and will continue to do so in the coming period at the heart of the common European data space for cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A consortium of committed partners&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Foundation will steward the data space for cultural heritage, but collaboration, community and teamwork will be key to its success. We will continue to work closely with the Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum to bring - and build - the benefits of the data space to cultural heritage institutions and professionals throughout Europe. We will also work across sectors and borders with a consortium of partners who will manage the data space with enthusiasm, creativity and drive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These partners include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">AIT Angewandte Informationstechnik Forschungsgesellschaft mbH&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">AIT Austrian Institute Of Technology GmbH</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Archives Portal Europe Foundation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Capgemini Nederland BV</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Connecting Archaeology and Architecture in Europe</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">DARIAH-ERIC</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Datoptron P.C.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Deutsches Filminstitut &amp; Filmmuseum</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">European Fashion Heritage Association</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EUN Partnership AISBLl</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuroClio</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Facts &amp; Files Digital Services GmbH</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Inception s.r.l</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Michael Culture</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">International Consortium for Photographic Heritage</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Time Machine Organisation</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An exciting outlook</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our role in the data space is a fantastic opportunity to drive our sector’s digital transformation. We’re excited to deliver higher-quality digital data that can be used and reused in everything from school projects to world-changing research. We’re looking forward to advances in 3D - for preservation and restoration and to boost opportunities in tourism and creative industries. We’re excited about what advanced technologies like augmented and virtual reality and artificial intelligence can do to get culture to more people more usefully; and we can’t wait to build digital capacity among the professionals in our sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Would you like to learn more?</strong> The data space will be in focus at our upcoming conference, Europeana 2022, with the first day (Wednesday 28 September) exploring perspectives on the data space for digital cultural heritage. Join us to explore the data space in practice, what it means for Europeana as we know it - and share why it’s something that institutions across the cultural heritage sector should be excited about.</p>\r\n"

The app stories are very short and at some point, we felt a need to tell more complex longer stories. That is how <a href=\"https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/\">DailyArt Magazine</a> was born in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the Magazine, we have managed to create a very unique place on the Internet. It is the biggest online magazine popularising art history and architecture, and we now&nbsp;attract quite a wide audience. We reached 1.5 million page views and almost 800,000 readers in the first quarter of 2022 and we are constantly growing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been developing since the very beginning by increasing the amount and also the style of published stories. The new website, launched in autumn 2021, contains several sections to help our readers find what they love.</p>\r\n"

Talking about art history in a compelling and fun way is our mission. It is all about shaping the subject. For example, if you want to share stories about still lives from the Dutch Golden Age, give readers <a href=\"https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/cooking-in-art/\">recipes</a> based on the products from the paintings. When exploring Impressionists, make it a soap opera and share <a href=\"https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/impressionist-gossips/\">all the gossip</a>. Show <a href=\"https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/men-in-heels/\">men in high heels</a> from Louis XIV to Johnny Cash, and never forget about <a href=\"https://www.dailyartmagazine.com/scandalous-nudes-art-history/\">nudes</a>. Add to this lots of high-quality well chosen beautiful pictures and you have it!</p>\r\n"

Attendants can attend for free by registering online, or buy a ticket to join on-site. General tickets are on sale priced at 180 euros, with a 50% discount (90 euros) for members of the Europeana Network Association.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana, working with <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/\">ESACH</a>, is delighted to be able to offer five bursaries to support students and new professionals to attend the conference in The Hague, with the aim of enabling those who would not otherwise be able to&nbsp;join us in The Hague.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does the bursary cover?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who is a current ESACH member is welcome to apply for the bursary, which offers a free ticket to attend Europeana 2022&nbsp;in The Hague and pre-paid accommodation for up to three nights of the conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bursary also offers reimbursement for travel expenses up to a total of 250 euros. To receive this reimbursement, recipients must sign in on the first day of the conference and submit an expense claim with evidence of their travel (for example, receipts and tickets) to Europeana within two weeks. This will then be reimbursed within three weeks of receipt of the claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will also ask recipients to take part in a short focus group after the conference to hear about their experiences and explore what else Europeana could do to support new professionals at their conferences; we will also ask you to contribute to a piece of editorial after the conference about your experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you apply?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for the bursary, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:events@europeana.eu\">events@europeana.eu</a> with answers to the following questions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Are you a member of ESACH?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Where are you based and what is your educational stage (BA student, MA student, PhD student, working professional)?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Why would you like to attend Europeana 2022 and what would you like to get out of it? What is the thing that you are most looking forward to on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-our-programme-for-europeana-2022\">programme</a> and why?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Fast forward five years - what do you want your lasting memory of attending Europeana 2022 to be?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Why are you interested in digital cultural heritage?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Your answers will be assessed by staff from the Europeana Foundation and ESACH. We will award bursaries based on the motivations expressed, and also aim to select applicants from a range of student/professional backgrounds and locations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as you are an ESACH member, you are welcome to apply from anywhere in the world! If you are an ESACH member who has already purchased a&nbsp;ticket to join in The Hague, you may still apply for the bursary and to be reimbursed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadline for applications is Midday (CET) Thursday 15th September. You will hear if you have been successful by the close of Monday 19th.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:events@europeana.eu\"><strong>Email Europeana to apply now</strong></a></p>\r\n"

Read on to discover the findings!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Journey of KU Leuven’s Library Collections in Europeana</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22PHOTOCONSORTIUM%22&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Catholic%20University%20of%20Leuven%22&amp;query=&amp;view=grid\">KU Leuven’s collections</a> in Europeana include around 34,000 cultural heritage items, which comply with the highest quality levels of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. Most of the content is available in high resolution and open access - all the images are either in Public Domain or free to reuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The items are varied, including portraits, historical documents, engravings, travel photographs, educational photographs of monuments, paintings and other cultural items used for teaching art history. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22PHOTOCONSORTIUM%22&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22KADOC%20Documentation%20and%20Research%20Center%20on%20Religion%20Culture%20and%20Society%22&amp;query=&amp;view=grid\">KADOC</a>, the University’s documentation and research centre, housing a beautiful collection of photographic heritage materials, has also aggregated content to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How did this happen? The question is answered in the <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/educationalportal/2021/09/03/kuleuven-library-collections-in-europeana/\">Photoconsortium case study</a>, which shares the story of the University’s approach to digital transformation, from the development of early Information Technology for teaching to the present day, where a top quality lab is in charge of digitising the holdings of KU Leuven’s Libraries. The Libraries work to ensure that all published content that is identified as Public Domain is labelled and published as such, while copyrighted content is intended to be shared as CC-BY label where possible; and of course KU Leuven complies with the Orphan Works directive as implemented in Belgian law when needed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Publishing collections in Europeana could be considered to not be a ‘core’ mission for a University like KU Leuven and its libraries and archives, which are intended to support research and university teaching and learning. However, publishing these open collections in Europeana and contributing to their digital curation has proved to serve the University’s core missions – research and education –&nbsp; by showcasing the collections in editorials and by enabling reuse through educational tools such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a>, <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/creating-a-digital-cultural-heritage-community\">MOOCs</a> and with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/heritage-history-and-contraception-behind-the-scenes-of-the-pill-exhibition\">students’ works</a>.</p>\r\n"

Since then, CRDI’s collections prepared for publication in Europeana amount to around 400,000 digitised cultural heritage objects. A large part of those are currently being republished with higher quality of data and metadata: at the time of writing this post, users can find in Europeana&nbsp;over 146,000 photographic <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Girona%20City%20Council%22&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22PHOTOCONSORTIUM%22&amp;query=&amp;view=grid\">top quality</a>&nbsp;items that are available for consultation and reuse. Around 14,000 items are open access and fully reusable, and their metadata is also of high quality, including contextual information about the items in the collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The policy of CRDI in terms of reuse and licensing is oriented towards openness, and the rights labels that CRDI applies to the Europeana items are either Public Domain where applicable, No Copyright, or CC-BY-NC-ND.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The case of CRDI’s collections exemplifies the approach of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>’ that ‘the more you give the more you get’. High quality and reusable collections are best positioned for gaining visibility in Europeana with their inclusion in blogs, galleries, exhibitions and learning materials. The photographic materials made available online by CRDI are also perfect for reuse in the educational realm, as seen in the learning scenario <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/colorful-culture-in-the-1950s-blue-skies-red-panic-ls-hr-215/\">Colourful culture in the 1950s</a>, which was curated by Photoconsortium for Europeana Education as part of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/blue-skies-red-panic\">Blue Skies Red Panic exhibition</a>; and reusable collections for e-learning activities that are currently available on the page of Photoconsortium in <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/photoconsortium\">Historiana</a>, the educational tool developed by Euroclio.</p>\r\n"

Whether you’d like to be better at talking about Europeana, pick up new ideas for storytelling, brush up on your social media skills or explore how to be more inclusive or climate-friendly in your comms, these sessions have something for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This autumn, on 11 October, we start with a session on ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/presenting-europeana\">Presenting Europeana</a>’. We’ll share our revamped <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-essentials-slidedeck\">Europeana Essentials slidedecks</a> - a brilliant tool for anyone needing to share info about Europeana. We'll talk about the importance of a consistent message, show you how to find the information you need in the slidedecks and walk you through activities to build your confidence in talking about Europeana. You’ll also hear from seasoned presenter (and co-chair of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators</a>) Killian Downing on how he prepares when he presents Europeana to his colleagues and networks. Be ready to share your thoughts, have a go, and take part in our activities and quizzes!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Then, in November, we’re going to take a closer look at the basics of storytelling and introduce you to the various ways you can contribute to editorial for the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the spring, we’re looking at topics such as social media, accessibility (both from a technical and a diversity and inclusion angle), and climate-friendly comms. We’d love to know if these topics are of interest to you, or if there are other communications elements you’d like to see us focus on. Please email me (<a href=\"mailto:beth.daley@europeana.eu\">beth.daley@europeana.eu</a>) with your ideas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And don’t forget, day two of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2022 conference</a> is all about Stories, Culture and Society, so if you’re interested in storytelling and communications, make sure you’re there!</p>\r\n"

Some recent examples from Europeana include our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe\">Discovering Europe season</a>, which aimed to highlight Europe’s rich natural beauty and cultural heritage to inspire travel to local and alternative destinations, as well as Generic Services projects, such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/jewish-history-tours\">Jewish History Tours</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, a new collaboration with the Cultural Routes of Europe initiative makes the promise for diverse and exciting reuse opportunities of cultural heritage. Launched in 1987, <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes\">Cultural Routes of Europe</a> is a programme of the Council of Europe and currently presents <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/by-theme\">48 certified cultural routes</a> on various topics, from Jewish heritage to Vikings and Santiago de Compostela routes, that illustrate European memory, history and heritage and contribute to an interpretation of the diversity of present-day Europe. The routes are seen as key resources for responsible tourism and sustainable development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>First success stories</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana works closely together with the Cultural Route of Jewish Heritage, run by the project partner AEPJ, within the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/jewish-history-tours\">Jewish History Tours </a>Generic Services project. This project aims to aggregate and enrich content on Jewish life in Europe across times and locations and use it as material to create engaging, high-quality digital tours on pan-European topics, such as multiculturalism, persecution and migration. The tour production is supported by several innovations, including a platform for creating tours, an Artificial Intelligence recommendation system for authors, and a semi-automatic geographical enrichment and machine translation for multilingual tours. The tours are published by well-known tourism platforms, such as <a href=\"https://cliomusetours.com/\">Clio Muse Tour</a> and <a href=\"https://izi.travel/en\">izi.TRAVEL</a> with more partnerships coming up. You can take a peek at the first published tours in <a href=\"https://j-story.org/experiences/centropa-jewish-berlin-tour\">Berlin</a>, <a href=\"https://j-story.org/experiences/discover-jewish-barcelona\">Barcelona</a>, and <a href=\"https://j-story.org/experiences/salonica-the-balkan-jerusalem\">Salonica</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A further collaboration with the Cultural Routes is the virtual exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/napoleon-and-urbanism-in-the-19th-century\">Napoleon and urbanism in the 19th century</a>, which was published on Europeana website in May 2022. The exhibition was created by the European Federation of Napoleonic Cities – Cultural Route <a href=\"https://www.destination-napoleon.eu/\">Destination Napoleon</a> as part of Destination Napoleon European Week 2022 and has registered over 8,000 visits so far. Europeana and the Destination Napoleon route are currently exploring ways to expand the collaboration into education and tourism (using the platform created within the Jewish History Tours project).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Scaling up</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we consider the collaboration with the Cultural Routes of Europe a strategic partnership, especially in the light of the future efforts on strengthening the relation between the data spaces on cultural heritage and tourism. We are exploring ways to raise awareness about our two initiatives and facilitate the connections and future partnerships between the Routes’ representatives and cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First steps in this direction were taken at the <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/cultural-routes/2020-fontainebleau-academy\">9th Training Academy of Cultural Routes of Europe</a> in the beginning of June 2022 in Fontainebleau, France. I presented the Europeana Initiative, the expectations for the data space on cultural heritage and possible areas of collaboration. This presentation was complemented by the case study of Jewish History Tours given by Pavel Kats, Director of Jewish Heritage Network, and Victor Sorenssen, Director of AEPJ. The event allowed for informal networking with other Routes representatives and for initiation of strategic talks with Stefano Dominioni, Director of the European Institute of Cultural Routes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join the special session at Europeana 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a next step, Europeana, AEPJ and the Jewish Heritage Network invite you to join the dedicated Culture &amp; Tourism session at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana annual conference</a>, 28-30 September in The Hague, the Netherlands. The session will run as a joint co-creation workshop where the project partners will use their experience to suggest synergies between the Cultural Routes of Europe and the Europeana Network in the context of the emerging European ecosystem of common data spaces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The session will run in a hybrid format in the afternoon of 28 September and you can join it (and the rest of the conference) free of charge online. Secure your place by registering <a href=\"https://pretix.eu/Europeana-Foundation/europeana-2022/\">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We look very much forward to welcoming you at the conference and create together new opportunities in the intersection of cultural heritage and tourism.</p>\r\n"

The aim for this new design is to more effectively communicate to people what they can gain by visiting the website and encourage them to engage with the various features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out how the new homepage can best cater to peoples’ needs, we investigated what they normally do on the website and found that, mostly, people want to find a specific item. They usually do this by using the search. To better support this, in the new homepage design we introduced an additional search bar and gave it a prominent place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second most common thing that people do on our website is browse content to get inspired. To encourage browsing from the new homepage, we are now promoting our thematic collections in what we think of as our 'themes swiper'&nbsp;- just swipe left and right to discover more themes. Below that you will find the latest blog posts, exhibitions and galleries.</p>\r\n"

The new ‘brutalist’ design sets the tone for a style that we will continue developing site-wide. The artistic movement of brutalism is known for its stark, honest and captivating style, communicating innovation and trust. The components literally grow out-of-the-box, looking great on any screen including the largest, so people will have a pleasant experience whether they are browsing on their mobile during their commute or presenting on a large TV screen at a conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To communicate our messages clearly and make the website welcoming, we translated all the editorial on the homepage into 25 European languages and continue to ensure it is fully accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To validate the new homepage designs we conducted user testing. We started by making sure that people could perform all the key tasks. We continued with tests for the visual style and the editorial used on the page, to be sure that what and how we communicate is well understood. If you want to know more about the homepage design and get insight into the process and results of user testing, take a look at this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hdyefUli4Qo3Z-EzHmiA7hLsKPMu7Viy37a3YX_PAa8/edit?usp=sharing\">presentation</a>.</p>\r\n"

Where we were displaying the English translation of the organisation name, we have now added the organisation’s native name on top of it. This means that more people can now read the organisation name and understand what type of content they can expect that organisation to provide. We believe that with this approach we can help our partner organisations become better known to audiences across Europe and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides the update in naming, on the Organisations page, you can now see an item count for each organisation, so you&nbsp;have an idea of how big each collection is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>What can you tell us about the work of ERIAC, and the challenges that Roma heritage faces across Europe?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Roma people have been a present and integral part of societies in Europe for over 600 years. Throughout this history, Roma have made an immense contribution to national cultures while managing to develop strategies to preserve their cultural heritage&nbsp;amidst persecution, discrimination and violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://eriac.org/eriacs-roma-tangible-heritage-network/\">ERIAC</a> has a unique and single mandate as the transnational, European-level organisation for the recognition of Roma arts and culture. Given this mandate, we have identified that Roma tangible and intangible heritage faces the following problems: lack of representation by national museums; often being represented as ‘other(s)’; museums having a monopoly over the discourse and narrative concerning the Roma; and lack of proper archiving of Roma cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As artist Delaine Le Bas and Junghaus in 2015, wrote: ‘Roma are deprived of their right to access their cultural heritage, and of their right to the production, presentation, and interpretation of their own Romani culture.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Roma lack spaces and resources to conserve, document, develop and disseminate the diverse manifestations and artefacts of Roma culture. Additionally, Roma <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00053\">oral traditions</a>, <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00054\">performing arts</a>, <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00055\">social practices, rituals and festive events</a>, <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00056\">knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe</a> and the knowledge and skills to produce <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00057\">traditional crafts</a> is uncollected, underestimated or misinterpreted by non-Roma stereotyping, scholarship and knowledge production institutions without the corrective impact of Roma themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What steps can cultural heritage institutions take to acknowledge, surface and appropriately label Roma cultural heritage in their own collections?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In many cases, the heritage of cultural communities has suffered from misrepresentation and underrepresentation. For example, a recent mapping of tangible heritage conducted by ERIAC revealed that while European museums hold numerous objects representing the Roma community and culture, these are often in storage areas, mislabelled and not shown to the public. Depictions and interpretations of Roma culture and community in existing collections are sometimes problematic and do not reflect the views of the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We know that the Council of Europe and the European Network against Racism have <a href=\"https://www.enar-eu.org/about/antigypsyism/\">documented the roots of Anti-Gypsyism</a>. Structural and institutional racism against Roma is a root cause of their exclusion across Europe. What is needed is a dismantling of structural racism and dispelling of prejudices so that Roma can become equal citizens. They must be considered as active creators of cultural heritage content. Cultural heritage institutions can model the <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/labdays/\">LabDay methodology</a>, created under the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE project</a>, to challenge hierarchies and include those community groups in their everyday activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has ERIAC worked to encourage people from all over Europe to engage with Romani heritage?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social media platforms and access to digital content created for and by Roma have helped ERIAC to engage with Romani heritage, bring content beyond borders, encourage a sense of community, belonging and pride, and network and connect with Roma organisations and individuals from all over Europe. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/weave-events-explore-3d-for-intangible-heritage-and-regeneration\">WEAVE project LabDays</a> also offered a great space, methodology and forward-thinking approach to decentralising power dynamics and encouraging inclusive and accessible events, while facilitating important discussions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ERIAC is a partner in the WEAVE project - can you tell us about the work that has been achieved through the project around Romani heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When considering social-cultural groups and vulnerable groups, the particular case of the Roma community - which the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE project</a> addresses - is especially important. This is in part because, due to its complexity, the framework needed for tackling issues around the community’s heritage can be applied to other groups as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">WEAVE had an impact for the Roma community as it had a clear participatory approach. The coordination and careful consideration of the project consortium will foster support for Roma heritage, and&nbsp;its outputs and its methodology will be a model for future EU funded projects and cultural heritage institutions. The Europeana WEAVE <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/capacity-building/europeana-events/\">events series</a> on Diversity and Inclusion and the WEAVE LabDays were a great way to create capacity-building opportunities for key stakeholders such as artists, academics, community representatives, cultural heritage institutions, curators, educators and individuals from marginalised communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the WEAVE project, data related to Roma heritage has been shared with Europeana, which is a milestone and a major achievement. This process of providing content not only empowers Roma as creators of cultural heritage but simultaneously allows for a representation to exist that challenges erroneous information. Digitised Roma cultural heritage is a great opportunity for all European citizens, and those further afield, as it allows open access information for people to engage with, learn from and reuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us more about the content shared with Europeana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The content selected by WEAVE content providers for publication in the Europeana website showcases the richness and variety of digital representation of tangible and intangible heritage. Matching the high criteria of content and data quality required by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, and fully available for educational and other types of reuse, these collections are a great resource for any person interested in the rich and invaluable cultural heritage of cultural communities.&nbsp;They are also showcased in a set of engaging editorials and an online exhibition ‘<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/exhibitions/the-renaissance-of-romani-re-presentation/\">The Renaissance of Romani Re-presentation</a>’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The collections aggregated through WEAVE are varied, in content and in item types.&nbsp;The content aimed to cover&nbsp;tangible and intangible cultural heritage material, offering digital items of built heritage, artworks, posters, historical photographs and representation of traditional practices from different communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fact that the Roma community is included in this online European platform is powerful. This moment deserves to be celebrated as we have a mix of traditional materials, including content from TopFoto and contemporary items from ERIAC and Coventry University, that speak to the diverse heterogeneous Roma community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Would you like to learn more about the WEAVE project and framework it has developed?

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In October each year, Black History Month is marked in some European countries to celebrate and highlight the lives and the achievements of Black people throughout history and in the present. It is also a month of discussion, reflection and campaigns which bring challenges faced by Black communities to light.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, we created a new exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/black-lives-in-europe\">‘Black Lives in Europe</a>’ that explored the lives and achievements of a number of Black figures such as Toussaint Louverture and Nicola Adams, from the 1600 to the present day. We invited guest writers to support our editorials and interviewed organisations highlighting Black European History. Since then, we’ve continued to publish new stories that can be found on our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/black-history\">Black history feature page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our plans in 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We look forward to once again sharing stories of Black history from the past to the present through our editorials, social media, online courses and partnerships. We will continue to promote the editorials we’ve already created and our exhibition ‘Black Lives in Europe’. And we aim to explore the steps that cultural heritage institutions can take to acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections through Europeana Pro news.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our plans for Black History Month are part of our wider efforts across our Initiative to be more inclusive and diverse. We want to give more space to the narratives of underrepresented groups, in order to become more representative of the society in which we live. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/talking-diversity-and-inclusivity-at-the-european-foundation-being-bold-and-learning-from-others\">Find out more</a> about the work being done towards this at the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to support cultural heritage institutions to get involved in Black History Month, and we can help to share your work and content in a number of ways. We're particularly interested in hearing about stories or projects from southern, eastern and central Europe. If you would like to get involved, you can:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Write</strong> an editorial piece which highlights Black history for the Europeana website or recommend historical Black European figures we could feature. You are welcome to share images and objects from your own collections.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Tell us</strong> about your plans for Black History Month so that we can explore ways to support and align them with our activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Share</strong> your own work through Europeana Pro. Is your organisation mainly focused on Black history or running projects and exhibitions to highlight it? Let us interview you and raise awareness about the importance and challenges of making Black history accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>'Take over'</strong> our instagram account by sharing stories from your institution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can do all of the above by&nbsp; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU9IOndv3-895jlCoqZ5wDHn-iRrOU6CFYQDrzNtQwfZ0FsQ/viewform\">filling out our form</a> or getting in touch with <a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu\">editorial@europeana.eu</a>. In addition, you could:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Promote</strong> relevant content, blogs, images and objects from your own collections on social media. Use #BlackHistory and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Highlight</strong> a well-known or lesser-known historical Black figure on social media. Again, use #BlackHistory and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Follow, retweet and share</strong> our editorials and news posts throughout the month - we will be sharing them on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3201557/\">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For any other questions or ideas, please get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu\">editorial@europeana.eu</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It is building ‘digital bridges’ through what it calls Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs), to provide access to those services for the benefit of all.&nbsp; Europeana is the DSI that delivers services to showcase and provide online access to Europe’s digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana service was provided by a consortium of 24 partners, coordinated by the Europeana Foundation, and funded under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility\">Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)</a>. The Europeana DSI-4 project ran from September 2018 to August 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The work carried out throughout DSI-4, whether related to data, engagement, networks or reuse, all contributes to Europeana’s overarching goal of supporting the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The impact of digital transformation is different for each individual organisation. Each change, no matter how small, contributes to a cultural heritage sector powered by digital and a Europe powered by culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Is your collection or story just too elaborate and detailed for social media? Reach out to <a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu\">editorial@europeana.eu</a> and let’s discuss how we can showcase your collection in a blog, gallery and/or video!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">#CraftingHeritage Month is inspired by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted\">CRAFTED</a> Enrich and promote traditional and contemporary crafts project, which aims to support the transfer of European crafts to future generations by aggregating, enriching and promoting crafts heritage. The project partners have created (and continue to create) blogs, galleries, videos, and exhibitions that offer a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/making-culture\">unique resource</a> to better understand, preserve and reuse the rich tangible and intangible heritage of European crafts. Looking for inspiration on how to contribute during #CraftingHeritage Month? Take a look at some of the project’s most exciting creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Blogs with new perspectives</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project has published a number of blogs highlighting new perspectives on the histories of crafts and textiles. The field of textile arts is predominantly led by female artisans who use this intricate work to explore their femininity and actively take part in creative and social discourse. For example, the ‘Antonia Suardi Collection’ includes over 1,500 pieces of embroidery and lace from the personal collection of the Italian Countess Antonia Ponti Suardi (1860-1938). How the collection, conserved in the Museo del Tessuto di Prato, contributed to encouraging a new perspective of social emancipation for women can be read in the blog <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/women-crafting-freedom\">Women crafting freedom</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

In her creations, Brankica blurs the traditional boundaries established between crafts and contemporary art and carries a message of resilience. 'In the 1980s and 1990s, you could see that textiles could take on an important role in critical space … [female artists] animated and mobilised questions about gender, the values of our society, individuals, political issues, female emancipation, etc.'&nbsp;explains Brankica in <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/brankica-zilovic\">an interview</a> for the CRAFTED project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Radio was not only bringing news told by human voices to homes, crossing cities and borders. It also brought people together, either as listeners or as builders and modifiers of radios themselves. Today, despite TV and the internet, radio remains ever-present in daily life. Rob, Dennis and Martin, volunteers at Netherlands Institute for Sound &amp; Vision and passionate radio-makers, told the CRAFTED project all about the craft and art of radio during its analogue years in a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/de/blog/analogue-days\">mini video series</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can expect many more exciting videos to come with topics ranging from the technique of analogue animation to beautiful ceramic pottery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

For centuries, makers and designers have been fascinated with the natural world, considering its richness a starting point for a new creative language, with its own motifs, forms and colours. You can take a deep dive into the relationship between fashion, nature and craft in the online exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/nature-crafting-fashion\">Nature crafting fashion</a>, which the CRAFTED project has developed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of this year’s #CraftingHeritage Month a second exhibition will be published. '100 years of amateur film'&nbsp;will cover the craft from 1922 to 2022 and will highlight the first successful home cinema format and technology, the Pathé-Baby 9.5mm film projector, among other innovative techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Running from 1 October 2020 to 31 August 2022, the project aimed to support European cultural heritage institutions by giving digital access to new medieval objects through Europeana. It also explored how these digitised items could be used in the classroom to demonstrate how reading culture in the Middle Ages became a fundamental part of European heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A trove of manuscripts… and more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project had to face challenges brought about by the global COVID-19 pandemic, including limited access to digitisation rooms and the need to shift to online collaboration.&nbsp; Despite the limitations brought by the pandemic, the project exceeded its goals for digitising new medieval manuscripts, as well as for creating editorials and curatorial activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seven cultural heritage institutions provided over 34,000 new digital versions of medieval manuscripts, printed books and coins to Europeana and updated and enriched another 31,000 items already available through the Europeana website. These new collections fed into 40 published pieces of editorial, double the 20 originally planned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe centrepiece of that work is <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages\">‘The art of reading in the Middle Ages’</a>, an online exhibition published in October 2021, which was one of the most popular exhibitions launched on Europeana website last year. Through six chapters, the exhibition told the stories of reading in monasteries, courts, cities, language, bookpaths and universities of medieval Europe. The exhibition is available in English, Dutch, French, German, Czech and Slovenian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project partners also curated a feature page about the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/middle-ages\">Middle Ages</a> on the Europeana website. This space consists of themed galleries, blog posts and digital content which correspond to the focuses of the main exhibition. The page also highlights educational material (videos, learning scenarios) and encourages the audience to browse manuscripts based on the century. It serves as an entry point for Europeana’s audiences to all of the editorial which explores the Middle Ages and hopefully will be used by future projects exploring similar topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project partners recognised the importance of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF): a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. It is an important protocol to share and use digitised images in high quality, and particularly valuable for analysing manuscripts. Still, it is not yet widely implemented across cultural heritage institutions in Europe. The project provided recommendations to other institutions on how to enrich or optimise their digital services with tools that make use of the IIIF protocol.</p>\r\n"

The project targeted <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/bringing-digitised-medieval-objects-into-compulsory-education\">primary and secondary</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teaching-with-digitised-medieval-manuscripts-in-post-secondary-education\">post secondary students</a> with age-appropriate materials, contributing an impressive suite of educational resources in different formats (learning scenarios, videos, blogs and interactive games) to enable the usage of the digitised medieval items in the classroom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe learning activities aim to engage students and educators by bringing together the most relevant collections of manuscripts and objects and allow for interpretation and understanding of medieval reading culture. You can see one of the games the project developed for primary school students below; it encourages them to learn about medieval coins through an interactive online activity. They then create their own coins, imagine and map their own land, and use their coins to trade resources with their classmates.</p>\r\n"

The group discussed best practices in the use of web resources for teaching with medieval manuscripts, and collecting and communicating educational resources available on the internet. This resulted in a series of recommendations for heritage institutions and curators, as well as for educators. This knowledge exchange will be continued and the working group hopes to expand its network to strengthen the position of medieval cultural heritage in an educational context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, project partners produced a four-part video series, to share information about the ARMA project and show more sophisticated ways to find the medieval items, editorials and learning scenarios that were created in the course of this project.

The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1ban1-JNQ_0\">third video</a> offers a short introduction to the resources that were made for primary education and shows how they can be used in the classroom. The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/N_vIF_nLSlk\">fourth and last video</a> provides more information on the educational resources developed for secondary education.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />At the start of September, Europeana won the European Commission’s tender to deploy the common European data space for cultural heritage. Our role in the data space is a fantastic opportunity to continue driving our sector’s digital transformation, as is the Europeana Foundation’s involvement in the new EIT ‘Culture &amp; Creativity’ innovation community. The benefits that collaboration - and data sharing - bring were also emphasised in new case studies from Europeana’s accredited aggregator for photography, Photoconsortium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

We also shared our reflections on organising a hybrid event. Elsewhere, an online subtitling contest invited the public to correct AI-generated subtitles on TV clips.</p>\r\n"

We were delighted that over 1,300 professionals, experts and students working in and around cultural heritage signed up to attend our first hybrid annual conference, joining over 80 speakers for more than 50 sessions and in person social events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each day of the conference focused on a theme of importance to the cultural heritage sector, from&nbsp;the data space for cultural heritage to&nbsp;storytelling to technology. Panel sessions in the morning, and online and in person sessions in the afternoon inspired, informed and challenged participants on these topics, which were also given beautiful new interpretations from the conference’s resident Data Poet, Mr Gee. His words on the importance of sharing and collaboration have stayed with us even after the conference has finished:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>By exposing our art,</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We expose our heart,</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Such is the impact of the task,</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>To bring us all together.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Watch our conference recap video and read about the days below.</p>\r\n"

She shared how important it was that, ‘In the age of virtual worlds and metaverses, we need to show, more than ever…our vision of a data space that empowers cultural heritage institutions.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation, then continued the morning&nbsp;with an exploration of this vision where, '<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We should empower cultural heritage institutions to control the data.' This was&nbsp;followed by a panel discussion with fresh provocations and perspectives on the data space, moderated by Michael Peter Edson. Afternoon sessions on themes from culture and tourism to the role of youth in the data space further enriched participants’ understanding of the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stories, culture and society&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thursday 29 September saw a focus on stories, culture and society. Award-winning author Olia Hercules gave an inspiring keynote exploring how social media, storytelling and food can bring people together and create positive change. She reflected&nbsp;movingly on the heritage of Ukrainian cooking and its documentation for her cookbook, Summer Kitchens, sharing how, ‘Even before the big war broke out, it felt really important to show what united us and you know, summer kitchens, to me, the food that we made, was symbolic of the bigger unity that we all felt.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interactive activities, a panel discussion and afternoon sessions all helped to shine a light further on engagement, reuse and storytelling in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Technology matters</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, on Friday 30 September, we heard from Caitlin Southwick, Executive Director of Ki Culture, an international nonprofit working to unite culture and sustainability. She explored the relationship that cultural heritage institutions have to the climate crisis, and the role that technologies can play in addressing these issues. Caitlin reflected&nbsp;that, ‘As the cultural sector we have a huge voice in social justice issues and it's important we speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Afternoon sessions helped to explore digitisation, sustainability, Europeana Research and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Share your thoughts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you joined us at Europeana 2022, we would love to hear about your experience.

                body: "<h3><strong>How the campaign works</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Saint George on a Bike project</a> aims to train and build AI systems which will be able to understand art and describe the visual content of paintings in detail. To make this work possible, the project has to train AI to recognise different elements in paintings; this is a potentially huge task, but also offers an opportunity to involve art lovers and cultural heritage professionals to contribute and get involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the motivation behind the project’s crowdsourcing campaign, which asks volunteers to submit annotations of digitised paintings. Volunteers are invited to create&nbsp; descriptions of 12th to 18th century European paintings on the campaign´s <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/artem-dot-reshetnikov/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Zooniverse site</a>.&nbsp; Volunteers can work on as many paintings as they want – the more descriptions gathered, the more data the AI algorithms can work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to annotate paintings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When annotating images for this campaign, you need to be as detailed as possible - as if you were explaining the painting to a person with their eyes closed. Phrases such as ‘small baby’ could be improved with detail - for example, ‘a small baby lies on a blue blanket on the ground’. This helps the AI to gain a much larger vocabulary that it can then use to automatically describe more paintings in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some people may wonder if it is necessary to describe everything they see in a painting. The general rule is that you should start with the elements that are important to understanding the image. It is not necessary to describe minor details such as the elements of architectural decor found in the scene. But don´t worry - the campaign has very clear instructions and examples about how to contribute. All you need is a willingness to help researchers improve their image captioning technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engaging with European art and cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With thousands of paintings hosted on the campaign website, volunteers will also be able to view images&nbsp; from Europe’s vast artistic cultural heritage. Exploring different components and styles of centuries-old artworks could lead to new discoveries and engagement with&nbsp; art and cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A collaborative campaign&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Saint George on a Bike is an EU funded project led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in collaboration with Europeana. The project aims to improve the quality and quantity of open metadata associated with imagery from European cultural heritage, something which this crowdsourcing campaign supports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a licensed environmental planner, I completed an undergraduate degree in Environmental Planning and Management. This included two years of practical work and experience, passing the professional regulation commission (board examination) for my licence and undertaking continuous professional development. I am now a member of the Philippine Institute of Environmental Planners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an Environmental Planner, I became interested in the field of heritage and cultural mapping and joined Grupo Kalinangan, a non-profit organisation that innovates on cultural heritage management through a synergy of technology and community.&nbsp; I became a cultural mapper-facilitator-mentor in cultural mapping courses and heritage tours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to this role, I am a PADI Open Water Scuba Diver, Licensed Financial Advisor and professional artist-singer-songwriter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Presently I have a full time role as Team Head of the Sustainability Department of Drink Sustainability Communications. We prepare sustainability reports for different companies.&nbsp; During the weekend or when time allows, I also volunteer at Grupo Kalinangan. We organise heritage tours and writing retreats among other activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am also working on a memoir of my journey as an expectant mother.&nbsp; I am giving voice to my child.&nbsp; I am journaling and documenting with videos, photos of my visits to old churches deemed heritage sites and significant cultural buildings with patron saints for mothers, babies, safe pregnancy and&nbsp;family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It can be challenging to balance working from home and fulfilling the desire to travel and explore heritage sites. My favourite part is I still get to travel occasionally on weekends to fulfil this desire through heritage tours or online sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I became an official Philippine delegate of Eurotalent Festival, Stars of the Albion, Arts for Peace and International Understanding in London, I became interested in European culture. I discovered Europeana during the pandemic when my email was flooded with sites to visit - perhaps the internet must have known I was&nbsp;interested in Europe.&nbsp;Initially, I was interested in the art and painting archives on the Europeana website. I opened an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/set/3366\">online gallery through Europeana</a>. It kept my sanity during the pandemic.&nbsp;Then I learned that I could actually join the network; I was motivated to join as a Members Councillor so that I can more actively participate in the Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I plan to join the General Assembly in person hopefully next year. I plan to connect Europeana to the organisation I work for. Presently, we are working on having a global expansion within the company with a European team.&nbsp;We can work on collaborative projects on digital cultural heritage, digitising sustainable organisations working in the cultural heritage sector in Europe and in the Philippines among others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Hunt Museum is in Limerick in the west of Ireland.&nbsp; The museum preserves and exhibits the original artefacts from ‘<a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/the-collection/\">the Hunt Collection</a>’, an eclectic collection of approximately 2,000 works of art and antiquities gathered by antique dealers and collectors John and Gertrude Hunt over their lifetime. Described as a ‘cabinet for the curious’, the Hunt Museum is dedicated to enriching lives with culture, creativity, and learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The role of digitisation at the Hunt Museum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Hunt Museum believes that the modern museum operates across three platforms, including the human - the community; the physical – the building itself and the collections; and the virtual – the web environment and digital content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Projects like <a href=\"https://europeanaarchaeology.carare.eu/\">Europeana Archaeology</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages-arma\">Art of Reading in the Middle Ages (ARMA)</a>&nbsp;have allowed the museum to increase its digital capacity and improve its ability to share its cultural heritage with a wider audience. Projects also allow the museum to learn from other institutions and project partners, their collections and especially from their expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the lifetime of the Europeana Archaeology project, the Hunt Museum contributed 150 objects in 2D format and 50 objects in 3D format, and enriched the information on those objects which were then published on Europeana.&nbsp; A further 50 3D objects and 156 2D objects have been published on Europeana as part of the recently completed <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/\">ARMA project</a> and you can see all the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=TYPE%3A%223D%22&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22CARARE%22&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22The%20Hunt%20Museum%22&amp;query=3D&amp;view=grid\">Museum’s collection in Europeana</a>. The Museum used the <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/dashboard/\">Share3D dashboard</a> with support from <a href=\"https://pro.carare.eu/en/introduction-carare-aggregation-services/\">CARARE</a> to share metadata for its 3D objects with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3D digitisation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3D digitisation at the Hunt Museum began after the museum was awarded funding through the Heritage Council of Ireland to deliver training to its staff and volunteers in photogrammetry and 3D post-processing.&nbsp; This project was called Limerick3D and its main goal&nbsp;was to reach as many people as possible by digitising the Hunt Museum’s collection and making the content publicly open data. The project evolved into a permanent 3D strategy in the museum, which continues to digitise the collection in 3D and to involve volunteers as much as possible. 3D models are integral to educational activities and the museum shares 3D models via <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/TheHuntMuseum\">Sketchfab</a> and also as 3D printable models via <a href=\"https://www.myminifactory.com/users/HuntMuseum\">Scan the World</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using digitisation for engagement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Hunt Museum uses both its digitisation project and its digitised collections for engagement. It engages with the local community in Limerick and the Mid-west by running short 3D digitisation days for groups of interested volunteers. These are a form of outreach and encourage engagement with the museum, and they have also resulted in a large number of objects being digitised in 3D and published on Sketchfab.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Connecting to platforms is the first step, and communicating it is the next.&nbsp;Social media is vital to the Museum’s successful engagement and communication activities.&nbsp;A lot of its high-quality digitised objects are used across our social media platforms to create conversations by placing material online with information on our objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Using digitisation for education</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Successful education programmes have found that 3D digitisation lends itself especially well to teaching children about museum objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the ARMA project, the museum has created a suite of learning resources for primary and secondary school pupils that use the digitised medieval collections. All resources encourage students to use and explore Europeana digitised collections.&nbsp; The resources make excellent use of <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/schools-resources/arma-online-multilingual-calligraphy-programme-learning-pack/\">video-based learning tools</a>, <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/schools-resources/arma-reading-aloud-in-the-middle-ages/\">online games</a>, and the standard format for <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/assets/uploads/2022/05/FINAL-UPDATED-Reading-Aloud-LS.pdf\">learning scenarios</a> used by <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Hunt is using its digitised collection in the <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/schools-resources/the-three-muses/\">Three Muses Joint Education Programme</a>, an education programme that spans three cultural institutions in Limerick city. Objects have been digitised and are currently being used in the development of a digital teachers pack as well as in an online game aimed at school children ages 8-10 years old.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>IIIF</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through recent publications for ARMA and <a href=\"https://fragmentarium.ms/search?iCurrentPage=1&amp;sQueryString=hunt&amp;sSearchField=all_metadata&amp;iResultsPerPage=100&amp;iCurrentPage=1&amp;sSortField=score&amp;aSelectedFacets%5Bcountry_code_facet%5D%5B%5D=IE\">Fragmentarium</a>, the museum has seen the potential for IIIF&nbsp; (International Image Interoperability Framework), a protocol for sharing and using digitised images of cultural heritage objects in high quality. By standardising the way the image and metadata are delivered means that comparing images from different institutions can be easily achieved especially using standardised IIIF viewers and annotating tools. The information is contained in IIIF manifests that are stored by the creating or hosting institution. The Hunt Museum have recently been able to create IIIF manifests for our 3D models so and created annotated digitial displays using our 3D models and&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.exhibit.so/exhibits/rQWpn0xoHae6CAmwGEyI\">Exhibit.so</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The case study has shown 3D and digitisation in general have been an excellent opportunity for the Hunt Museum. It has not only allowed the Museum to engage with volunteers who learned transferable skills in digitisation but also to make its collection more accessible and searchable by placing it into the public domain for resharing and reuse. 3D digitisation has also allowed the Museum to unlock educational potential by using its 3D data sets across various platforms and in tourism and education programmes and, in this way, to access new audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read the full case study <a href=\"https://pro.carare.eu/documents/99/Case_Study_Hunt_Museum_v1.pdf\">on the CARARE website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a cultural heritage institution interested in finding out more about digitising objects in 3D, you can find some useful resources in <a href=\"https://pro.carare.eu/en/training-hub/3d-and-virtual-reality/\">CARARE’s training hub</a>.</p>\r\n"

Starting in April 2020 and running until September 2022, the project developed a framework to link the tangible and intangible heritage of cultural communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">WEAVE focused on three main areas, including building capacity in cultural heritage professionals to work with minoritised communities, and support them in preserving and presenting their intangible heritage; aggregating new high-quality content into Europeana, including 3D content and content representing intangible heritage; and providing an innovative set of tools that allow professionals to better manage 3D content, annotate videos, automatically enrich content and create digital stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Representing communities with new content and editorials</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The WEAVE project saw new tangible and intangible cultural heritage content digitised and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;query=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%20%28WEAVE%20OR%20Weave%29&amp;reusability=restricted&amp;view=grid\">aggregated to Europeana</a>, including built heritage, artworks, posters, historical photographs and representation of traditional practices from different communities. Content includes images,videos, audio files and a selection of 3D content that comprises existing models of Slovenian castles, which were digitised by partner ARCTUR. The project also aggregated reproductions of fragile daguerreotypes, specifically digitised in the context of WEAVE by partner CRDI, at top quality and published with open access. Explore all the collections <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/collections/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This new content shared with Europeana has been showcased in inspiring new editorials on the Europeana website, such as the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/the-renaissance-of-romani-re-presentation\">The Renaissance of Romani Re-presentation</a>, which explores the histories of Roma communities and highlights their contemporary artistic expressions. This unique exhibition was authored by Dr Adrian R Marsh, a professor of Romani Studies, himself of Welsh Gypsy origins, and increases the self-representation in Europeana editorial from underrepresented voices and communities. A corresponding <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/roma-representation-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector-an-interview-with-eriac\">Pro news piece</a> was published alongside the exhibition, which further reflected on the vulnerability of the Roma community in the cultural heritage sector as well as the value for them of working with Europeana to amplify their voices.</p>\r\n"

All tools are web-based, and accessible to professionals on most devices. These tools are brought together into a toolkit which consists of:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://weave-3dviewer.com/\">3DWeaver</a>: a tool for uploading and managing high-quality 3D content, with a 3D viewer that can efficiently display high-quality models and carry out measurements. The published 3D models in the 3DWeaver can be embedded into other web pages using the viewer.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://experience.weave-culture.eu/\">WEAVEx</a>: a tool for managing content (from Europeana or uploaded directly by the user) and documenting cultural communities’ heritage through digital community spaces, stories and experiences. With WEAVEx, anyone can create blogs or galleries that can include Europeana content and embed them&nbsp; into any website or application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://motion-notes.di.fct.unl.pt/\">MotionNotes</a>: a real-time multimodal video annotator created under the CEF Telecom project, <a href=\"https://culturemoves.eu/\">CultureMoves</a>. The tool is based on keyboard, touch and voice input, and is designed to assist the creative and exploratory processes as well as support the capture of multimodal annotations while, and after, recording video. During the WEAVE project, the tool was extended with 3D annotations and human pose estimation techniques.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/weavetoolkit/metadata-enrichment/\">Metadata enrichment tools</a>: these can be&nbsp;used to semantically enrich content metadata in order to improve indexing, searchability and contribute to its transformation to linked open data.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Capacity building and events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project carried out several activities that helped to connect cultural heritage institutions, minoritised cultural communities and Europeana. Together, these groups explored new approaches to preserving and documenting intangible cultural heritage, and options for making these approaches more inclusive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The LabDay methodology of Coventry University was used to organise 22 events on various topics such as 3D heritage, representation of minoritised communities and more. To support their long-term impact, WEAVE created<a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/capacity-building/\"> video recordings</a>, <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/capacity-building/resources/\">methodologies, resources and lessons learned</a>, and a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Europeana_GS_meeting/WEAVE-workbook.pdf\">Diversity and Inclusion workbook</a> that can be used by professionals in the cultural sector. The capacity building activities culminated with a <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/conference/\">closing conference</a> organised in hybrid format in Girona.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A pioneering project for diversity and inclusion within the Europeana ecosystem&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The WEAVE project was pioneering in many aspects, but in particular, in that it served as an example for future Europeana projects as it centered marginalised or/and local communities in all project activities. The WEAVE consortium actively engaged with Europeana Foundation’s Diversity and Inclusion cross-team to create unique capacity building events, which helped participants to better understand the point of view of minoritised communities. WEAVE also actively contributed to the reflection on, and analysis of, metadata curation in the light of communities’ representation in digital heritage collections via the participation of&nbsp;project partner Photoconsortium in the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum Diversity and Inclusion Working Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The efforts made in the development of the capacity building workshops and sessions, as well as editorials presented and commissioned by WEAVE with underrepresented communities, will be used as reference for future work by Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More information about the project, its consortium, as well as links to all resources and recordings from the events organised are available on the <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/\">project website</a> maintained by <a href=\"https://in-two.com/\">IN2 Digital Innovations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>The transposition process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In late 2019, the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania formed a national working group on the transposition of the provisions of the Directive. Representatives from libraries, archives, museums and other cultural institutions submitted a position paper to the Ministry with support from the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons. In turn, a position paper reacting to the points raised by cultural heritage organisations was published by collective management organisations and publishers, which unfortunately generated more attention than the points raised by the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lithuania officially completed the process of transposing the CDSM Directive on 24 March 2022, with the adoption of the draft law by the Seimas (Parliament). However, part of the provisions only entered into force in May and in June.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Text and data mining</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of the transposition of the text and data mining provisions into Lithuanian law, scientific research organisations and cultural heritage institutions are allowed to reproduce materials to which they have legal access in order to carry out text and data mining, as long as it is for non-commercial and research purposes. They can do this without the permission of the rightsholder and without paying any copyright royalties. Copies of works made for this purpose can be stored and retained for research purposes, including to verify research results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A second exception allowing anyone to conduct text and data mining was also adopted in line with the Directive, with the possibility for rightsholders to prohibit the use of their materials in this way. Overall, these provisions were incorporated in a way that is very faithful to the text of the Directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preservation of cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transposition of the preservation exception has resulted in an expansion of the scope of the existing preservation exception in Lithuanian copyright law. The current provision allows cultural heritage institutions to make reproductions of materials held in their ‘permanent’ collections (understood as belonging to the institution ‘by right of ownership’ or ‘transferred by right of trust’) for preservation purposes, regardless of the type of materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This use is not subject to remuneration. It is possible for cultural heritage institutions to rely on third parties to create these copies. There is no limitation on the format or medium of the reproduction or on the number of copies. The right for cultural heritage organisations to make these copies cannot be removed via contract by the rightsholder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital and cross-border teaching activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the transposition of the CDSM Directive, current Lithuanian copyright law allows for certain uses of protected materials for teaching activities without the need for permission from the rightsholder. This is based on an exception to copyright, rather than a licence-based system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under the exception, educational institutions, including university libraries and archives that take part in formal educational programmes, can reproduce, publish, make publicly available (via computer networks online) and display small-scale or short excerpts of works and their digital copies. This can be both in the original language and a translation, and only for non-commercial teaching and research purposes, and to the extent necessary for the activity. As long as the uses are under the responsibility of the educational institution, they can take place on their premises or in other places, or using a secure electronic network to which only the teachers, lecturers and students of the educational institution have access. Terms of contracts that prevent these legal uses are not valid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Out of commerce works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of commerce works are works that are likely in copyright, that sit in cultural heritage collections but are no longer, or were never, available commercially. The Lithuanian copyright law now provides for a system based on a licence or an exception. The licence, granted by a collective management organisation that is sufficiently representative of the type of material and rights, allows cultural heritage institutions to make out of commerce works available online in the European Union and European Economic Area. Under the exception, ‘making available online’ is limited to Lithuania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both the licences and the exception should allow for the digitisation and sharing online out of commerce works, as long as they are permanently located in the collections of the cultural heritage institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Lithuanian provision does not define out of commerce works beyond the text of the Directive, nor the ‘reasonable effort’ that needs to be conducted to determine that a work is out of commerce, but this might be covered in a resolution by the Government or in explanations of the Ministry of Culture. It is likely that a national database run by the National Library of Lithuania will be set up for publicity measures of out of commerce works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rights holders can request that their works are not used either by initiating an opt-out procedure on the <a href=\"https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/outofcommerceworks\">European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) portal</a> or by submitting a request to the cultural heritage institution. In that case, the institution shall evaluate the request, take the necessary steps to stop the use of the material, and inform the rightsholder within 10 working days. Applications can also be processed by a collective management organisation when material is used under a licence. Rightsholders that opt out are entitled to a one-time compensation for the use of the material, paid from government budgets, by submitting a request to an institution authorised by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Public Domain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The public domain provision in the CDSM Directive requires that no neighbouring rights for non-original photography are claimed in digital reproductions of works of visual arts in the public domain. As a result, works of visual arts in the public domain shared digitally should be free from copyright restrictions, unless the reproduction of the work is a ‘work of art’ protected by copyright in itself. Lithuania has transposed this provision into Lithuanian law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about the transposition of the CDSM Directive and copyright law in Lithuania in the Communia pages (<a href=\"https://eurovision.communia-association.org/detail/lithuania/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Lithuania-0915a3f8be564952a6c7ae1d07a6e225\">here</a>), the <a href=\"https://microsites.bournemouth.ac.uk/cippm/2020/10/28/observatory-on-national-implementation-of-dsm-exceptions-limitations/\">CIPPM page</a>.

Best known as the ‘Poet Laureate’ on Russell Brand's SONY award-winning Radio show, his work has been featured in the Times, The Guardian and the New Statesman, and he has presented several radio series. He was the summit Poet-in-Residence for the UK’s Open Data Institute where he coined the phrase ‘Data Poetry’. In 2019 the Open Data Institute commissioned Mr Gee’s first ever data artwork, ‘<a href=\"https://culture.theodi.org/firetruck/\">Bring Me My Fire Truck</a>’. You can follow Mr Gee on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrgeepoet/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrgeepoet\">Twitter</a>,&nbsp;@mrgeepoet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mr Gee's perspective that, ‘There is this beautiful poetry, there is this beautiful storytelling, there is this beautiful artistic expression within the data industry’ led to some truly unique retellings of the three days of Europeana 2022 in poetry. Mr Gee’s reflections were, for many attendees, one of the highlights of the conference:</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-datasets-available-for-reuse-in-eu-datathon-competition\">EU Datathon</a> is an annual competition which provides ‘a chance for open data enthusiasts and application developers from around the world to demonstrate the potential of open data, get international visibility for their innovative ideas and compete for their share of the total prize fund of €200,000 and the Public Choice Award.’ They are invited to make use of <a href=\"https://data.europa.eu/\">data.europa.eu</a>, the official portal for European data, managed by the Publications Office of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />With the Europeana.eu dataset published on <a href=\"https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/europeana-aggregated-dataset?locale=en\">data.europa.eu</a> earlier this year, aggregating metadata from the approximately 4,000 cultural heritage institutions that provide content to Europeana, proposals and apps designed for the competition could also benefit from it for their entries. As an official partner of the competition, Europeana invited researchers, university professors and students from Social Sciences and Humanities, and Computer and Information Science to take part in the EU Datathon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After two rounds of pre-selections of 156 entries from 38 countries, a team that is developing an app based on the Europeana.eu dataset was one the 12 finalists and was awarded a prize of 7,000 euros under Challenge Number 4: ‘A Europe Fit for the Digital Age’ at the award ceremony that took place in Brussels on 20 October 2022. The team is composed of Professor Johanna Monti;&nbsp;researcher, Maria Pia di Buono; and two PhD students, Gennaro Nolano and Giulia Speranza. Johanna Monti tells us about the experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us about the app that you developed and the process of creating it? &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We developed Maggie, a real-time chatbot that functions as a virtual assistant to help people access and discover European cultural content. People can interact with Maggie through natural language questions and ask about European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main idea behind Maggie is exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies to develop an user centric&nbsp; app which facilitates the access and discovery of multilingual cultural content. The intended audience of Maggie is very diverse; the app tailors content on users’ knowledge and interests to satisfy different information needs, from students to experts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maggie is the result of more than a decade of research activities which began in 2012 with our very first experiments in <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6744767\">Cross-Language Information retrieval on Cultural Heritage</a>. After that, several milestones marked our way to Maggie, including the establishment of the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/unior-nlp-research-group/home?authuser=0\">UNIOR NLP Research group </a>of the University of Naples L'Orientale in 2016, and several several projects from 2019 until 2021, including the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/smach-project/home?authuser=0\">SMACH Project (Semantic Multilingual Access to Cultural Heritage)</a>, the ArchaeoTerm project which offers a resource of archaeological terms available within the framework of <a href=\"https://yourterm.eu/yourterm-cult/\">YourTerm CULT project</a>, and the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://github.com/unior-nlp-research-group/NEAT\">NEAT (Named Entities in Archaeological Texts)</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you decide to use the Europeana.eu dataset?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our research group has always been committed to making cultural content easily accessible for everyone, by developing systems and applications for cultural heritage. In this sense, we have already exploited European open data (in the form of data from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">the Europeana </a>website) in several works, all aimed at improving current state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing tasks for better access to cultural heritage content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In all these cases, the core of the data we used was represented by open data scraped from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search\">Europeana Search API</a>, which makes it easy for aggregated data to be accessed and reused, while also ensuring the high quality of the data, and their multilinguality. While in previous experiments much of the information described by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (such as data about localisation, authors and themes) was not used, to develop Maggie, we fully exploit the rich source of information offered by Europeana, as we aimed to develop a more specific Natural Language Processing task.</p>\r\n"

This is the case of our app Maggie.&nbsp; Without open data from Europeana and data.europa.eu, we couldn’t have developed Maggie.&nbsp; We extract information about each artwork made available through Europeana, such as its author, creation date and so on, and we aggregate the information about its geolocation from the GeoDataset of data.europa.eu.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you decide to enter the EU Datathon competition?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was a big challenge for us as we tried to gather all our previous efforts in one single application which could help people easily access European cultural content in today’s digital age. However, it also represented an opportunity to get out of pure academic research, and commit in a proof of concept which goes beyond the prototype stage, towards something which might actually be used in a real-world situation; all while making use of state-of-art methodologies, resources and tools in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give others entering a competition like this?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joining competitions which promote the use of open data is a way of supporting the implementation, spread, and adoption of such data. It also contributes to the improvement and maintenance of datasets which, due to the amount of data and sources, are difficult to manage, clean, and test. The results of these types of competitions have a real impact on society, directly related to the possibility of improving the quality of life of citizens, by making information and knowledge about the society they live in accessible and readily available. Our advice to researchers is to get out of their comfort zone, and to combine the rigour of research with the creativity of the design process, thinking of the beneficial impact on society as the final objective.</p>\r\n"

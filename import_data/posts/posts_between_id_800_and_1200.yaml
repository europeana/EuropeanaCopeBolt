        title: 'Why are projects like Digital Manuscripts to Europeana important for Europeana’s future?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Moving from a portal to a platform: this is one of Europeana’ s<a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\"> major objectives for 2015-2020</a> in order to allow “people to re-use and play with the material, to interact with others and participate in creating something new”. Europeana can’t achieve this vision on its own and it needs the support of its Network and other valuable related projects. The Digital Manuscripts to Europeana project (DM2E) is one of these projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in February 2012 and ending last January, the DM2E project focused on the development of Linked Data based solutions and tools that enable libraries and archives to provide digital manuscripts to Europeana. Along the way, the project developed a new data model for manuscripts, and technical solutions to allow the description, the manipulation and enrichment of the data. The results were promoted within and validated by the Digital Humanities community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what makes the results of the DM2E project beneficial to Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s broad vision is supported by activities running on three different levels:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>A <strong>Core </strong>where we collect the data, content and technology.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>An <strong>Access </strong>level where we standardise and enrich the core, define the rules of engagement and provide the interfaces for access.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>And a <strong>Service </strong>level, where we develop tailored experiences for our three user groups: Professionals, End-Users and Creatives.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DM2E makes a positive contribution to all three of these levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/guF36sII8yXdrvsArWs_brkzoXp6nJQTmfANLK6O4G0kZ6H2gdhv8nLOfd_iAlJ7AfqUMT-16PCYXzANZouE503fnKeTCSsz-5tK_-jrFPMqFTrT692u1bgn8WxBdtIBkfklUvQ\" width=\"600px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Strategy%202020.pdf\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a>.Visuals by Elco van Staveneren, www.denkschets.nl (CC-BY-SA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improving Europeana’s core</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DM2E brings additional 20.08 million manuscripts pages from national libraries, archives and research institutions across Europe. These manuscripts come from important corpora for Digital Humanities researchers. Until this project, modern manuscripts were underrepresented in Europeana. Furthermore, this content enriches Europeana in multilingual data. Content and data cover a variety of languages: German, Latin, French, Italian, English, Czech but also Arabic and Turkish, less represented in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata couldn’t be integrated into Europeana without defining a proper interoperability framework. The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/DM2E_Model_V1.2.pdf\">DM2E model </a>is developed using the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model </a>(EDM) and specialises it to support the requirements of the project. The DM2E model allows the description of rich metadata for manuscripts, answering the needs of scholars without hindering the interoperability with Europeana as the DM2E model is built on top of the Europeana one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions during the project enabled the creation of mapping recommendations that have been useful to Europeana for improving its model. The model also demonstrates how EDM can be extended so as to support different grains of data. The discussions around the development of the DM2E model and EDM application profiles in general were also opened out to the wider community in a <a href=\"http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/RDF_Application_Profiles\">task group</a> at the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. The issues are currently being discussed with Europeana as well as other partners such as the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\">German Digital Library</a> or <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">DPLA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DM2E model is only one building block within a larger <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D2.3_1.0_WP2_Final_Version_of_the_Interoperability_Infrastructure_140214_final.pdf\">interoperability infrastructure </a>allowing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>The description of metadata transformation, provenance, versioning workflows.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>The mapping of the original metadata (in various formats) to the DM2E model and then to the Europeana EDM.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The contextualisation of resources by the generation of links to external sources (performed with <a href=\"http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/silk/\">Silk</a>)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The dissemination of RDF data via a Linked Data API</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The access of the transformed EDM data via an OAI-PMH service</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D2.3_1.0_WP2_Final_Version_of_the_Interoperability_Infrastructure_140214_final.pdf\">OmNom</a> engine independently integrates and orchestrates the tools supporting these different workflows.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All the DM2E tools are the outcome of a great deal of innovation work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This flexibility of the aggregation services built by DM2E is what Europeana hopes to achieve for its own aggregation services but also for its network of providers and aggregators. This impressive infrastructure could benefit Europeana own services, but also other organisations within the Network who share the same needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Providing access to data, content and technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing new data to the Europeana core and improving the overall data quality is a great achievement, but becomes even more valuable if Europeana can provide access to it. The DM2E project has developed ways to allow the content, the data and technology to be re-used after the project ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The publication of the data under the Creative Commons CC0 licence enables the data to be openly accessed. The Linked Data API developed by DM2E facilitates the distribution of the data while the enrichments performed on the data enables a better access to resources by the Digital Humanities community. All these tools have been made available as open source software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Offering new services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By encouraging humanists to work with Linked Data, the DM2E project has nurtured a thriving relationship with a community that was, until this point, not well-represented in the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis of the research processes in the humanities supported the development of a series of digital tools included in the Scholarly Research Platform. The created <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D3.4_2.0_Research_Report_on_DH_Scholarly_Primitives_150402.pdf\">model</a> defines new types of scholarly activities involving collaborative commenting, annotating, collecting, and the sharing data. The results of the DM2E project were tested and validated by scholars in experiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scholarly Research Platform is based on the open source tool <a href=\"http://thepund.it/\">Pundit </a>which</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>allows users to create structured data while annotating pages and text on the Web.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>supports the semantic linking of text and images to the DM2E data but also to controlled vocabularies and taxonomies.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This approach completes Europeana’s recent work around data enrichment and the development of its “semantic layer”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"dm2e_eu_files_Public_Final_Report_150331_pdf.jpg\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1KEr_Gb_crTNOxjhcacufjbLKCRa2CR4K2iM1pU4Q6MiDuvfog2ZEqkdONQUqc0Y001DUZ8O3LMpArpda6rv9xuPthSKmiZiF7yaWzn560EYhQAz8wIFfxsbfavbTdHLzqqRqlk\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholarly Research Platform “Pundit”: The software ecosystem overview</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is now in the position to re-use the efforts made by the DM2E project to elaborate the new <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a> and the developments of the services it will offers. Projects such as DM2E indicate areas that Europeana should be exploring to deepen that relationship and provide more meaningful links between the GLAM sector and the digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>in addition, the DM2E project participated in bringing new communities into the Europeana Network around topics such as open data, and data trust. <a href=\"http://openhumanitiesawards.org/\">The Open Humanities Awards</a>, for instance, demonstrate how the research community can foster innovation around cultural heritage data, while the <a href=\"http://openglam.org/\">OpenGLAM community</a> initiated by Open Knowledge in the DM2E project works on promoting and furthering free and open access to digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these results shows how R&amp;D developments can support the Europeana platform and its future services. The work of the DM2E affects all the levels of the platform: it improves its core, provides new ways to access and re-use materials and brings promise of great services in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the DM2E outputs, publication and results can be found at <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/outputs/\">http://dm2e.eu/outputs/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Some resources are already fully open online, in all sense of the words. The recent publication of transcribed data from <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">The</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">Text</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">Creation</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">Partnership</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">on</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">early</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">English</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">language</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Text-Creation-Partnership\">texts</a> is a great example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many mass digitisation datasets are not quite as open, meaning they cannot be used in for text and data mining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As probably the largest textual dataset in the world, the Google corpus of digitised books is perhaps the most interesting for re-use in the digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a tool for simple discovery, allowing anyone to search through the OCRd text of over 30m books, even scholarship’s most profound opponent of technology cannot fail to make use of Google Book Search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on this, the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google</a> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">n</a><a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">-</a><a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">gram</a> <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">viewer</a> allows users to see the frequency of words across some of it corpus (although not all languages are included). More recent versions of the n-gram viewer have improved the functionality, allowing for searches including distinction between upper and lower case, and using wildcards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">Google</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">has</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">also</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">made</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">the</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">n</a><a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">-</a><a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">grams</a> <a href=\"http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html\">available</a> from certain languages within the corpus so they can be downloaded for offline use (with a CC-BY licence). These aren't the indices of the books but extracted keywords from the corpus. So the 2 gram index features (and counts) all instance of phrases with two words, eg \"slippery eel\" or \"magic mushroom\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The availability of both this viewer and the data has provoked some new strands of scholarship, most notably the <a href=\"http://www.culturomics.org/\">Cultronomics</a> <a href=\"http://www.culturomics.org/\">movement</a> instigated at Harvard and Princeton (<a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">See</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">one</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">their</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">early</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">papers</a> <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.abstract\">here</a>) It should be noted that criticism of this approach has already begun. A 2015 paper pointed out some of the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">flaws</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">with</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">drawing</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">too</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">many</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">conclusions</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">from</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">the</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">Google</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00960\">corpus</a>, particularly as there was no related metadata to know what was precisely in each n-gram index</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what Google doesn't do is allow bulk access to the original OCRd text. You can get the plain text OCR to a single page or group of pages, and a pdf or sometimes an ePub of the whole text. But if you want to get easy access to the all the text for multiple books, it can't be done. The complex jungle of licensing restrictions means this can't happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">two</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">existing</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">APIs</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">for</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">Google</a> <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/books/\">Books</a> allow third parties to embed the search functionality and the image viewer on other websites. Indeed some of the libraries that contributed books to the digitisation project make use of the APIs to show their Google books on their library catalogues. But, again, these do not provide access to multiple full texts that are required for text mining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the US, the Hathi Trust (the library consortium) and in particular the related <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">Hathi</a> <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">Trust</a> <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">Research</a> <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">Center</a><a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\"> (</a><a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">HTRC</a><a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\">) </a>are addressing this issue. As cited on their home page, the HTRC are building capability for analysing the public domain and in-copyright books at scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having aggregated many digitised books from US libraries - including the US libraries who were part of the Google books program - the Research Center is now in a position to allow authenticated access to the collected dataset, allowing researchers to run algorithms over it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there doesn't exist a similar organisation in Europe. Many libraries have digitised shelves and shelves of their collections, but there is currently no systematic way at a European level to release this data for research throughout the research community. There are numerous interested stakeholders - researchers, aggregators, the libraries, politicians and policy groups and Google itself of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, here we have one of the first strategic issues that Europeana Research can help tackle. How do we liberate this data for research?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(With thanks to Steven Clayssens, <a href=\"http://www.kb.nl/en/organisation/research-expertise/research-digitization-and-digital-preservation\">KB NL Research</a>)</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Tougher times for funding proposals'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the earlier cross-disciplinary calls in the EU’s H2020 programme was for the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html\">Virtual Research Environment call (eInfra-9</a>)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The deadline for proposals was earlier this year. According to the EU website, over 90 proposals were received. Given that 40m Euros was available, and that proposals were supposed to request between 2 and 8 million Euros,<strong> this means that around 8 proposals will get funding</strong></span></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Anecdotal evidence from colleagues in other institutions involved in this call provide <strong>evidence of how much more difficult things are getting</strong>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One proposal got an astoundingly good 14.5 out of 15, but still got rejected. The only successful proposal I have heard of got 15 out of 15. This means that <strong>bids need to be literally perfect</strong> (at least in the eyes of the reviewers) to get funding.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This should sound a warning shot to those preparing proposals. It's evidence that there is less money to be had for projects, particularly now there is not the PSP_ICT programme that provided much generous funding for digital cultural heritage projects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The practice of cobbling together partners, budgets and text at the last moment may have worked when a few very clever people could work late into the nights before submission date.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But such an approach will also leave a few gaps and inconsistencies, i.e. will bear traces of imperfection. Any mistakes might mean losing crucial half points.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">So if you are serious about a project proposal, <strong>get your consortium organised early</strong>, identify your core goal, identify and agree on your coordinator and work package leaders and get writing long before the submission date.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">(For details of the EU marking system, with its three pillars of Excellent, Impact and Implementation Quality, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2014_2015/annexes/h2020-wp1415-annex-h-esacrit_en.pdf\">see the document on the EU site</a>.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">(Oh, and one of the bids that I was involved in at Europeana (Wikidata4Research) got rejected. A brilliant bid, at least in my opinion :), but one maybe ahead of its time. <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Category:WikiProject_Wikidata_for_research\">The full details of that bid are available on Wikidata.</a>)</span></p>\r\n"

        teaser: "<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the earlier cross-disciplinary calls in the EU’s H2020 programme was for the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/2144-einfra-9-2015.html\">Virtual Research Environment call (eInfra-9</a>)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The deadline for proposals was earlier this year. According to the EU website, over 90 proposals were received. Given that 40m Euros was available, and that proposals were supposed to request between 2 and 8 million Euros,<strong> this means that around 8 proposals will get funding.</strong></span></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>For Dr Delap, newspapers are a vital source for her research. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/found-researchers-wanting-to-use-historic-newspapers\">successful call</a> for researchers making use of historic newspapers, a workshop was held on May 13 at NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. It aimed to understand the precise workflows and methodologies researchers use, shape the kind of tools that can be built to them with these workflow and define how data are made available for re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 20 researchers attended, from PhD students and early career researchers to senior researchers and university lecturers, each bringing in the discussion his or her own research area and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What topics can be explored with newspapers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Lucy Delap, University Lecturer in Modern British History at the University of Cambridge was among the participants in the workshop, exploring the potential for exploiting the Europeana Newspapers corpus in new ways through the lens of her own research. Her research perspective was based on the project <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/projects/project/historical-child-sex-abuse\">‘Historicising ‘Historical child sex abuse’’</a>, an initiative rooted in her wider work with the British knowledge exchange initiative, <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/\">History &amp; Policy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research aims to provide a fuller understanding of past social, legal and political responses to child sex abuse of 20th-century Britain in order to contextualize current public inquiries and contribute to future policy making. Mainly investigated through newspapers, this topic is both intensely relevant to contemporary concerns, and can be greatly enriched by historical newspaper content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why newspapers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We came to look at newspapers sources because we were aware of the lack of other sources… Of course, we are getting a particular kind of subset of cases by using newspapers, as most cases did not come to police attention. But we are condemned to work with a non-representative sample because that’s the best we can do. It still gives us a sense of who is abusing who, in what kind of settings”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Dr. Delap told us, newspapers are a valuable source for observing the various kinds of reporting (factual, sensational), documenting spikes of coverage and recording the kind of voices commenting on cases of child sex abuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working mainly with digitised corpus, she and her research team are searching to create subsets of cases; however, “there is a lot more that we can learn about the kinds of tools - on visualization or semi-supervised searching and so on - that we could use”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>Digital aspirations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop gave participants the possibility to shape fictional user scenarios and, in this way, think of the potentials digital technology and Europeana could offer in their own research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We’d like to generate a map of change over time in the reporting of child sexual abuse in different national contexts and to be able to chart the ways in which this issue came to the fore in certain moments as a result of certain scandals or certain historical circumstances. We could then test out our theories as to what causes change in how different kinds of public bodies respond to child sexual abuse.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on Europeana, Dr. Delap suggested, “for me the real potential of Europeana is not about me sitting at home doing all the searches, but lies in collaborating with other European researchers so that each brings her or his own expertise to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than just creating a vast database of cases, our team would like to get different people bringing informed knowledge of their own national context and discussing this matter together”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers shared their ideas, Europeana listened, research innovation is hopefully upon us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Many thanks to Dr. Lucy Delap for her time and feedback! The Europeana Research blog will continue to give information on how the newspapers are being reused in research.</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'What’s up doc ! : explore the history of medicine with WUD'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>By using the broad term of “Digital Humanities” we tend to forget the diversity of disciplines it covers. What about the “Medical Humanities”</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.unifr.ch/mh/fr\">Medicine and Society chair</a> at the University of Fribourg explores the relationships between the medical practices and their social impact in order to better understand the history of Medicine and Health. The challenge is how to lead these studies in a digital environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University of Fribourg started to explore the wealth of digitised Cultural Heritage materials in a virtual exhibition about <a href=\"http://manger.unifr.ch/grid.php\">Food and its history</a>. This exhibition re-uses materials from cultural heritage institutions like the Rijksmuseum or the Wellcome Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University went further by developing <a href=\"http://unifr.ch/mh/wud\">WUD</a> (\"What’s up doc”), a discovery engine based on the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and DPLA APIs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WUD currently retrieves any object from the Europeana and DPLA datasets but the team is currently working on a filter that will enable users to retrieve only results specific to the history of medicine. New cultural heritage datasets will be also added such as <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research.aspx\">The British Museum</a> or <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WUD is open source and the code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/aperlini/WUD\">Github</a>. It was built with <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">Angular JS</a> and <a href=\"https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/\">UI Bootstrap</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WUD demonstrates how Europeana data can be re-used in domain specific areas. The development of simple interface pre-selecting and organising content related to a specific theme makes cultural heritage data more accessible to researchers.<br>\r\nThe WUD team is seeking for feedback, feel free to contact <a href=\"mailto:radu.suciu@unifr.ch\">them</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentine Charles (Europeana Foundation), @valentinec89, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/valentinec89\">https://twitter.com/valentinec89</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radu Suciu (University of Fribourg), @radusuciu, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/radusuciu\">http://twitter.com/radusuciu</a>.</p>\r\n"

They are essential tools for democracy, holding government to account and allowing historians to trace the political development of nation states</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parliamentary Papers itself is a loose term that can encompass myriad documents. There are transcriptions of speeches and dialogues from one or both debating chambers; there are committee papers; there are published laws and their amendments; their are written questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each country has a unique system that creates a whole different range of documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, taking a look at one part of the French parliament, <a href=\"http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/documents-parlementaires\">l'Assemblée nationale </a>(National Assembly), one can find, amongst other things, Questions écrites (written questions), Amendments, rapports and comptes rendus (reports).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also related papers from the other house of the French Parliamentary system, <a href=\"http://www.senat.fr/\">Le Sénat</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Europeana Research content strategy, we are looking into the extent to which parliamentary papers from the EU member states are available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is obviously a massive task, made more complex by the individual idiosyncrasies of each system and the language differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, while the task aims to summarise what is available and from what time periods, we also want to explore how open the parliamentary papers are - what licence accompanies the documents, are they available for search only or for downloading as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've made a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LLj-pPmo2WG1YWqA18U5hSAv9TpnZX4_wRa5bcPgvFo/edit#gid=0\">Google document open to record the information we collect</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also looking for help - we are very keen to hear from experts and interested parties if they have specific knowledge about the papers of one country. Or if you interested in exploring the papers from a research angle, we are also happy to hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please get in touch !</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/alastair-dunning-1\">Alastair Dunning</a><br>\r\nMartin Schaller</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Last month, I travelled to Paris to take part in the <a href=\"http://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/2428\">Digital Humanities Experiments Conference #dhiha6</a> held at the <a href=\"http://www.dhi-paris.fr/\">German Historical Institute Paris</a>. Revolving around the theme of “experiments”, this two-day conference gave to approximately 20 young researchers, including me, the opportunity to express their own views and experience from the area of Digital Humanities in a friendly, highly dialogical environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/dhip-bild0.jpg\" style=\"width: 425px; height: 299px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.dhi-paris.fr/\">The German Historical Institute Paris</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hosted in the beautiful building of L’Institut historique allemand (IHA), in Le Marais, the Digital Humanities Experiments Conference 2015 aimed to address the gap between the research culture with which Digital Humanists are equipped via their disciplinary backgrounds and the research culture they foster in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Why does experimentation play a crucial role in Digital Humanities? How does it contribute to define the relationship between method and research questions? Can we identify barriers which currently prevent Digital Humanities from developing their full potential, leaving little room for iteration, comparison or failure?”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this context, some of the topics explored were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The value of failure in science</li>\r\n    <li>Research infrastructure as experiments</li>\r\n    <li>Digital research and creativity</li>\r\n    <li>Interdisciplinary experimentations</li>\r\n    <li>Define a protocol</li>\r\n    <li>Citizen digital humanities</li>\r\n    <li>Bibliometrics</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Examples of experimentation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From ConverStations to Laboratories, the Conference itself was structured based on an experimental basis. <a href=\"http://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/2468\">Conversation Stations</a> were introduced as a way for the participants to debate different topics, at different tables with different people. With each debate lasting 17 minutes, participants were creatively expressing their views on four of the topics presented before, chosen according to their interests. Following this, four parallel <a href=\"http://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/2479\">Laboratories</a> were held on four thematic sessions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Laboratory 1: Aggregate, visualize and browse information about researchers and their activities</li>\r\n    <li>Laboratory 2: Open analytical ecosystems for digital humanities</li>\r\n    <li>Laboratory 3: Texts in a Laboratory</li>\r\n    <li>Laboratory 4: Machine Translation</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/dhiha6.jpg\" style=\"width: 810px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>ConverStation on Bibliometrics</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the experimentation in the Digital Humanities, the organizers of the conference called for blog posts, rather than for papers or articles, encouraging participants to contribute to the <a href=\"http://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/2416\">Blog Carnival: Experiments in Digital Humanities #dhiha6</a> before their arrival in Paris. Being part of the team of Europeana Research, I grasped this opportunity for introducing the work of building such a research infrastructure as a space of collaboration, experimentation and research. My contribution thus focused on my involvement in this ‘Digital Humanities endeavour’ for formulating the user requirements of the research community, Humanities and Social Sciences, and building a researchers’ network followed by work on the actual outcome of the digital platform, build to serve the community and its needs. This journey through desk research, case studies, web survey and Expert Fora in collaboration with the wider Europeana Research team was presented alongside other research initiatives in the platform <a href=\"https://medium.com/@elizapapaki/being-part-of-the-team-building-a-new-research-platform-96bbaf95c982\">Medium</a>. Spreading the word on Europeana Research agrees with the 2015 internal targets as a way of continuing to gather user requirements and feedback from the wider community.</p>\r\n"

        title: '20th Century School History for 21st Century Scholars'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>The 20th century saw a rapid development in schools and education throughout Europe, and school history is a topic of interest to a wide range of researchers in a variety of disciplines throughout Europe and beyond. Much of our cultural heritage is in some way or other tied to the education of school children: of pedagogical and social situations as well as physical environments. For this reason, one of the topics selected for the future content strategy of Europeana Research is European school history of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This topic evolves through three parallel tracks that feed into each other. All three tracks are currently works-in-progress, in the early stages of their development, and suggestions and information would be greatly appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first track concerns the identification of material in <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">the Europeana database</a> that may be of interest for research into school history. Europeana includes a great wealth of documented image, sound, video, and text material of potential interest to researchers. We have used a wide range of search terms to identify as much of this material as possible and divided the results into rough categories. Examples of categories include documentaries and news clips about school life, school trips, and the inauguration of school buildings; interviews with school children; pupils’ projects, journals, and exam papers; school reports and registers; political material about school policies; photos of school life, interiors and exteriors, and a plethora of school-related objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second track aims to find European collections of school history that are not part of Europeana but which may be of interest to researchers, and which therefore should be considered for inclusion. There seem to be four different types of museums, but few of them have been found in Europeana (this goes even for national museums for school, education and pedagogics).</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>National museums of Schools and Education – large national collections, often digitized, meant for research as well as public access.</li>\r\n    <li>Research Museums of Pedagogy and Education – connected to research institutions. Large collections meant for research. Good chance collections have been digitized.</li>\r\n    <li>Major School Museums – collections of thousands of objects, possibly digitized and with research facilities.</li>\r\n    <li>Minor/Local School Museums – collections of hundreds of objects, often not digitized, and run either under the aegis of a larger institution (which may have provided data to Europeana), or as a hands-on “experience” for families/school classes.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>The third track, and the most important one, is engagement with the researcher community. The Europeana Research collections are ultimately meant to be useful resources for future research. Therefore, we attempt to obtain the views and opinions of researchers in relevant disciplines on what material from tracks one and two would be worth bringing into Europeana Research, and what can safely be ignored. Through discussion groups, skype meetings, and e-mail conversations, we hope to get as much input as possible from the scholarly community, on possible content but also on how that content should best be presented and what documentation it requires to be useful. What we learn in this track constantly informs the work in the two other tracks, letting us shape the most useful content strategy we can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work with the content strategy has just begun, and we appreciate any comments, suggestions, and offers of assistance. If you work in the area of school history research somewhere in Europe, and have found something in Europeana that you would like to see included in Europeana Research (or that you know can be excluded); if you know of collections that could be brought into Europeana Research (or collections that should at least be documented there); or if you have any ideas that you think may be helpful, do not hesitate to get in touch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Cloud team at the <a href=\"http://snd.gu.se/en\">Swedish National Data Service</a> / University of Gothenburg:<br>\r\nStefan Ekman: <a href=\"mailto:stefan.ekman@snd.gu.se\">stefan.ekman@snd.gu.se</a><br>\r\nIlze Lace: <a href=\"mailto:ilze.lace@snd.gu.se\">ilze.lace@snd.gu.se</a><br>\r\nDimitar Popovski: <a href=\"mailto:dimitar.popovski@snd.gu.se\">dimitar.popovski@snd.gu.se</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>During a recent <a href=\"http://summerschool.dcu.gr/\">ARIADNE Expert Forum</a> on the digital futures of archaeological practice held in Athens, Professor Gary Lock expressed a rather provocative idea: Digital Archaeology, he said, may be an established self-contained sub-discipline of Archaeology. It sounded interesting. If Digital Archaeology is indeed a sub-discipline of Archaeology, let alone a self-contained one, one would be safe to assume that Archaeology is indeed a self-contained discipline in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Elementary grammar might suggest that “Classical Archaeology” is a sub-discipline that forms an integral part of one subject – Archaeology – and has especially close links with another – Classics. But elementary grammar, here as in some other instances, is profoundly misleading</em>. Thus wrote Anthony Snodgrass[1] in the mid-eighties, when academic musings on the semantic constructs of Archaeology were perpetuating an intellectual dialogue with Jean-Claude Gardin, who, in 1980, extensively discussed what he saw as the logical and semantic constructs which constitute or underlie Archaeology as a scholarly discipline.[2] By intellectual discipline, Gardin referred to all those aspects of the field that are not essentially practical and technical, namely all archaeological endeavours outside of fieldwork and technical/laboratory work, later to be challenged by Ian Hodder,[3] as well as Snodgrass’ own student, Ian Morris, who emphatically stated that “Archaeology is cultural history or it is nothing”.[4]</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Other_images/dsc06340.jpg\" style=\"width: 672px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo taken at the Ariadne Expert Forum: Sub-disciplines were as many as the people in the room.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where does this all leave us today that Archaeology is increasingly becoming digital, at a time when digital research infrastructures across Europe attempt to support digital research in the Humanities through meeting documented user needs of the so-called research communities? How helpful is it, really, to view Archaeology as one solid discipline, or, in fact, Digital Archaeology as a self-contained sub-discipline, when almost all empirical studies on user requirements in the context of digital research infrastructures have revealed numerous underlying variations in the ways Archaeologists carry out research? Are their methods, activities, resources, research goals and schools of thought similar, and if yes in what ways? And, if not, then how does this affect the design of effective user-centred digital research infrastructures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost fifteen years ago I embarked on doctoral research in Archaeology. In a way, my thesis was both classic and Classical: I employed very conventional research methods and absolutely basic tools to produce a piece of work on fifth century B.C. Corinthia. I used Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, and Illustrator. That was it, and yet I had managed to reconstruct and re-interpret the one of the most turbulent periods of Corinthian History. Right across from me at the ARIADNE Expert Forum sat Martin Duffy, whose PhD thesis focuses on settlement and landscape in the early medieval kingdom of Brega, in Ireland, and covers a period of seven centuries, from 400-1100 AD. Martin is working within a very sophisticated GIS framework to utilize new data and create changing models of settlement and landscape organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to argue, Martin and I are both archaeologists. But to what extent really do we both belong to the same discipline? Apart from some similar basic university units we may - or may not - have taken during our early bachelor years, to what extent do we employ the same research methods? And are there differences in the way we use existing digital tools and services? Yes, there certainly are and one cannot hide from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital research infrastructures should look at Archaeology - Digital or non - as a set of numerous hardly self-contained sub-disciplines; Archaeological research sub-communities are not autonomous or self-sufficient. Rather, they are co-dependent, interdisciplinary and largely inhomogeneous. Only those digital research infrastructures which address this granularity in sub-communities of practice and their respective user needs are to be meaningful to researchers. As Ian Hodder put it recently, <em>One of the things I thought was very important during the 1980s was the idea that culture is meaningfully constituted. I still think that is right. But now, I put the emphasis on the \"meaningful constitution\"rather than the \"cultural\" bit. (...) I prefer to break it down and talk about the various processes that constitute it</em>.[5]</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\n<p>[1] Snodgrass, A.M., “An Archaeology of Greece: The Present State and Future Scope of a Discipline:, University of California Press, 1987.<br>\r\n[2] Gardin, J-C., “Archaeological Constructs: An Aspect of Theoretical Archaeology”, Cambridge University Press, 1980.<br>\r\n[3] Hodder, I., “Theory and Practice in Archaeology”, Routledge, 1992.<br>\r\n[4] Morris, I., “Archaeology as Cultural History – Words and Things in Iron Age Greece”, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991.<br>\r\n[5] To The Trowel's Edge: An Interview with Ian Hodder, <a href=\"http://ucexchange.uchicago.edu/interviews/hodder.html\">http://ucexchange.uchicago.edu/interviews/hodder.html</a> (consulted on 10.07.2015)</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><strong>via <a href=\"http://lornamhughes.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/nemo-nedimah-methods-ontology-launched.html\">LORNA M. HUGHES Blog post</a></strong></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I’m delighted to announce the launch of NeMO, The NeDiMAH Methods Ontology, a major new component of the international digital humanities research infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NeMO is the final research output of the <a href=\"http://www.esf.org/\">European Science Foundation</a> Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities (<a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/\">NeDiMAH</a>). It is a comprehensive ontological model of scholarly practice in the arts and humanities. NeMO was developed by the <a href=\"http://www.dcu.gr/\">Digital Curation Unit (DCU), ATHENA RC</a> in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/workgroups/development-ict-methods-taxonomy\">NeDiMAH Ontology Working Group</a>. For more information, please see: <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/content/nedimah-methods-ontology-nemo\">http://www.nedimah.eu/content/nedimah-methods-ontology-nemo</a>. The direct link to NeMo is <a href=\"http://nemo.dcu.gr/\">http://nemo.dcu.gr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Background: NeDiMAH, and understanding Digital Humanities in Practice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/\">NeDiMAH</a> was a ESF Research Networking Programme (RNP) funded from May 2011-May 2015. It was a collaboration of 16 ESF Member organisations, and was co-Chaired by myself, <a href=\"https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/faculty-arts-celtic-studies-philosophy/our-people/susan-schreibman\">Susan Schreibman</a> (University of Maynooth, Ireland) and <a href=\"http://www.jannidis.de/\">Fotis Jannidis</a> (University of Würzburg, Germany, from 2011-14).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NeDiMAH brought into partnership the digital humanities researchers of16 NeDiMAH <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/Contributing-Organisations\">Member countries</a> (Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK). The Network built a collaborative forum to research the practice of advanced digital methods in the arts and humanities, via an extensive programme of activities. NeDiMAH explored key areas of theory and practice in a number of methodological areas, via <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/workgroups\">Working Groups</a>. Areas of focus included the analysis of time and space, visualization, linked data, large scale data analysis, editing, manuscript imaging, temporal modeling, and scholarly communications. The reach of these activities has been documented visually in a series of maps of digital humanities activities across Europe:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/content/events-map\">http://www.nedimah.eu/content/events-maps</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/content/map\">http://www.nedimah.eu/content/map</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our activities, the Network was able to get a sense of the diversity of practice of digital humanities around Europe, and to understand and demonstrate the collaborative and trans-national nature of digital humanities, and to demonstrate the integration of digital approaches into all aspects of the research lifecycle. Our objective was to understand better the impact that digital methods have had on transforming scholarship in the arts and humanities, and the potential for extending the benefits of digital research to the creative industries, the commercial sector, and public policy and planning. Collaboration has been key: with scientific and technical disciplines; with data science; with libraries, archives and museums; with existing European research infrastructures including <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a>, <a href=\"http://clarin.eu/\">CLARIN</a> and <a href=\"http://dariah.eu/\">DARIAH</a>. The essential complexity of the digital environment means that individual researchers and small groups are less able to exploit it effectively, so collaborative models are emerging as the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evidence gathered by NeDiMAH is an excellent basis for understanding the impact of core elements of current digital research: the seamless integration of data, and a critical engagement with its management and preservation as part of the humanities research life-cycle; the ability to scale up (and down) while working with heterogeneous data from diverse sources; skills for the critical analysis and interpretation of data created locally, and by commercial entities; and the experience of embedding digital scholarship in cultural contents, and those that promote widest public engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a time when attempts to define the digital humanities can be contentious, NeDiMAH has provided a powerful example that the digital humanities is essentially understood through practice, and that a critical framework for digital research within the ‘big tent’ of digital humanities must be based on a reflection of the diverse and rich work carried out to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work will be the basis for future knowledge production in the humanities that takes advantage of digital tools, methods and content. It has been consolidated in NeMo, the main and final output of NeDiMAH. NeMo is a formal expression of the practice of digital humanities that explores this richness and complexity, and provides a valuable resource for critical and peer review of digital outputs. It also demonstrates directly the scholarly ecosystem that underlies digital research in the arts and humanities as a distinctive intellectual practice with considerable impact within and without the Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About NeMO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NeMO is a unique resource that brings together the digital content, tools and methods that are at the heart of the digital humanities. It brings together work developed by our partners at the DCU, ATHENA RC, including past and current empirical work on scholarly practices (developed in the context of <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?reload=true&amp;tp=&amp;arnumber=6123273&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6123273\">Preparing DARIAH</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ehri-project.eu/\">EHRI</a>, and <a href=\"http://dariah.eu/\">DARIAH-EU</a>); their <a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/14945/benardou.pdf?sequence=2\">Scholarly Research Activity Model</a> (developed for <a href=\"http://www.dcu.gr/index.php?p=projects&amp;lang=en&amp;section=7\">DARIAH-GR</a>); and research into the need for expansion of existing digital humanities taxonomies, such as the taxonomy underpinning arts-humanities.net and now the basis for the classification of <a href=\"https://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/people-projects\">Digital Humanities at Oxford</a>. It was decided early on in the programme of NeDiMAH activities that a taxonomy is not complex enough to explore the diversity of Digital Humanities in practice, based on exemplars drawn from the NeDiMAH Methodological Working Groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NeMO is a <a href=\"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/\">CIDOC CRM</a> - compliant ontology which explicitly addresses the interplay of factors of agency (actors and goals), process (activities and methods) and resources (information resources, tools, concepts) manifest in the scholarly process. In addition to providing a formal ontology for Digital Humanities, it includes methods for classification and a shared vocabulary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefit of NeMO for the Digital Research Community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite an enormous investment in the creation of digital collections for research, very little funding has been invested into discovering what scholars actually do with ‘all this digital stuff’: digital content, but also the methods that enable us to discover, annotate, compare, and analyze digital content; and the tools that make this work possible. The first initiative to do this in a comprehensive way was the <a href=\"http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/index.html\">AHRC ICT Methods Network</a>, based at King’s College London, which I ran from 2005-8. This developed the taxonomy that was the basis of arts humanities.net as a first attempt to formally classify the ‘methodological commons’ of digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NeDiMAH went beyond this, taking the research into DH in practice into a European forum, and fostering the development of NeMO. We hope this will help to formalize and codify the expression of work in the digital arts and humanities, and make it possible to explore the inter, multi, and trans disciplinarity that is at the heart of the most exciting work in the digital humanities. It shows the human aspects of digital infrastructure: the collaborations among people that make the integration of content, tools and methods possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a means to formally describe the practice of digital humanities will contribute to the development of a commonly agreed nomenclature in Digital Humanities: something that typically happens with the maturing and consolidation of disciplines / research domains, so this is an important stage in the history of Digital Humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major next step is to populate the ontology with more existing taxonomies, case studies and exemplars, and to develop the community of researchers who use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While NeDiMAH funding has ended, an activity within the <a href=\"https://dariahre.hypotheses.org/about/dariah_vcc2\">DARIAH.EU Virtual Comptency Centre 2</a> will continue to develop NeMO through the establishment of the <a href=\"http://nedimah.eu/events/nemo-nedimah-methods-ontology-dg-digital-methods-and-practices-observatory-dimpo\">Digital Methods and Projects Observatory (DiMPO)</a>. DIMPO will develop and provide an evidence-based, up-to-date, and pragmatically useful account of the emerging information practices, needs and attitudes of arts and humanities researchers in the evolving European digital scholarly environment, for the benefit of the digital humanities research community. It seeks to achieve this objective through the inception of a longitudinal mixed methods research and monitoring programme on the information practices and scholarly methods employed in digitally-enabled arts and humanities work across Europe, and through the digital dissemination, validation and enrichment of research outcomes by the scholarly community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further to DiMPO, the NeMO team will seek to collaborate with <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a>, the newly-launched research portal of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a>, supports and fosters research in the humanities and social sciences through the meaningful re-use of Europeana content and metadata. The work will be taken forward at a series of workshops and case studies orgnaised by Europeana Research to further scope the best way of developing NeMO as a methodological layer for the international e-research community. This will maximise the value of national and international e-research initiatives by developing a methodological layer that allows arts and humanities researchers to develop, refine and share research methods that allow them to create and make best use of digital collections, as well as methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://nemo.dcu.gr/\">http://nemo.dcu.gr</a><br><br>\r\nFor more information about NeMO, please contact Lorna Hughes (Chair of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology Working Group), or Panos Constantopoulos, Agiatis Benardou, Costis Dallas (Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA RC, who developed NeMO), via the <a href=\"http://nedimah.dcu.gr/index.php?p=contact\">contact form</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Working on Parliamentary Papers'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This blog post can be seen as a follow up to Alastair Dunning’s recent<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/parliamentary-papers-in-europe\"> entry</a> on Parliamentary Papers</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><br>\r\nHe mentioned an ongoing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LLj-pPmo2WG1YWqA18U5hSAv9TpnZX4_wRa5bcPgvFo/edit#gid=0\">collection of information on the availability of Parliamentary Papers online</a>. In this post I’d like to expand a bit on our first results especially focusing on Central Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we have a look at the first results, one feature is particular striking: diversity. Diversity in terms of the various parliament’s historical development, in terms of their structure but also in terms of the online availability of European parliamentary papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Central Europe, 1848 was a pivotal year for our topic, because the numerous uprisings in this year led to the introduction of constitutions in many states that had not had a written formal document in place yet, as for example in the Habsburg Empire (March Constitution 1849) or Prussia (Constitution of 1850).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, in many states older constitutional traditions can be found. One example is Bavaria where the first constitution was introduced during Napoleonic times. Another the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that was organized as a republic, governed by cardinal laws dating back to the late middle ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, these parliaments were far from democratic parliaments as we understand them today. But nevertheless, the introduction of constitutions was a first step to limit the powers of monarchs, who were (at least on paper) reigning absolute. If we take a closer look at a<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000134084292.html?start=23&amp;query=map+central+europe&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Fpublicdomain%2Fmark%2F1.0%2F*&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\"> contemporary map, like the one </a>below, we see that Central Europe was on the hand rather fragmented – a unified Germany took another twenty odd years to come into existence – and on the other hand assembled within greater entities – the regions under the sway of the Habsburgs and Romanovs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/parlpaperspostcontempmap.jpeg\" style=\"width: 625px; height: 454px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The map changed quite drastically, as it is well known after the Great War, but it is important to note, that the successor states of Austria-Hungary did not start from scratch. Hungary for example had a long parliamentary history traditionally dated back to the issue of the Bulla Aurea in medieval times. For other territories organized within the Holy Roman Empire, the so-called Landstände - meetings of the political representatives of the estates of the realm – fulfilled that function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does that mean for our work? In order to have a complete picture, we have to take historical developments into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this leads us to another important subject. As different traditions influenced the structures of national parliaments we know today, a focus on national level does not suffice to understand the development of European parliamentary systems. Empires might have split up, larger states might have dissolved and smaller states might have been incorporated into larger entities. Thus, regional levels should be covered as well. Otherwise we would miss the bigger picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then there is also question of the parliament’s internal structures as for example not all parliaments are organized in two chambers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Going Digital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as in historical development and parliamentary structures there is also great diversity in the way digitized parliamentary papers are presented online. Most parliamentary libraries operate their own portals to access their digitized material. Although most operate at a national level, some few have joined forces and operate multi-national portals as for example<a href=\"http://www.nrsr.sk/dl/?lang=en\"> The Joint Czech and Slovak Digital Library</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their portal is well-made and easy to use. The offered materials are OCRed, hence full text searchable, and downloadable as PDF. However, material on today’s Slovakia is only available from the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, because it was part of Hungary before. This could be a potential advantage of pan-European resource for parliamentary papers.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>One of the consistent messages that Europeana receives from the the research community is the need for high quality data, and of a sufficient depth to cater for different research questions within different research themes</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Europeana Cloud project, a team from Work Package 1 are exploring different topics and assessing the current research requirements and available tools and resources for that topic. This will help Europeana assess the feasibility of aggregating data in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Population movement, or ‘migration’ is a common occurrence and has been throughout history. Indeed, nations have been founded upon it. The causes of population movement can be mostly economic in peacetime, as we currently see at both a national level, and in the EU, as well as further afield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200182/59C140FCE8C240D68068849C360948D03B3C34FB.html?start=1&amp;query=hungarian+revolution+1956&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Arestricted&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Image from Casgliad Geoff Charles Collection, National Library of Wales\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Other_images/natlibwales-hungarian-relief-image.jpg\" title=\"Woman in Wales preparing for Hungarian relief effort\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<table><tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>Image: \"Clothing collected for Hungarian relief effort\", taken from Casgliad Geoff Charles Collection, National Library of Wales</strong></td>\r\n        </tr></tbody></table>\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, other causes of population movement can be more sinister, due to religious persecution (or indeed the pursuit of religious freedom, as was seen in the movement of Pilgrims to the Americas), enforced banishment through criminal punishment, relocating after a natural disaster, or simply fleeing for one’s life in times of conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This research into the content of Europeana, and potential opportunities for further resources looks at population displacement due to conflict in Europe in the 20th Century. The 20th Century was a century of war as never seen before, with industrial weaponry and ideological conflicts across the world. Within Europe, this led to huge displacement of people, either fleeing as refugees or forced migration. This continued right up to the last decade of the century with the Balkans’ War that divided former Yugoslavia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This topic, while given more time and resources it could potentially cover every European conflict within this period of time, focuses on 3 semi-related conflicts and the effects they had on populations in 3 key locations across Europe - The Greek-Turkish conflict of the 1920s; the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the refugees that fled the country; and the Balkans’ (former Yugoslavia) War of the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research projects within this field could focus on the patterns of migration, the causes of migration, the ease of migration, how the migrants were received in their destinations, did this depend on the sympathies of the destination countries with their plight? The involvement of the surrounding countries and how they may or may not have been able to help? Could UK assistance have helped refugees in the Hungarian Revolution, for example? How have attitudes changed towards migrants from Eastern Europe within the EU since the Cold War ended?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through looking into this topic, it is clear that any content relating to this area of research would benefit scholars in the fields of History, Peace/Conflict studies, Politics, Sociology, and European Studies to name but a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far our research has focussed mainly on the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and has begun looking into potential for studies into the Balkan’s War of the 1990s. Europeana already has a rich source of materials around the Hungarian Revolution, in particular the Radio Free Europe transcripts that include testimonies and stories from refugees that made it across the borders and told their stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wealth of newspapers available through Europeana can also reveal what and how various countries were reporting on the Revolution and how events unfolded. These too can also reveal the attitudes towards the brief Revolution, and offer some manner of justification for actions taken (or not taken).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenges that lie ahead, however, include not only trying to find digital resources and ensuring that their licensing agreements allow for reuse, but in the case of the more recent conflicts, those that are still within living memory, finding material could prove more tricky. Documents, particularly relating to the 1990s conflict in the Balkan states may be still under a 30 year embargo (or however long each government allows for sensitive documents). Similarly, those who lived through the conflicts may be reluctant to talk about them, possibly due to trauma, or even shame at the part they played. The culture of secrecy and reporting inside the Iron Curtain where many of these countries lay could still be felt today, 20+ years after the wall fell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is nonetheless a topic worth pursuing, as historians will be keen to reveal new stories from the latter half of the 20th century. Tools used so far to try to gather data, and create some manner of storyboard to the items in collections have included Pinterest, Story Map Journal and Culture Collage. Each has potential for showing these stories, but each needs to be more powerful to include the kind of information that can be more easily interrogated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work continues……</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are working in similar research and would like to shape how Europeana might develop its content to assist you, please get in touch!

        title: 'An interactive visualisation of the digitised newspapers'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This is a guest blog by Sven Charleer, KU Leuven</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Through <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a> website, Digital Humanities researchers are now given access to 10 million European digitised newspaper pages. While the availability and accessibility of this rich material are a great addition to the researcher corpus, the large amount of data can make it hard to find the specifics a researcher is looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We gathered a group of Digital Humanities researchers in Amsterdam to collect ideas in a 1-day workshop on how we could improve the access to the data and what tools could improve the research workflow. A similar, shorter session was organised during the Europeana Cloud Plenary Meeting in Edinburgh. Ideas that came up inlcuded visualising sentiment analysis, how news moves through time and space, being able to compare queries, moving and continuing search results to personal digital spaces, sharing results with other researchers, dealing with language issues, spelling changes through time, visualising the precision of OCR, entity recognition etc. The list is quite long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our current prototype focuses on creating a faceted search environment through an interactive visualisation focussing on the time and space aspects. Following and \"overview+details on demand\" approach, the visualisation provides both an overview to allow researchers to find patterns in the data and gain insights across time and space, while also giving access to each individual newspaper image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prototype consists of 6 modules:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>a text search widget: supports search on words and sentences in the OCR’d newspaper text;</li>\r\n    <li>a newspaper title widget: in order to restrict searches to specific newspapers;</li>\r\n    <li>a timeline widget: in order to restrict searches to a specific time frame while also visualising the number of newspapers in the search resultper year;</li>\r\n    <li>a map widget: enables a researcher to explore the distribution across Europe while also providing the ability to restrict a search to a specific country (note: due to the metadata lacking country information, language is currently used as a country indicator);</li>\r\n    <li>a search history widget: visualises the history of search terms/facet selections of the user;</li>\r\n    <li>a newspaper edition result widget: shows all results within the selection of the widgets above;</li>\r\n    <li>a newspaper view: shows the actual newspaper scan.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Created using Processing.js for the visualisations, Socket.IO for live communication with a Node.js server, any interaction with a single module updates all other modules, e.g. selecting a country adjusts the timeline to overlay the results of the selected country, selecting a specific time frame shows only the countries and newspapers that are relevant to that time selection. The whole application can run across multiple devices at the same time, enabling set-ups from a single tabletop device to multiple displays on mobile devices. All updates happen cross-device, wherever the devices are located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a setup is very flexible: researchers can not only decide which modules they wish to use, but also how they wish to access them. Large displays can visualise all modules simultaneously, while multiple screens (e.g. multiple computer screens, large TVs, interactive tabletops, tablets and phones) can each provide access to 1 or more modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A researcher can decide to open multiple tabs in a browser to access the data on smaller screens. Researchers can share live searches, creating a co-located or even remotely shared faceted search environment. This also means the visualisation can be deployed in other settings such as a public library, using a public display where visitors can interact with the visualisation using personal devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently in the usability testing phase, where we evaluate both the usability of the modules, but also the viability of the multiple screen setup. Deploying the visualisation on a large interactive tabletop as well as spreading it out on multiple tablets has already shown that faceted search performs equally well from a user point of view on both setups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of these evaluations will let us improve the visualisation even further, after which we shall ask Digital Humanities researchers to join in and provide us with expert feedback. If you wish to be part of this process, do let us know!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/\">University of Glasgow</a> hosted the annual conference of the European Association of Archaeologists (<a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/\">EAAGlasgow2015</a>) on September 2-5 2015, celebrating its 21st annual meeting in Scotland. With topics varying from Virtual Archaeology to Celtic Connections, this conference gathered around 2500 delegates from all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nConference themes were quite broad and inclusive allowing thus various research initiatives to be heard with wide geographical, chronological and methodological span. More particularly, the themes centered around:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/archaeology-mobility/\">Archaeology and Mobility</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/reconfiguring-identities/\">Reconfiguring identities</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/science-archaeology/\">Science and Archaeology</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/communicating-archaeology/\">Communicating Archaeology</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/legacies-visions/\">Legacies and Visions</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/celtic-connections/\">Celtic connections</a><br><a href=\"http://eaaglasgow2015.com/conference-themes/additional-themes/\">Interpreting the archaeological record</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the presentations and the whiskey tasting, archaeologists discussed the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of the field, ranging from Anthropology and Chemistry to Computer Science, the distinction between the representation, digital or not, and the actual archaeological site/artefact and its meaning, altmetrics and electronic publications, new opportunities for communicating archaeology today, methodology and scientific terminology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living in an age of uncertainty, the field seemed to be puzzled about its future development. Will new generations experience archaeology and its remains only through their digital representations? Will that be matter of choice or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/02/isis-destruction-of-palmyra-syria-heart-been-ripped-out-of-the-city\">matter of necessity</a>? Do we have a duty as archaeologists? How can archaeology be more engaging for the public?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the sessions ran parallel so was the discussion held in the conference; capturing all its aspects is hardly possible. From <a href=\"http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/\">innovative technologies enforced in projects</a> to more “traditional” archaeological research, the discussion revolved around a wealth of topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initiative of Europeana Research was among the projects introduced in the context of its potential collaboration with the digital heritage library of <a href=\"http://mubil.no/ark-4/\">ARK4</a>. Aiming to engage the audience and to transform a passive to an active user, ARK4 experiments with archaeological content, among other, to develop digital games and 3D environments as a new way of cultural heritage dissemination. In this context, Europeana Research aspires to serve with its archaeological content to a new target audience of young users and in digital gaming and learning activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, “teaching and discussing heritage within the archaeological education in our present society, with its uncertain political situation is more crucial and important than ever”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Slide from Prof. Anita Synnestvedt (University of Gothenburg) presentation “We all learn from each other-teaching archaeology for the future”, session Communicating Archaeology 24: Sustainable practices in archaeology.</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana Research aims to create stronger connections between humanities research and the digitised content of Europe’s galleries, museums, libraries and archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although much of Europeana’s dataset is already available for reuse via its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">API</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">portal</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/linked-open-data\">linked data set</a>, researchers require access to specific sets of tools and services that provide critical mass of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <strong>Monday, October 12th and Tuesday, October 13th 2015</strong>, Europeana Research invites <strong>key stakeholders (researchers / e-content experts / digital humanists) who have worked on the issues specifically related to use of digital content for research</strong> to discuss the following topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Scoping and understanding the range of available digital content and metadata: what is available, what are the barriers to knowing what's available (discoverability, awareness, but also cultural issues and disciplinary issues that may inhibit the use of open content). A report of work done in this area within the Europeana Cloud project will start the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Using digital content and metadata for research: what are the barriers to use and re-use of content? Are the aggregations of content, and the tools or services that are available adequate for researchers? If not, how can European Infrastructures scope user requirements to discover what is needed? How should such infrastructures interact with cultural heritage institutions? And what should cultural heritage institutions do to make their digitised content more amenable for research use ?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in a landscape of short-term project funding, how is the dialogue about research needs sustained?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Who are the Users: How can we cultivate the communities of practice that use the content, understand their requirements, and capture this in the process of designing content strategies and tools? How can use of digital content contribute to the sustainability of infrastructure services over the long term?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do we need more formal ways to describe and understand use of digital content for research: is there a 'methodological layer' needed for research infrastructures?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Outcomes of the event will be recommendations to the aforementioned questions.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Date: Monday, October 12th and Tuesday, October 13th 2015<br>\r\nTime: Monday, October 12th morning to Tuesday, October 13th lunch time.<br>\r\nVenue: R.C. \"Athena\", Institute for the Management of Information Systems, Artemidos 6 &amp; Epidavrou, GR-151 25 Maroussi, Greece</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Event Chairs:<br>\r\nAgiatis Benardou, Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C.<br>\r\nAlastair Dunning, The Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nLorna Hughes, School of Advanced Study, University of London</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contact and RSVP:</strong> Agiatis Benardou (a.benardou@dcu.gr), Eliza Papaki (e.papaki@dcu.gr)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This workshop is funded via the Europeana Cloud CIP-ICT PSP (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-cloud\">http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-cloud</a>) and the DARIAH-ATTIKI EFRD projects</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Rembrandt vs Leonardo - some brief feedback from Research Data Alliance workshop'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><br>\r\nEuropeana Research spoke at the <a href=\"https://rd-alliance.org/plenary-meetings/sixth-plenary/programme/e-infrastructures-rda-data-intensive-science/data-and\">Research Data Alliance workshop on infrastructures for linguistics</a> this week. A key, if obvious, conclusion was<strong> how useful open data is for research.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on some early position papers from earlier events in <a href=\"https://b2drop.eudat.eu/public.php?service=files&amp;t=ed09431357343226947a557e02d4142d\">Paris</a> and <a href=\"https://b2drop.eudat.eu/public.php?service=files&amp;t=0edc65109eb9a4edfa59b7b4ac2bf73d\">Rome</a>, a key theme of the workshop was openness of data; <strong>Europeana spoke on its work on open data</strong> and how they could help researchers exploit cultural heritage data better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key talking points was how cultural heritage institutions are moving at different paces in terms of openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example of this was metadata records for Rembrandt's painting <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_C_5.html?start=1&amp;query=the+night+watch&amp;startPage=1&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">The Night Watch</a>, with the record for the Leonardo da Vinci's <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/92034/GVNRC_SFA03_SFA022800004.html\">Mona Lisa</a>. Because the two museums and related aggregators have different policies for how open their data is, the quality of record on Europeana is very different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the researchers in the audience, this made a big difference. <strong>The Night Watch was more likely to be found, provided greater scholarly context and trust, and was openly licenced to allow for reuse in teaching and research.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A quick visual glance at the two make is easy to understand the difference, in terms of numbers of fields, quality of description and the licencing of the actual content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bClo9ymGE0n51YmduZv0TvZWJmLbx8yXaKt6plz6JAw/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\">The full presentation is here</a>. Thanks to <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/board/dieter-van-uytvanck\">Dieter van Uytvanck from CLARIN </a> for organising the workshop</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><br>\r\nEarlier in the year, we published some <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/blogpost/experimental-text-dumps-from-europeana-newspapers\">sample full text downloads</a> from the Europeana Newspapers corpus. We received lots of good feedback on the best way to make such data available and, where feasible, we have taken this on board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have now progressed and have published corpora taken from the following library collections. As was stipulated as part of the Europeana Newspapers project, these texts are in the public domain, so can be freely reused.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-austria\">National Library of Austria</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-estonia\">National Library of Estonia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-dr-friedrich-tessman-library\">Dr Frederich Tessman Library</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-france\">National Library of France</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-latvia\">National Library of Latvia</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-poland\">National Library of Poland</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/data/full-text-of-newspapers-from-national-library-of-finland\">National Library of Finland</a></li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>A few things to point out:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- We have grouped all issues of a newspaper in a zip file. Inside each newspaper zip file, there are the export files of its issues, organised by year. There is one file in JSON format per issue, containing issue level metadata and the full-text. One JSON file is also present in the root folder of the zip, with newspaper title level metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- We have considered providing each issues as one large file, but it creates chunky files that we are unable to process. This has also curtailed us from providing access to the ALTO files (which are much larger in size). We will consider this again next year</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- OCR confidence in the (at the word level) is noted as both the issue and title level. This figure was created during the OCRing process as part of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Finally, we have not made the images available yet, as many are currently being migrated from The European Libary servers to Europeana Cloud. We will also talk to source libraries abuot this topic, and hope to do something in 2016.</p>"

        body: "<p>Often in the research community, the mention of Europeana draws mixed responses. \"It's a good idea, but the depth of data is not suitable for research use.\" But <strong>Europeana is not just about its portal</strong> (currently being renamed Europeana Collections, by the way)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was heartening to hear the talk at the Europeana AGM from of the University of Oxford based <a href=\"http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/projects//\">Million Images Database Program</a>, specifically citing how it drew on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The talk, given by Dr. Alexy Karenowska, provoked much discussion at the event, in part because it was relevant to a very contemporary topic - the terrorist destruction of the classical monuments in Palmyra</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, I was struck by Dr. Karenowska's statement that the primary reason for their destruction was not cultural but economic. Palmyra was not being obliterated but blown apart and the remaining pieces being sold on the black market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the context of Europeana what was interesting was how much <strong>the Million Images Program drew on Europeana's values</strong> - those of sharing, openness and mutuality. There was a specific nod to how these values underpinned what the cross-cultural Million Images Program is trying to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is part of a broader theme. <strong>Europeana's impact is not just in the nut-and-bolts of providing an online service that users can search through</strong>, but also in the trying to implement that service according to certain ideals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time and time again, one hears of Europeana’s influence in pressing the open, sharing agenda - in the DPLA in America, but also in cultural institutions in Korea, Australia and Brazil and elsewhere. And <strong>it is in these values, embedded and put into practice in the online services, that Europeana's achieves its greatest impact</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Text Mining #1: Extending the method toolbox: text mining for social science and humanities research'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <strong><a href=\"http://asv.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/en/staff/Gregor_Wiedemann\" target=\"_blank\">Gregor Wiedemann</a></strong>, Natural Language Processing Group, University of Leipzig, </em><a href=\"mailto:gregor.wiedemann@uni-leipzig.de\"><em>gregor.wiedemann@uni-leipzig.de</em></a></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Qualitative and quantitative aspects of text as data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text as data for research in social science and the humanities has been a hot issue in methodological debates for decades. Interest in large quantities of text started with investigations especially of propaganda in press coverage of hostile countries during the first half of the 20th century. Early attempts simply manually counted columns and lines, or directly measured areas of text coverage on single pages related to a certain topic. Later on, in the late 1960s, since computers were able to assist researchers doing word counts in large quantities of text, media scientists started to base their quantifications on more fine grained categories involving the actual text. But at that time, researchers with more qualitative focus already began to separate themselves from the “quants”. They were keen to generate a real understanding on how meaning was constructed via discourse, thus focusing on close reading and analyzing small quantities of text representing distinct and paradigmatic cases. Method debates from both sides successfully sought to draw clear distinctions between the qualitative and the quantitative paradigm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a few years now, this divide on how to approach qualitative data is questioned. Social scientists, for example, engage in mixed method research projects and discourse analysts start to realize that their subject always incorporates a quantitative perspective at least indirectly. On the one hand, this is a consequence from the increased availability of digital sources—born digital during the web era or made available as retro-digitized documents by galleries, archives, libraries and museums. On the other hand, nowadays text analysis technologies from Natural Language Processing (NLP) contribute to reconcile qualitative aspects of semantic meaning with quantitative aspects of their relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Types of computational text analysis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To better understand the development of computational text analysis and what is “new” in the situation nowadays, a typology highlighting specific aspects of analysis technology is helpful. As shown in Figure 1, I distinguish four types [1]:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>computational content analysis (CCA),</li>\r\n    <li>computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (cQDA),</li>\r\n    <li>lexicometrics / corpus linguistics, and</li>\r\n    <li>machine learning.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>I refer to the latter both also as “text mining”, since they enable us to reveal (previously unknown) patterns of meaning in very large corpora automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2015-11/figure1-wiedemann.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2015-11/figure1-wiedemann.png\" style=\"width: 634px; height: 575px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Types of computational text analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These types differ in their applicability to varying quantities of data and in their ability to extract structures of meaning from text. Since word meaning can be perceived as a function on its contexts (or as J. Firth has stated “You shall know a word by the company it keeps”), consideration of context is crucial for distinguishing types of computational text analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1960s <em>CCA</em> has focused on counting of keywords and lists of keywords (also known as dictionaries). While this can be applied easily to large quantities of text, due to the isolated observation of single terms, it lacks context to a large extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emerging current of qualitative research answered to this lack of understanding by developing methods of qualitative data analysis (QDA), supported since the 1980s by gradually evolving software for document management and coding. In <em>computer-assisted QDA</em> Programs such as MAXQDA or Atlas.ti guide researchers through the process of analysis and interpretation of small document sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also during the 1980s, especially in the Francophone research community, the utilization of corpus linguistics, also called <em>lexicometrics</em> became prevalent. Lexicometric analysis such as key term extraction and collocation analysis model context of language use in a global manner, retrieved from statistical observations in large corpora. During the 1990s and 2000s, it slowly spread into social sciences via integration with (Critical) Discourse Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consideration of context in the most recent type, <em>Machine Learning</em> (ML), resides in a crucial intermediate position between the other three types: ML works on the basis of local context by observing co-text in single documents or smaller sequences (e.g. sentences). Through aggregation and joint observation of multiple documents, knowledge conceivable only on the collection-level is learned and incorporated into model instances representing global context. At the same time, learned global knowledge again is applied on individual documents, e.g. by assigning globally learned categories to individual instances. In consequence, the computational representations of meaning of the latter both types allow for qualitative and quantitative insights into text collections which could not be acquired by the isolated observation of single documents alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, there is no single best method of computational text analysis. Methods should meet requirements from the analyst’s perspective and might be operationalized in manifold ways. Greatest benefits can be expected from systematic combinations of several approaches of the aforementioned types [2, 3].</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Different requirements: Linguistic vs. social science collections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text mining using both, lexicometrics and machine learning, enormously can contribute to reveal semantic structures, differences of meaning between (sub-)collections, changes of meaning over time, correlations between text external observations and many interesting things more from large collections which could not be revealed by purely manual approaches. Nonetheless, human interpretation is not replaced by “machine intelligence”. In contrast, the algorithmic approaches are only tools to make patterns visible buried in large data sets and provide measures of their quantitative prevalence. Still, meaning has to be constructed from such “new” kinds of data by the analyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hereby, a distinction between analysis goals for linguistic or social science purposes is useful. Linguists, who have been accustomed to the use corpus linguistic methods for decades already, strive for revealing patterns in language use to infer statements on language as their matter of research. Social scientists, in contrast, apply text mining to identify discourse patterns striving for statements on social reality. For them, language analysis is not an end in itself, but a window to look through to study societal phenomena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both perspectives have severe consequences for requirements on language collections as subjects of analysis. While corpora for linguistics need to be representative for certain language user communities, corpora for social science need to be representative for social communities and their (public) discourse to support valid research. Unfortunately, up to now most digital corpus resources in the field of DH were created having linguistic and philological purposes in mind. Linguists usually are content with sets of well-formed sentences, while social scientists work on document contexts mostly. Also, collections for social science need to be rather complete, instead of just medium-sized samples, to enable researchers to dig into specific events. For instance, a complete collection of volumes of a newspaper consisting of millions of documents quickly reduces to several thousand or even only hundreds of articles when filtered to a specific topic of interest. This implies that corpora need to be accessible to be sliced into smaller pieces, either by metadata (e.g. certain authors) or by thematic selections (e.g. key word searches). For this, data management infrastructures for large collections need to provide access to full archives via well maintained source information allowing for attribution of authorship or publishers and well curated metadata in general [4].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, these conditions are not met by many popular large collections. The <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams\">Google Ngram Corpus</a>, for example, provides valuable resources for linguistic research and certainly contains documents of interest for social science as well. Nonetheless, obscure background information of its composition and lack of control to filter for sub collections makes it pretty useless in social science scenarios. Luckily, the data availability situation for content analysis is improving since more and more collections, e.g. of complete newspaper volumes covering decades of public discourse, become available for research purposes (e.g. the German <a href=\"http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ddr-presse/\">“DDR-Pressekorpus”</a> provides a collection of three GDR newspapers covering more than forty years of news coverage). Equipped with such big data sets of stable quality and levels of representativeness over long periods of time, text mining truly may become a valuable extension of the toolbox of contemporary historians and social scientists. Their methodological debate is likely to accelerate, once they are provided with more collections curated in such way. Moreover, there is a need for interdisciplinary reflection on technical realizations and application of research infrastructures to enable scientists to make use of text mining efficiently… but that’s another story on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Further readings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] A more elaborated description of these types can be found in this article: <em>Wiedemann, Gregor (2013). </em><a href=\"http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1302231\"><em>Opening up to Big Data: Computer-Assisted Analysis of Textual Data in Social Sciences</em></a><em>.

        title: 'Text Mining #2: How scholars can support digital libraries'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <strong><a href=\"http://tedunderwood.com/ted-underwood/\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Underwood</a></strong>, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, <a href=\"mailto:tunder@illinois.edu\">tunder@illinois.edu</a> </em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Libraries, of course, support scholarship. But in the twenty-first century, scholars might occasionally be able to return the favor. As scholars develop experience mining large datasets, there is a growing area of overlap between the things libraries need done (organizing collections, enriching metadata), and the tasks that count as research in other fields. This area of overlap holds opportunities for both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also holds risk. As Michael Pidd has pointed out, the scholarly landscape is already littered with <a href=\"http://talkinghumanities.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2015/11/05/re-using-bad-data-in-the-humanities/\" target=\"_blank\">ad-hoc data sets designed to support a particular inquiry, without much planning for re-use</a>. The implicit warning seems clear: the task of organizing cultural heritage will not be solved by research groups working in isolation. Libraries remain central - as sources of expertise, sites of collaboration, and of course as institutional guarantors of permanence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there may still be a role for scholars to play. Once large digital libraries have been organized, and standards have been established, individual researchers can usefully supplement a collection with provisional metadata schemas that point to standard identifiers, and thus (with any luck) leave a trail of bread crumbs for others to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I've attempted something like this recently in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/htrc\" target=\"_blank\">HathiTrust Research Center</a>. HathiTrust receives metadata about books from its member institutions. Although it has done a great deal to harmonize different sources, it still inevitably shares some of their blind spots: for instance, records for nineteenth-century volumes usually lack information about genre. For literary scholars, this is an important gap. We're interested in genres (like poetry or drama) that may be widely scattered both within and across volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find as many of those texts as I could, I trained predictive models of genre and swept them through 850,000 volumes in English, producing genre metadata that points back to specific pages in HathiTrust. This metadata can be freely shared, and to some extent so can data about the texts themselves. Licensing arrangements often make it hard to share full text, but scholars pursuing research on this scale don't always need sequential full text: <a href=\"https://sharc.hathitrust.org/genre\" target=\"_blank\">a public dataset of word counts associated with pages in a particular genre</a> has already been useful, both <a href=\"http://tedunderwood.com/2015/05/18/how-quickly-do-literary-standards-change/\" target=\"_blank\">in my own research</a>, and in projects by other scholars. Using the same data, Chris Forster <a href=\"http://cforster.com/2015/09/gender-in-hathitrust-dataset/\" target=\"_blank\">has investigated questions about gender</a> and Jonathan Goodwin <a href=\"http://jgoodwin.net/htb/\" target=\"_blank\">has produced topic models of fiction</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project encountered many challenges, and we haven't solved them all. Algorithmic prediction is imperfect, so it's important to communicate levels of error. Digital libraries also change and grow; in some cases, my page-level predictions are now out of date, because new scans of a volume have altered the pagination. (In the next iteration of the project, we hope to address that problem with persistent page-level identifiers.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the sine qua non for the project to happen at all was HathiTrust's willingness to make their collection as open as legally possible. This required some imagination, because digital libraries inherit a model of scholarship organized by \"search.\" The scholarly task is envisioned as recovery of a single document, or of a small collection; a library's task is to make those documents discoverable and serve them up one by one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholars working on a macroscopic scale need a basically different model of access. Portals, platforms, and interfaces are largely beside the point for us. APIs are good, and I'm grateful that HathiTrust has APIs for <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/data_api\" target=\"_blank\">both text</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/bib_api\" target=\"_blank\">metadata</a>. But even an API is ultimately a straw. You can't suck 850,000 volumes through a straw without inconveniencing someone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hesitate to admit it, but what data-mining scholars really want is to have as much of the library as physically and legally possible on their own machine (or a local cluster). I know this sounds strange. It reverses the ordinary relationship between library and patron. But for scholars who do data mining, bulk downloads are essential. (For instance, if I had asked the library to separate out a collection of \"fiction,\" I would have created a lot of extra work for librarians - and would also have overlooked a lot of volumes. The boundary between fiction and nonfiction was something I needed to map myself; and to do it, I needed to start with a collection much larger than \"fiction.\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much data do text miners need? \"As much as possible\" is a flexible metric. But, for instance, if I can have a single <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/hathifiles\" target=\"_blank\">table summarizing the metadata for every volume in a library</a>, that's definitely something I want. If I can have the MARC records, I want those too. If I could have the full text of all volumes in English, I would want that as well -- but alas, copyright law prevents sharing full text beyond 1922 in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HathiTrust Research Center is developing <a href=\"https://wiki.htrc.illinois.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22085965\" target=\"_blank\">a secure virtual machine (the Data Capsule)</a> that will make it possible for scholars to pursue research on texts indirectly, without copying the text itself. The flexibility of a virtual machine will represent, for many research problems beyond the wall of copyright, the only viable solution. But even here it may often be possible to legally export summary representations (word counts, for instance), and whenever that is possible, I think researchers will prefer to download data in bulk and manipulate it on their own machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use cases I'm decribing are admittedly a minority. There are still many more people browsing records one by one, through some kind of search interface. But although we represent a small slice of the user community, I've tried to suggest that data-mining scholars can be a useful slice. Our goals align closely with the core mission of a library: we want to make the collection as a whole more transparent and intelligible for others. To accomplish that, we need some way to download whole collections (for instance, through rsync, which makes updates easy to manage). For this group of users, the details of data formatting are not critical (xml or plain text are both fine). Search interfaces are not very important. What we need is timely and comprehensive bulk access to metadata (and as much data as legally possible).</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In November, 2015, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> Network Project released a groundbreaking study developed by the Project’s Work Package responsible for assessing researchers’ needs for using digital content, tools and methods in the Cloud and ensuring community engagement (WP1). This main deliverable (D1.3) has been released to the European Commission, the funding organisation, in the form of two joint reports: the first on User Requirements and a series of Case Studies, and the second, a Content Strategy Report based on these requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a product of a cross-European, multi-scale, interdisciplinary effort, this document employs a multi-faceted approach to make sense of the information needs and behaviour of Humanities and Social Sciences researchers both within and outside the Europeana ecosystem, while achieving a deep understanding of the ways these communities interact with existing Europeana content and metadata. The ultimate aim of this report was to develop an empirically-based, comprehensive, list of non-prioritized User Requirements as well as a set of flexible Content recommendations. These will form the basis of future development of Europeana Research as part of the next round of Europeana funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this has been the first opportunity for Europeana to look closely at the information behaviours and content interaction of Humanities and Social Sciences communities, we did not want to re-invent the wheel. Rather, we opted for basing our work on some important findings reached in the context of other Digital Humanities Research Infrastructures, including Preparing DARIAH, <a href=\"http://dariah.eu/\">Digital Research Infrastructure in the Humanities (DARIAH-EU)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ehri-project.eu/\">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/\">Advanced Research Infrastructure for Archaeological Dataset Networking in Europe (ARIADNE)</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.nedimah.eu/\">The ESF Research Network for Digital Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH)</a>. Their methodologies, results and, for that matter, slight shortcomings, were our guides throughout the development of this project</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The starting point of this extensive piece of work was a thorough literature review of user information behaviour studies, followed by a web survey carried out at the beginning of the project. The Europeana Cloud Web Survey was built on, and ran in parallel to,related surveys by EHRI and DARIAH-EU, and greatly benefited from both of them. In addition to this quantitative part of the work, three other in-depth methods were employed to make sense of user requirements and content needs for Europeana Research: case studies, a study of researcher behavior in using data at the API level, as well as a close look at specific research themes for aggregating digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, at a time when Digital Research Infrastructures across Europe attempt to support digital research in the Humanities through meeting documented user needs of the so-called research communities we considered that it is inadvisable to view the Humanities and the Social Sciences as two clear disciplines, or, in fact, any particular disciplines within them as self-contained, as almost all empirical studies on user requirements in the context of digital research infrastructures have revealed numerous underlying variations in the methods researchers employ research. The final section of the document was a list of non-prioritized user requirements and content recommendations for the upcoming design and development of Europeana Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe are confident that this report will not only serve as a coherent, trustworthy basis for Europeana Research, but it will form the basis for further understanding and meeting user requirements and making sense of content interaction in the wider field of the Digital Humanities.<br><br>\r\nA <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D1.3%20D1.6%20User%20Requirements%20Analysis%20and%20Case%20Studies%20Report%20Content%20Strategy%20Report.pdf\">link to the full report may be found here</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Text Mining #3: Europeana for Quantitative Literary History'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <strong><a href=\"http://www.christof-schoech.de/en\" target=\"_blank\">Christof Schöch</a></strong>, Departement for Literary Computing, University of Würzburg</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over the last several years, there has been an increasing interest in large-scale, computational, quantitative investigations into European literary history. Scholars working on texts from many different European literary traditions are using tools and services from computational linguistics, adapting methods from computer science and statistics, and developing new tools and methods for their research. They work on attributing texts of unknown or uncertain authorship to their actual authors (in the field called stylometry), they attempt to retrace the fate of particular phrases and ideas across the centuries (in text-reuse studies), they explore the distributions across genres and the evolution over time of thematic trends (using methods such as topic modeling), or they investigate the stylistic and structural commonalities of authors, literary genres or literary periods. What is common to all of these approaches is their reliance on large amounts of freely available textual data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/v2-dist-heatmap-ssbgenre-mode-minusmean-sortedby-std.png\" style=\"width: 931px; height: 640px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: This graph shows the distribution of a selection of topics in a collection of several hundreds of French novels of different types. The heatmap has been generated using topic modeling coupled with metadata about the subgenre each novels falls into. Such techniques allow new insights into the distribution of themes and motives in literary history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This last point can hardly be overstated: Without texts, lots of texts, quantitative literary history just doesn't work and won't get anywhere. And while literary studies as a field has invested generations worth of effort into creating reliable witnesses of the literary tradition and establishing detailed information about authors and texts, most of this valuable information is not available in digital form and can therefore not be used at the scale required for quantitative literary history. From the perspective of such research, libraries with their millions of books seem like the wardens of enticingly large amounts of excruciatingly inaccessible data. Many libraries have understood this a long time ago and have been working towards making their rich holdings more accessible and more useful. But this is not an easy task and there is still a lot of work to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, then, would be the most urgent and most useful from the perspective of quantitative literary history? In fact, it seems there are three key requirements: First, large amounts of relevant, semi-structured, reliable textual data. Second, rich, detailed, relevant metadata. And third, the technical and legal availability of the data and metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the first requirement, relevant, semi-structured, reliable texts: Data needs to be relevant from the perspective of literary history, that is consist of texts generally assumed to belong to the realm of literary texts, in a broad but meaningful sense of the term. Data needs to be available in a semi-structured, open and standardized format. The <em>de facto</em> standard of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) comes to mind because of its ability to make major structural divisions (such as parts, chapters and paragraphs) as well as fundamental local phenomena (such as person or place names or quotations and direct speech) explicit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, texts need to be reliable in the sense of presenting a level of accuracy with regards to the print sources which is sufficient for quantitative methods (what that level is, remains open to debate) and those sources themselves need to be reliable texts. It is a problem that quantitative investigations into literary history frequently use the latest statistical methods but need to rely on texts which have been established a century ago at best, cutting this research off from the state of the art in textual criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the second requirement: Metadata needs to be relevant to literary history, which basically means it is not just the author, title, place and date of publication of a document that are needed. When working with large amounts of text, even characteristics of texts which would be obvious to a human reader need to be made explicit in machine-readable form. For this reason, texts need to be described with regard to fundamental categories such as their form (proportions of prose and verse, for instance), the languages used (often, more than one language is used in literary texts) and their broad genre category (the Dewey classification would be a somewhat useful start, distinguishing poetry, drama, fiction, essays, speeches, letters, humor &amp; satire, and miscellaneous writings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anything more detailed would be a huge challenge for the library world and for literary historians: Without consensus on fundamental categories in literary studies, it will be very difficult to enable librarians to add such metadata to their holdings. But for relatively clear and simple categories, tools could be built that will help detect them automatically from the full texts. In comparison with this challenge, the technical question of the best format and standard for metadata becomes almost secondary: XML (TEI or METS), CSV or JSON will be just fine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third requirement regards the technical and legal availability of the data and metadata: For quantitative literary history, large amounts of data are key and being able to run customized routines for linguistic annotation and statistical analysis is just as important. As a consequence, convenient ways of downloading the data and associated metadata in bulk are essential. The legal requirements are those routinely associated with \"open data\", that is, researchers need to have the right to access, download, store, modify, merge, analyse and republish the data and metadata. The last point, republishing the data, is sometimes neglected but actually crucial, because it allows documenting one's own research more fully and making it transparent as well as reproducible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Europeana generally focuses on aggregating metadata from their many partner institutions, Europeana Research's initiative to gather specific thematic collections of data and provide those as full datasets is very welcome in the context described here. The datasets are large, can easily be downloaded, have permissive licenses, and include metadata. However, there are still very few of these datasets and even fewer of them contain literary texts. The current newspaper archives use unstructured text formats, have problematic levels of OCR quality for anything other than keyword search, and the metadata are doubtless reliable but relatively superficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There appear to be two avenues for increased use of digital library holdings by literary historians: the first avenue would be for librarians and literary historians to team up and build more and even richer collections than the ones already offered through Europeana Research, collections such as \"1001 French Nineteenth-century Plays\" or \"2000 Italian Sonnets\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second avenue would be to build machine learning algorithms which are trained to add some of the metadata relevant to literary historians to Europeana's holdings, so that for any full-text made discoverable through Europeana, researchers can also find out whether, for instance it is a play or a collection of poems, written in prose or in verse. Besides funding of such activities, the key challenge will no doubt be to bring the library and research communities closer together in order to make the most of the hidden digital treasures available through libraries across Europe.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <em><strong><a href=\"http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/balex/\">Beatrice Alex</a></strong>,</em> Research Fellow at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh and a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/\"><em>Edinburgh Language Technology Group</em></a><em>.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I specialise in text mining and over the last eight years obtaining access to data has been crucial for doing the work I do. More recently, I have been part of many digital humanities projects, including <a href=\"http://tradingconsequences.blogs.edina.ac.uk/\">Trading Consequences</a> and <a href=\"http://palimpsest.blogs.edina.ac.uk/\">Palimpsest</a>, where we mined a series of different textual sources from archives and libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of Trading Consequences, a project on mining information on nineteenth century commodity trading in the British Empire, we were able to text-mine, among other collections, summaries from the <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/\">Kew Garden</a>'s Directors' Correspondence archive. In Palimpsest, a project on mining Edinburgh's literary landscape, the largest datasets we obtained access to were a collection of books from <a href=\"https://www.hathitrust.org/\">HathiTrust</a> and the Nineteenth Century Books Collection from the <a href=\"http://labs.bl.uk/\">British Library Labs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting access to such datasets required us to know about them to begin with. In many cases, our project ideas are inspired and enabled by relevant data. Applications for research funding are always much stronger if we can provide evidence for being able to work with a given dataset. If galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) are interested in sharing their available datasets widely for text mining and other research purposes, then they need to be proactive in publicising and explaining how to get hold of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One institution which is already doing this very well is the HathiTrust. Their website contains detailed information on available documents, metadata, how to access subsets of data via their API and gives clear guidance on how to get hold of their entire collection. If the data is not already accessible online then it is also useful to know details of the content of a collection, any other useful metadata, what the format is, how big it is in terms of storage space and a contact person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although GLAM institutions may be interested in making their data available for text mining, they might be worried that the data they carefully curated over many years will be copied and misused for things that they did not anticipate. Assuring them that their data is safe and that we will not release it to the public is very important. Our aim is merely to identify patterns in the data, usually ones related to a particular hypothesis and domain in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both Palimpsest and Trading Consequences, wherever possible, we provided links to the original source documents held by the data providers thereby encouraging access to the original content. Having URLs available for the source is very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we are aware of a dataset and know its holder is happy to share it, then there need to be mechanisms in place to transfer this data. This will apply whether an individual scholar or research group approach a GLAM for data. This can be handled in different ways and often depends on the size of data, the support available in the data holder institution and their technical expertise. With the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/375954/Research.pdf\">copyright exceptions for text mining research</a> put in place in the UK in October 2014, and lobbying to extend these exceptions Europe-wide, more and more data holders with copyrighted material will be approached to get access to their data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If an agreement needs to be signed then it's preferable if a sample agreement already exists, which can be modified if necessary. This will avoid unnecessary delays in sorting out the legalities of sharing and using the data. In my research group, this has been more of an issue in the case where a commercial entity owns the copyright of a digitised dataset and not where a GLAM institution itself is keen to share its data as open data or under a permissive license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, we have received data in many different ways: as downloads, via authorised scraping by email, via APIs, on disk, by <a href=\"http://rsync.samba.org/\">rsync</a> (a Unix program used for file transfer and synchronisation), you name it. For example, we received the Directors' Correspondence archive from Kew Gardens in several Excel files as email attachments. In that case, Helen Hartley, the Project Digitisation Manager at Kew's Herbarium, Library, Art &amp; Archives, provided very helpful support over email to explain the content and format of the data. For larger datasets, email transfer and support might not be an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the HathiTrust data, a couple of hundred thousand world public domain documents, we simply had to run an rsync command which allowed us instant computational access to their data . The advantage of rsync is that it can be rerun when new documents get added to the collection or if the copyright status of existing document changes and thereby keep a collection that changes up-to-date. Some institutions may not have the resources to support automatic syncing of data, however, if their data is in high demand then putting some type of automatic sharing mechanisms in place (e.g. via the cloud or downloads) will be more cost-effective long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of the British Library Nineteenth Century Books data, we received the entire collection, including all the images and the full text, on several hard disks. For text mining purposes, we require access to the full text and not only the digitised images. So if a collection has already been optically character recognised (OCRed) in-house then giving us access to the full electronic text will save us and other teams valuable time having to re-OCR it. This might be an obvious point to make but from conversations with data holders it does not always seem to be apparent and online search interfaces often only present the images to users. Also any available document-level metadata can be very useful. For example, knowing the location that a text is about would help us to run the <a href=\"https://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/geoparser/\">Edinburgh Geoparser</a> with a locality setting and restrict place name disambiguation to the specified area.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"stackitem image info-pop item-1\" title=\"\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/img-1367.jpg\" style=\"width: 565px; height: 424px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: Delivery of the British Library Nineteenth Century Books Collection on hard disk for Palimpsest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of data formats, our text mining tools work with XML, so that format is our preference. However, we have the expertise to convert other formats into XML first. In fact, we usually spend time in the initial phase of any project doing data preparation which includes format conversion. While there are already efforts to use standards in different domains (<a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/\">TEI</a>, <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/marc/\">MARC</a> etc.), each dataset comes with its own individual characteristics and we can rarely re-use existing conversion scripts without having to make even some small adjustments. However, we have a lot of experience in data preparation which GLAM institutions might not necessarily have. So I believe that making the data available is therefore more vital than determining the optimal format it should be in. However, having a consistent, well-formed format definitely helps us to get started more quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in short, my wish list to data providers from the GLAM sector who are interested in sharing their data is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>publicise the data you would like to be used for text mining purposes</li>\r\n    <li>give us information on what a collection or dataset contains (metadata, content, size, format)</li>\r\n    <li>tell us how we can get hold of it</li>\r\n    <li>find a mechanism to share the data easily</li>\r\n    <li>if there are copyright issues, draw up a template agreement (which can be modified if necessary)</li>\r\n    <li>provide the full text if you have it (not just the images), ideally in a consistent and well-formed format</li>\r\n    <li>provide document-level metadata, if possible</li>\r\n    <li>provide a URL for each source document, if possible, so that we can link back to you</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>Merry data sharing.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Developing an interactive visualisation of Europe''s historic newspapers'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This is a guest blog by Sven Charleer, KU Leuven, on his work visualising historic newspapers for researchers.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>(<strong>How should newspapers be visualised? Help us work it out at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/xmAoeg\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/xmAoeg</a></strong>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers\" target=\"_blank\">Historic Newspapers collection</a> of the European Library website gives access to 10 million European digitised newspaper pages. While the availability and accessibility of this rich material are a great addition to the Digital Humanities (DH) researcher corpus, it is quite a challenge exploring such a vast amount of data.<br><br>\r\nTo tackle this, we gathered a group of DH researchers in Amsterdam for a one day workshop to collect ideas on how we could improve access to the data and find out the tools with potential to improve the research workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar, shorter session was organised during the Europeana Cloud Plenary Meeting in Edinburgh. This resulted in the design and development of an interactive visualisation for newspaper exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/tabletop-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 448px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Location, time distribution, newspaper titles and newspaper issues visualised on an interactive tabletop. Image: Sven Charleer</em><br><br>\r\nOur prototype follows the \"overview+details on demand\" approach: the visualisation provides both an overview to allow researchers to find patterns in the data and gain insights across time and space, while also giving access to each individual newspaper.<br><br>\r\nProviding views of multiple facets at once, interactive tabletops create an efficient and effective environment for data exploration and analysis. Large interactive tabletops can already be found in public spaces such as museums, but are rare in the average research lab. It would still be interesting to get the benefits of large interactive surfaces, but the cost might not be easily justified. The answer? Tablets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/tablets.jpg\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 448px;\"><br><em>The tabletop application is split into a modular system spread over multiple tablets. Image: Sven Charleer</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAs tablets become cheap and ubiquitous, it is not hard to imagine a researcher having access to multiple such devices. Certainly, when a group of researchers come together, the chance of each bringing along a device is high. By combining multiple tablets, you can recreate certain affordances of an interactive tabletop.<br><br>\r\nOur research has shown that, for simple faceted search and exploration tasks, multiple tablets can be a substitute when large interactive displays are not available. The modular nature of multiple tablets has its advantages too: users can decide which modules are required for the task at hand (or can choose which modules to activate depending on the devices available), while picking up a module/tablet from the table and moving it to your workplace would be more natural than sending the data back and forward to e.g. your desktop computer.<br><br><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SO1cc6zXquU\" width=\"560\"></iframe><br><br>\r\nCurrently 7 modules are available in our multi-device prototype: text search, timeline, language (previously location), search history, newspaper titles, newspaper issues and newspaper view. While more modules can be added (creating even more need for larger displays or more devices), the next goal is to figure out if the exploration tool will benefit researchers, fit their workflow and prove more useful than the standard Google-like approach of searching the database.<br><br>\r\nHowever, inviting DH experts from all around Europe to our lab is not straightforward. We therefore decided to create a a web browser version, suitable for the average desktop user, so as to continue our evaluation. As an added bonus, we also added a complete new recommender system to assist the researcher in finding new, interesting newspapers related to their search results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/finalprototype.png\" style=\"width: 455px; height: 238px;\"><br><em>The final desktop prototype: text search, language, timeline, newspapers and issues in a single web browser window. On the right, recommendations based on the selected result. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nOur next step is to get the experts' opinion. It is now important to get this tool in the hands of real users, e.g. DH researchers interested in the Historic Newspapers collection, or even enthusiasts who regularly visit newspaper archives. And that's where you, the reader, come in. If you are interested in participating, we would love to hear from you. You will need access to a computer with the Chrome browser, Skype (not 100% necessary but preferred) and 30-45 minutes of free time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that sounds good, contact me at (sven.charleer [at] kuleuven.be)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/tabletop-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 648px; height: 648px;\"><br><em>A satisfied user.

        title: 'Digital Musicology #1: Medieval sources brought back to life'
        posttype: News

        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/staff/EAFankhauser/0\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Eliane Fankhauser</strong></a>, Utrecht University, <a href=\"mailto:E.A.Fankhauser@uu.nl\" id=\"MainContent_controlHeader_hlEmail\">E.A.Fankhauser@uu.nl</a></em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>From the very beginning of my research project about polyphonic music in the northern Low Countries in the late Middle Ages, it has been clear that my main objects of research would consist of a few loose parchment leaves some of which were in a very bad state. As these parchment leaves are the only witnesses of polyphonic music in the northern Low Countries around 1400, I considered the improvement of their legibility crucial for the progress of my research project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doubtlessly, I was not the only one who attributed particular importance to enhancing the legibility of the said fragments. Traces of restoration from the beginning of the 20th century can be found on some of the fragment leaves. Restorers at the time aimed to bring to the fore vanished script by applying a chemical solution to the relevant passages. As a result, dark brown stripes appear on the fragments today, the script underneath having vanished nevertheless. From today’s perspective, the physical restoration of the fragments was not an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of my project in the autumn of 2013 I had already heard about digital methods to restore images of fragments or manuscript pages. Because these methods are digital no damage can be done to the sources whilst the possibilities to enhance legibility are almost unlimited. Thanks to Julia Craig-McFeely and Alan Lock, who published a comprehensive <a href=\"http://http://www.diamm.ac.uk/publications/digital-restoration-workbook/\" target=\"_blank\">workbook on digital restoration</a> in 2006, I was in the lucky position to have at hand a manual with the help of which I carried out my first digital restorations on ‘my’ fragments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this blog, I would like to highlight one particular technique I applied in the course of the restoration of some of the fragment images: to re-combine two complementary images of one and the same fragment. The fragments were used as binding material in printed books from the early sixteenth century and were glued to the front and the back of book covers. Upon their removal some of the ink remained on the wooden book covers. Today, the content is thus divided between the fragments themselves and the wooden book cover. Luckily, the imprints on the book covers are in an exceptionally good state but obviously they cause major gaps on the original fragment leaves. It thus goes without saying that bringing together the original content and its imprint yield a more complete content. On top of that, digital restoration techniques are most suitable for doing exactly this. No sooner said than done!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-resolution images of both the fragment leaf (‘image 1’ hereafter) and its imprint (‘image 2’ hereafter) on the book cover formed the basis of this kind of restoration. In a first step both images were restored. That is, the script and music notation on both images were selected and their colors intensified. The background was made paler in order to increase contrast. Image 2, moreover, needed to be flipped horizontally because the imprint of the script appeared mirrored. Then, I superimposed image 2 on image 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2015-12/original-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/original-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 246px; height: 400px; border: 5px solid black;\"></a><a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2015-12/imprint-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/imprint-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 307px; height: 403px; border: 5px solid black;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Left: Original fragment page (image 1) Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, NL-Uu 37.I, fol. IIIAv; Right: imprint (flipped) on the wooden cover of the host book (image 2) Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, NL-Uu 37.I-folio_IIIAv</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first result was disappointing: it appeared that the fragment itself had shrunk over time whereas the imprint did not. This made impossible the precise alignment of the two images, which is essential in fitting the content. After some unsuccessful trials changing the angle of image 2, it was clear that cutting image 2 in small bits and aligning them one after the other was the only possibility to make both images match. Indeed, even though this technique was very time consuming, it yielded a satisfying result: For the first time hitherto illegible script and music were made visible again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2015-12/combined-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.png\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/combined-utrecht-universiteitsbibliotheek-nl-uu-37.i-folio-iiiav.png\" style=\"width: 227px; height: 331px; border: 5px solid black;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An image of the combination of both (thus the final result of the restoration), Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, NL-Uu 37.I, fol. IIIAv</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two components were of great importance for the success of this particularly challenging kind of digital restoration. On the one hand, there is the availability of high-resolution images. The higher the quality of the image, the more precise and accurate the restoration will be, as many of the tools used are based on color selection. The color, in turn, can be detected most efficiently by zooming in and selecting pixels of distinct colors. On the other hand, the communication with the institution housing the sources and its willingness to cooperate is central, especially in more complicated cases such as the one introduced here. Without the cooperation of the Special Collections of the Utrecht university library, which made available several more images of the imprints, the overall result of the restoration, doubtlessly, would have been of lower quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This brings me to an aspect of digital restoration, which I would like to mention as a final point here. Restoration as used in research on early music primarily serves the purpose to make legible content invisible to the naked eye. Digital restoration <em>can</em> be used as an instrument for the embellishing of the overall impression of a source (the discussion of ethically correct digital restoration I deliberately do not address here). It is, however, more often used purely to make visible content in the case of which the restored image is not meant to be presented to a broader audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital restoration is of great help for research on early music, as it makes possible the re-discovery of music and text. The Middle Ages got their epithet as “the dark ages” primarily because so little documentation is available today. If we are able to get out more of the sparse sources we happen to have, it can only be in favor of this distant and yet so fascinating period of time.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital Musicology #2: Modelling Musical Style'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>Guest Blog Post by <strong><a href=\"http://www.lodebar.nl/pvk/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter van Kranenburg</a></strong>, <a href=\"http://www.meertens.knaw.nl\">Meertens Institute</a>, Amsterdam</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Digitisation of sources is beneficial for Musicology for several reasons. First of all, it increases the accessibility of historical sources in an unprecedented way. Where before one needed to travel to a library, church, monastery, or private person to examine a certain manuscript, nowadays this can more and more be done online from a distance. Next to this, there is another reason, on which I want to focus in this blog, namely the digital availability of huge amounts of sources enables large scale modelling of aspects of music. Currently, there are some impediments to pursue this goal, which I want to point out in this blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to start with the definition of musical style that musicologist Leonard B. Meyer provides at the very beginning of his book <em>Style and Music</em>: “Style is a replication of patterning, whether in human behavior or in the artifacts produced by human behavior, that results from a series of choices made within some set of constraints.” In the following of his book, Meyer discusses various aspects of this definitions and applies it to nineteenth-century Romantic music, demonstrating that the egalitarian ideology of the Romantic period is reflected in ‘patterns’ that occur in composed music of that age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key concepts of Meyer’s definition are <em>pattern</em>, <em>replication</em>, <em>choices</em> and <em>constraints</em>. The act of composing involves a human who choses which notes to write. Meyer discerns three levels at which these choices are constrained: <em>Laws</em> (1), which are universal - one cannot, for example, ask a piccolo to play a contra G; <em>Rules</em> (2), which are intra-cultural - it is in the rules that music from the Renaissance differs from music from the Baroque; and <em>Strategies</em> (3), which are constraints to which the composer subjects himself (consciously or unconsciously) within the rules of a certain culturally established style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason that I present this definition is that it allows for a quantitative approach. According to Meyer, style is a replication of patterning. If we would be able to define such a pattern in an explicit and precise way, we could implement pattern-detectors that automatically would find all occurrences of a pattern in a large body of music. This involves a challenging modelling question: how to explicitly define a pattern such that all its occurrences (which inevitably show certain variation) are covered by the definition, while the definition does not cover musical fragments that are not instances of the pattern at hand? This kind of modelling has not fully been developed in musicology, yet. Therefore, I would encourage to collaboratively work on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose we do have high quality models and detectors for musical patterns, we next need access to the ‘large body’ of digitised music. Of importance is the level at which music sources are made available. Often, it are the scanned images of the pages that are provided. There is however no way to access the musical contents of those pages other than by visual inspection by the human investigator on a computer monitor. A major step forward would be to systematically provide the musical and textual contents of those pages in a standardised and structured way, as well. One example of a project that partially addresses this aim is the C.M.M.E. project.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project offers digital editions of early music, which makes the scores accessible at note-level including variants as found in different sources. Another example is The Josquin Research Project at Stanford University.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having compositions digitally available, a gigantic network of composers and compositions could then be made showing various kinds of interrelations. It would then be possible to trace the development of musical style with a much higher precision than has been done before. For example, the transition of modal to tonal thinking in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries could be reconstructed in a very detailed way. One could even think of constructing several parallel ‘histories’ of musical style by focussing on different aspects of music. This would challenge the current periodisation of music history, but it might also enrich it with an unprecedented level of detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a music researcher’s perspective, the availability and accessibility of the data are - although laborious and expensive - the more straightforward part of this endeavour. I’m not the first one conveying this vision. Steps have already been set on this path, and maybe some already have given up because there certainly are serious hurdles to be taken: standardisation is a challenge, maybe impossible, political and institutional cooperation is not always evident, funding might be problematic, optical music recognition is not ‘solved’ yet, etc. But, if we set out to devise methods to model computationally the historical development of musical style, we enter the real unchartered land. Explicit models of what musical style is and how musical style develops, are still too limited to have explanatory power for a large body of music. This, I would say, is a major challenge for historical musicology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To conclude, I would like to add a further step to this yet-to-realise future vision. If we also would have contextual data digitally available in a standardised and structured way, we could involve ‘extra-musical’ information in the modelling to explain aspects of development of musical style. For example, the full historical network of composers and musicians and their relations would add much. But also the inclusion of historical political, economic, and ideological contexts would enable richer models of the development of musical style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital accessibility of the <em>contents</em> of historical sources at such a large scale and at such level of detail involves collaborations between libraries, cultural heritage institutes, museums, and universities. It for sure fits the objectives of Europeana very well. I therefore suggest this vision as one point at the horizon to head towards.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<hr width=\"33%\">\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> <a href=\"http://www.cmme.org\">http://www.cmme.org</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\r\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> <a href=\"http://josquin.stanford.edu\">http://josquin.stanford.edu</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>Návrh titulní strany L´Assiette au Beure.No 100/Mars. Preissig, Vojtěch - Source: <a href=\"http://www.upm.cz/\">Uměleckoprůmyslové museum, Praha</a>, CCO</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the work conducted in Work Package 1 of the project Europeana Cloud, we have realized that focusing on sub disciplines within the Humanities and Social Sciences can be significantly more efficient for understanding and documenting user needs and practices in specifically set contexts. This has led in identifying different research topics to be explored in terms of the current research requirements, available tools and resources in that area. Children’s Literature, as introduced last June <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/children-s-literature-migration-the-mediterranean-and-more\">here</a>, was among the topics set for further exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research conducted in the following months, background as well as empirical, followed a set of questions imposed in order to identify the current status of Children’s Literature in and outside Europeana and its further potential as a future Europeana Research channel. However, a particularity faced was the difficulty in defining a geographical or chronological span – as evident by the practice followed in other thematically-relative projects. Therefore, research aimed in documenting in general the digital presence of the field content and community-wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather underrepresented currently in Europeana, resources related to Children’s Literature are increasingly been digitized and accessed online in international digital libraries. With thousands of records of mainly textual material, a significant bulk of this literature is currently available on the Web. Discussing with researchers of the field on the possibilities provided for academic research on this topic, it was underlined that there is a lack of digital references, databases and access to digital research journals on Children’s Literature to support such research online, especially in a multilingual level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community-wise, the number of networks of academics, researchers and amateurs surrounding the topic of Children’s Literature that was recorded was impressive! This vivid community, documented both in European and international level, aims, among other, in strengthening collaboration, supporting research in the field worldwide and enforcing its digital presence. This exploration led us to consider Children’s Literature as a field of growing dynamic, particularly in a digital context. What role could then Europeana Research have in this area to further support the community?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link to the Europeana Cloud report on “Research Themes for Aggregating Digital Content: Children’s Literature” can be accessed <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/WP1%20Research%20Needs/Childrens-Literature-Europeana.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<!--StartFragment--><!--EndFragment-->\n</ul>"

        title: 'Digital Musicology #3: Building networks of music sources'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Building networks of 16th Century music sources – what about the data? -- Marnix van Berchum, University of Utrecht</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The notion of ‘distant reading’ – introduced by Franco Moretti – gained wide popularity in the emerging field of Digital Humanities. It is interesting to see whether the ideas of Moretti can also be applied to the field of musicology. Stephen Rose and Sandra Tuppen mention Moretti as inspiration for the British library project ‘<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2660168.2660177\">A Big Data History of Music</a>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what other methods, beside those presented by Moretti, Rose and Tuppen, and others could prove to be of use for historical musicology? In an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-musicology-2-modelling-musical-style\">earlier blog post</a> in this series on Digital Musicology, Peter van Kranenburg presents the opportunities of modelling musical style from large corpora of digitised compositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My research explores how network theory, and its concepts and methodologies, could be useful in studying the transmission of music in the sixteenth century. The entities of the networks I am currently investigating are the sources and the compositions they contain (see figure 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connected attributes of both entities are valuable as well – e.g. the dates and locations of origin of the sources, the physical characteristics of the sources or the composers associated with the composition in case. It is the type of data which Kranenburg calls ‘contextual data’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"605\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HcpMgNP1zYqp-idkga6jRJNibOn1fvxvuUloDS3lP9RHkJMzmZXAXyAcRIGrWKj1zUkoQHpeEXOTrtYd2xDl3G3idT35ZF01wwuDJIshH9TnwLfUQAo-Y2KMOGL36cwpC1bbFuIVVD6WuI6PfA\" width=\"605\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Figure 1) A bipartite graph of eleven manuscripts (blue nodes), produced by the scriptorium of Petrus Alamire and currently held at the Thüringer Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek in Jena, Germany and the compositions within these sources (red nodes).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data I use are the metadata on music manuscripts and music prints from the sixteenth century, the primary sources of music. Most of these musical sources are described in the secondary literature produced by more than a century of musicology; many of them are digitised and available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The secondary literature though – which very often lists the content of (a particular) source(s) – is mainly available in printed volumes, stacked in the music and university libraries of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small percentage of this information is available in a digital format, like an online database. These databases originate primarily from musicological projects, and are due to the nature of projects very often limited in scope. A preliminary exploration of the (meta)data on sixteenth century music sources – or broader: Early Music sources – available online, shows that many differences exist. A first inventory can be found in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U3vxAGVQ32wtoHT7b0THBjirDzbhETASrTpM9TpHh-4/edit?usp=sharing\">this sheet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Scope</strong><br>\r\nThe scope of the information presented hugely differs between the databases. Every database/project has its own focus on a specific historical period (e.g. one century only or the whole ‘renaissance’ period), geography (e.g. Europe, the German speaking areas or the Low countries) and genre (e.g. only motets or chansons, or no specific genre). Furthermore, the amount of sources included ranges from a handful to several thousands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Entities / attributes</strong><br>\r\nWithin the defined scope each database has made different choices in what information to include. The <a href=\"http://www.vdm16.sbg.ac.at/\">vdm16 database</a> for example has an elaborate section on the physical characteristics of the sources (including e.g. collation information), but does not provide a table of contents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cmme.org/\">CMME project</a> on the other hand provides nearly no information on the visual appearance of the source, but presents the compositions of each, in the order as they appear in the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Standardisation</strong><br>\r\nThe different databases use different ways of standardising information. A very relevant one is the abbreviation used for the manuscript sources: the <a href=\"https://opac.rism.info\">RISM project</a> provides an authoritive list (which e.g. is used in the <a href=\"http://www.diamm.ac.uk/\">DIAMM database</a>), but for the period 1400-1550 the abbreviations of the paper reference work Census-catalogue of manuscript sources of polyphonic music, 1400-1550 are also very common in musicological literature (and used in e.g. the <a href=\"http://www.cmme.org/\">CMME project</a>). A similar issue occurs with composer names: the composer Orlande de Lassus can be found as ‘Orlande de Lassus’, and ‘Orlandus Lassus’ as well. Even within one database different spellings are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Structure</strong><br>\r\nOf the databases investigated, it is not always clear what the underlying data structure is (see also Transparency below). One would presume there is a (relational) database management system underlying the web interface, but this is not explicitly visible in most databases. In the database of <a href=\"http://ricercar.cesr.univ-tours.fr/3-programmes/basechanson/index.htm\">Base Chanson</a> for example, from <a href=\"http://ricercar.cesr.univ-tours.fr/3-programmes/basechanson/03231-3.asp?numfiche=127\">one record</a> it is not possible to ‘click through’ to another piece of metadata and see more records; the records are (or at least appear) to be static and not linked to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transparency</strong><br>\r\nThe possibilities of re-use of the information offered – not only ‘as is’ from the website, but also as ‘raw data’ – could be greatly improved if more is known about the characteristics discussed above. There is a lack in transparency on the information offered by the websites though, with positive exceptions like the <a href=\"http://legacy.arts.ufl.edu/motet/default.asp\">Motet Database Catalogue Online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project states explicitly composer names are standardised to conform to the authoritative New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians; as I know from my involvement with the <a href=\"http://www.cmme.org/\">CMME project</a>, this database does the same, although it does not state it anywhere on the website. Another aspect of transparency would be information on the last update of the online material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, there is no single, standardised dataset on music from the sixteenth century available, which I can readily use for my research. An increase in standardisation, structuring and transparency of the data currently available in the (small) project databases online, would make the interlinking of these data a feasible and foreseeable task. Similarly to the situation of data of the music itself (mentioned by Kranenburg), there is still work to be done. Or, to cite <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fdigh.2015.00004/full\">Laurent Pugin</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>[…] obtaining or accessing high quality datasets remains a serious hurdle, especially on a large scale, in a similar way to accessing sources a couple of decades ago. It is a major barrier that needs to be removed if digital musicology research is to be taken to the next level.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n"

        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first Book Hackathon in Greece was held on the 22nd, 23rd and 24th of January at the <a href=\"http://www.sgt.gr/eng/SPG1/?\">Onassis Cultural Centre</a>. Ten teams, constituted by artists, designers, publishers, writers, poets, developers, innovative businessmen and hackers, were called to imagine the book of the future, in collaboration with the Europeana Space network and support of the non-profit organization <a href=\"https://gfoss.ellak.gr/\">Greek Free / Open Source Software Society (GFOSS)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the predictions for its future, in a period of intangible networks of production and services, the traditional book remains a constant value for readers. What happens though when we add to the characteristics of a physical object new attributes provided by the digital connectivity? What if we move from the physical book to an object with enhanced capabilities? By applying smart technologies (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Internet of Things [IoT]) during “HackTheBook”, the teams had to face the challenge of redefining the substance of the book within 48 hours and to suggest alternative models in the production value chain of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/hackathon2.jpg\" style=\"width: 460px; height: 303px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teams that participated were: Digital Heritage Geeks, Arcbook, Experience Designers, Cook Lee, Vivl.io, MnemoTrace, Box The Book, Sink A Future, Calculus, Muzine. Each team had eight minutes to present the results of the work produced during the 48 hours they spent at the Onassis Cultural Centre. The participants could open, digital heritage content from <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu/\">Europeana Space</a>, to experiment on it, and, in the end, to design a hybrid book. Apart from the technical challenges, the participants examined the legal restrictions that may have arisen, but also the financial sustainability of their proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the open invitation, 24 participants with experience in design, graphics, content curation, book art, creative programming and business modeling were called to work in teams on a business sustainable hybrid book. Next to these teams, prominent designers and theorists of open access and creative programming were offering their guidance. On Sunday, January 24th, the teams presented their suggestions in front of a judging committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The judging committee was constituted by Antonella Freza, a specialist in information and communication technologies and General Director of the Italian Promoter Srl, Saimon Kronsoou, Co-director and Co-founder of the Sessions REMIX, Gary Hall, Research Professor of Media and Performing Arts and Director of the Centre of Disruptive Media at the University of Coventry, Thanasis Deligiannis, political scientist, Coordinator of the Open Technology Group and member of GFOSS, Prodromos Tsiavos, legal adviser for the National Documentation Center/ National Hellenic Research Foundation and senior research fellow at the Media Institute at the University College London (UCL/BBC), Joanna Zylinska, Professor of New Media and Communication at the University of Goldsmiths in London and Theodoros Chiotis, Project Manager of the Cavafy Archive (Onassis Foundation), poet and literary theorist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/hackathon4.jpg\" style=\"width: 659px; height: 438px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/hackathon5.jpg\" style=\"width: 509px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teams presented their work with enthusiasm, answering to the questions of the judging committee and trying to prove the sustainability of their idea based on solid arguments. The three winning teams were: Sink A Future, Vivl.io, and Cook Lee. One representative from each team will travel to London to participate to the business workshops of <a href=\"http://www.remixsummits.com/\">REMIX</a>, for an intensive Business Model Workshop which will be held by a specialist team of REMIX, a leading body of culture technology entrepreneurship. Among the three teams, the one with the strongest business plan will go through an intensive three-month process of incubation from REMIX and Europeana Space Network, with the aim to successfully capitalize the proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representatives of the three winning teams shared their Hackathon experience, talked about the projects they presented and their aspirations for London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sink A Future – Anna – Maria Vlasopoulou</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The team was built on shipwrecks and on the memory of their drowned uninsured staff. This was our first work and the opportunity from which the name of this team derived. Then came our participation to “HackTheBook”. We don’t have clear characteristics, rather each one of us has clear aesthetic and meaningful references. What we presented was a comment on the present form of internet as means of mass surveillance, the global geopolitical fluidity suggesting a new way of exchanging data. Our experience was good, we met very remarkable persons at the Cultural Centre. While being a bit hesitant at first, we came in contact with people with similar ideological and conceptual background and we interacted with most of the teams, something which we consider a gain for both sides. As for London, our distinction surprised us a lot as our project is more about criticizing particular financial/business systems and political events rather than suggesting sustainable solutions and product development prospects. Our plans are usually shaped by testing, we don’t have a particular aim for the future”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team Sink A Future is constituted by: Spiros Kokkonis, Anna-Maria Vlasopoulou and George Roussos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vivl.io – George Papanagiotou </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<a href=\"http://thinking.gr/\">Thinking</a> is a company which since 2010 deals exclusively with the technology of printed and digital book as well as with the creation of digital applications (websites, apps, microsites) for reading, marketing and dissemination of their content. Our participation in “HackTheBook” was thus obvious, as it was the first time that such a relative to our interests event took place in our country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience from hackathon was enjoyable. The initiative of the Onassis Cultural Centre and of Europeana Space was excellent and very useful for people and teams that wished to showcase their work, as the field of the book in our country has only slightly moved forward in comparison to the relevant technological innovations globally. The organisation was good and the place of the event was nice and functional. All the teams had very innovative suggestions and their competitive character gave us an additional motivation to reach a good result within 48 hours and with very particular requirements. The challenge to combine the specific analogue and digital technologies (printed, Arduino, eBook, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing) preserving at the same time the character and the experience of reading intact, was quite interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/hackathon6.jpg\" style=\"width: 666px; height: 454px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work we presented was a development of the project <a href=\"http://vivl.io/\">vivl.io</a> with which we have been occupied during this last year. The idea concerns the creation of an edition of classical texts of the world literary heritage which is provided in two basic versions: printed and digital, as well as a series of accompanying applications which are based in open software and hardware and they support the reading and storytelling experience. The book we chose for “HackTheBook” is the “A Child’s History of England” by Charles Dickens. The digital edition is not only provided in ePUB (the basic format of a digital book) but also through the browser - book-in-browser as this particular technology is called, which allows reading a book in any browser, as for example Chrome. Moreover, and here lies the main innovation of our proposal, we encode using open standards selected excerpts from the book which concern information such as locations, people, objects, dates, etc, information which we highlight afterwards, providing the reader with the context through applications that accompany, without disturbing, their digital reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most interesting challenge of hackathon was when we were called to combine reading with interactive tools such as Arduino. We chose to create a map with locations mentioned in the book functioning as the old traditional recipe of the omniscient. When reading for a location, the reader has the possibility, through WiFi, to see the selected location in a physical map. We believe that this is a simple example of how someone can build hybrid activities in a classroom, as the potentials are huge - imagine timelines, maps, interactive games, all based in the narrative of the book. By activating the interest of young children in technology, you may equally motivate them in classical literature. For this reason, we included in our product a very cheap and simple computer, Raspberry Pi Zero, which has already installed the digital text, instructions (for children, parents and teachers) on how children can experiment with Arduino, instructions and advices on how they can print as 3D objects some of the objects mentioned in the book as well as the free edition of the Minercraft game, in which they can introduce 3D models that are based on the story of the book and to create their own experiences around it, by playing. As a team, we don’t have any doubt that the biggest creative force is children’s imagination, that is why we try to offer them tools and knowledge to develop it, avoiding to control the experience with predefined paths - we leave the child to create its own having as incentives the book and the story it narrates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are getting ready for London! We are lucky because following our participation at the London Book Fair in May 2015, where we presented our work, we are already collaborating with an important british publishing company, Faber &amp; Faber, for which we are preparing a specialized website. Thus, during the last semester, we had the opportunity to meet the professional environment of the country, the standards and requirements of a collaboration there and we are excited as this opportunity will continue our efforts in London in a different context. Our plans for the future have to do with intensifying our work in innovative fields and with our wish for maintaining the good atmosphere and passion that characterizes our team and work.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people behind Vivl.io are: Michalis Kalamaras, Ivan Kanakarakis, Aris Karatarakis, Lena Metheniti, George Papanagiotou, Panos Papanagiotou, Anna-Maria Sichani, Andreas Triantafillidis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cook Lee – Nikoleta Mpaliothiari </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Reading the programme of the Onassis Cultural Centre, I came across the invitation for “HackTheBook” - that was the beginning. Alongside the rest of the team, after tons of tea and discussions we ended up with this idea. The roles of each one of us were defined from the start. Nikoleta Mpaliothiari - graphic and web designer took up the design, Angeliki Zervou - architect and cultural manager, functioned as content curator and project manager and Panagiotis Sempos - hardware and software developer, took up the technical part. The Nap team was then created for this purpose. The idea we materialized was Cook Lee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackathon was exciting and challenging. The GTD - Getting Things Done - which this demands got us excited. It required from us to find solutions and give our best self each single minute. At the same time, we consulted the mentors for problems that emerged and we had to report our progress to the judges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/hackathon7.jpg\" style=\"width: 509px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cook Lee is an interactive cook set, constituted by an interactive apron, with wearable and washable technology, an art cook book - with references to cooking and art - and a box - with scale, speaker and slot for mobile integrated - in which an app runs. Cook Lee aims in enriching the cooking experience, transmitting knowledge from the contemporary art, the artists and their work through their relation with recipes. We are ready for London, but we at the same time are improving the project and editing possible bugs. We are really happy because we believe in Cook Lee and its potentials and this is only the beginning, we want to move on and reach its implementation. In the question “How big can it get” that we are asking ourselves, we reply that in the future we would like to implement “THE Cook Lee”. The must cooking gadget which will introduce to us artists through the pleasant procedure of cooking! People! Fasten your apron!”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFirst published in Popaganda.gr on 31.01.2016: <a href=\"http://popaganda.gr/hackathon-stegi/\">http://popaganda.gr/hackathon-stegi/</a><br>\r\nOriginal Greek text: Philippa Dimitriadi / Translated into English by Eliza Papaki<br>\r\nPhotographs by Katerina Samartzi / FOSPHOTOS</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Experts talk on tools, services and content priorities in Archaeology and the Classics'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In July 2015, Europeana Research organized a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-workshop-on-tools-services-and-content-priorities-in-archaeology-and-the-classics\">workshop on Tools, Services and Content Priorities in Archaeology and the Classics</a> which was hosted by the <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/\">UCL Centre for Digital Humanities</a> in London.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Archaeologists and scholars working on the Antiquity were invited to discuss and assess existing tools and content in the area, to review related Europeana content, to give insights about user requirements, to give advice on feasibility of Europeana working in that area with a focus on issues concerning the creation and use of related datasets and to specify additional content to be aggregated by Europeana. Two main sessions were held, the first being about excavation data and related content and the second about tools and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first session of the workshop focused on data and related content in Archaeology and the Classics. The experts discussed issues associated with the different kinds of data, the ways those are made available and are being used, the data and metadata sharing and the use of data repositories and databases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second session of the workshop was focused on the availability of digital tools and services for research in Archaeology and the Classics, as well as their usability and accessibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experts agreed that although there is not an obvious role for Europeana in helping the research community in Archaeology and the Classics with research questions, various opportunities exist when it comes to teaching, to offering paths for placing the data, and to metadata enrichment. The experts suggested that Europeana should improve access to more demanded content, should focus on connecting or contextualizing existing data from across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also advised that Europeana should provide motivation for sharing metadata, and focus on users’ feedback on metadata as well as on different user groups, attempting to match them to particular sets of services. As for understanding user communities, it was suggested that researchers could more likely be interested in genres within disciplines (e.g. space in archaeology, time in geography) and, importantly, methodological areas that go beyond disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, ontologies were proposed as a means to bring Europeana closer to the research community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full report on all Research Community Evaluation Reports can be found here: <a href=\"http://The%20experts%20agreed%20that%20although%20there%20is%20not%20an%20obvious%20role%20for%20Europeana%20in%20helping%20the%20research%20community%20in%20Archaeology%20and%20the%20Classics%20with%20research%20questions,%20various%20opportunities%20exist%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20teaching,%20to%20offering%20paths%20for%20placing%20the%20data,%20and%20to%20metadata%20enrichment.%20The%20experts%20suggested%20that%20Europeana%20should%20improve%20access%20to%20more%20demanded%20content,%20should%20focus%20on%20connecting%20or%20contextualizing%20existing%20data%20from%20across%20Europe.%20They%20also%20advised%20that%20Europeana%20should%20provide%20motivation%20for%20sharing%20metadata,%20and%20focus%20on%20users%E2%80%99%20feedback%20on%20metadata%20as%20well%20as%20on%20different%20user%20groups,%20attempting%20to%20match%20them%20to%20particular%20sets%20of%20services.%20As%20for%20understanding%20user%20communities,%20it%20was%20suggested%20that%20researchers%20could%20more%20likely%20be%20interested%20in%20genres%20within%20disciplines%20(e.g.%20space%20in%20archaeology,%20time%20in%20geography)%20and,%20importantly,%20methodological%20areas%20that%20go%20beyond%20disciplines.%20Finally,%20ontologies%20were%20proposed%20as%20a%20means%20to%20bring%20Europeana%20closer%20to%20the%20research%20community.%20%20The%20full%20report%20on%20all%20Research%20Community%20Evaluation%20Reports%20can%20be%20found%20here:%20http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D1.7%20Research%20Community%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf\">https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D1.7%20Research%20Community%20Evaluation%20Report.pdf</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get a glance from the Workshop <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134065131@N08/albums/72157656400151436\">here</a>!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The State of Parliamentary Papers Online'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Like historic newspapers, parliamentary papers provide a fertile hunting ground for scholars from all kinds of disciplinary angles. The nature of the questions, laws and debates recorded in such papers structure so much of a country's life - they are an obvious source to explore to understand a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But so far there has been little attempt to examine parliamentary papers at a cross-national level. A few examples have been located. Digging into Linked Parliamentary Data (<a href=\"http://dilipad.history.ac.uk/\">http://dilipad.history.ac.uk/</a>) allows cross searching between British, Dutch and Canadian papers, while the Czechs and Slovaks have also build a common portal (<a href=\"http://www.nrsr.sk/dl/?lang=en\">http://www.nrsr.sk/dl/?lang=en</a>)<br><br>\r\nExpanding the transnational possibilities for parliamentary papers has enormous scholarly potential. It would allow, for example, researchers to trace how laws in one country may have influenced another (eg how were laws about female suffrage discussed across Europe), or different perspectives on common events (eg how did Parliaments discuss the run up to the Second World War)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These possibilities led Europeana to undertake an initial survey of what was currently available. What is the extent of digitisation of Parliamentary Papers in Europe? Are they available online? Under what licencing conditions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spreadsheet of the data collated is <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D1.3%20Appendix%20European%20Parliamentary%20Papers%202.pdf\">here</a>, but some of its key findings are below.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Many nations have digitised significant quantities of their principal parliamentary debates</li>\r\n    <li>Beyond laws and debates in the main parliamentary chambers, parliamentary papers include a whole range of different genres of document (eg. session papers, committee reports, petitions, etc.). These are less likely to be digitised.</li>\r\n    <li>Additionally, there are regional parliaments that in some cases have also digitised their archives.</li>\r\n    <li>Digitisation is often executed in a way that fails to extracts maximum value from the papers. Eg. Papers are often presented as scans / pdfs without any optical character recognition. This rules out any full text searching and makes researchers dependent on often poor quality metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>The ability to undertake bulk download of the material is also very rare</li>\r\n    <li>There is very rarely an clear licence associated with the parliamentary papers. This also inhibits reuse for text mining, aggregation etc.</li>\r\n    <li>Some stand outs do exist though. For example, a handful of states also offer their data in other formats - html, epub or txt files (France, Italy, Slovenia, Sweden). The Netherlands offers the whole data set for download. And for its more recent parliamentary activity Italy has done some groundbreaking work in offering parliamentary resources as open linked data.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        title: 'Europeana 1914-1918: Showcasing Crowdsourcing and User Generated Content as The ''New'' History'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This article by Dr Stephen Bull is the first in a three part series about crowdsourcing. </em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>There is a genuine case to be made that, in the digital age, 'User Generated Content' (UGC) is 'new history'. Its beauty is twofold: much of it has never been shared outside of a family or personal context, and now, being seen publicly for the first time, it can be marshalled into categories and mined for research.<br><br>\r\nSuch projects may relate to known historical events and themes, or to stories hitherto unrealised. Documents and ephemera captured could otherwise be lost entirely with passage of years, or never fall within collecting policies and resources of cultural institutions.<br><br>\r\nThe UGC concept fits modern aspirations for electronic data, rapid searches, and instant accessibility. Moreover, unlike many documents and photographs in public archives, items uploaded onto the internet by private individuals do not usually deal with the business of states and authority. They are rather the primary source material of the social and family historian, the 'everyday documents' of the everyman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/crowdsourcing-2.png\" style=\"width: 553px; height: 403px;\"><br><em>Regimental certificate of Lieutenant Arrigo Montorsi (1896-1951) of the Italian 16th Infantry who served in the Balkans and elsewhere. Just part of a group of personal items contributed on behalf of Silvana Montorsi.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 illustrates this point perfectly. Its wealth and breadth is undeniable: a single click generates close to 400,000 results from across Europe, and well beyond. Though the core collections are uploaded from libraries and archives, the public has also contributed <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/statistics\">14,000 'stories'</a>. These have been provided by individuals, or contributed at 'Roadshow' events with assistance from volunteers and professionals from the library, archive and museum sectors.<br><br>\r\nMany of these ‘stories’ are data packets containing many pages of information: copies of documents, letters and postcards, photos of three dimensional objects and video. Others comprise a poignant single image. Random illustrations of richness and diversity include everything from a message in a bottle deposited by a German workman under concrete foundations in August 1914; to a collection of teddy bears carried into battle by British officers as talismen; the remains of a Mannlicher rifle from the Isonzo front; and a number of substantial, but hitherto unknown, diaries from different countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/crowdsourcing-1.png\" style=\"width: 408px; height: 600px;\"><p><br><em>'Greetings from Nuremberg', postcard from a future dictator: Dear Lanzhammer, I am now in Munich with the Ersatz Battalion. Currently I am under dental treatment. By the way I will report voluntarily for the field immediately. Kind regards A. Hitler 19.12.16 Contributed to a Roadshow in Munich.</em><br><br>\r\nAs Europeana 1914-1918 has shown, the creation of a virtual UGC archive has many benefits, including the relatively modest resources needed to create and preserve a collection and the inclusive nature of a 'crowdsourced' or 'community archive', where users self-select what it is about an historical theme which interests them. Items are 'shared' in a way that chimes with popular social media, but within a space dedicated to a subject area.<br><br>\r\nNew users, and the public in general, are introduced to the established collections accompanying the user generated content in a way previously impossible. The 400,000 World War I items can be compared to the somewhat over 30 million digitised items that 2,300 institutions have uploaded to the various other Europeana archives and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/crowdsourcing-3.png\" style=\"width: 554px; height: 421px;\"><br><em>Framed medals and photograph of Harry S Green, of 4th Battalion Black Watch (Royal Highlanders). One of a group of associated items including letters and cards, contributed by Clare Sanderson.</em><br><br>\r\nThough there is broad data on 'hits' we may never know exactly to what degree the Europeana UGC is shared and viewed by interest groups, families separated by distance, and general browsers, or precisely what items are used for which research project. However it is already possible to illustrate some specific outputs.<br><br>\r\nFor example images have been used in articles, and material used to inspire a Lancashire schools project with the support of the University of Oxford. A batch of 'curated images' drawn from ten European countries now <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Europeana/Europeana_1914-1918_batch_upload.\" target=\"_blank\">appears on Wikimedia Commons</a>.<br><br>\r\nArguably however the greatest test of historical usefulness comes when creating new works based mainly upon UGC content. The first attempt, by BBC Journalist Jackie Storer, was published in printed book form by the British Library in association with Europeana, as Hidden Stories of the First World War (2014). Taking 32 promising family tales, most of them from the database, Storer re-interviewed many contributors and cross referenced their testimony with official documentation and other works.<br><br>\r\nThe act of producing Hidden Stories exposed the pitfalls, sheer hard work, and circumspection required when using UGC as raw material. Imperfect memories of veterans and families, the 'Chinese whispers' of gossip, national bias, or simple vagaries of translation often confirmed that 'family story' and 'historical fact' are far from one and the same, and that using UGC profitably requires perhaps even greater effort than 'ordinary' archival data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/crowdsourcing-4.png\" style=\"width: 554px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>Jožetu Lajnšiču, a Slovenian machine gunner fighting on the Eastern Front with the Austro-Hungarian Army. Upheaval and Imperial crisis gave birth to new nations, but also splintered families and led to extraordinary personal journeys in a transforming Europe. Contributed by Anton Korosec.</em><br><br>\r\nHowever, the result was a remarkable, otherwise unachievable, compendium of personal stories of the war. Some are simple illustrated anecdotes of loss, love, or hardship. Others are significant sidelights on historical events - that we thought we knew well – as eyewitnessed by 'ordinary' people. There is the German seaman's record of the events surrounding the sinking of HMS Audacious, an alternative account of the loss of HMS Hampshire and Lord Kitchener, and a simple postcard sent by the young Adolf Hitler.<br><br>\r\nIt also demonstrated the work still to be done in terms of making searching, translation, and transcription in a multi-language, transnational database easier than it currently is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/crowdsourcing-5.png\" style=\"width: 554px; height: 433px;\"><br><em>Steel helmet worn by a French artilleryman: contributed by Josiane Lefebvre.

        body: "<p>As more and more digital content is created and ingested in digital libraries, there is a growing need for creative reuse of this content by the public, researchers or the GLAM sector, for producing new digital outcomes. This need is also identified as one of the goals of Europeana Research for encouraging further engagement of researchers with digital content lying within Europeana, implementing it in their research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a different context, the relation between the public and digital content is among the core points of discussion in a different project entitled <a href=\"http://mubil.no/ark-4/\">ARK4</a>. This Norwegian project aims to create a virtual dialogue between the public and partner institutions through gaming activities. In its new phase, the project attempts to re-use digital content from the Cultural Heritage sector, mainly deriving from Europeana, to reach a wider audience through knowledge testing games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/quiz1.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 524px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"Animals\" by Ernst Enno, illustrated by Richard Kivit, published by \"Loodus\" in 1938, Estonia. </em><em>Conservation Centre Kanut, Kadriorg Art Museum, National Library of Estonia, Rights: CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collaboration among these two initiatives has resulted in the creation of knowledge games inspired by the content held within Europeana, freely available to the public. This work was an initiative undertaken by the <a href=\"http://www.dcu.gr/\">Digital Curation Unit, Athena RC</a>, project partner of Europeana Research and ARK4. To this purpose, results deriving from the work conducted within Work Package 1 of the project Europeana Cloud were explored (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D1.3%20D1.6%20User%20Requirements%20Analysis%20and%20Case%20Studies%20Report%20Content%20Strategy%20Report.pdf\">Deliverable 1.3/1.6</a>). More particularly, the suggestion for more specialized approaches to communities within the target audience of the project, in order to better capture user needs, led to the identification of different research topics. These were examined in terms of the current research practices, available tools and resources in the respective areas. Some of the identified topics thus served as the content inspiration for building games on top of them for the purposes of the ARK4 project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children’s Literature is the first of a series of knowledge testing games that will be produced in this context. Launched on March 3, on the occasion of the World Book Day, it is a joyful topic that aims to travel its users back to their childhood and test what they have been reading and remember from then. Among the questions, the users can have a look at beautiful visual records lying currently within Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/quiz2.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Illustration from \"The Adventures of Oliver Twist\", 1893, British Library.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This article is by Lorna Hughes, Professor of Digital Humanities, Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute, University of Glasgow<br>\r\n@lornamhughes</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/lorna2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was very pleased to recently receive an invitation to present a keynote on behalf of Europeana Research at the <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/about/events/eagle2016/\">EAGLE Conference</a> at <a href=\"http://www.uniroma1.it/\">Sapienza, University of Rome</a>. <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/\">EAGLE</a> is the Europeana network of Ancient Greek and Latin Epigraphy, and the conference brought together many members of the Network who are working with digital content and developing tools and services for the wider community. In addition to presentations by members of the Network, the conference included keynotes by leading figures from the epigraphic research community: Mary Beard, Cambridge University; <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/charlotte.roueche.html\">Charlotte Roueché</a>, King’s College London; and <a href=\"http://histinst.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=309\">Werner Eck</a>, University of Cologne. The whole event was steered flawlessly by the <a href=\"http://viaf.org/viaf/24736430/\">Silvia Orlandi</a>, the Eagle Chair, and <a href=\"http://uniroma1.academia.edu/RaffaellaSantucci\">Raffaella Santucci</a>, the conference organizer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/\">EAGLE</a> provides a single, user-friendly portal to the vast majority of the surviving inscriptions of the Greco-Roman World, as well as explanatory information and translations for the most important: a massive resource for researchers as well as the public. As part of Europeana, the EAGLE dataset includes over 1.5 million items, currently held across 25 EU countries as well as the east and south Mediterranean. EAGLE has supported the development of services such as a mobile application, allowing tourists to understand the inscriptions they find in situ by taking snapshots with smartphones, and a storytelling application that will allow teachers and experts to assemble epigraphy-based narratives. A multilingual wiki supports interaction with epigraphic images and texts. The metadata that enriches the digital images (photographs, drawings, scanned notes, manuscripts and archive material, ancient books out of copyright) includes semantic enrichment through geographic information, provided in close collaboration with the Pleiades project of a digital Atlas of the ancient world, operated by the New York University’s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many aspects of the research covered by the Network were covered in the keynote presentations. Charlotte Roueché discussed the many years of work she has put into digital resources like the <a href=\"http://insaph.kcl.ac.uk/\">Inscriptions of Aphrodisias Project</a>, highlighting the concerns around sustainability of, and continuing accessibility to, scholarship that relies on digital sources, tools and methods. Werner Eck discussed the potential of digital approaches for creating new understanding of the Roman World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wmarybeard\">Mary Beard’s</a> presentation reminded us of the importance of inscriptions as primary historical sources, bringing to light hidden histories about the people of the ancient world, their laws, customs, as well as their personal relationships, likes and dislikes, even their grievances and unhappy marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the emphasis on use and re-use of the rich collection of primary sources, gathered by the extensive community of researchers that have been able to work together through the Network, and using the Europeana platform, my presentation emphasised the needs of scholars in the digital realm: how we can carry out humanities research in what Roy Rosenzweig called the digital <a href=\"http://chnm.gmu.edu/essays-on-history-new-media/essays/?essayid=6\">‘culture of abundance’</a>. I discussed how digital collections can be used for research in the humanities; and how a better understanding of the place of digital collections in the research life-cycle can provide a critical framework for future development of digital collections by Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (the so-called GLAM) sector. This perspective provides an evidence base that can be used in the development of the research infrastructures that share this content, and make it openly accessible for use and re-use. In this context, I’ve been working with Europeana as Chair of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-research-advisory-board-established\">Europeana Research Advisory Board</a>, and my presentation was an opportunity to discuss how Europeana is developing a programme of engagement with the research community to make its content more accessible for research, and to develop its collections, as well as enable the humanities to exploit the ‘digital turn’, and use digital tools, content, and methods for research. The greatest opportunities to draw of the expertise in the digital humanities community to add value to digital cultural heritage lie in three key areas: the provision of trusted, open content that is ‘pre-knowable’ from the perspective of quality control; the ability to liberate content from its mode of production and dissemination for reinterpretation and analysis by open tools; and the use of multimedia content in an integrated way, liberating data from silos of content type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/lorna1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Figure 1: Research requirements in a ‘digital culture of abundance’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Research is currently developing approaches to address these needs, bringing together the metadata, content, tools and services that <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana portal</a> with Digital Humanities research and the communities of practice have evolved around specific genres of content, and specialist tools and methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s plenty in Europeana to enable digging further into these issues: helping researchers to select content from what’s available; supporting the creative use and re-use of content, and working with multimedia content in different disciplines and formats. Europeana has identified several ways it can do more to focus on researchers. For example, building focussed aggregations of content, particularly full-text, and exploring how the content can be re-used by the research community, based on some successful examples with <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a>. This will mean highlighting collections in the Europeana dataset of specific interest to researchers. Similarly, exposing Europeana’s aggregations of text and metadata to allow research teams and infrastructures to build specific tools and services to fulfill particular research tasks, like looking for links between types of data, or doing visualisations of data to test theories and ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, development of Europeana Research will be a priority over the next couple of years: as a forum for exploring these issues, it will be an important mechanism for connecting digital heritage with the research community. It has established an Advisory Board to direct a series of funded activities to enhance the use of Europeana for research, and to better document some of the innovation that can be achieved in re-using digital cultural heritage content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work will have five areas of focus, be carried out by my colleagues in the Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute, at the University of Glasgow, at the Digital Curation Unit in Greece, and at the Europeana Foundation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Developing a grants programme: The grants programme will offer funds to researchers work with digitised content from the cultural sector: exploring how content can be re-used by the research community.<br><strong>2.</strong> Expanding Collections for Re-Use on Europeana Research: The Europeana Research platform highlights various <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/collections\">featured collections</a> available for re-use. These collections will be expanded and have extra descriptive metadata.<br><strong>3.</strong> Develop enhanced ways to describe the use of Europeana content with DH tools and methods, through user engagement and dialogue with groups working in specific disciplinary areas.<br><strong>4.</strong> Continuing exploration of use case of Europeana Content: Undertaking use cases exploration and related focus groups on use of Europeana content.<br><strong>5.</strong> Developing a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/academic-research#advisory-board\">Research Advisory Board</a>, with representatives across the Arts and Humanities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that this programme of work will have wider benefit for the digital humanities research community. The opportunity to conduct this work, and engage with researchers directly and develop a better understanding of how they can work with digital content and metadata, and how they can develop a better awareness and understanding of available tools for analyzing data through the Europeana platform, will provide an important layer of evidence that will also help shape the development of other research infrastructures in the humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Research is an important opportunity for a praxis-based critical engagement that is the key to understanding the ways that the digital is affecting knowledge production: drawing us into new collaborations, leading us to encounter new methods for engaging with content, and assisting in developing new insights into our cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EAGLE is a best-practice network financed by the European Commission, under the ICT policy of its Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP – ICT PSP). It has been funded from 2011 and will conclude in April 2016: in many respects, the conference was ‘the end of the beginning’: developing the content and establishing the community. The focus will now be on use and re-use of the EAGLE dataset for new and innovative purposes, by epigraphers and other disciplines interested in the Ancient World. We very much hope that Europeana Research will be able to collaborate with these communities of practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A full version of this presentation will be included in the proceedings of the EAGLE conference, published by Sapienza, University of Rome. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More information about EAGLE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EAGLE and Wikimedia Italia</strong><br>\r\nEAGLE’s key collaboration is the one established with Wikimedia Italia.

        title: 'Europeana 1989: Documenting Historic Turning Points Via Crowdsourcing'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This article by Frank Drauschke (Facts &amp; Files, Berlin) is the second in a three part series about crowdsourcing.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Mass escape through border fence. Thousands of refugees cross the Austro-Hungarian border at Hegyeshalom. Overcrowded trains arrive in Bavaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though these headlines may sound familiar, as if drawn from recent news programmes, they are nearly three decades old. Published in September and October 1989, they refer not to refugees from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, but to people fleeing from East Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historic events of 1989/1990 marked a turning point in European history, as 2015 may well prove to be. It is important to document such crucial phases in our history, and to start doing so as early as possible. Crowdsourcing can play a useful role here by helping to gather information through the collection and documentation of personal accounts and source materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to the events of 1989-1990, several projects have been initiated in a number of countries in recent years. The German project ‘Wir waren so frei / Moments in time 1989/1990’ embarked on this task for the 20th anniversary of events. It collected 7,000 private films and photographs, and over 100 personal accounts. For example about the opening of the Brandenburg Gate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot from the moments in Time 1989/1990 website, showing a picture of crowds on and around the Berlin wall at the Brandenburg Gate, november 10th 1989\" src=\"http://research.europeana.eu/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-1.jpg\" width=\"500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collection formed the base of the pan-European crowdsourced archive <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">Europeana 1989</a>, initiated to mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of two years, under the slogan ‘we made history’, thousands of photos, documents and objects were digitised at collection days in eight Eastern and Central European countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania) or contributed online. This made Europeana 1989 the first multi-national and multi-lingual online archive about this recent past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1989 not only documents the refugee crisis of 1989, but the era’s material culture, its political and cultural movements, and last but not least the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the legitimate question arises: can this kind of user generated content (UGC) be used for serious academic research? Obviously it cannot be the only source, but it can provide a good starting point and a useful extra resource for research projects. With the right amount of source criticism, it can lead you in new directions and supplement official archival sources, with eye-witness accounts giving you a missing link or crucial supporting material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of a rich sub-collection within Europeana 1989 is that of documents, photos and films from the Baltic Way. The Baltic Way was the longest human chain in history, and one of the biggest peaceful demonstrations ever held too. It spanned 600 km, connecting the three Baltic capitals Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn. Over two million people joined hands on 23rd August 1989, marking the 50th anniversary of the Hitler-Stalin pact and demanding freedom and independence for the Baltic States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"a screenshot of 'relive the Baltic Way online', a project from Europeana 1989\" src=\"http://research.europeana.eu/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-2.jpg\" width=\"400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the project, former participants were asked to “relive” the Baltic Way online and pin their images on the actual spot on the map where they took part in this demonstration. It is now one of the most comprehensive cross-border image archives of this event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 302px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/baltic-way/#!photos/index/baltic-way/1/hide_tabs/1/#!/geo:54.653281,25.522044/zoom:10/dialog:174759/tab:details/\">Example</a> of very young participants of the Baltic Way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Via the multi-lingual project website <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">Europeana 1989</a> it is possible to explore the sources geo-located on the map. Descriptions and stories are attached to the items. Furthermore, all material gathered at collection day events can be researched via a <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/zbiorki/dlibra/collectiondescription\">more powerful search function</a>, giving access to multiple images in higher resolution through the repository backend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of this, a number of personal audio accounts were collected and shared through <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/\">89 voices</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For research on the revolutionary movements and the transition in Eastern and Central Europe this collection can be a useful resource and might include even some hidden gems for specific topics. It will also form an essential part of the digital heritage within Europeana Collections as part of User Generated Content. Future crowdsourcing initiatives might be able to enrich and complement these sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of collected material:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-4.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 309px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaflets, barbed wire, films and photos from the Pan-European Picnic in Sopron/Hungary on 19 August 1989. <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#!photos/index/#!/geo:50.762829,13.759035/zoom:4/tags:SOP034/dialog:265140/tab:details/\">Europeana 1989</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-5.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 304px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#!photos/index/#!/geo:49.969201,14.865907/zoom:9/dialog:220121/tab:details/\">Hand made banners</a> held at demonstrations in different countries, here an example from Prague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-6.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#!photos/index/#!/geo:52.364337,17.037165/zoom:11/dialog:179809/tab:details/\">Leaflets, strike posters</a> documents from the Polish Solidarnosc movement, here a leaflet from the first free election in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/europeana-1989-7.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 304px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#!photos/index/#!/geo:46.267754,29.832511/zoom:5/dialog:271594/tab:details/\">Photos and documents</a> from the Romanian revolution in December 1989.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'From ''Digital Humanities'' to ''Research Infrastructures'', a motivating talk by Lorna Hughes at Athena R.C.'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On Wednesday, March 2nd 2016, Digital Curation Unit - Athena R.C. hosted a talk by Lorna Hughes, Professor of Digital Humanities and DCU Visiting Scientist 2016, entitled From 'Digital Humanities' to 'Research Infrastructures'</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As the broader field of digital humanities and digital scholarship in the humanities expands, the discussion about how we communicate digital humanities research and what might be the role of digital research infrastructures on this respect is essential for the understanding of the implications of what is called “the digital turn”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation made by Professor Hughes was addressing, precisely, those issues focusing on the expansion of digital cultural heritage which has created tremendous opportunities for research, not least through new methods for collaboration and communication. As Professor Hughes argued, the increasing use of digital technologies in the humanities has enabled innovative approaches to representing spatial and temporal aspects of primary source materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, challenges still exist in accessing and using digital heritage. The presentation discussed the approaches to addressing these issues, based on developments in digital research infrastructures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/lornainathens.jpg\" style=\"width: 742px; height: 540px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>picture from digital humanities lecture given at Athena R.C. by Lorna Hughes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Professor Hughes, digital research infrastructures need to evolve as “digital ecosystems” and not merely collections of sources. Towards this end, she argues that digital research infrastructures should evolve around three axes: (1) better access to digital content, (2) open content for the use and re-use of digital content and (3) better environment enabling the use of hybrid and complex material and data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Professor Hughes also discussed the role of Europeana.eu in the digital research space as well as some important new developments internationally to support the use of digital content, tools and methods for research.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Five Tips For Your Next Academic Crowdsourcing Project'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em>This article by Marek Nicolic is the third in a three part series about crowdsourcing</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h6>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/\">Zooniverse</a> sprung up from Galaxy Zoo, a project where people could sort photographs of galaxies; a task where large quantities of data that cannot be processed by computers, are offered to public. Project become so popular that it grew into Zooniverse - now one of largest and most popular citizen science platform.</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>As an intern at the University of Aberdeen, I had the chance to research and learn more about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing\">crowdsourcing</a>. First popularised a decade ago, crowdsourcing is now widely recognised and used as a way for organisations to engage communities, complete large tasks on small budgets and to create buzz for their initiative. For universities, crowdsourcing has the potential to reduce research costs but so far its use has been limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is this? One reason is that, regardless of its benefits, crowdsourcing is also tied to a number of issues that need to be thought through before launching a campaign. Some of these issues are hard to work around in the university environment. In this article, I highlight some of these issues and offer tips for running a successful research-oriented crowdsourcing campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fe9e62dd-a812-9cef-78b4-d554b966ac79\">Raise Awareness Within Your Institution</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some university departments and colleges are well-versed in online approaches, many more traditional departments have only just started to invest in technology. Often, where potential for public collections is large (e.g. art, history), knowledge about the possibility of crowdsourcing is scarce, or hidden behind other problems such as a lack of familiarity about how to use online platforms. The first step towards a successful crowdsourcing project is, therefore, to explain the concept to your peers and show them the tools which are available to help with your quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fe9e62dd-a814-f1cf-62f1-16a3f5f80b42\">2. Identify How People Can Best Help</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all tasks are suitable for crowdsourcing projects. It’s therefore important for researchers to identify a part of their research to which the general public could contribute. This should be something helpful but not too detailed or difficult to understand. If the work is too technical or sophisticated, there is a risk that the crowd will lose interest before they’ve even started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Work Across Disciplines</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few disciplines could successfully launch a crowdsourcing platform on their own. By working across departments and with peers from other subject areas, it will be easier to gather the necessary computer skills, promotional tools and support of the public. This video looks at <a href=\"https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/crowdsourcing-arts-and-interdisciplinarity\">crowdsourcing in the arts and interdisciplinarity</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Identify Your Target Audience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For crowdsourcing, you need to find your target crowd. This means advertising, and perhaps even a big promotional campaign. Think about where to find the type of people you need to complete your work. The types of people who might be interested in <a href=\"https://www.galaxyzoo.org/\">sorting pictures of galaxies far away</a> could, for example, be very different from those who enjoy <a href=\"http://menus.nypl.org/\">transcribing historical restaurant menus</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fe9e62dd-a81a-96ea-e939-2d06e93f3cae\">5. Consider The Start-up Costs</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The costs of crowdsourcing can vary hugely: some are free for researchers to use, while other platforms have high initial costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UCL’s project <a href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/\">Transcribe Bentham</a>, for example, invested approximately £50,000 over a period of years to create, launch and maintain their platform dedicated to transcribing unpublished manuscripts by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. This figure included testing and revision during the design process to make it more user friendly. A more budget-friendly alternative to bespoke development is the <a href=\"http://projects.oucs.ox.ac.uk/runcoco/resources/cococo.html\">CoCoCo platform</a>, and there are surely other examples to be found online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While considering the costs of crowdsourcing, remember that there would be a cost to adapting any platform to the specific needs of your project, as well as the cost of paying a couple of salaries. Crowdsourcing is not a cost-free solution to carrying out your research but it can be a way to do low-cost research at a time when demand for grants is high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fe9e62dd-a832-95ae-4c4c-9fcc1defafc7\">Is the effort worth it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the time you’ve identified a job for the public, created a platform, found your crowd and nurtured them, you will have invested a considerable amount of time and probably also money. This leaves fewer resources to do your research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you have great success in attracting volunteers, you may find those volunteers are not as effective as you would like. Too many volunteers can also put great pressure on staff, who have to liaise with and help those volunteers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The previously mentioned <a href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/\">Transcribe Bentham</a> is a case in point. When it launched in 2010, their great social media campaign attracted the attention of mainstream media (newspapers), which in turn attracted lots of volunteers. However early reports suggested these volunteers did not produce work of a very high quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As David Weinberger observed:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'[For the first period of the project] … the results of the [crowdfunding] project cannot be encouraging for those looking for a pragmatic way to generate high-quality transcriptions rapidly. (David Weinberger, ‘<a href=\"http://home.trg-inc.com/sites/default/files/too-big-to-know-weinberger-en-16803.pdf\">Crowdsourcing Transcription: Too Big To Know</a>' (last accessed 1 January 2016)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is it worthwhile leaving your research to focus on getting the crowd to do your work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that, like other open source projects (e.g. Wikipedia, Zooniverse), <a href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/\">Transcribe Bentham’s</a> track record improved over time, as it found ‘supervolunteers’ who became very skilled in their work. The project is currently generating a large number of high quality transcriptions, with only four staff working on a less than part time basis. The take-home message here is that Transcribe Bentham is now achieving much higher numbers of transcriptions than if it had hired staff for the same cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all crowdsourcing is a great opportunity in many areas, and perhaps the only chance for many researchers to access the valuable knowledge held by the public. Encouraging awareness about and creating channels for crowdsourcing, creates pressure on universities to develop ways to accommodate it. Through this, academics will be able to engage far more closely with the public.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The issue of lost cultures or cultures under threat is nowadays more urgent than ever. Increasingly more archaeological sites are set as targets of terrorist attacks, leading to their severe damage or even their total destruction. Such numerous examples documented in recent times call for action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the aftermath of these attacks, individuals or groups, spontaneously or more organized, were activated having as goal to preserve or reconstruct as much as possible of the threatened heritage. In this way, several - mainly crowdsourcing - projects made their appearance in the Web calling people and institutions to contribute in order to virtually rebuild the sites damaged or destroyed. Among the endangered sites recently declared as targets of terrorism are Palmyra, Mosul and Nineveh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a different angle, with the aim of spreading the word and knowledge on these sites, the topic of Lost Cultures was set as the theme of two new knowledge testing games. Created in the context of the project <a href=\"http://mubil.no/ark-4/\">ARK4</a> and in collaboration with Europeana Research, these games constitute an initiative of the <a href=\"http://www.dcu.gr/\">Digital Curation Unit, Athena RC</a>, project partner of both Europeana Research and ARK4. Adding to a series of knowledge testing games initiated with a <a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/?lang=en\">Children’s Literature quiz</a>, these games attempted to reuse digital content from the Cultural Heritage field, and in particular Europeana, to reach a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first game entitled <a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/index.php?op=map&amp;mapid=6&amp;lang=en\">“Lost cultures 1: Nineveh of Henry Layard”</a> focuses on the ancient sites of Nineveh and Nimrud, excavated by Austen Henry Layard in the 19th century. The second game (<a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/index.php?op=map&amp;mapid=7&amp;lang=en\">Lost Cultures 2</a>), which reuses digital content entirely deriving from Europeana, focuses on the ancient site of Palmyra. Since its destruction, the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria has been a popular topic among archaeologists and the public and has been reconstructed in various ways, from crowdsourcing projects to 3D virtual modeling initiatives. These games, which have been widely circulated in social media, could be considered as another effort to preserve the memory of the sites of Palmyra and Nineveh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who did not have the chance to visit those sites or for the lucky ones who did, give a try to these knowledge testing games and have a glimpse of these important heritage sites.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><em>This article is by Nephelie Chatzidiakou, Scientific Associate at the Digital Curation Unit, Athena R.C.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Digital games are increasingly used for promoting learning and supporting cultural heritage engagement through playful activities. Games used for learning have a positive impact on educational efficiency and student motivation, as they encourage and improve engagement and resourcefulness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this context, DCU (<a href=\"http://www.dcu.gr/\">Digital Curation Unit, Athena R.C.</a>) recently participated in the <a href=\"http://www.athens-science-festival.gr/en/\">Athens Science Festival</a> with a thematic knowledge testing quiz developed in the context of the project ARK4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARK4 is a collaborative project between the <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/ub\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology University Library</a> and DCU, aiming to share knowledge through a series of online quizzes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Athens Science Festival took place in Athens between 5 and 10 April 2016. Although the Festival is a relatively new initiative, it is already established as one of the biggest celebrations of science and technology in Greece. Organized annually in the spring, the Athens Science Festival attracts tens of thousands of visitors, among them students, researchers and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As most of the visitors of the Festival are young people, DCU designed the “Click and Learn! Europe and Me” quiz in the Greek language. This quiz is targeted to younger users, mainly between 6 and 15 years old, and challenges their knowledge about Europe, the European geography, peoples and traditions. Eleven multiple choice questions with different weighting factors were created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visual content of the quiz was derived entirely from the Europeana collections in an attempt to re-use Europeana material in a different context, while exposing young Greek users to high quality visual material from across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether, we managed to gather 137 responses to the quizzes; the majority of the respondents was not older than 17 years old. According to the evaluation questions that accompanied the quizzes, all users liked the game and most of them felt they learned something new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intrigued? You can play too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are comfortable with the Greek language, you can try the quiz <a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/index.php?op=map&amp;mapid=4&amp;lang=el\">here</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If not, you can still try the three English quizzes on <a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/index.php?op=map&amp;mapid=4&amp;lang=en\">Children’s Literature</a> and the <a href=\"http://core.cloud.dcu.gr/ark4-front-no/index.php?op=map&amp;mapid=7&amp;lang=en\">Lost Cultures</a> created in the context of ARK4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134065131@N08/sets/72157666955022821\">Following this link</a> you can also find some pictures from the event!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Europeana and the National Library of the Netherlands are hosting an (invite only) event on ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/using-digital-heritage-for-research\">Using digital heritage for research</a>’ at the National Library in The Hague on the 25th and 26th of April. At this event policy makers, research institutions, and heritage institutions will come together to review the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Research%20Policy%20Recommendations.pdf\">research recommendations</a> made in July 2014 during the Greek Presidency, highlighting European best-practices, Europeana Research, and the Netherlands state-of-play. Two years on, this event will revisit the recommendations, look at their successes, and make new recommendations for the next phase of digital heritage in research. The event will also be the first time that representatives from all the main players in the Dutch digital humanities scene will come together to discuss digital cultural heritage in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to introductions from <a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/en/news/2015/new-director-general-at-the-koninklijke-bibliotheek-as-of-1-july-2015\">Lily Knibbeler</a> (Director General of the National Library of the Netherlands), <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/lornahughes/\">Lorna Hughes</a> (Chair of the Europeana Research Advisory Board), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jill-cousins-1\">Jill Cousins</a> (Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation) and <a href=\"https://eie.academia.edu/VictoriaTsoukala\">Victoria Tsoukala</a> (National Documentation Centre, Greece), the first day includes both a look at the future of digital humanities research needs from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_Ross\">Seamus Ross</a> (CorrFRSE, Professor Faculty of Information at University of Toronto, Europeana Research Advisory Board) and presentations on practical use cases. Researchers from <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/charlotte.roueche.html\">King’s College London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uva.nl/over-de-uva/organisatie/medewerkers/content/n/o/j.j.noordegraaf/j.j.noordegraaf.html\">University of Amsterdam</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/JvanEijnatten/0\">Utrecht University</a> will be looking at the use of digital heritage material in the study of antiquity, newspapers, and audiovisual material. Following that, Europeana Research will be the subject of an interactive session, moderated by the management team, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nienke-van-schaverbeke-1\">Nienke van Schaverbeke</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/agiatis-benardou-1\">Agiatis Benardou</a> (Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA RC), and featuring four members of the Advisory Board, <a href=\"https://soton.academia.edu/LIsaksen\">Leif Isaksen</a>, <a href=\"http://current.ischool.utoronto.ca/faculty/costis-dallas\">Costis Dallas</a>, <a href=\"http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/author/toma-tasovac/\" target=\"_blank\">Toma Tasovac</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milena_%C5%BDic-Fuchs\">Milena Žic-Fuchs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day, the opening event will be a session on the Dutch perspective and situation with digital humanities and digital heritage research. Moderated by Lorna Hughes, the session will bring together figures from research policy makers, ministry representation &amp; research organisations to discuss the Dutch situation. The meeting will conclude with a breakout session moderated by Jill Cousins, to reflect on what has been done since the 2014 recommendations and identify new ones for the next phase. The new recommendations will include priorities and policy actions in the next phase, as well as implementation and communication proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full programme is available <a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/usingdigitalheritageforresearch-programmedraft-version1.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>By <a href=\"http://blog.agroknow.com/?author=3\" title=\"View all posts by Nikos Manouselis\">Nikos Manouselis</a> in <a href=\"http://blog.agroknow.com/?cat=484\">Our Solutions</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.agroknow.com/?cat=41\">Projects</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This blog was first published on Agroknow blog.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"quote by Alan Moore: 'without the humanities, all we have are the inhumanities'.\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/withoutthehumanities.jpg\" width=\"400px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you imagine that there is a connection between Europe’s digital cultural heritage library, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and agricultural cooperatives? Probably not. Which is the beauty of the whole thing: investigating whether this rich, common European heritage source can prove of relevance and value to people and activities that one would never consider. This is exactly what Agroknow has carried out during the last year of a large European project called Europeana Cloud – being a member of the ARIADNE Foundation that was a partner in the project. The project focused on how Europeana could prove to be a research resource to scientists working on areas related to the Humanities; that is, people working on topics such as history, philosophy, culture, theology and such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Science can tell you how to clone a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Humanities can tell you why this might be a bad idea.\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/science-v-humanities.jpg\" width=\"300px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What is the difference between science and the humanities? (as exemplified by the University of Utah)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question that we focused on after a very interesting project plenary in Edinburgh was: could researchers working in completely different areas, like agriculture and food, could discover and make uses of available interesting digitised materials, from the vast amount of resources available through Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how do the Humanities related to the Agricultural and Food Sciences? Well, they kind of do have an essential relationship. Socioeconomics and policy research are an integral part of agricultural research, innovation and decision making. They help in bringing the human dimension and issues in the research process, contributing critically to the analysis and conduction of research in crosscutting themes such as poverty, food security, nutrition inbalances and natural resource management. They provide research methods and tools for scarce resource allocations, identification of research agenda, research priority setting, adoption and impact assessment studies; and they can play important role by identifying policy gaps and constraints to technology development, uptake and scaling-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Hungarian agricultural cooperative\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/18414958.jpg\" width=\"500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Right from Europeana, explaining when most Hungarian farms were turned into huge agricultural cooperatives. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2059502/data_foodanddrink_http___www_bildarchivaustria_at_Preview_18414958_jpg.html\">Hungarian Agricultural cooperative</a>, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Public Domain. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some very important policy decisions rely on scientific work that is taking place using social science methods: a prominent example is the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), a Europe-wide network and instrument of the European Union for evaluating the income of agricultural holdings and the impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to the lives of farmers in all European countries. In order to investigate the societal factors that affect major agricultural and food aspects, a number of social science methods and tools are being used, including survey data collection, statistics, analyses at a farm, cooperative and industry level, case studies, focus groups research, guides, interactive maps etc. that produce or contain socioeconomic information and data of great importance for researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why we have decided to run a pilot for a specific group of scientists that we work with: the team of the Agriculture Economic and Policy Research Institute (AGRERI), the national agricultural economics and policy research institute of Greece. The work of these guys is heavily dependent on ethnographic studies and other social science methods and tools. In many cases, historical resources and archives are used as research resource. And we wanted to investigate this dimension further: could Europeana collections become a useful digital resource for the AGRERI team? And how could we develop an online service that would bring the relevant digital collections and resources at their fingertips?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"screenshot from the homepage of the agricultural economics Research Institute homepage.\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Images/Blog_images/agreri-ecloud.png\" width=\"500px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Discovering external digital collections and repositories right from the AGRERI web site.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we have developed for the AGRERI team was a discovery service, positioned right inside their web site: a virtual library of digital collections coming from various sources (Europeana but also other important repositories and archives). Allowing them to either browse through these collections, or to search within them using keywords such as Agricultural Cooperatives, Agricultural Products, and Agricultural Economics. We started by developing an initial online demonstrator of how something like this should work. This was tested with the AGRERI team, through hands-on workshops and trials. We have incorporated their revisions, we have addressed their questions, we have revised and simplified the interface and the functionalities. And they liked this so much, that they have decided to actually integrate this discovery service into the new web site of the institute (that just went live, yeah!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do have a first answer in place, thanks to our work in Europeana Cloud and the AGRERI team: yes, scientists working with social methods and tools on topics related to agriculture and food, can and wish to discover and make use of relevant digitised collections and archives that are catalogued in Europeana. We have also taken a step further, exploring how a cultural digital infrastructure like Europeana can be connected with a data e-infrastructure for agriculture and food like AGINFRA, in order to facilitate the discovery and exploitation of such resources from our communities. It is all described in a White Paper titled “Europeana as a Resource for Social Scientists In Agriculture and Food” that we have prepared, summarising our work in the project and some directions for future work. And we are very happy and proud to share this also with you, as it illustrates how we find, connect and deliver agriculture and food information worldwide in order to make it usable, meaningful and useful.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>This article is by Lorna Hughes, Professor of Digital Humanities, Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute, University of Glasgow @lornamhughes</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, under the auspices of the ESF Research Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities (<a href=\"http://nedimah.eu/\">NeDiMAH.eu</a>), the Digital Curation Unit at the Athena Research Institute, Greece, built an ontology of digital methods for humanities research, the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (<a href=\"http://nemo.dcu.gr/\">NeMO</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ontology development incorporated existing research that had attempted to understand digital humanities projects, methods, or tools by expressing them through a series of taxonomies: analysis of these indicated an ontology, intellectually and technically, was a missing piece of the digital humanities research infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This conclusion was reached through an assessment of the complexity of the multidisciplinary landscape of digital research in the humanities, involving a combination of digital content, tools, and methods and research practices from a range of disciplines and traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can make the practice of digital humanities seem fragmented and hard to define: recent contentious debates about the nature of Digital Humanities exemplify how this lack of transparency inhibits a shared understanding of digital research methods, their contexts, dependencies, and affordances, and prevents effective peer review of digitally enabled research outside one’s ‘home’ discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the development (and funding) of research infrastructures in the humanities has lacked methodological cohesion: we hope that NeMO can provide a “layer” that allows arts and humanities researchers to develop, refine and share research methods that allow them to create and make best use digital methods and collections, better understanding the digital research life-cycle, and contributing to the growth of digital humanities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to find out more, and contribute to the development of the ontology, there is an opportunity to take part in a workshop at the Digital Humanities Conference (DH2016) in Krakow, Poland this year. It will take place on Monday, July 11th, from 09:30-16:00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This workshop will engage participants in the process of developing and analyzing ontology-based, structured documentations of scholarly research practices in the (digital) humanities, extracting and understanding patterns of work and resource usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop will explore NeMO as a conceptual framework for representing scholarly work in the Humanities, dealing especially with aspects of intentionality and capturing the various associations between ‘research actors’ and their goals, the activities undertaken, the methods employed, the resources and tools used, and the outcomes produced, thus enabling semantically rich structured representations of scholarly work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants will be invited to contribute one or more examples of their own research work, from which they will be guided to produce structured descriptions according to NeMO using a dedicated Web-based tool under the guidance of workshop facilitators, resulting in a series of case studies for use in NeMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience:</strong><br>\r\nThe workshop is of interest to both advanced digital humanities scholars and to digitally-enabled humanities researchers, or those not currently using digital tools and methods but interested to do so in the foreseeable future, as well as to computer scientists, information scientists and others interested in the relationship between digital humanities and digital infrastructures. If you’d like to attend, you can register here, by including a brief outline of the project or piece of research that you would use as the basis for the modeling exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can sign up here: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ontology-based-recording-discovery-of-research-patterns-in-the-humanities-registration-24511798449?aff=ebrowse\">https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ontology-based-recording-discovery-of-research-patterns-in-the-humanities-registration-24511798449?aff=ebrowse</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><em>This article is by Nephelie Chatzidiakou, Scientific Associate at the Digital Curation Unit, Athena R.C.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The collaboration between two EU initiatives, the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (NeMO) and the Europeana FLOSS Task Force Inventory, aiming to align the FLOSS Inventory tools against the Activity Types in NeMO, traveled to Krakow, at the Digital Humanities 2016 Conference. The poster presented in the conference showcased the results of the cooperation between the NeMO and FLOSS research groups and focused on the visualization of the results of this work regarding which functions the digital tools in the FLOSS Inventory serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"academic research poster titled: Scholarly Research Activities and Tools: When NeMO met FLOSS\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/Europeana_Research/Blog/dh2016-poster-nemo-floss-v5.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FLOSS Inventory consists of over 200 well-documented, active and pertinent Open Source tools and is actively updated and maintained. The NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (NeMO) on the other hand, the primary output of the ESF Network for Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH), is a formal ontology representing and codifying the scholarly work in the Humanities through controlled vocabularies of interrelated concepts. NeMO incorporates a tagging system through a taxonomy of Activity Types, which is structured in five hierarchies corresponding roughly to scholarly primitives (Unsworth 2000), incorporating also existing taxonomies and related work such as TaDiRAH, Oxford ICT and DH Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research teams working on FLOSS and NeMO collaborated to map each tool in the EuropeanaTech FLOSS Inventory against the NeMO Activity Types. The structure established by NeMO divides scholarly research practices into five Activity Types within a scholarly research lifecycle. Those are: seeking, acquiring, conceiving, processing and communicating and they encompass narrower terms accounting for further detail and specialization. Overall, most tools (72%) are related to the Activity Type of Processing, while fewer tools are related to Seeking (13%) and Communicating (11%). However, very few are related to Acquiring (4%) and, remarkably, no tool is related to to Conceiving (0%). More particularly, most of the tools serving the Activity Type of Seeking are used for browsing, seeking and extracting data, while others are associated to activities such as direct accessing, locating, retrieving, extracting metadata, data mining, filtering, aggregating and harvesting. On the other hand, tools related to Acquiring serve functions such as data extraction, metadata extraction, gathering, harvesting and collecting. Of the largest grouping of tools, those related to Processing, most of them are associated to managing, visualizing, annotating, adding meta-information, preserving and archiving, while several serve functions such as data recognition, modifying, web developing, editing, parsing and producing. Finally, tools related to Communicating are mostly relevant to publishing and resource sharing, while others are associated with functions such as collaborating, crowdsourcing, networking and consulting. The most frequent fine-grained Activity Types represented are managing, visualizing, publishing, browsing, annotating, adding metainformation and preserving, each supported by more than 5% of the 218 tools in FLOSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This endeavor enabled the categorisation of available tools according to the function they serve and can be of use to researchers in the Humanities for consulting an authoritative list of tools according to the type of activity they wish to undertake. Furthermore, representing the FLOSS Inventory using NeMO adds value to digital research, and the visualization of the uses of available digital tools can facilitate an important debate about software development trends.</p>\r\n"

We expect to see applications deploying as much of the Europeana data (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">e.g., the API, metadata</a>) as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">Who can apply?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be a postgraduate or doctoral student, an early career scholar in any field within the Humanities, Social Sciences, Archival or Information Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">How will Europeana Research be involved in your project?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be in charge of your own project and free to pursue it according to your own work schedule. Selected members of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/academic-research#advisory-board\">Europeana Research Team and Advisory Board</a> will be there to guide and advise you, based on their area of expertise and in accordance with your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">What funding is available?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funding is available for up to <strong>8,000 euro</strong> per successful project. 3-5 successful proposals will be funded. Funding can be used for buyout of researcher time, travel, meetings, or developer costs. This funding does not include overheads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">What are the important dates you should have in mind?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadline for applications is<strong> Friday, October 14th, 2016</strong>. Proposals will be reviewed by <strong>Friday, November 4th 2016</strong> and the list of successful projects will be announced by <strong>Friday, November 25th 2016</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">What will be the duration of the projects?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each project will be funded for one to six months, but all the work must be carried out during the period of <strong>December 1st 2016- May 1st 2017</strong>. The final reports should be submitted in English by <strong>May 1st 2017</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d840d5b3-fa39-1455-e439-237c253301e9\">How should you apply?</b></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should send an updated CV alongside a publications list, accompanied by a 500-word project proposal including work plan to Dr. Agiatis Benardou (<a href=\"mailto:a.benardou@dcu.gr\">a.benardou@dcu.gr</a>), and we will take care of the rest!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>In order to understand and agree on what success means to us under the new Europeana Strategy 2015-2020, we have researched the ‘impact’ we can expect from Europeana as a Digital Service Infrastructure.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In this paper we have assessed this first on a qualitative level, that is - when are our stakeholders happy with what we have done? Secondly, on an economic level - what are the expected returns on investment? Finally taking a more holistic, balanced approach, we ask what the desired returns are, taking into consideration the mission and values of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we can’t claim that we have resolved the issues completely, we believe we have developed a framework, a mind-set, which will help us evaluate success and failure in relation to our aims and objectives as an organisation. The paper concludes with a view on the three main areas of impact for Europeana, the desired outcomes of our activities in these areas and a first review of possible performance indicators to measure success.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>In practice, this means the CEF acts as ‘seed capital’ and that Europeana needs to develop significant alternative income streams within a couple of years while remaining true to our mission to enable heritage institutions to make their holdings openly available for re-use. This shift requires us to innovate our business model significantly from an entirely centrally funded EU initiative to a more entrepreneurial and service-centred operation that is firmly embedded in and supported by the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n"

Europeana's current logo, too, has a programmatic aspect: the slogan “Think Culture” clearly again is related to Europeana's mission and at same time seems somewhat closer to the point: 'thinking' culture evokes notions like conceptualisation, reasoning, semantics and the like.</p>"

These memory organisations are the guardians of society’s shared knowledge. They play an essential part in maintaining the Public Domain on behalf of citizens and must uphold a number of general principles. These principles are essential to preserve a meaningful understanding of the Public Domain and to ensure that it continues to function in the technological environment of the networked information society. These principles are not intended to prevent organisations from commercial exploitation of Public Domain works in their collections. Instead they provide a set of minimum standards that ensures that the Public Domain functions in the digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Copyright protection is temporary. </strong>Copyright gives creators a time-limited monopoly regarding the control of their works. Once this period has expired, these works automatically fall into the Public Domain. The mass of knowledge over recorded time is in the Public Domain; copyright offers an appropriate and time-limited exception to this status.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>What is in the Public Domain needs to remain in the Public Domain.</strong> Exclusive control over Public Domain works cannot be re-established by claiming exclusive rights in technical reproductions of the works, or by using technical and or contractual measures to limit access to technical reproductions of such works. Works that are in the Public Domain in analogue form continue to be in the Public Domain once they have been digitised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>The lawful user of a digital copy of a Public Domain work should be free to (re-) use, copy and modify the work. </strong>Public Domain status of a work guarantees the right to re-use, modify and make reproductions and this must not be limited through technical and or contractual measures. When a work has entered the Public Domain there is no longer a legal basis to impose restrictions on the use of that work.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Guidelines for preserving the function of the Public Domain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of significant developments that threaten the function of the Public Domain. Over the last decades we have witnessed an expansion of the scope of copyright both in terms of time and protected subject matter. This has been detrimental to the Public Domain and the ability of citizens and memory organisations to interact with important parts of our shared culture and knowledge. The following Guidelines are issued to counter this trend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Any change to the scope of copyright protection needs to take into account the effects on the Public Domain. </strong>Changes to the scope of copyright must not be retroactive. In the 20th century copyright has been extended to accommodate the interests of rights holders at the expense of the Public Domain. As a result a large portion of our shared culture and knowledge is locked away behind copyright and technical restrictions, and we must ensure that this situation will not be worsened in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>No other intellectual property right must be used to reconstitute exclusivity over Public Domain material. </strong>The Public Domain is an integral element of the internal balance of the copyright system. This internal balance must not be manipulated by attempts to reconstitute or obtain exclusive control via regulations that are external to copyright. No technological protection measures backed-up by statute should limit the practical value of works in the Public Domain. Industrial property rights, such as trademarks, should not be used to restrict the re-use and copying of Public Domain works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Background</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Public Domain is a shared resource that underpins contemporary society. As knowledge and information are digitised, legal contracts are often being used that inhibit free access to the digitised Public Domain. This runs counter to the founding objective of Europeana. Our essential aim is to make Europe’s Public Domain cultural and scientific heritage freely accessible to citizens in digital form to encourage the development of knowledge and stimulate creative enterprise and innovation. This is the position of the European Commission, who fund Europeana, and the Europeana Foundation, who run the service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Foundation is made up of international associations that represent museums, archives, audiovisual collections and libraries: the memory organisations which provide content to Europeana. It is in the Foundation’s interest to be clear on the use and meaning of the Public Domain. Europeana belongs to the public and must represent the public interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Charter is a policy statement, not a contract. It does not bind Europeana's content providers to any position. The Europeana Foundation is issuing the Charter in order to influence the debate among the Europe’s memory organisations, policy makers and funders about the terms under which Public Domain digital content is made available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In its access and re-use terms Europeana follows the policies of its content providers. Each of them is legally responsible for deciding the terms on which they make content available, and for determining and clearing any rights in their content. Consequently, there are a wide range of practices among institutions providing Public Domain content to Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Public Domain Charter will help to promote greater consistency for the benefit of our users. Users have complained of the range of different practices and especially that some content providers charge for downloading and even for accessing digitised items which are in the Public Domain in their analogue form. They perceive this as a barrier to citizens wishing legitimate access to their Public Domain heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the Public Domain?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Public Domain comprises all the knowledge and information – including books, pictures and audiovisual works – which does not have copyright protection and can be used without restriction, subject in some European countries to the author's perpetual moral rights. The Public Domain provides a historically developed balance to the rights of creators protected by copyright and it is essential to the cultural memory and knowledge base of our societies. The Public Domain covers two categories of material:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Works on which copyright protection has expired. Copyright in a work in most of Europe lasts for 70 years after the death of its longest living creator. If copyright is held by a corporation, then it lasts for 70 years after publication. Once this temporary protection has come to its end, all legal restrictions cease to exist. It means that almost everything published, painted, photographed or released anywhere in the world before the 20th century is out of copyright and in the Public Domain.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The essential commons of information that is not covered by copyright. Works are not protected by copyright if they are not original. Ideas and facts are not covered by copyright, but the expression of them is. Laws and judicial and administrative decisions are excluded from this protection. This essential commons is regarded as too important for the functioning our societies to be burdened with legal restrictions of any nature even for a limited period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note that next to the Public Domain as described above there are a number of other limitations and exceptions that reduce legal restrictions and ensure sufficient access to our shared knowledge and culture. These exceptions ensure that the copyright granted to creators does not interfere with certain specific requirements of society. They ensure access, enable the functioning of essential social institutions and provide for the social participation of individuals with special needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why is the Public Domain important?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Public Domain is the raw material from which we make new knowledge and create new cultural works. Having a healthy and thriving Public Domain is essential to the social and economic well-being of our societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Much of the world’s knowledge – Diderot’s Encyclopédie, the paintings of Leonardo, Newton’s Laws of Motion – is in the Public Domain. Society constantly re-uses, reinterprets and reproduces material in the Public Domain and by doing so develops new ideas and creates new work. New theories, inventions, cultural works and the like are indebted to the knowledge and creativity of previous centuries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Public Domain in the digital age&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The internet gives access to the digitised portion of that knowledge and creativity on a scale previously impossible. It is the driver for massive digitisation efforts that will fundamentally change the role of cultural and scientific heritage institutions. The digitisation of analogue collections creates new opportunities for sharing and creative re-use, empowering people to explore and respond to our shared heritage in new ways that our legislation has yet to catch up with. It has also brought copyright to the centre of attention for holders of our cultural and scientific heritage. Our memory organisations have for generations had the public duty of holding the heritage in trust for the citizenry and of making it accessible to all. Both of these functions are usually conducted at the citizens’ – i.e. the tax payers’ – expense.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Entrusted with the preservation of our shared knowledge and culture, not-for-profit memory organisations should take upon themselves a special role in the effective labelling and preserving of Public Domain works. As part of this role they need to ensure that works in the Public Domain are accessible to all of society, by making them available as widely as possible. It is important for memory organisations to recognise that as the guardians of our shared culture and knowledge they play a central role in enabling the creativity of citizens and providing the raw materials for contemporary culture, science, innovation and economic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the same time the transformation from guardians of analogue collections to providers of digital services places enormous challenges on these organisations. Creating and maintaining digital collections is expensive; the cultural heritage sector may lack resources for this new responsibility. Government sponsors may encourage or require organisations to generate income by way of licensing content to a wide variety of commercial users.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Public-Private Partnerships have become one option for funding large scale digitisation efforts. Commercial content aggregators pay for the digitisation in exchange for privileged access to the digitised collections. These activities are seen as a reason for attempting to exercise as much control as possible over digital reproductions of Public Domain works. Organisations are claiming exclusive rights in digitised versions of Public Domain works and are entering into exclusive relationships with commercial partners that hinder free access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When this exclusivity locks down digital content and inhibits access and re-use by teachers, innovators and citizens, memory organisations may be compromising their core mission and undermining their relationship with their users. Works that are in the Public Domain in analogue form must remain freely available in digital form and digitisation of such works must lead to increased access by the public instead of new restrictions. To remain relevant in the digital age, cultural and scientific heritage organisations must strive to increase access to our shared knowledge and culture by being the primary points of access to the works that they have in their collections. Value-added services can be developed around content without the need to claim exclusive rights over works that have been in the Public Domain in analogue form.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, at a political and policy-making level, it is in the interests of society that Public Domain knowledge and information be digitised. Once digitised, it should be freely available to creative enterprise, R&amp;D innovators and technical entrepreneurs to use as the basis for generating ideas and applications yet to be envisaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The aim of this Charter is to give a clear signal to content providers, policy makers and the public that Europeana and the Europeana Foundation believe in and wish to strengthen the concept of the Public Domain in the digitised world. In order to do so we need a robust and up-to-date understanding of the nature of this essential resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to respond to the Europeana Public Domain Charter, please <a href=\"mailto:info@europeana.eu\">contact info@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n"

It began with the publication of Europeana – Next Steps, a report by Helga Trüpel, Vice-Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education of the European Parliament, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in May 2010. It culminated in the publication of the Comité des Sages’ report, The New Renaissance, in the first weeks of 2011, which featured Europeana extensively. We welcome the confidence shown in Europeana. This Annual Report highlights the progress we have made this year, both in the short term and in setting out longer term goals in our Strategic Plan 2011-2015. The Plan will help us deliver on the European Commission’s objectives for the Europeana service and meet the expectations that have been raised.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Making impact on a small budget'
        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>How the LSH museet shared their collection with the world</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In the summer of 2014 the paper ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publications/democratising-the-rijksmuseum\">Democratising the Rijksmuseum</a>’ was published on Europeana Pro. This paper described how the museum opened up their entire digital collection to the public and the results of that. The paper was received with great interest, but also raised questions about how the model of the Rijksmuseum could be applied to smaller museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, we have worked on another case study. This time, with an institution with a far smaller budget: the <a href=\"http://lsh.se/en\" target=\"_blank\">Livrustkammaren och Skoklosters slott med Stiftelsen Hallwylska museet</a> in Sweden. It has about 50 people on its staff and a limited budget. About 300,000 people visit the three museums combined each year. At the same time, their collection is shared all over the world and receives millions of views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper investigates how they have achieved this and how they worked with their digital collection using limited resources. The paper explores the preparation, the decisions taken, the process and the results. In addition that, the paper will also take a closer look at some of the copyright issues that had to be dealt with and specifically at the difference between the generation of copyright between two- and three-dimensional objects. Finally it also includes the full transcript of the interview we had with Karin Nilsson which is well worth a read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that this paper can be an inspiration and a useful example for smaller and mid-size institutions. If you have any comments or questions, get in touch!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The first requirements were defined by representatives from all the domains represented in Europeana: libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDM has become an interoperable framework for describing digital cultural heritage data. The same collaborative effort now supports extensions and refinements that accommodate the subtleties of cultural heritage domain-specific data. Europeana facilitates this by maintaining EDM as a flexible model and providing adequate documentation to support communities’ specific work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This White Paper gives an account of the latest developments in EDM and highlights the principles that are necessary for the model to continue as a suitable framework for cultural heritage data.</p>\r\n"

The content and metadata which data partners can provide will depend on their own agendas and capabilities. However, the higher the quality of information provided, the more benefit created for audiences and the greater the potential use in education, research and the creative industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help our partners understand what we mean by ’quality’, the Publishing Framework outlines different layers for content and metadata, which we refer to as ‘tiers.’ The content tiers were developed in 2015 and the metadata tiers added in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can explore an overview of these tiers through the videos and documents below. Each tier is based on real examples and has been developed through discussions in Europeana-led projects, Task Forces and Working Groups.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>This year's business plan sets out how we’ll carry out our Strategy 2015-2020. It was created through valuable discussions with our partners and Network Association and reflects the views of our broad community. Rather than concentrating on one year only, we decided to expand our vision and lay out our priorities for the next two years, to be able to focus on reaching goals rather than ticking off tasks. Obviously, things will develop along the way, so we’ll update it next year to reflect that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have called this business plan ‘Creating Cultural Connections’ because we feel that removing obstacles between institutions, large and small, who have heritage to share and users who are looking for it, is our main focus for the year.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Search has long been acknowledged as a difficult area for the Europeana platform.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In 2016, we have released a whitepaper that discusses the question of the search and navigation paradigm required for a platform that attempts to represent not just an individual exhibition or organisation, but the GLAM sector as a whole. How does one navigate and discover ‘culture’, at scale? The document then details high-level strategic areas which have influenced Europeana's effort for improving and evaluating search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years later and significant progress on the ideas laid out in the white paper, we have published a new strategy that is aimed to guide search improvement efforts in the Europeana DSI project. This document, while echoing the general lines of the whitepaper, presents a much more detailed picture, with many possible actions to improve search. These\_ actions are organized in a roadmap that is structured along 6 focus areas: metadata search, content search, semantic search, documentation and procedures, multilinguality, evaluation. The document also presents the current progress along these actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This page was edited 3 January 2022 to introduce the new DSI Search Improvement Strategy.\_</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>This White Paper aggregates resources and best practices for realizing multilingual access to cultural heritage content in digital libraries.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>It offers recommendations and resources for overcoming challenges in letting users access content they might not understand. It addresses cultural heritage professionals and wants to give practical advice for common problems. It shows examples from the cultural heritage domain, lists research that addresses the implementation of multilingual access and gathers best practices from various projects within the domain.<br>\r\nThe paper focuses on three different components of multilingual cultural heritage information systems – the data, the interactions and the interface. Additionally, common pitfalls are addressed and suggestions for evaluating multilingual components are gathered.<br>\r\nIt is an extended version of a deliverable published within the EU-funded project Europeana v3.0. Many cultural heritage professionals from the Europeana Network followed the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/help-us-tear-down-language-barriers-together\">open call to contribute their expertise to this work</a>, resulting in a rich resource reflecting multiple perspectives.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>We invite you to watch the film, and read the case study and judge for yourself the social and cultural impact of Europeana 1914-1918.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/183833345\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film is part of the case study prepared with our partners Whalebone &amp; Greenstone that explores the social and cultural impact of a long-running service: Europeana 1914-1918. The case study presents the preparation and research that was undertaken for the first application of the Europeana Impact Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It explores the processes and tools that were developed to collect and analyse data, as well as the creation of the film itself. If you wish to know more about undertaking an impact assessment in the cultural heritage sector, this is a good place to start. You can also <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eGaMxkLOzBHugLn7LuH2LIxB89beYlDJAMumdIK-Yqo/edit#gid=2142975142\">see and download the dataset</a> behind the figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope this study supports others in our Network who struggle with the same issues related to impact and impact assessment. We welcome your feedback, your comments and your own experiences. We invite you to join us as we continue to build our understanding of this complex subject. You can email us at <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu?subject=Feedback%20from%3A%20%20Workers%20Underground\">impact@europeana.eu</a> and follow the conversation via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23europeanaimpact&amp;src=typd\">#europeanaimpact</a></p>\r\n"

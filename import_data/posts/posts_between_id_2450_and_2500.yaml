Can you tell us about the history of the Women’s Museum of Norway?&nbsp;</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for the invitation!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://kvinnemuseet.no/en\">Women’s Museum of Norway</a> is the result of years of networking, fundraising, building a collection and finding a suitable building. The museum was founded in the town of Kongsvinger in the late 1980s, with the purpose of collecting, studying and disseminating the history and culture of women in Norway. The founders were influenced by emerging academic fields of women’s history and women’s studies (now women’s and gender history and gender studies), whose early common goal was to increase women’s visibility and status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1995 the museum opened in the former childhood home of the avant-garde poet, Dagny Juel (1867‒1901). At the time Juel was nearly forgotten, but thanks to the Women’s Museum her story was made visible again.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What exhibitions and projects are you focusing on at the moment?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We recently opened a new exhibition: <a href=\"https://kvinnemuseet.no/en/exhibitions/shhh\">SHHH! Stories about abortion and sexuality</a>. The right for women to control their own fertility, including the right to safe abortions, has been a core issue for the women’s movement globally, and SHHH! is one of the museum's biggest productions. It was a collaborative project with the museum network <a href=\"https://iawm.international/\">International Association of Women’s Museums (IAWM)</a>. It collects approximately 60 stories from women (and some men) who share their experiences with abortion. We have stories from around 20 countries all over the world. The physical exhibition opened last summer, and an online international version will open during spring/summer 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the photo below, you can see a student in a part of the exhibition which showcases underwear from a demonstration in 2018 initiated by the Norwegian radical feminist group Kvinnegruppa Ottar to protest the government’s suggestion to add a restriction to the abortion law. They encouraged women to write protest slogans on old underwear and send them to the Prime Minister’s office. After the demonstration, the Women’s Museum wrote a letter to the Prime Minister’s office who sent the collection to us. The underwear now a part of the museum collection, and as you can see from the photo, a part of the exhibition SHHH! in the room dedicated to pro-choice activism. <a href=\"https://digitaltmuseum.no/021028441341/trusesamling\">Explore the collection</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In 2022 we will also open two new exhibitions in our temporary exhibition room. One will be an exhibition about lesbian feminism in the 1970s and 1980s as in 2022, Norway will mark and celebrate that homosexuality was decriminalised 50 years ago. The Women’s Museum will focus on lesbian activism in the 1970s. The exhibition opens in April.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In August we will open an exhibition about the famous glaciologist and polar explorer Monica Kristensen (b. 1950), who managed to build an international career in a male-dominated sphere and profession. A truly fascinating story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in this work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the permanent exhibition SHHH!, it was very important to add a digital platform for the exhibition in addition to the physical exhibition at the museum. Since it is an international project we want to make our colleagues at women’s museums around the world able to show their visitors the stories we have collected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What plans do you have to celebrate Women’s History Month in your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Women’s Museum is involved in our local 8th of March (International Women’s Day) committee, which normally celebrates with a parade ending at the museum. The evening continues inside with speeches, poetry readings, songs and other contributions that the committee have put together for the program. This year we have to settle for an outdoor event, because of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, every year a local upper secondary school class makes posters for the event, and this year is no exception! We will share the posters in our social media channels and in the town of Kongsvinger. Have a look at <a href=\"https://kvinnemuseet.no/kvinnedagen-2022?fbclid=IwAR1wAiEaiOIqDg3XMrsb1TvZCULiCL4fVs92GFPfl27EQ1Vj0wxvb0QuzGo\">this year's poster</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you share with us a woman who inspires you either from history or is still alive and explain why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our research for SHHH! I learned about the Norwegian-Swedish sexual educator Elise Ottesen-Jensen “Ottar” (1886‒1973).&nbsp;In the 1920s she became an advocate for sexual reform in Sweden. She educated people on abortion and contraception. She travelled around the country to poor working-class families, and in outside toilets and wood sheds, she helped mothers of large families to get diaphragms fitted, all at a time when there was still a ban on sharing information about contraception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 1933 Ottar founded the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU). Between 1959 and 1965 she was the president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the world’s largest federation for sexual and reproductive health and rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice do you have for cultural heritage institutions who would like to acknowledge, surface and highlight women’s history in their own collections?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the institutions are already&nbsp;interested in making an extra effort to acknowledge and highlight women’s history in their own collections, they have already taken an important step. There are many fun and easy ways to highlight women’s history on your museum platforms, such as 'object of the month'&nbsp;on your webpage and social media channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For museum professionals to succeed in integrating this work in their daily practices, they need support from both museum directors and general management. It cannot only be the responsibility of individual curators and registrars who have an interest in women’s history. To have the support of upper management teams, it is necessary to implement a long-term strategy for improving museums’ work with women’s history. In addition, institutions need to formalise their priorities in documents such as exhibition plans, collection plans and strategy plans.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women’s history is everywhere! But sometimes we have to ask new questions of the collection and museum objects to find it. For example, there can be more women’s history related to the use of objects, instead of their production, which is more often related to men. If the museum presents object stories about both use and production the collections become richer and more interesting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Follow the Women’s Museum of Norway on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Kvinnemuseet\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kvinnemuseet/\">Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why did you decide to commission an economic impact assessment?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.culture.gouv.fr/en/Thematiques/Monuments-Sites/Acteurs-metiers/Les-partenaires/Les-mecenes-et-Fondations/La-Fondation-du-patrimoine\">Fondation du patrimoine</a> is the biggest investor in heritage preservation in France. For our 25th birthday, we wanted to highlight to everyone (in both the public and private spheres) that our actions create a lot of positive impact in territories across France. We have supported 35,000 projects in 25 years, and the Fondation’s resources represent approximately €70 million in 2020. <a href=\"https://www.fondation-patrimoine.org/fondation-du-patrimoine/nos-resultats\">Find out more</a>&nbsp;(in French).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our impact study had four objectives: to promote the Fondation’s economic, social and societal contribution; quantify the results, the relevance of our actions and identify areas for improvement; guide and manage our strategy using self-assessment tools; and to promote the work of volunteers and employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How was the Europeana Impact Playbook helpful for your work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I checked online to explore which impact studies have been done in the cultural heritage sector, and found that in France, there are very few. I was looking for impact studies at a supranational level, and Europeana appears as a main player in this field. I read the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Playbook</a> to understand if our methods were similar because our economic&nbsp;and social impact study, at that time, was already done. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />It was interesting to analyse other examples of, and approaches to, impact studies and it has given us insights for future impact studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did you find from your assessment?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The study showed that, beyond its cultural dimension, heritage has a social and economic utility. We estimate that around 15,000 full-time jobs have been created or maintained every year related to the work&nbsp;and operation of the sites supported by the Fondation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This quantitative study also had a qualitative component which explored the societal impact of heritage projects. Given the work it does, in particular with regard to the collection of donations and sponsorships, we found that the Fondation contributes to a real dynamic of citizen participation. It acts as a facilitator of projects and brings private and public donors together with a joint mission. Ultimately, sponsorships and fundraising create civic commitment. Thanks to the preservation of heritage, specific knowledge and know-how is transmitted and maintained from generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of economic impact, we found that the preservation and restoration of heritage generates significant economic and tourism benefits. The study showed that each €1 donation to the Fondation triggers €21 in sustainable economic benefits. By 2019, €553 million of work will have been supported by the Fondation, and this has generated €1.2 billion of direct, indirect and induced long-term economic activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Has digital informed your work on impact or your understanding about the value of heritage?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digitisation of our cultural heritage is important in order to protect, conserve, restore, and promote our heritage. For example, using augmented reality for some of our projects makes it possible to better visualise the restoration work. In addition, digital allows us to communicate about our projects in France on various networks, especially since 60% of our projects are in municipalities of fewer than 2,000 inhabitants. Digital allows us to have an impact on the visibility of our projects nationally and internationally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do real-life stories add value to these metrics?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Telling the impact story behind the numbers is useful for all stakeholders. Indeed, investing in heritage is not only a question of Euros. There is an emotion, a transmission, something that you cannot explain, which compels you to donate. Case studies underline, namely through interviews, that the Fondation’s actions contribute to the revitalization of the local economy and the regeneration of town centres.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can others learn from your approach?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They can learn that investing in heritage is not only a cost, it is a wonderful investment with positive effects in the short and long-term! Preserving heritage strengthens social cohesion and underlines the importance of the transmission of history, culture from generation to generation and equal access to the common good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those wanting to gain more insight into our approach,we have created an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.portailpatrimoine.fr/\">online platform</a> (in French) to help public authorities, donors, patrons to understand how to invest in heritage, what are the key returns on investment, how to draw a business plan, and more.&nbsp;There is educational and practical content to answer all your questions, as well as testimonials and feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where do you go next?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’d like to help regional projects assess their economic impact with an&nbsp;‘excel impact calculator’ regarding economic and social impacts. We would also like to run an environmental impact study in 2022-2023 with qualitative case studies and a quantitative approach. An external advisory service will help us to create the indicators for such a study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Communicating about impact is important: we will have an impact review in our upcoming annual reports, put the report online and think about our contribution to the <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Sustainable Development Goals. We aim to publish five case studies every year and get more involved in the philanthropic sector and impact investing in France (for example, through the <a href=\"https://philanthro-lab.org/\">Philanthro lab</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, thanks to this impact study, we can highlight that investing in heritage preservation leverages a tourist and cultural offer and develops the attractiveness and visibility of a territory. We will support this through our annual&nbsp;‘Impact Fund’, which offers €1 million of private funds given to five projects in France that have a real impact on their territories (economic, social, environmental, safety, cultural).</p>\r\n"

Cultural heritage is vital to our knowledge and understanding of who we are, where we've come from and what we can become. It promotes tolerance and inclusivity and is essential to empowering citizens and creating fairer societies. At this critical time that heritage is now at risk and the work to promote our shared values and goals will be more important than ever.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our thoughts are with our Ukrainian members of the Europeana Network and with all those with family and friends in Ukraine. We hope for a speedy return to peace for the sake of humanity.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Network Association</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Aggregators Forum</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Engaging with cultural heritage through Europeana XX</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, Masters students of Cultural Studies at KU Leuven were assigned a project to create and promote an online exhibition. Encouraged by their course mentors&nbsp;Frederik Truyen and Sofie Taes, partners in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX, Century of Change</a> project, the students considered: what could be seen as a 20th century game changer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The group of six students identified the first contraceptive pill as one of the most significant inventions of the 20th century. This had transformed the lives of millions of people. They decided to curate an exhibition exploring the history of birth control and the impact that modern contraception had on improving the health and well-being of women around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The student team described how, ‘As an international group of six women, it was our primary goal to tell a story women all over the world could relate to. Almost immediately we agreed that the contraceptive pill was the topic to go with: the pill was of such importance in the 20th century that it was definitely a game changer. The pill was empowering and still contributes a great deal to the ongoing empowerment of women and the fight for equal rights.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their digital exhibition ‘<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/thepillexpo/the-pill-expo\">The Pill Expo - A game changer of the 20th century </a>’ examines not only the invention of the pill but also the history of birth control and pioneering birth control activists, as well as the legal, religious or health-related constraints to contraception. It was launched in April 2021 and uses predominantly openly licensed material from the Europeana website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The extensive collections on Europeana inspired us greatly. Thanks to the search engine we could browse the collection easily,’ says one of the curators, Margot Melsens. ‘Next to that, the large number of freely usable photographs were very advantageous’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘The Pill’ comes to Europeana&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana inspires people to engage with, curate and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-reuse-be-inspired\">reuse</a> the content shared by cultural heritage institutions across Europe. ‘The Pill Expo’, which includes posters and photographs from diverse collections found in Europeana, is a great addition to Europeana’s online exhibitions, and has been added to mark <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/join-us-in-celebrating-women-s-history-month-2022\">Women’s History Month</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To bring the exhibition onto the Europeana website required some adjustments and also saw an expansion of the exhibition’s content. Through this work, the exhibition can be shared with Europeana’s audiences, broadening the reach of the student project, particularly as it has been translated into more languages. The exhibition is also available now in&nbsp;French, German, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To bring ‘The Pill Expo’&nbsp; on to the Europeana website, Europeana’s Collections Engagement Team worked&nbsp; with Sofie Taes, Europeana XX project editorial coordinator and student mentor, to adjust the exhibition’s format, tone of voice and styling. The original exhibition has also been enriched with audiovisual material allowing the viewers to explore archival footage. ‘Audiovisual collections have been at the core of Europeana XX ', says Sofie Taes. 'They are a unique expression of recent history that often remains under the radar when it comes to the caring and sharing of cultural heritage.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>International Women’s Day</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibition launched on Europeana on 8 March, International Women's Day. The day of a global celebration of women’s achievements feels like a perfect moment to explore the story of emancipation through effective birth control.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'I grew up in a traditional, conservative environment where the perception of the pill has never been very comprehensive or has been biased. This topic gave me a chance to break the stereotypes', says contributing student Xinghan Lou, responsible for the communication and visual design in the student&nbsp;team. 'For me, the process of exploring The Pill was like a microcosm of the process of shattering personal prejudices about something unfamiliar.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibition aims to inspire Europeana’s visitors to reflect on the impact the invention of the pill had on society, and women in particular, as well as to bring the work of students engaging in their digital cultural heritage to wider audiences.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What are the Europeana Inclusive Engagement Guidelines?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Inclusive Engagement Guidelines are a set of principles and accountability measures which aim to ensure that when the Europeana Initiative and its communities engage with each other, in either a physical or a digital space, we do so in an inclusive way, with respect for each other, kindness towards each other, and an open heart and mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of these Guidelines are very practical in nature: for instance, we want to make sure that everyone is aware and comfortable with meetings being recorded, going into breakout groups, or audience interaction. Others are more about mindset: for example, we ask everyone to embrace a learning mindset, to become aware of biases, and have the courage to be curious about what we do not know or understand. The Guidelines are accompanied by a set of accountability measures that demonstrate how we plan to ensure that we are open, kind and respectful to one another and that can be used by anyone to hold anyone else in the community accountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At their core, the Guidelines represent principles for thoughtful communication, inclusive collaboration and healthy conflict that we will adhere to together with members of the Europeana community. They provide a shared tool to foster an environment of openness, learning, awareness of biases, curiosity, and respect for multiple views and perspectives. They also can help to ensure that, where and if differences of opinion occur, they can be resolved in a healthy and respectful way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How have we developed these Guidelines?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020 Europeana created an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-europeana-foundation-diversity-and-inclusion-cross-team\">internal Diversity and Inclusion cross-team</a> to coordinate the work that was needed to make Europeana a more open, welcoming and respectful place for everyone. In 2021, the cross-team started collaborating with consultant Lauren Vargas to create a set of guidelines for Europeana's community. Europeana Foundation staff members were invited to several co-creation sessions led by Lauren Vargas to start building the Inclusive Engagement Guidelines. After workshops within Europeana, representatives of the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregator’s Forum were asked to give feedback on the Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Guidelines were then tested at several events, including Europeana 2021 in November, the Slovenian Presidency in December, and a series of WEAVE project events in February. Feedback from participants at these events, as well as from Europeana Foundation staff and representatives from the Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, has been positive. The guidelines were well received, with staff members even using them outside of Europeana events and audiences at the Europeana 2021 event sharing their appreciation of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One Twitter user who attended Europeana 2021 wrote: <em>‘One thing that really caught my attention at #Europeana2021 were the #inclusive conversation + community guidelines. They were posted in the video chat and read out by the host at the beginning of a session. The organisers were kind enough to share more information.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This input has informed the first public version of the Guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How will we apply and develop these Guidelines?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are currently using the Guidelines at our events, but it will take time to properly integrate them in a sustainable manner across the Europeana Initiative and our communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whenever we publicly engage with the Europeana community, we will aim to adhere to our Guidelines and will ask those participating in the event to adhere to them with us. We will share and link to our the Guidelines and aim to hold each other accountable for adhering to them in our physical and digital spaces. We aim to use the Guidelines to make sure that there is no place for racism, discrimination, or oppression in the spaces where we engage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even after the work of the past few months, the development of the Europeana Inclusive Engagement Guidelines will continue to evolve as our own dialogues and behaviours evolve. They will reflect the practices and needs of our community. As the world, and our ways of communicating and engaging with each other, change, we will need to adapt the Guidelines, and will establish a process that ensures that they are periodically reviewed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can you use our Inclusive Engagement Guidelines?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our Inclusive Engagement Guidelines are available to read in this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_9WM7BiMpgT0SXsLtMKRXQdss90hUqb7C4rl5-sObek/edit?usp=sharing\">Google document</a>. We are sharing them&nbsp;in this form so that they can be easily updated as we continue to develop and shape them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are looking for a set of guidelines to use at your own events or other places of engagement, Europeana's Inclusive Engagement Guidelines are open to reuse as you see fit. We will continue to update you on how we are implementing the Guidelines as we use them more and more in our daily work. If you make use of them, we would love to hear about your experience&nbsp;- please feel free to contact us via&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:marijke.everts@europeana.eu\">marijke.everts@europeana.eu</a> and <a href=\"mailto:jolan.wuyts@europeana.eu\">jolan.wuyts@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can you give feedback on our Inclusive Engagement Guidelines?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We invite you to give feedback on and test out these guidelines to make sure we can support everyone in feeling safe, secure, and heard in Europeana's community. We are looking for volunteers to take part in one-hour testing sessions where you will work in a group with consultant Lauren Vargas and other volunteers to explore the Guidelines, see if they have the desired effect and provide feedback about how they work for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The sessions will take place on 7 and 8 April 2022, and are an opportunity to give direct feedback about our work, help ensure all voices (yours included) are represented and benefit from these guidelines and shape resources that we hope will be useful to the whole cultural heritage sector. If you are interested in taking part, please sign up through the form below. You will be asked to identify with a certain group in order to make sure we are giving you a safe space in which to share your experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>The transposition process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transposition process kicked off in Italy on 14 February 2020. After a legislative act authorised and guided the Government to change the law as required by the new European Union Directive, a draft of a legislative decree by the Ministry of Culture followed, to which the Standing Advisory Committee on Copyright provided input. A new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:1941-04-22;633\">legislative decree</a>’s final draft was published on 27 November 2021, and came into force on 12 December 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Representatives of the cultural heritage sector followed the process closely by providing input, suggesting amendments and participating in informal hearings. Unfortunately, many were not taken on board and some relevant stakeholders were excluded from the final hearings, which made the process appear rather opaque.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Text and data mining</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The provisions on text and data mining in the CDSM Directive give researchers who have legal access to materials (such as in archival collections) the freedom to undertake data analytics without needing to ask for permission, even if the materials might be in copyright. This cannot be forbidden by contract: for instance if a university subscribes a licence to access a database and the provider includes a clause that forbids doing data analytics on the database, the clause is not applicable. Beyond research purposes, the use of (in copyright) materials that are legally accessed is also possible, under the condition that the rights holder does not ‘opt out’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a few choices that Member States could make when bringing this into their national law. In particular, the Italian legislator went beyond the text of the Directive to authorise the possibility to share the outcomes of the research (if expressed through new original works), a welcome addition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, no clarification was provided on what the ‘opt out’ by rights holders should look like. No additional conditions were established on how researchers and others should store the copies they made to conduct text and data mining, nor on the measures by rights holders to ensure the safety and integrity of the networks and databases where the materials mined are hosted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preservation of cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CDSM Directive makes it mandatory for all Member States to put in place an exception to copyright for preservation - the authorisation to make copies of materials that might be in copyright, without the need to ask the rights holder for permission. That is under the condition that they are permanently held in the collections of the cultural heritage institutions, and only to the extent necessary for preservation. These copies can be done in any format or medium, and cannot be limited through a contract.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Italian copyright law now recognises this exception, which represents an improvement from the previous provision on preservation in Italy, which limited the medium to photocopying. There is no clarification on what should be understood by ‘permanently held’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital and cross-border teaching activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The current provisions on teaching activities in the Italian copyright law establish that copyright-protected materials can be used for digital and cross-border teaching activities, without having to pay for them. This cannot be forbidden by contract. So, for example, a teacher could post part of a poem in a school’s online system, to be accessed by students from another country, without needing permission from the rights holder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this is limited to the use of parts of materials, and under the responsibility of an educational establishment, on its premises or at other venues, or through a secure electronic environment accessible only by its pupils or students and teaching staff. This concept is not clarified.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This exception does not apply to material primarily intended for the educational market or to sheet music where a licence needs to be acquired instead. This is as long as these are available on the market for the use of such materials, they cover the needs of the educational establishments and are easily known and accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Out of commerce works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of commerce works are works that are likely in copyright, that sit in the collections of cultural heritage institutions, but are no longer, or were never, available commercially. The Italian copyright law now provides for a system based on a licence and an exception to allow cultural heritage institutions to make out of commerce works available online without the need to ask for (further) permission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to determine what is and isn’t out of commerce, the Italian text establishes that works not available in commercial channels for at least 10 years are presumed to be out of commerce. A reasonable effort to determine that something is out of commerce needs to be conducted in good faith and ‘professional correctness principles’, and through consulting appropriate sources of information. A decree of the Minister of Culture can identify further specific requirements to define out-of-commerce works after consultation with the rights holders, collective management societies and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions can only rely on an exception to copyright when the materials at stake are software or databases, and if no sufficiently representative collective management organisation exists. In such cases, no licence or permission from the rights holder is needed. For all other out of commerce materials, a licence with a collective management organisation needs to be obtained in order to rely on the legal solution of the Directive. This unfortunately goes slightly against the text of the CDSM Directive, which does not limit the exception to software or databases only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The use has to be for non-commercial purposes, and in the case of materials used under the exception, shared via non-commercial websites only. Rights holders can opt their materials out of this system anytime by giving notice to the collective management organisation who issued the licence. In case of harm resulting from a particular use, the right holder has the right to request compensation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Public Domain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Italy, the transposition of the public domain provision is very faithful to the text of the Directive, which establishes that no neighbouring rights for ‘non-original’ photography can be claimed on digitised copies of works of visual arts that are in the public domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Works of visual arts are not defined, but a reference is made to a non-exhaustive list of possible types of works under this category. There is no limitation or reference to the format of the resulting reproduction, nor to the application in time of the rule (whether it has a retroactive effect or not).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is however a clarification that this new provision does not override the provisions in the Italian Cultural Heritage Code. These establish that the reuse for commercial purposes of digital reproduction (both original or faithful) of cultural heritage in the public domain is not possible. For such uses, it is compulsory to pay concession fees calculated by the authority that has them in custody. This represents a barrier to the reuse of public domain material. However, the National Matera Museum recently made a significant step forward by setting the legal fee at zero for a small collection of Etruscan vases. Recently, Senator Margherita Corrado presented a Parliamentary Question considering Matera Museum's decision against the law regarding art. 108, which now awaits response but can set an important precedent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to be the first to hear about these developments, network with peers and learn more about copyright and digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">join the Europeana Copyright Community</a> and follow our CDSM Directive series through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro news</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also read this post in Italian on the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.it/chapterIT/index.php/1392/\">Creative Commons Italia website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The study concluded that only a small number of datasets aggregated by Europeana were available in data.europa.eu. Europeana advocates for the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability), and bringing digital cultural heritage to external platforms is one of the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-and-the-fair-principles-for-research-data\"> ways we can comply with these principles</a>. So, we set about working on providing Europeana’s data resources to data.europa.eu and we are pleased to say that they are now available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EU Datathon 2022</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The publication of our resources on data.europa.eu happens at an opportune moment - just as the <a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-data/news/take-part-eudatathon-2022\">#EUDatathon 2022</a> call for submissions is open. This annual open data competition provides ‘a chance for open data enthusiasts and application developers from around the world to demonstrate the potential of open data, get international visibility for their innovative ideas and compete for their share of the total prize fund of €200,000 and the Public Choice Award.’ This year, the competition also contributes to the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/youth/year-of-youth_en\">European Year of Youth 2022</a> by featuring initiatives dedicated to young people all around Europe.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enter the EU Datathon</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in the EU Datathon, you must submit a proposal that aims to develop an application making use of at least one of the datasets available on data.europa.eu. The deadline is&nbsp; 31 March 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage you to experiment with Europeana’s data resources and to consider entering Challenge 4 in particular - A Europe fit for the digital age. This is related to one of the European Commission’s defined priorities for 2019-2024 and is all about empowering people through a new generation of technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EU Datathon is an excellent opportunity for interdisciplinary teams composed of researchers, university professors and students from Social Sciences and Humanities, and Computer and Information Science, who can combine the potential of digital cultural heritage with that of technology for the benefit of open science and society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Our support&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find out how to use the Europeana data resources and APIs at <a href=\"https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/europeana-aggregated-dataset\">data.europa.eu</a>. And you can get in touch with us for personal support at <a href=\"mailto:api@europeana.eu\">api@europeana.eu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to hear from you if you reuse Europeana resources and you get the chance to be among the finalist teams - you can contact us at <a href=\"mailto:research@europeana.eu\">research@europeana.eu</a>. Good luck!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Shaping the project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In recent months, CRAFTED project partners have been developing a Curational and Public Engagement Plan to inspire a wide variety of audiences to (re)discover the creative potential of crafts heritage and enable artisans to pass on their knowledge to others. The plan maps out the path to making the wealth of materials that will be aggregated and enriched throughout the project available online. Online access across the themes of <em>Fashion and&nbsp;Textiles, Analogue Media</em> and <em>Re-use of Traditional Crafts</em> will offer a unique resource to better understand, preserve and reuse the rich tangible and intangible heritage of European crafts. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Expect a wide variety of blogs, galleries, videos, and exhibitions to be published on the Europeana website in the coming months!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to our editorial plan, we are delighted that the CRAFTED project has a newly developed visual identity, created by Carlos Marcelino from the Europeana Foundation. The identity highlights the effect that artisanship and craft heritage have on the fabric of societies and cultures. The logo focuses on the common threads between tangible and intangible heritage: the fluid lines of hand-made objects, such as jewellery, textiles and garments, reflects the shape of the CRAFTED 'C', that while irregular, converge to the same point, moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Data enrichment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In parallel to the ongoing curatorial work and aggregation of 186,000 newly documented images, videos and 3D content for our galleries, blogs and exhibitions, the automatic enrichment workflow that the project will follow is being prepared. This workflow includes testing and validating a methodology and developing an accompanying set of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for the optimisation of automatic enrichment of large amounts of cultural heritage metadata. The technical partners are working closely with content providers and aggregators to inspect the characteristics of the available metadata to define the desired enrichment use cases and derive the technical requirements that the AI tools to be deployed have to meet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the data inspection process is in an early stage, some technical challenges are already being taken into consideration. The semantic analysis needs to support metadata from different languages and to identify a variety of domain-specific terms (such as material, techniques, types of objects), while at the same time linking to broader large Linked Open Datasets such as Wikidata or Geonames. Similarly, the content analysis tools will have to serve a number of diverse scenarios, from image tagging and colour detection to optical character recognition and speech to text extraction. The complexity of the resulting landscape makes it evident that there is a great need for systematisation and combination of different techniques. The first version of the AI tools is expected to be ready by the summer of 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Showcasing the (un)expected</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The galleries, blogs and exhibitions that are to be rolled out over the course of the project will cover the expected, but also the less obvious topics from the three editorial themes (<em>Fashion and&nbsp;Textiles, Analogue Media </em>and <em>Re-use of Traditional Crafts</em>) covering everything from a behind the scenes look at Dutch television studios to an assortment of beautifully painted easter eggs. Whatever your preference or professional field, there will be an editorial that inspires. The first CRAFTED blog highlights our love for crafts: <em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/blog/lace-a-labour-of-love\">Lace, a Labour of Love</a></em> explores the history and influence of lacecraft throughout the ages. If you can't get enough of lace, you can also peruse two related galleries: showcases of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/set/5174\">Bobbin Lace</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/set/5175\">Needle Lace</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Natural History Museum in London (NHM) has recently digitised its five millionth item; counted over 30 billion downloads of its openly accessible data; and estimated that the digitisation of its entire natural history collections - 80 million items - could lead to research with a value of more than two billion pounds over the next 30 years, representing <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/digitised-five-million-specimens-landmark.html\">a seven to 10 times return on investmen</a>t.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We go behind the scenes with Helen Hardy, Science Digital Programme Manager, to learn more about why they commissioned an impact study, what they’re doing with these findings, its value for natural history and heritage collections across the globe, and what comes next.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Impact, the Natural History Museum and natural science collections - tell us more!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Impact has been part of my thinking at the Natural History Museum, London since I started leading the digitisation programme almost six years ago. My previous career wasn’t in the heritage sector and there are so many things that have surprised me - for example learning, while we digitised lice, about how they co-evolve with their host species - so I have always wanted to share that variety and importance with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like many other natural science institutions, we often use case studies to demonstrate impact. We have also had insights into access and use (downloads, research papers and citations) which has been a great step forward. In most cases, these data are often enough to encourage financial support for digitisation programmes. However in some countries, like the UK, we need to strengthen the business case and our advocacy by demonstrating a potential return on investment and direct impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Work to understand the benefits for the Museum’s planned <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/harwell.html\">science and digitisation centre</a> at Harwell campus, Oxfordshire, again highlighted the potential of digitisation and, when the stars of senior leadership support and financial resources aligned, this impact assessment was the logical next step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did you learn in the process?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the report, we focused on five key areas where digitisation has a strong impact and where we had already strong evidence for our change pathways: biodiversity preservation; medicines discovery; invasive species; agricultural research and&nbsp;development; and mineral exploration. The findings, even though they take a conservative perspective on our total impact, validated what we had long been saying about the value of the open accessibility of digitised natural history collections. It also really reinforced the value of each item in our collection. We were reminded of how important our work is for research and how open publishing (most of our data are published with a CC0 licence) really maximises its impact. As a public collection, we believe strongly in making access to collections data free and open, and now have further evidence that we will maximise impact by doing so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are glad we used external expertise of the consultancy <a href=\"https://www.frontier-economics.com/uk/en/home/\">Frontier Economics</a> to work with us on this modelling and <a href=\"https://riojournal.com/article/78844/\">reporting</a>. We had got as far as we could go internally. They helped us focus on the primary audience for these data, the research community, and the links in our change pathways (as Europeana calls them) where we could find strong evidence for the economic value of collections data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you still want to learn?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some people ask us if this research helps us prioritise what to digitise, or what level to digitise to, but at this stage it’s not granular enough for that - it was focused on understanding the broad impact potential. We have a lot more to explore and while we have no immediate plans for further studies we are keen to continue understanding our research and other users better (for example, what levels of digitisation make data ‘research ready’).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also looking at internal efficiency and effectiveness benefits through increased digitisation and digital processes, for example exploring areas such as digitisation on demand, working toward international initiatives like the Distributed System of Scientific <a href=\"https://www.dissco.eu/\">Collections (DiSSCo)</a>. In time, and as more evidence becomes available, we’d like to broaden the range of impact lenses through which we look at our work and strengthen the pathways that we have created in our Theory of Change. We’d also like to look more closely at whether different degrees of digitisation create different depths of impact, and whether certain impacts are (more) connected to specific items or collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our focus also meant that we didn’t look at impact in other areas outside of the scientific field, like creative and humanities reuse, contribution to climate action, educational value, etc. In some of these areas there was already a good deal of research; in others, it would be harder at present to find a direct path between our digitisation activities and these impact areas. Finally, the impact of the stories our curators create from our collections and which we share with our audiences would be interesting to evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What will you do with what you’ve learned?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This impact study will inform the scoping study currently under way to shape a UK-wide strategy for digitising natural science collections, hopefully leading to continued and increased digitisation funding for all heritage institutions. We’ll use the findings to make the case for support to the government and philanthropic funders, and to feed into other projects that we are part of in Europe and across the world. We really hope that the report will help others make the case institutionally and nationally for the digitisation of their collections, and to inspire further research so that we all contribute towards making the global case for the value of the digitisation of our natural science collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What would you recommend to a smaller organisation that doesn’t have the resources of the Natural History Museum?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For natural science institutions, remember that every specific item is a unique data point and has a role to play in better understanding the distribution of species over time and geography, and what the implications of this are. Every item has value! Similarly, smaller, more niche collections have just as vital a role to play in painting the global (and digital) picture of our planet. For smaller organisations, case studies are an effective way to demonstrate the importance of your collections. The case studies that we have worked on really showed us the lenses through which to look at our impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the methodology we followed is very similar to the Europeana Impact Playbook. It relies mostly on common sense and you can go a long way without needing external help. You can think in practical terms about what is important to measure, what data you have access to, and what case studies you can use to bring your numbers to life. This can all feed into your business case for increased digitisation and support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.mna100.ie/\">Mná100</a> is an online research platform, taking its name from the Irish word for women. It's part of Ireland's 'Decade of Centenaries' programme which remembers events which took place from 1912 to 1923, including World War I, the 1916 Easter Rising, the Irish Struggle for Independence and Irish Civil War. The website was launched in May 2021 by Minister Catherine Martin T.D., to provide a platform for new material related to this seminal period of our history, while also looking at the past to examine contemporary issues as they relate to women and girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It follows on from the Pop-Up Women’s Museum ‘100 Years of Women in Politics and Public Life: 1918 to 2018’ which toured every province of Ireland and utilises the original resources sourced for this award winning project. Due to Covid-19, this resource moved online, ensuring the continuation of the women’s strand during this final stage of the Decade of Centenaries.&nbsp;You can view the virtual tour <a href=\"https://www.mna100.ie/centenary-moments/virtual-tour/\">here.</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Mná100 undertook original research and produced a short film called <a href=\"https://www.mna100.ie/centenary-moments/toward-america/\">Toward America</a>, which looked at women on both sides of the Atlantic who helped raise awareness and funds for the cause of Irish independence. Launched in 2021, in collaboration with New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House, it highlighted areas of new scholarship in archives and universities across the United States. It is our hope that, through Mná 100, we can reach out to the Irish Diaspora who hold information and material relating to this period in Irish history. It is important to tell the story of women and their seminal part in this Decade of Centenaries by continuing to make connections with archives, museums and libraries worldwide who may have Irish material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the website, you will see the ‘100 Year Journey’ that Irish women have taken, documenting the actions of individuals and the collective actions of groups. During this passage of time, there has been a massive sea change - from the early 20th century when women did not have the vote, to now, when women work in important roles in politics, public life, and have leading roles in many Irish State institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Working in partnership</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of this online content has been produced by the Mná100 team in the Commemorations Unit of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media in collaboration with key partners. The website highlights the work of Ireland's national cultural institutions and Historians-in-Residence. We have also worked with the Irish Local Authority Network of Arts Offices who have created community programmes as well as Arts Council’s Awardees and contemporary singer songwriters and balladeers. These partnerships span across the thematic strands of the Decade of Centenaries Programme, including the Historical and Creative Imagination Strands as well as the Community Strand, which is led by the local authority network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engagement with stories online</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope that <a href=\"https://www.mna100.ie/\">Mná100</a>.ie will bring the stories of these women to new audiences through the medium of film, podcast, articles, exhibitions, photo essays and webinars. The website will offer an online primary source to serve as another freely-accessible resource for people of all ages who have an interest in this complex period of commemoration. We have many future projects planned with academics, school children, International Associations, and contemporary women who shaped Irish history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During this Decade of Centenaries, a new version of this period in Modern Irish History is being written; one which is more complex, nuanced and inclusive, facilitated by the primary source material being made freely available online and private collections being made public. Mná100 showcases some of this work.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My background is in music. Even as a child I wanted nothing more than to be a musician and a conductor. So after attending a music academy throughout my youth I started to pursue a career as an orchestra musician at the Brussels conservatory, studying the flute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Somewhere along that journey, though, I got interested more in the stories behind the music than the athleticism of performing. I left the conservatory and switched to musicology studies at KU Leuven, where I stayed on after my graduation to explore philosophy and an advanced Masters in Medieval and Renaissance studies. I then was able to become part of a research group at the university specialising in Renaissance polyphony, and from there became an assistant programmer at a concert hall in Antwerp and then a communication manager for an orchestra. In the meantime, I had become entangled in the mesmerising web that is digital cultural heritage by shifting research groups and joining that of Fred Truyen at CS Digital - a unit specialising in digital humanities in general and policies and practices involving digital collections in particular.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The very first project I was assigned to was <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeanaphotography\">EuropeanaPhotography</a>: an immensely inspiring experience with a consortium consisting of people that today - almost nine years on! - still make up a circle of trusted friends. We’ve also jointly established <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/photoconsortium\">Photoconsortium</a> as an association devoted to promoting photographic heritage, which has become Europeana’s accredited thematic aggregator! I’ve remained active in the musical realm ever since (having established a small business of my own as a journalist-writer) but honestly, have never looked back on that switch of domains, allowing me to explore many more types, themes and styles of storytelling using Europeana and its network as a fabulous premise!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m involved as a digital curator in three projects running in parallel: <a href=\"https://www.citizenheritage.eu/\">CitizenHeritage</a>, an Erasmus+ action dedicated to fostering citizen science practices in cultural heritage with a view to educational applications; <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE</a>, a CEF-project in which we explore intangible as well as minoritised&nbsp;community heritage, enriching and improving metadata, investigating inclusive modes of storytelling, and building capacity with stakeholders; and in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/indices\">inDICEs</a>, a Horizon project where we develop tools, guidelines and recommendations in aid of cultural heritage institutions embarking upon the highway of digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I recently got elected into the Europeana Network Association <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> and became the vice-chair of its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a>. This is one of my greatest adventures so far, and I can hardly wait to see what’s around the corner!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally: as the proposal-writing season is upon us, I’m assisting colleagues and friends in developing concepts and ideas that, hopefully, will bloom into a range of fresh projects to pour our hearts and souls into!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being involved in many different roles and contexts keeps the mind agile and makes the days run like crazy. But there’s a big challenge here as well: how to make sure not to lose track of what really matters to make a project succeed? How to strike that balance between investing time and effort without overcharging yourself? I am a notorious perfectionist, and this sometimes makes it tough for myself (and others…) to deal with the intense work that is often involved with our projects, meeting deadlines and enabling colleagues to proceed with their tasks. What I love: the rush of adrenaline I feel when meeting new people or longtime friends; the endorphins that ooze out when a task is beautifully accomplished; the joy of joint accomplishments when in a project all dots get connected and the pieces of the puzzle form a convincing whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It just felt like a ‘now-or-never’ moment. Previously, I was mainly focusing on acquiring the knowledge, skills and experience to maximize my value as an actor in this sector. When I noticed that in the span of almost a decade I indeed had come to know a big part of the Europeana realm, I wanted to step up and give something back to the community that has given me so much. And finally: my amazing mentor Fred Truyen was stepping down in that very same round of elections. I saw an opportunity to follow into his footsteps and build on his legacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Listen, learn, explore, create and act! I’m not a silent passenger, but a vocal member of this extraordinary community of people who, as diverse as their skill sets may be, are connected through their passions and beliefs. I want to contribute to tightening and expanding our network, support good practices with regards to transparent governance and audience engagement, and explore innovative way to what I would call ‘curate and care’: use Europeana’s stunning treasury of collections to offer support to people, causes and concerns that are (or should be) at the top of everybody’s agenda.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Key challenges</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reflection started with a simple, yet encouraging, recognition: we have come a long way. Tools and platforms have improved so much in the last two years, along with our users’ (teachers’ and students’) confidence on how to engage with digitised historical content. At the same time, the forced acceleration of the digitisation of content demanded by the pandemic exacerbated two key challenges.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First and foremost: the wealth of content that is available online makes it hard for cultural heritage institutes to stand out in the crowd. They have to offer the exact content that teachers and students need, and to know what this content is, they need access to students and teachers. In the pre-pandemic period, this was easy: they could go into the community, travelling to host focus groups / labs / workshops to learn more about their desires and offer tailored services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly: content’s accessibility. Several cultural heritage institutions that we spoke with underlined how the digitisation of content has made it harder to navigate copyright restrictions, which are often exacerbated when it comes to the right to access to content of other countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'I wish we could stop keeping our content in a vault, starting to actively engage with it and share it,' said one of the participants to our focus groups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dreaming big</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After discussing these challenges, we moved on to what was arguably the most fun part of the reflection: dreaming big. We asked ourselves: 'if time and money were not an issue, what would the ideal eLearning Platform look like?' And what great ideas we had! To the group, the ideal eLearning Platform is (among others):</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Designed in collaboration with the end-user</strong> (teachers, students, cultural heritage institutes) to make sure that it is not only easy and fast to use, but also fun to engage with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Trustworthy</strong>, in that it presents content that is of the highest quality, always up-to-date, and that users are sure can be used for educational purposes and shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interactive</strong>, in that it allows for teachers to interact with students, for students to interact with each other, and for cultural heritage institutes to engage with teachers and students to better understand their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-bdef7f89-7fff-6e20-3ec8-5b18de8998de\">Multilingual. </b>It will not come as a surprise that language is one of the biggest challenges faced by the cultural heritage institutes we have spoken with. On the one hand, local cultural heritage institutions lack the funding and capacity to translate their content in other languages. On the other, teachers and students often require content to be made available in their own languages, and thus have trouble accessing international sources. A multilingual platform would help all stakeholders gain better reach and access to content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reflection concluded with a presentation of the eLearning platform <a href=\"http://www.historiana.eu\">Historiana</a>, and specifically of the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners\">partner pages</a> that can be used by cultural heritage institutes to share their own content on it. These allow cultural heritage institutes to upload their own digitised content in the form of curated source collections, as well as to develop eLearning Activities that teachers and students from across Europe can engage with the content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help cultural heritage institutes, EuroClio is currently planning several online ‘co-creation meetings’, where our Content and Teaching and Learning Teams will guide participants through the process of curating high quality source collections based on teachers’ demand, and design engaging eLearning Activities. The co-creation meetings will take place in the late spring, and last through the summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Help us make the partner pages better! </strong>EuroClio is committed to further improve Historiana’s partner pages, based on the suggestions received by cultural heritage institutes. If you have missed the last focus groups, but would like to know more about the partner pages and to let us know more about your own challenges, needs, and dreams, please reach out to Alice Modena at <a href=\"mailto:alice@euroclio.eu\">alice@euroclio.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us at the co-creation meetings! </strong>If you would like to join the co-creation meetings, or to receive more information about them, please reach out to Alice Modena&nbsp;at <a href=\"mailto:alice@euroclio.eu\">alice@euroclio.eu</a>. We are currently defining the format and the programme, and would really like to prepare something that is tailored to your needs, so please, let us know: what would be most beneficial for you? How can we at EuroClio help you further engage with teachers and students? Take part to let us know!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Improved search filters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana website offers access to 51 million cultural heritage items. A popular way to explore them is to use the site’s search and filter options. In the last quarter, we revamped the filters, making it easier for people to refine the search results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Positioning&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First of all, we changed the position of the filters on the search results page to appear on the right-hand side instead of above the search results. We also stacked the filters on top of each other so they’re always visible instead of hiding them behind the ‘more filters’ button, saving people the extra click. We also save people waiting time by applying the filters and returning the search results directly - no need to click ‘Apply’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Item quality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/collections\">collection pages</a>, we introduced a new ‘Item quality’ filter which corresponds to the tier classification making it easier for people to filter by content quality and licence (for more on these tiers, see the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>). So, for example, if you are&nbsp;looking for images of daffodils to share on social media, you might enter ‘daffodil’ in the search bar and get several results. To narrow them down, select ‘Natural History’ in the ‘Theme’ filter and then select ‘Image’ in the ‘Type of media’ filter - the page will immediately update to show only images of daffodils. Then try using&nbsp;the ’Item quality’ filter to refine the results to display only high-quality freely reusable (tier 4) images of daffodils.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Auto-suggest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the next iteration, we will introduce an auto-suggest feature to the filters to help people find the values they want. This is handy for filters with a long list of values, such as&nbsp; ‘Institution,’ especially as only the first 50 values in a list can be shown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newspaper date filter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re looking for <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/collections/topic/18-newspapers\">newspapers</a>, you might have noticed the useful ‘Date issued’ filter. We will shortly be making changes to this filter to make it easier to see the dates for which newspapers are available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><br />\r\nUpdated search result views</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can see results on Europeana in either a grid view or a list view. We’re pleased to say there’s now a third option - mosaic view.&nbsp; Here’s what they do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">The <strong>grid view</strong> shows a medium-sized thumbnail image and basic metadata information such as the item title and providing institution, making it suitable for discovering all sorts of items from across our collection no matter the media type or item quality.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">The <strong>list view</strong> shows the most information about the item itself, the basic metadata information, including the copyright statement and the type of media, but the media thumbnail is small. So, this view is most useful for exploring text or audio items for which the item metadata is more important to its discoverability than the media.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li role=\"presentation\">The <strong>mosaic view</strong> is the most visual. It shows a medium-sized thumbnail without any metadata information, making this view most suited for finding images and videos. This is useful for people&nbsp; selecting an item based on its media instead of its metadata information.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All views allow people to save and like items directly in the search results. The different views offer people the option to browse and search the collections in their preferred way. For example, someone looking for images to use in a school project might prefer the mosaic view. Someone else looking for ‘public domain objects’ might choose the list view.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

These items use imagery or language that can be considered offensive. To notify people when this may be the case, we introduced&nbsp;a content warning that editors can include&nbsp;—giving people the choice to proceed with viewing the editorial.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJolan Wuyts, Collections Editor at Europeana, explains why this message is essential:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">’We want to create editorial stories that show the diversity and breadth of digitised cultural heritage. However, we find that items around specific topics are steeped in colonial, imperialist, racist or otherwise offensive historical practice. For example, while creating a gallery that explores how <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/galleries/black-people-in-european-art\">Black People have been depicted in European Art</a>, we found it challenging to find items that haven't been described using racist terms, othering or orientalising language. So we decided that it was essential to bring this issue to light to fuel conversations about decolonising the metadata information describing cultural heritage items. At the same time, we want to make sure we don't offend anyone who views our editorial. Therefore, we find it important to have and use tools like the content warning to provide important context to those reading our editorial stories.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, our editorial story about <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/blog/sign-languages-giving-voice-to-the-voiceless\">Sign Language - giving voice to the voiceless</a> celebrates the history of sign languages. Unfortunately, some items highlighted in this story use derogatory words to refer to members of the Deaf community. People visiting this story will see the content warning explaining the issue and can continue reading or leave the page.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>About the Data Space for Cultural Heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new European Commission&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/repository/document/2021-46/C_2021_7914_1_EN_annexe_acte_autonome_cp_part1_v3_x3qnsqH6g4B4JabSGBy9UatCRc8_81099.pdf\">Digital Europe Program</a> foresees the creation and deployment of several data spaces, including a Common Data Space for Cultural Heritage. The latter is a new flagship initiative to provide support to the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural sector, and to foster the creation and reuse of content in cultural and creative sectors. It will build on the current Europeana platform and will expand the current functionalities, in particular in relation to 3D digitisation and reuse of digitised cultural resources as well as cross-sector and cross-border cooperation. The initiative will also align with the current <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The work related to the data space for cultural heritage will be implemented through two main work strands. The first work strand will focus on setting up and running the European Common Data Space for Cultural Heritage. The project will build on the current Europeana platform, and can therefore be seen as an extension of the current core service, and link to relevant European, national and regional initiatives and platforms to provide interoperable access to cultural heritage databases all over Europe. This first strand of work will be implemented via a call for tender which is expected to be published soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second work strand will focus on digital capacity building in the cultural sector for its digital transformation and reuse of data, particularly at national level across Member States. This second strand will be implemented through grants and is described in the recently published <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2022/call-fiche_digital-2022-cultural-02_en.pdf\">DIGITAL-2022-CULTURAL-02 call</a> - find more details about how you can apply below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the call</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The aforementioned call will allocate €4 million EUR to project proposals that would run for a maximum of two years and address at least one of the following areas of contribution to the common European data space for cultural heritage:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Enriching Data, Tools and Services in the data space</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Applications should propose ways to enrich the offer of data, tools and services available in the data space, such as access to high quality and high-value datasets, tools, technical knowhow references, knowledge sharing, and other services, with the objective to support digitisation, sustainability and online sharing of digital cultural heritage assets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine-learning</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The call also seeks proposals to use existing Artificial Intelligence and machine-learning systems to improve user-engagement and experience, such as the automatic translation of content or automatic metadata enrichment, improving multilingual aspects, providing adaptive filtering of cultural heritage assets or personalised recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em><strong>Reuse and 3D&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The call is also open to applications with a focus on the reuse of 3D digitised cultural heritage assets in important domains such as education, social sciences and humanities, tourism and the wider cultural and creative sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other call highlights</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The call strongly encourages participation from SMEs by offering a 75% funding rate. Contributions of all other types of participants will be funded by 50%. Furthermore, the call puts a greater emphasis on digital and green. Proposals will be evaluated regarding the extent they would reinforce and secure the digital technology supply chain in the EU and, also, the extent to which they address environmental sustainability and the European Green Deal goals, in terms of direct effects and/or in awareness of environmental effects.&nbsp;Finally, all project results are expected to be integrated into the data space for cultural heritage&nbsp;and thus relate to the Europeana Core Service Platform (more information on the integration <a href=\"https://webcast.ec.europa.eu/virtual-information-day-dep-2-calls\">here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to apply&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in &nbsp;submitting or contributing to proposals, Europeana Foundation might be able to bring you in touch with other network partners as well as contribute directly to your proposal. If you are interested in this, please reach out to Milena Popova (<a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu\">milena.popova@europeana.eu</a>) by the latest 15 April 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All applications must be submitted&nbsp; via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/home\">Funding &amp; Tenders Portal Electronic Submission System</a> by 17 May 2022, 17:00 CEST.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake a look at the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2022/call-fiche_digital-2022-cultural-02_en.pdf\">call text</a> and consult EC <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/support/faq;grantAndTendertype=1;categories=p_submission_eval;programme=null;actions=;keyword=;period=null\">Funding &amp; Tender Portal FAQs</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/digital-europe-programme-2021-2022-data-for-cultural-heritage-faqs\">our list of FAQs</a> for more information.</p>\r\n"

We aim to explore how we can collaboratively build a common data space for cultural heritage and raise voices from across the sector to empower digital transformation and explore the role digital cultural heritage plays in today’s and tomorrow’s world. Building on the success of last year’s virtual conference, we are excited to organise a hybrid event to inspire and inform you whether you can join us in the Netherlands or wherever in the world you will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over 1,000 professionals from around the globe attended Europeana 2021, and we are looking forward to welcoming an exciting mix of cultural heritage practitioners to this year’s event again. We welcome both those new to the sector and Europeana, and a regular at Europeana events to join us and connect with an engaged and innovative audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Call for proposals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to open up our conference to new - as well as familiar - voices and topics and give the stage to exciting formats. Therefore we are inviting you to submit your proposals for an interactive and engaging webinar, workshop, session or intervention to be held during Europeana 2022. Sessions could involve delivering training and building capacity, promoting products and services, showcasing exciting research or providing an opportunity for collaboration. All sessions will be 30 minutes long, and can be delivered live, in person or by video, recorded or presented live online. We’re looking for proposals that cover the following themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Common Data Spaces:</strong> The Europeana Initiative is positioned at the heart of a data space for cultural heritage in the new plans of the European Commission. We want that space to be part of a vibrant digital public sphere where everyone can interact with trustworthy, reliable information and enjoy discussions and interactions which are respectful and free of harassment and exploitation. This idea is very closely linked to the foundations on which Europeana is built and the values we hold. And it’s also closely linked to the European Commission’s New European Bauhaus movement which aims to shape future ways of living that answer the wider challenges we face today. Digital cultural heritage can play an important role in this initiative, and in shaping the heritage of tomorrow. We’re looking for proposals in this area to share and showcase how the digital transformation of our sector contributes to such a thriving public digital space, to sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, and to help ensure that culture is always represented in discussions on the development of policies and programmes linked to digital public spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> Cultural heritage empowers society to embrace its diversity and flourish. We are looking for proposals related to any aspect of diversity and inclusion. This could be around access, reinterpreting or reimagining practices and discourses, or looking at the ways people work and operate individually, within our organisations and as a sector. We are interested in how we can collectively ensure our communities are equitable and everyone feels safe, welcome, represented and equal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Participation and Collaboration:</strong> Participation in and engagement with culture creates value in our sector and society at large. We want everyone to have the opportunity to participate in digital cultural heritage - to access it, to share it, to enjoy it, contribute to it and be enriched by it. We are looking for proposals that help engender participation and cover participatory practices, standards, platforms, tools and more. Collaboration is vital in addressing the cultural heritage sector’s vulnerabilities and challenges. Greater collaborative practices can progress our sector’s digital transformation, which in turn can enable further collaborative opportunities. We’re looking for proposals that support collaborations for a European cultural sector which places digital cultural heritage at the heart of society. We’d love to hear from you if you have imaginative, engaging or new ways to connect people or organisations, build partnerships, engage audiences and network from within or even outside the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Climate Action:</strong> There is a global climate emergency and digital has a carbon footprint too. We’re looking for proposals that support and contribute to the European Green Deal and New European Bauhaus, creating a greener, more sustainable society. We want to hear about innovative and new ways we can work together to tackle and raise awareness of the climate emergency. The proposals could cover individual actions we can all take to ‘green-up’ our practices, or activities that organisations can carry out to proactively make a positive difference. If it covers how we can individually and collectively reduce the impact the digital cultural heritage sector has on climate change, we want to hear from you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Europeana aims to be a powerful platform for storytelling and to enable cultural heritage institutions to transcend cultural and national borders and place their collections in the European context - to be part of the story of Europe. Initiatives such as our <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival\">Digital Storytelling Festival</a> and the Europeana Network Association <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">Task Force on digital storytelling</a> have demonstrated that this is a hot topic in the cultural heritage sector and that professionals are keen to share and develop their own storytelling expertise. We want to hear about your storytelling work - how do you find and tell stories with digital cultural heritage that capture imaginations, and create memorable and meaningful experiences for audiences?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3D, multilinguality and AI:</strong> Europeana 2022 will have a strong focus on topics of relevance to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a>. Tech does not sit alone, and the areas of 3D, multilinguality and AI are not only prominent threads in the common data space but also affect so many of the other aspects we collectively work on. For example, how can AI and 3D help us tell stories and encourage collaboration? What can multilinguality do to help foster an inclusive sector and online experience? Perhaps you have work in this area which can help contribute to the common data space, or you have created something you want the sector to hear about. If it’s related to 3D, multilinguality and AI and digital cultural heritage, send us your proposal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European Year of Youth:</strong> 2022 is the European Year of Youth. At Europeana 2022, we want to celebrate this, and build on the work the Europeana initiative has been doing to support <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">new professionals</a> and collaborate with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/supporting-new-professionals-the-european-students-association-for-cultural-heritage\">ESACH, The European Students' Association for Cultural Heritage</a>. We want to receive proposals that relate to digital cultural heritage and students, young people and those new to working in the sector. If you have ideas on how we can support these groups or facilitate intergenerational exchange within the sector, examples of innovative ways to reach and communicate with young people around cultural heritage, something to showcase from the European Year of Youth, or are a new professional who wants to make a difference to our sector and the societies we live in - we’d love to hear from you.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about your organisation? Why is it named Macedonia?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We - <a href=\"https://www.somosmacedonia.com/\">Macedonia</a> - are a collaborative studio who design strategies and experiences to help social, cultural and educational innovation thrive. We work along with social companies, cultural institutions, universities and public organisations through strategic research, methodology facilitation and community creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since we come from very different backgrounds, we work in fluid, mixed teams for every project. That’s why our name is ‘Macedonia’; this means ‘fruit salad’ in Spanish so, when a new opportunity happens, we choose the custom ingredients to achieve the best taste!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did the Built with Bits project come to life?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to&nbsp;the pandemic, one of our aims was to explore how to hybridise the physical and virtual world in an intelligent way to design ‘in-between’ experiences which could provide value to different communities. We started this research by creating our own cultural and arts virtual centre called <a href=\"https://madrix.space/\">Madrix</a> (Madrid + Matrix) and we joined some digital culture networks, like <a href=\"https://remed.webs.upv.es/\">REMED</a> (Spanish Network for Museums and Digital Strategies).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In one of their events, Isabel Crespo, Business Development Coordinator, Education at Europeana Foundation, asked if someone knew about Mozilla Hubs, as the Europeana Education Community was eager to begin exploring innovative platforms to engage audiences with the New European Bauhaus initiative. As Mozilla hubs is the platform we used for Madrix, the match happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Could you tell us about how the programme worked?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Built with Bits was an eight-week mentoring programme which combined collaborative learning experiences and digital technologies. It was aimed at teachers and educators working with students in secondary education in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. We worked with them to design spaces in Mozilla hubs and explore how virtual experiences can be used within education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme focused not only on building virtual spaces, but also covered topics including user experience, art direction, design and conceptualisation, use of cultural material, types of licences, mediation, gamification and facilitation, concerning virtual spaces through weekly ‘learning pills’. A facilitator from each country gave support to participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>From your perspectives, how did the programme make connections with the values of the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We both have a background in Industrial Design, so the Bauhaus School inspires and motivates us, both from the disruptive point of view it represented at the time - the foundations of professions such as design or architecture - and from the School itself. It sought new ways of combining art and science by rethinking teaching methods through learning by doing, 100 years before it is beginning to be applied again in our classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus movement was therefore the perfect scenario to create this ‘educational sandbox', using Open Source tools, designing, building and mediating virtual spaces that allow teachers and students to engage in new ways of learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the winning entries - we will be hearing more from them in the coming month!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were very pleasantly surprised by the response of the participants and their inventiveness in developing these virtual spaces. There were very different projects, but always with a common link: digital culture. As it was very difficult to choose a winner representing each country, we also awarded some special mentions. In any case, the biggest goal was not to earn a prize but to provide tools, learnings and tips to the teachers so they feel confident to create new experiments beyond the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did you learn from running the programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was our first European project, so we learnt how to manage and coordinate different people from different countries. We had already coordinated other activities and workshops in Spain, but it was also the first time we did such an ambitious programme fully in digital format. It was a good lesson about how to change strategy on the fly, listening constantly to the feedback of the participants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This experience was very inspiring and, taking into account that most of the teachers were not used to dealing with digital tools like these, communication was a key factor. We made a great team with Isabel and the national facilitators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the value of using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, definitely, one of them is to protect patrimony. When we are able to digitise a 19th century vase, we allow people to interact, study or even play with it with no physical damage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In addition to this, something maybe not so evident is to narrow two existing gaps. On one hand, people from rural areas or from different countries may not be able to travel to museums in big cities to interact with their collections. On the other hand, the world is changing and young people are engaged with values, codes and narratives different from past generations. So we have to learn how to reach them and understand together the world (past and future), which using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education can support. We could say that it’s all about democratising cultural access.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have plans for any projects in the context of the European Year of Youth?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are a young studio and our work is essentially made by young people, and many of our projects are aimed at them. For example, <a href=\"https://www.labotica.xyz/\">LaBotica</a> is related to the problem of smaller villages running out of inhabitants in Spain; we have created an observatory to pool ideas, involving young people to redesign their own cultural identity in order to generate new opportunities of value for the people around them. We are continuing to run <a href=\"https://www.disenaton.es/\">Diseñatón</a> (Design Hackathon) and <a href=\"http://futuraton.com/\">Futuratón</a> (Future Hackathon) experiences, mixing interdisciplinary groups to solve systemic challenges. And finally, we have participated in <a href=\"https://hateblockers.es/\">Hateblockers</a>, which is a project that aims to identify and mitigate hate speech on the internet. The project aims to instil critical thinking and empathy among young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can we expect any follow ups to the project in the future?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes! We already intend on a new edition of Built with Bits, so we hope it becomes reality soon. We would also love to celebrate new editions of the project, involving university teachers and other professionals (for example, museum mediators), based in specific regions and the real world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Like so many people around the globe, from March 2020, staff at the Europeana Foundation were forced to work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, we thought this might be for a couple of months, never imagining that our working and private lives would be influenced for such a long period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It soon became apparent that although we were no longer working together in an office, our productivity in general didn’t change, and in some areas even increased. So, we started to look at options to better support our staff to work from home, and explored how we could combine this with working from the office when this was once again possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Five steps to developing our hybrid working vision&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hybrid working empowers people to choose where (and when) they work. It is a hot topic at the moment, with many discussions, articles and expert advice available on how to develop a hybrid working culture, and which shiny new tools to use. But is it really about the tools? At the Europeana Foundation, we think it is about the people. Here’s the approach we’ve taken so far to develop our vision for hybrid working, with some steps that you could follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>1. Form a team</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In May 2021, a working group of colleagues from across the organisation came together with an external consultant with expertise in organisational development to look at some scenarios and identify the values that would underpin our hybrid working culture.&nbsp;Our starting point was that our interaction and not our location should be our driver. Our goal - a healthy hybrid culture that suits the needs of both our colleagues and the organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Decide on your process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We decided on an iterative approach - taking small concrete steps and updating all staff on a regular basis in order to gather their feedback to use in the next round of planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Involve everyone in your organisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An important part of the process was involving colleagues in our thinking, and asking for feedback so that the final vision reflected their ideas and could be supported by everyone. To do this, we used a variety of types of online dialogue and asynchronous collaboration, from virtual ‘all-staff’ meetings to surveys employing appreciative enquiry, giving everyone the chance to get involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Define your driving beliefs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This collaborative and iterative process led us to define the elements we believe will underpin and drive our hybrid working culture. These are: safety, engagement, trust, flexibility and diversity and inclusion.</p>\r\n"

Articulate your vision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next, we translated these beliefs into a vision for a hybrid working culture to suit the Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>We envisage a hybrid working culture where we learn and develop together. A culture that is based on trust and autonomy. Where personal achievement and organisational effectiveness come from balance and flexibility. Where we value time with our colleagues, in person and online, and where practical solutions are in place to support better ways of working.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To put this vision into practice, we now need to make some changes - from updating our policies and rethinking our practices to reconfiguring our office so that when we do need to be together - to meet, work and collaborate - we have a space that works effectively. Of course, we will learn as we go, and develop and adapt when necessary. Our emphasis is on creating a flexible and safe environment - whether that’s in the office, at home or wherever else a staff member decides they’d like to work. We want our employees to know they are trusted and able to make their own choices, based on their own needs, as well as those of their team and the wider organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/working-with-you-and-for-you-in-the-time-of-covid-19\">Find out more about how the Europeana Foundation has been working during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>\r\n"

The project consists of media (photographs and interviews) created by our students that are displayed in 3D models of our school building and assembly hall. All were from 16-year-old students who interviewed key figures of our school's history, digitalised media and created 3D models. This project shows the strong commitment of our school towards learning by doing as the outcomes are the products of our students’ work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

As detailed above, in the first one, the 16-year-old students of Scientific Culture created a digital representation of our school and our assembly hall in order to display all the media they created. In the second phase, which has just begun, the Modern History Teachers will build upon the phase one work to populate it with additional material created in their lessons so that all in all the over 100 students of Grade 11 from our school will participate in the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Can you tell us about your institution?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Institute ‘Capozzi-Galilei’ is located in Valenzano (Municipality of the metropolitan area of ​​Bari) and includes the Kindergarten (Agazzi), the Primary (De Bellis) and Intermediate Secondary School (Capozzi and Galilei). It is a school open to innovation and experimentation, focused on student&nbsp;needs, and aims to put the students and their educational training at the centre of learning, as people and future citizens. We also aim to promote the exchange of skills and experiences among teachers through the combined use of professional and structural resources and ongoing training courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I applied to participate in ‘Built with Bits’ because I felt that it was an opportunity to undertake a new training path for both myself and my students. I had previous experience working with Augmented Reality and Virtual Worlds, but I had never used Mozilla Hubs and Spoke by Mozilla before entering the project, so it was exciting to learn something new.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have never run activities using Europeana resources, so this represented something new for me and my students too. The use of Europeana resources allowed me to treat scientific content with a historical approach, since we searched for ancient anatomic tables.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Tell us about your winning entry, ‘Anatomical Open Air Museum’!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our initial idea was to build a ‘surrealistic’ museum that brought together elements which could not co-exist in reality. We wanted to create an original exhibition, characterised by symmetry,&nbsp;without walls, immersed in the harmony of the famous ‘trulli’ of Unesco World Heritage. The trulli are ancient sustainable buildings located in South Italy&nbsp;that don't require heating and air conditioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The initial idea was developed thanks to the help of the students. I was really interested in&nbsp;a project that was student-centred, collaborative, inclusive, multimedial, manual and multicultural. Anatomy was an opportunity for my students to enhance creativity in creating material models and multimedia products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are satisfied with the final product and virtual space because it responds to the initial idea of ​​an anatomy open-air museum, in which the modern is opposed to the ancient, mathematics to science, individual to collective work. The work, conceived within the framework represented by the New European Bauhaus, is characterised by the integration of different cultures and different media.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you say more about how your project was connected with the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our project perfectly aligns with the thematic axes of New European Bauhaus.&nbsp;It is the result of the students’ collective design and encompasses different disciplines. It bridges science, mathematics, technology, art, civic and digital education, and foreign languages ​​such as English and Chinese. Our project connects with nature, the local culture and environment - particularly given that the ‘trulli’ we took as inspiration are sustainable and use solar energy. The project also focuses on hand craftsmanship and digital innovation. Great attention was given to the inclusion of foreign students and students with special needs, one of the key elements of the New European Bauhaus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The museum that we created as part of the project is an open area which anyone can access to look at ancient drawings from Europeana. In order to create this virtual environment in line with the New European Bauhaus, it was necessary to deepen our understanding through the Europeana website and other resources. If I hadn't done this programme, I would never have known anything about the New European Bauhaus, as I teach Mathematics and Science, so Built with Bits has also greatly enriched my cultural background.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the value of using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education? &nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital cultural heritage allows us to overcome disciplinary separation, for example, encouraging students to consider a scientific topic from different points of view, including artistic and historical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Immersive technologies improve student motivation thanks to the degree of involvement and level of entertainment they offer. They promote discovery and research, encourage active learning and problem solving skills, and offer better digital and scientific skills in a simulated reality. Motivation, enjoyment, inclusion,&nbsp;strengthening self-esteem, especially in children with learning difficulties, are extremely important for their active and productive collaboration and participation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Given that 2022 is the European Year of Youth, have you considered other ways to engage students and young people with your winning project?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our project concerns human systems, which are usually studied in the second class, such as the musculoskeletal system, the respiratory system, the cardiovascular system, the urinary system and&nbsp;the digestive system.&nbsp;I would like to continue working on this project next year. It could be enriched&nbsp;by adding the nervous system and the reproductive systems, so the virtual space would concern the entire human body. In fact, in the current project,&nbsp;there&nbsp;are suspended anatomical elements belonging to these two systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It is an institution that offers education from pre-school to secondary. It consists of 15 educational establishments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{16}\" paraid=\"499018880\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits? &nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{50}\" paraid=\"1123907013\">My main goal&nbsp;when starting the program was to make my multimedia students aware of the area of virtual reality. But, of course, being part of the European education community, with the vision of building an international community of educators, committed to the use of disruptive pedagogical practices to help Europe move towards new ways of thinking, creating and living together in a sustainable way, offered a fantastic and innovative vision in which I could not fail to try to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{90}\" paraid=\"309497094\"><strong>Tell us about your winning entry!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{102}\" paraid=\"1461997116\">It is a huge honour that the project with which I participated in this programme is one of the winners. The title of this project was ‘Historical monuments of Tomar’, and it consisted of making multimedia content related to the various historical monuments of the city available in a Mozilla hubs space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{102}\" paraid=\"1461997116\">This project arose within the framework of the Multimedia Techniques programme, which I teach. It was very easy to capture the attention of students of the course&nbsp;for this theme of virtual reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{d30f43cb-4233-48b7-8950-003a580ba38e}{159}\" paraid=\"2112078249\">However, in the context of Curricular Flexibility, an educational project being implemented at national level in Portugal, we also involved Year 10 students of the Technical Tourism course. When working on content such as local and regional heritage, we suggested that these students could record guided tours of some monuments and later work with Technical Multimedia students to treat and edit these same visits with sound and image editing software. Currently, these guided tours are completed and edited in Portuguese and ready to be added to the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{169}\" paraid=\"357311163\"><strong>How did your project use digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{207}\" paraid=\"2012578326\">This project aligned with the content of the multimedia techniques and technical tourism&nbsp;courses, combining digital and history. As Tomar is a place so rich in history, ranging from the castle of the Knights Templar, to the Tomar Synagogue, it was very interesting and enriching for students from different courses to work collaboratively in the construction of virtual tours of the city's historic monuments, and make these available to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

These resources should be known by teachers and educators because they can and should be shared with their students.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{31}\" paraid=\"1230438006\">I believe that this programme in the context of the European Commission's New European Bauhaus movement was a collaborative learning experience using digital technologies that are enriching, both for teachers and for pupils.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{234}\" paraid=\"1835305217\"><strong>Given that 2022 is the European Year of Youth, have you considered other ways to engage students and young people with your winning project?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{9c9487f2-254b-421f-abfc-0f474b1ce100}{73}\" paraid=\"1080897765\">Yes, of course. In fact, this is a process that I have already started through the virtual visits created by the students in Portuguese, which are being edited in order to add subtitles, currently in Spanish and later in English.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{9c9487f2-254b-421f-abfc-0f474b1ce100}{201}\" paraid=\"1018042198\">In addition, one of my students who participated in the winning project,&nbsp;Patrícia Bandeira from the Technical Multimedia course, liked it so much and was so inspired, that she is currently&nbsp;building her final project - about awareness of internet security - with Mozilla Hubs. This project is also directed to the entire school community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

By combining collaborative learning experiences and digital technologies with the values of accessibility, inclusiveness and sustainability, it helped educators and teachers from various countries and different cultures. In addition to realising that it is possible to connect all these concepts, participants considered it very valuable that they had the opportunity to apply them in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

É um Agrupamento vertical que oferece desde a educação pré-escolar ao ensino secundário. É constituído por 15 estabelecimentos de ensino ou de educação.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{64}\" paraid=\"801165698\"><strong>Por que você se inscreveu para participar do Built with Bits?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{704df6ef-cead-4b7e-93b9-4cbe691f056e}{78}\" paraid=\"1291258935\">Os meus principais objetivos ao iniciar o programa foram sensibilizar os meus alunos de multimédia para a área da realidade virtual. Mas, claro, fazer parte da comunidade europeia de educação com esta visão de construir uma comunidade internacional de educadores empenhados na utilização de práticas pedagógicas disruptivas para ajudar a Europa a avançar para novas formas de pensar, criar e viver em conjunto de forma sustentável é, para mim, uma visão fantástica e inovadora, na qual não poderia deixar de tentar participar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{4c24b0a1-7ad9-45e9-bb94-a03762d5a606}{201}\" paraid=\"1699001948\"><strong>Conte-nos sobre sua entrada vencedora!&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{4c24b0a1-7ad9-45e9-bb94-a03762d5a606}{207}\" paraid=\"575812034\">É para mim uma enorme honra que o projeto com que participei neste programa seja um dos vencedores. O título deste projeto é monumentos históricos de Tomar e consiste em disponibilizar conteúdos multimédia num espaço do Modzilla Hubs relacionados com os vários monumentos históricos desta cidade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{4c24b0a1-7ad9-45e9-bb94-a03762d5a606}{213}\" paraid=\"894871668\">Este projeto surgiu no âmbito dos conteúdos programáticos da disciplina de Técnicas de Multimédia, da qual sou professora. Tendo sido muito fácil cativar a atenção dos meus alunos do curso profissional técnico de multimédia, para este tema da realidade virtual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{4c24b0a1-7ad9-45e9-bb94-a03762d5a606}{219}\" paraid=\"433902591\">No entanto no âmbito da flexibilidade curricular, que é um projeto educativo que está a ser implementado a nível nacional em Portugal, envolvemos também os alunos do décimo ano do curso profissional técnico de turismo que ao trabalhar em conteúdos tais como o património local e regional implicou que estes alunos gravassem visitas guiadas a mais alguns monumentos e posteriormente articulando com os alunos do curso profissional técnico de multimédia, tratassem e editassem estas mesmas visitas com softwares de edição de som e de imagem. Neste momento estas visitas guiadas já estão concluídas e editadas em língua portuguesa e prontas para serem adicionadas ao projeto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{218}\" paraid=\"862036853\"><strong>Como seu projeto usou o patrimônio cultural digital e as tecnologias imersivas?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{224}\" paraid=\"1093316836\">Este projeto está em linha com os conteúdos dos cursos de técnico multimédia e técnico de turismo, combinando digital e história. Como esta cidade, é um lugar tão rico na história que vai desde o castelo dos Cavaleiros Templários, até à Sinagoga de Tomar, é muito interessante e enriquecedor colocar estes estudantes de diferentes cursos a trabalhar colaborativamente na construção de visitas virtuais aos monumentos históricos da cidade, disponibilizando-os à comunidade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{137}\" paraid=\"521236284\"><strong>Como o programa aprofundou sua compreensão da 'New European Bauhaus'?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{143}\" paraid=\"1819138821\">Neste momento, no projeto, temos referência a alguns recursos da New European Bauhaus, tais como os relacionados com o Convento de Cristo que foi classificado como património da humanidade e inscrito na lista do património mundial da UNESCO.&nbsp; Na minha opinião, todos os recursos disponibilizados pela New European Bauhaus, são de enorme interesse educativo, histórico e cultural e, com imensa qualidade. Estes recursos, devem ser conhecidos pelos vários professores e educadores pois podem e devem ser transmitidos aos seus alunos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{0a37a53c-a033-4aac-be13-f24b86ed3312}{157}\" paraid=\"1195380138\">Considero que este programa no âmbito do movimento do New European Bauhaus da Comissão Europeia foi uma experiência de aprendizagem colaborativa recorrendo a tecnologias digitais muito, mas mesmo muito, enriquecedora, quer para os professores, quer para os alunos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{9c9487f2-254b-421f-abfc-0f474b1ce100}{213}\" paraid=\"370382276\"><strong>Dado que 2022 é o Ano Europeu da Juventude, já considerou outras formas de envolver estudantes e jovens no seu projeto vencedor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{9c9487f2-254b-421f-abfc-0f474b1ce100}{219}\" paraid=\"1484376271\">Sim, claro que sim. Aliás, esse é um processo ao qual já dei início, ou seja, as visitas virtuais criadas pelos alunos em língua portuguesa, já estão a ser objeto de edição, no sentido de acrescentar legendas, neste momento em Espanhol e posteriormente em Inglês.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{9c9487f2-254b-421f-abfc-0f474b1ce100}{225}\" paraid=\"790130210\">Para além disto, uma das minhas alunas, a Patrícia Bandeira, do curso profissional Técnico de Multimédia, que também participou no projeto vencedor, gostou tanto e ficou de tal forma inspirada, que neste momento está a construir o seu projeto final com o Mozilla Hubs, cujo tema é a sensibilização para navegar em segurança na internet. Este seu projeto é dirigido, também, a toda a comunidade escolar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 paraeid=\"{bca1a0e3-d368-40f1-b8ea-2cddcebc65b7}{48}\" paraid=\"1929089159\"><strong>Qual foi a coisa mais valiosa que os educadores aprenderam com o programa?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p paraeid=\"{bca1a0e3-d368-40f1-b8ea-2cddcebc65b7}{54}\" paraid=\"1551030294\">Foi muito enriquecedor participar neste programa de mentoria, que ao combinar experiências de aprendizagem colaborativa e tecnologias digitais com os valores de acessibilidade, inclusão e sustentabilidade, ajudou educadores e professores de vários países e com culturas diferentes. Para além de perceberem que é possível interligar todos estes conceitos, consideram muito valioso terem tido a oportunidade de os aplicar na prática.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have always had a great passion for cultural heritage, and participated in work to preserve cultural sites since I was young. I am a graduate of Building and Architecture Engineering and during my studies in Italy and Spain, I became interested in metric survey techniques with digital solutions which added value to architectural heritage. For this reason, I started the path of academic research in the field of geomatics and digital humanities, working in Italy and Japan. During my PhD in Architectural and Landscape Heritage, I experimented with the use of historical archival images for the 3D digital reconstruction of lost monuments using Artificial Intelligence and photogrammetric techniques. I had the chance to use Europeana data, and starting from this experience, I wanted to find out more about the potential of this valuable data, both from a technical and historical perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently working as a researcher participating in different interdisciplinary projects related to the field of digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the one hand, I am exploring&nbsp;ways of using historical archive images for the digital reconstruction of buildings and spaces in our cities that have disappeared or changed over time. This is&nbsp;in order to preserve their historical memory, but also to make citizens actively engage with their city’s history, compile personal memories and photos, and together develop a collective city memory. This is the case of my contribution to the<a href=\"https://www.timemachine.eu/ltm-projects/jena4d/\"> Jena4D project</a> for the browser application for mobile devices with a 4D representation of the entire city of Jena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, I work with archaeologists and museums (<a href=\"https://www.dicea.unipd.it/ricerca/progetti-di-ricerca/hybrid-sustainable-worlds\">Hybrid Sustainable Worlds</a>) to give technical support to the enhancement of archaeological heritage by creating virtual tours, VR and AR apps and 3D models of archaeological artifacts, useful both for the metric studies of the excavations and to show to tourists from every part of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am fully convinced that the use of digital techniques has great potential for the valorisation and conservation of cultural heritage, especially if it is in danger or destroyed, as is evident in recent days due to wars and emergency situations. However, to reach these objectives, in my opinion, there are two challenges to be addressed. The first one is the creation of a dialogue between all the experts of the different disciplines involved in the heritage valorisation process, both humanities and technologies. The second one is concerned with the data on the heritage, the difficulty in finding them and in their accessibility. Luckily Europeana offers a solution to these big themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I fully agree with the vision of Europeana. I have already joined the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech Community</a>, and now I am so excited to be part of Europeana Network Association as a Members Councillor. It will be important to engage with experts from different disciplines and work together with the common goals of data digitisation and accessibility of resources to all. I will certainly contribute to this debate on how to use digital solutions to create inclusion and participation of the local communities raising awareness of the preciousness of their heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Members Councillor I would like to contribute to the Europeana community by bringing innovative ideas concerning the accessibility and visualisation of digital content. I am a great believer in making participation in the digitisation process accessible to everyone through open data and immersive and virtual ways to engage and attract people. Technology is giving a lot of attention to the metaverse and I think Europeana is a very good starting point to take cultural heritage in this direction.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Congratulations on your success in Built with Bits! Can you tell us about your institution?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Iraklia’s Junior High School is a public secondary school in a rural area in Serres, Central Macedonia, Greece. The school community comprises 150 students and 20 teachers. The school was built in the 1960s and started operating as a public school in 1976. Since then, a lot has changed but most importantly, the school’s technological infrastructure. This year the teachers'&nbsp;association, in cooperation with the local authorities, equipped the school with computers, projectors, interactive whiteboards and tablets to help teachers to integrate technology into everyday classroom practice. The Built with Bits program was the ideal opportunity to test the equipment and attempt teaching with technology in real time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have been a member of the Europeana DSI-4 project for two years. My experience has been invaluable and the collaboration with colleagues and the rest of the Europeana teachers, facilitators, ambassadors and organisers has been excellent. The Built with Bits program was something new and innovative and I applied to take part and try it out with my students. I wanted to test my equipment, experience and students’ knowledge and competences in using new technologies in the classroom. I was sure that the program would be a success given my experience so far working with European Schoolnet and Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about your winning entry!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Children’s Games’ is a learning scenario (LS) developed in the framework of the New European&nbsp;Bauhaus – Built with Bits project. The LS combines various teaching approaches such as Artful Thinking, Flipped Classroom and Differentiated Instruction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The LS was inspired by Children’s Games, a painting created by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1560. The painting depicts about 200 children playing more than 80 games, attesting to the inventiveness and creativity of the children in their self-structured play. Children learn not only through the disciplines and traditional schooling but also through play. Playing is an integral part of growing up and of becoming a responsible and respectful adult, a future citizen of the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the LS, students researched games that children played in the past and&nbsp;compared and contrasted them with games they play today, in the schoolyard, neighborhood and streets. They used various online and offline tools to implement the activities, they played the games at the schoolyard, took pictures and recorded videos which they uploaded to the virtual space they had created. Most importantly, they had fun during the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

They want a school that includes an open space that will be shared with the local community, where parents, teachers and students will find inspiration, integration and respect. Inspired by the New European Bauhaus initiative the students created their own virtual ‘edutainment’ space, a kind of tableau vivant of the work of art they studied and researched. Students learned how to create virtual spaces with Mozilla Hubs, and how these virtual activities can be used in experiencing collaborative learning processes. They have created their own digital cultural material that is now accessible to students and teachers from Europe, and beyond, making a real contribution to this initiative for a beautiful and sustainable future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the value of using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education? &nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education gives students the opportunity to experience learning in an innovative way. It helps to&nbsp;develop their foreign language skills through the use of technology for digital outputs which have the potential to become part of the future cultural heritage for the next generations.</p>\r\n"

We are planning to attend an on-site conference that the local Town Hall of our city is hosting on the 15th of May 2022. There, the students are going to present the project, making it visible to the participating stakeholders and authorities. We will also discuss the possibility of adding new rooms to the existing project, engaging different groups of students, which will include the local natural attractions (lake Kerkini, river Strymonas, hot springs of Agkistro), the local architectural heritage (the houses that Venizelos built in the 1930s for the local population), local cultural monuments, dances, songs and stories. Our school is also running two Erasmus+ KA2 projects that will enable us to develop further and promote the program to a bigger audience in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We would love to hear from your students directly - what was the most valuable thing that they learned from the program?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In their opinion the most valuable thing was the collaboration and communication between them and the fun they had during the lessons. They also mentioned the use of digital resources, learning about digital cultural heritage, creative commons and reuse of digital material and how to create their own products and share them with people outside the classroom walls. It was an experience that they would like to repeat in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 2 and 3 December 2021 at ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/discuss-participation-with-digital-heritage-at-an-accompanying-event-of-the-slovenian-presidency\">Driving engagement – participatory approaches to digital cultural heritage</a>’, an event accompanying Slovenia's Presidency of the Council of the European Union, participants and attendees explored how cultural heritage institutions are embracing digital participation and how they are engaging online communities with digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speakers at the event presented a wide range of approaches to participation, from developing content collaboratively within the Wikimedia projects, to driving engagement with open access policy at Nationalmuseum Sweden.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr. Ignacija Fridl Jarc</strong>, State Secretary at the Ministry of Culture of Slovenia, emphasised the importance of digitisation of culture and how it connects Europeans and European societies. Her perspective reinforced the idea that participation is only possible when cultural heritage institutions preserve heritage via digitisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rehana Schwinninger-Ladak</strong>, Head of Unit Interactive Technologies, Digital for Culture and Education, DG CONNECT, stressed the importance of participation in European policies, in the peace, prosperity and stability of Europe, and the drive for engagement in the European project. The European Commission approach to policy making is engaging all stakeholders. Through communication and consultation, the European Commission aims to allow wider public participation in the way policies are shaped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two of the most recent EU initiatives—the New European Bauhaus and The Conference of Europe—have been designed to use participatory approaches as their launchpad. Engagement and participation have been crucial in nurturing the Europeana community of institutions, aggregators, and professionals. Engagement has been instrumental in developing community led standards and frameworks at Europeana. Some of the most important provisions in the European Commission’s Recommendation on the creation of Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage rely on participation and engagement. Comprehensive digital strategies in the Member States will require driving engagement with all cultural heritage constituencies: institutions, networks, cultural and creative industries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and authorities. Aggregators are drivers of engagement to channel the needs of institutions. Further, she stressed that engagement is a two way street where we need the engagement of the institutions to provide content and to engage with them to understand their needs. She also pointed out that multilingualism ensures participation of institutions from across the EU. She underlined an important question: how do we secure participation and engagement at all levels, not only with the public but also with institutions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>George Oates</strong>, Executive Director of the Flickr Foundation, shared her reflections on the legacy and current renewal of Flickr Commons, the digital repository where cultural institutions have been sharing collections since 2008, and how Flickr Foundation is working to reinvigorate historic member organisations and recruit new members–with deep, meaningful connections happening one-on-one. She talked about nurturing communities of special interest, meaningful connections and measuring engagement at scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr. Karin Glasemann</strong>, Deputy Head of Collection at ArkDes, The Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design, talked about turning digital access into visitor engagement at the National Museum Sweden. She described how crucial it is to put content where users are, underscoring empathy and the importance of user research and feedback in the process of gaining participation. She emphasised the importance of ensuring that any tools provided are easy to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jolan Wuyts</strong> from Europeana Foundation and <strong>Dr.&nbsp;Eirini Kaldeli</strong> from the National Technical University of Athens talked about engaging citizens for improving the quality of cultural heritage metadata, and the CRAFTED project on intangible cultural heritage. By creating rich metadata so people can find the information, participation increases. They showed the benefits and challenges of using a tool which combines AI and human intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Giovanna Fontenelle</strong> of the Wikimedia Foundation, an important partner for cultural heritage institutions and host of the fourth most visited website in the world, Wikipedia, focused her comments on the preservation of cultural heritage and sharing it with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Frank Draushke</strong> of Facts and Files, presenting with Europeana Foundation’s<strong> Ad Pollé</strong>, reflected on a decade’s work running public history crowdsourcing campaigns such as Europeana 1914-1918, Europeana 1989, and Europeana Transcribe. They explained how crowdsourcing can play a valuable role in collecting and documenting personal accounts and source materials from European citizens, and how user-sourced content can complement local institutional collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Medhavi Gandhi</strong>, founder of The Heritage Lab, and Europeana Foundation’s <strong>Aleksandra Strzelichowska</strong> highlighted the power of digital storytelling and how it brings people together and inspires them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Virginia Poundstone</strong>, Director of Product and Content at Mhz Curationist, spoke about the non-profit project, a nascent platform for sharing and learning about cultural knowledge. Its goal is to deepen cultural awareness by making content from around the world accessible, equitable, and dynamic, expanding open access. She emphasised how tools must be easy to use, and, when building tools, how important it is to know your user.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr Pavel Car</strong>, The National Museum of Slovenia, presented the experiences of digitalisation of Slovenian cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr. Ines Vodopivec</strong> of the National and University Library of Slovenia described the e-learning tools and materials for education, training and research the Library has employed, including quizzes and online games, paired with online classrooms. Their team has worked toward a nationally integrated Europeana user interface, Sloveniana.&nbsp; She emphasised how digital transformation has been supported through collaboration and partnership from Slovenia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Anne Torreggiani </strong>of The Audience Agency brought real world data to the audience. All of cultural professionals’ work, both analogue and digital, and all the great initiatives in the cultural sector, she suggests, can and should be seen in the wider context of reuse—in media, education, and the like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Susanna Ånäs</strong> of AvoinGLAM, reminded us of the importance of open access to cultural heritage through collaboration, as a catalyst and as an enabler of collaboration, engagement, international frameworks and communities of participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Eric Peters</strong>, Deputy Head of Unit, DG CNECT B2 - Implementation of the Regulatory Framework, shared insights about engagement in the New European Bauhaus (NEB) and its relevance for cultural heritage institutions. He stressed the NEB has engagement— with citizens and communities—at its core. Cultural heritage institutions have a key role in the NEB as physical spaces and as providers for participation, inclusion, transdisciplinarity, and innovative thinking. Ultimately, he said, the NEB will only happen if and when we harness the participation of and co-creation by all actors including our citizens. Culture plays a critical role in nurturing the interest and addressing the needs of citizens to create a greater sense of belonging. The multifaceted involvement of digital cultural heritage and heritage organisations helps engage people and connect communities—linking art, culture, societal changes, across past and future and across disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isabel Crespo</strong>, of the Europeana Foundation, gave the audience a comprehensive view of some of the great work happening to cultivate participation through educational ecosystems. Education is fundamentally important—both to the work taking place at museums and memory institutions—and to bringing the material housed in those institutions to life among students. Digital technologies and the growth of the internet provide amazing opportunities for cultural heritage to create educational participation, to foster engagement together with their audience and with other museums and organisations like Europeana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Maria Drabczyk</strong>, of Centrum Cyfrowe Poland, and EUscreen Foundation, shared her experiences of engaging students through Subtitle-a-thons, where members of the public are invited to create and add subtitles to archival audiovisual clips from European heritage collections. Subtitle-a-thons aim to verify how to integrate multilingual AV digital collections into educational and fun settings and to engage with communities of heritage and language enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The notion of participation of citizens and of professionals is critical to the work of safeguarding and preserving cultural heritage, and ultimately making it findable and usable for subsequent generations. When we think about the common European Data Space for cultural heritage, keeping ‘humans in the loop’ is essential to the Europeana Initiative and directly supports the data space for cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference underscored the importance of community participation, as local cultural heritage institutions are typically best positioned to gather local knowledge and exploit local interest in safeguarding that community’s heritage. Another international heritage organisation, ICCROM published a <a href=\"https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/PCA_Annexe-2.pdf\">guidance document</a> discussing people-centred approaches to heritage management in 2015. Cultural heritage management is recommended to be carried out through a community participation process. While we may, in 2022, with a European set of eyes, assume that local culture and cultural heritage is always supported by local communities, there is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8891959/#bib48\">substantial research</a> comparing non-European countries and emphasising the benefits to local participation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continuing to encourage local collaboration and community involvement in institutions and communities across Europe is essential while also acknowledging the challenges of sustaining that participation over time—especially in the resources required of people, time, and funding. Further, continuing to ensure tools for participation are user-centred and user-friendly/simple remain primary considerations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This event provided Europeana Foundation and our partners and stakeholders with much food for thought. We hope our audience and partners found it just as useful.</p>\r\n"

Can you tell us about your institution?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Institute where I teach is the IC Pimentel Fonseca located in Pontecagnano (near the city of Salerno) in Southern Italy. It is a comprehensive Institute with a Kindergarten, Primary and Secondary Lower school. It is a school with a technological vocation, equipped with 3.0 classrooms (which have flexible spaces and tablets for each student) and digital boards that allow digitally augmented teaching experiments. I am a&nbsp;Technology Teacher at the Secondary Lower School and I teach students aged between 11-13 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an ambassador of <a href=\"http://www.scientix.eu/home\">Scientix</a> I had the opportunity to know and appreciate the Europeana&nbsp;Foundation. When I read about the Built with Bits programme in August 2022, I decided to sign up. Firstly, to have new training (mentoring) on immersive technologies; secondly, for the opportunity to experience a new learning path with my students; and finally to participate in a challenge. The use of immersive technologies, which is now often part of the social life of students, was a strong motivation for involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about your winning entry!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My students were literally overtaken by the emotion of this exceptional victory. For them, participating had already meant winning, as we had managed to complete a structured and complex work. But on the day of the final ceremony, when we had the virtual experience of participating in a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/built-with-bits-final-ceremony-and-winners-announcement\">Europeana event in several languages</a>, and realised that our project ‘Living on my Moon 2021-22 Sustainability 4 Future’ was ‘the best Europeana project’, we exclaimed and rejoiced for this extraordinary experience together with our entire educational community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our learning path concerns future sustainability on the Moon. It is structured for students of middle school (12-13 years old). They imagined future life on the Moon and the correct behaviour for the use of water, air, food and waste in their hypothetical future homes and vehicles. Students compared their knowledge about environmental sustainability on Earth and provided alternatives for the Moon. All students were involved in laboratory activity through design thinking. They worked cooperatively in groups to design sustainable 3D models of lunar cars and homes with online tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project led us to explore&nbsp;the potential of immersive education using Mozilla Hubs, an open source tool designed to create virtual environments useful in collaborative processes (using digital cultural heritage to develop students' imagination). Mozilla Hubs is a learning environment where you can&nbsp;build with elements from countless internal toolboxes but also assemble other resources and 3D models built and remixed at school by students with other tools (Tinkercad, Cospaces, Minecraft, also Airbus and ESA resources). So in this learning scenario, students developed key skills, digital skills, and learned to use the Europeana website to develop content and search for references related to space and its sustainable elements.</p>\r\n"

It allows students to easily access digital resources, making them active participants in the construction of content and digital products thanks to methodologies of collaboration between peers. Today, it has become increasingly important in education to create motivation and interest in our students in order to create the ideal conditions to make them conscious future citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did the programme deepen your understanding of the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Built with Bits allowed us to combine collaborative learning experiences and digital technologies with the values of accessibility, inclusiveness and sustainability inspired by the New European Bauhaus movement promoted by the European Commission. The project has given us the opportunity to expand places and spaces for learning, inside and outside the school. This has made it possible to expand the educational horizon of students with a cultural heritage in digital transformation that urges knowledge, aesthetics and beauty desired as principles for the future. All thanks to immersive, increasingly fluid technologies that have increased pupils' creativity within collaborative experiences.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Congratulations on your success in Built with Bits! Can you tell us about your institution?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I teach Italian, History, Geography and Latin at the IIS Leonardo da Vinci of Lanusei, an institution in the province of Ogliastra which includes all the high schools of Lanusei. It is a very dynamic institution, characterised by the attention paid to developing teaching staff and the enriching training it offers. The institute is also at the forefront of technological innovation and foreign exchange projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you apply to take part in Built with Bits?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My aim was to learn a new teaching tool. Since technologies and virtual worlds are more and more present, it is fundamental that students are not only passive users, but learn to master them.&nbsp;Building a virtual space in line with the principles of the New European Bauhaus has been a great opportunity to learn something totally new and discover Europeana's extraordinary wealth of content. All this in a context of comparison and collaboration with colleagues from other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about your winning entry!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Una nuova vita per La Sughereta', the virtual space I developed with my students, class 1 B Scientific, represents an idea for the redevelopment of La Sughereta, an urban park in Tortolì (Ogliastra). It explores a way to make better use of it and rethink its function through its conversion into an environmental education centre. The centre would welcome schools and visitors, raising awareness of respect for the environment, the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the importance of protecting biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We imagined modifying the existing buildings in the park and putting them to a different use. The Environmental Education Centre consists of a central space (entrance, fountain and info point) from which there is access (via a link) to four different areas: a school with two classrooms where the goals of the 2030 Agenda are explored; a pavilion ‘Water is Life’ on aquatic environments; a pavilion dedicated to biodiversity in the Ogliastra region (with resources from Europeana); and a city farm in which students and visitors can see the farm animals, cultivated and spontaneous plants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did the programme deepen your understanding of the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The program was enlightening because my students and I thought about how to design a virtual space under the principles of the New European Bauhaus. We started by observing the reality in which we live and we imagined how to make it more beautiful, inclusive and sustainable. It was important to think that their ideas can help to imagine and realise a better world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the value of using digital cultural heritage and immersive technologies in education?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Education promoting knowledge and enhancement of cultural heritage and intercultural dialogue, represents, increasingly, a strategic resource for contributing, through digital, to the creation of new ways of sharing knowledge. It also gives meaning to the 'project'&nbsp;of Europe so important for the future of the community. Educating young people in the beauty of art and history is the key to building a future of respect for different cultures and points of view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Given that 2022 is the European Year of Youth, have you considered other ways to engage students and young people with your winning project?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think it would be great to involve other classes of the school and guide them (using peer to peer methodology) in a common civic education path aimed at contributing to our virtual space and integrating it with other projects for the redevelopment of urban areas of our towns. And then, to be able to collect all the projects in a web page themed 'Imagined Cities'. Who knows: it could be a source of inspiration for the administrators of the municipalities in which we live.</p>\r\n"

This made us work together, become more united and introduced us to new things in a productive and funny way.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mirko shared, ‘Thanks to this project I learned how to check and respect copyright when researching images on the internet and to use design programs such as Mozilla Spoke’, and Gabriele and Lorenzo wrote, ‘It was really great to participate in the creation of virtual worlds’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fabiana said, ‘I learned many new things such as identifying copyright-respecting content, collaborating with my classmates, and I deepened my knowledge regarding contents of the 2030 Agenda and the New European Bauhaus. Matteo says,’I gained new information regarding copyright and learned to collaborate even more with my peers. I would like to thank Europeana for giving the opportunity to work on this interesting and original project.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you so much for speaking to us! Tell us a bit about your institution.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Beba</strong>: The National Library of Serbia is the country's national, central, research, and general scientific library. It is the parent library institution for all libraries in Serbia. It is the first institution of culture established by the Serbian state, and this year celebrates 190 years since its foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You have recently run the project Being Woman in the Time of the Pandemic - why was the project started, and what does it aim to achieve?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tamara</strong>: Our library is an active member of the Conference of the European National Librarians (CENL), a significant organisation for national libraries in Europe. CENL reacted promptly to the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges for libraries by opening several funds which aimed&nbsp;to support its members to respond to the new worldwide landscape after 2020. This included a new Hidden Stories Fund in 2021. In this new fund, we saw an opportunity to create some new collections: we knew we wanted to work more on women's issues and were still very affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. So, it was logical to merge the two and to shed the light on women during&nbsp; the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project included four lines of activities: Collection Days (storytelling), web resources, a series of lectures and a blog. We aimed to make a similar event to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-migration-collection-day-belgrade\">Migration Collection Day</a> which we organised in 2018 together with Europeana. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic,&nbsp; this was not possible, so this activity moved online. We collected 25 stories/interviews from various women, together with photos illustrating what was an escape from the reality of COVID&nbsp;in their lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Beba</strong>: We wanted to highlight current gender issues and try to raise the voice of women from hidden to much more visible. This is a pioneering endeavour on this topic in our national library. Of course, the COVID pandemic is of particular importance as a time that exacerbates any pre-existing crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in this work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tamara</strong>: This work is completely powered by digital. The women’s stories are in digital format, together with the objects, as well as the web archive collection. The lectures were recorded and published online with digital tools and technology. All the results of the project were published on the <a href=\"https://nb.rs/en/women-s-practices-in-the-time-of-the-pandemic/\">project web page</a>. The whole project documentation was managed digitally on the cloud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Beba</strong>: I would just like to add that the importance of digital is indisputable even without the pandemic. These times have underlined that digital has become the most visible format nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you celebrate Women’s History Month in your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tamara and Beba</strong>: In the project framework, we held a series of lectures under the title, 'Being Woman in the Time of the Pandemic: Extension of the Domain of the Struggle'. Four women and one man (two university professors, one retired lieutenant colonel, one scholar and one historian) spoke from their point of view about women's experiences during the COVID-19 crisis, pointing out the additional issues they have faced in both battlefields, at work and at home from traditional gender roles. One lecture was dedicated to the role of women in war crises in ancient times to highlight the gender stereotypes and the division of gender roles, but also to help us in better understand the issues we dealt with during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you share with us a woman who inspires you either from history or is still alive and explain why?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tamara</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/the-trailblazer-jelena-dimitrijevic-serbias-first-feminist-author?msclkid=006e0fccb18511ec97dfffddb075e635\">Jelena Dimitrijević</a>, Serbian writer, traveller and feminist was a true trailblazer, quite unique and very different from the majority of women in the 19th century patriarchal Serbian society. I truly admire her courage and life attitude. We used her Poem of Myself, written in New York in 1920, for the graphical identity of this project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Beba</strong>: There are many! One is, Ksenija Atanasijević (1894–1981), the first recognized major female Serbian&nbsp;philosopher, and the first female professor at Belgrade University, where she graduated. During her teaching career, she was a committed feminist both in theory and practice. She was a member of the Serbian Women's League for Peace and Freedom, the Women's Movement Alliance and editor of the first feminist journal in the country <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=7&amp;view=grid&amp;query=%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%82\">Ženski pokret</a>, published from 1920 to 1938. Persecuted by all the regimes she lived in, she remained consistent with herself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice do you have for cultural heritage institutions who would like to acknowledge, surface and highlight women’s history in their own collections?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Beba</strong>: Libraries are especially suitable for highlighting women's history and injustices they have faced. In my experience, librarianship is a mainly female profession and users of library services are predominantly women. There are several examples of how library services and projects have been used for various programs to improve education, economic stability, and advancement for women (such as<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldUUAihYsQM\"> INELI - International Network of Emerging Library Innovators</a>.) Of course, the same could be applied to other cultural institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tamara</strong>: Open your institutions for women, listen to them, record their practices and preserve them as priceless collections for the coming generations. Make digital space for women’s history collections, create editorials, share on social networks to inspire others. Fight for gender equality everyday, but keep the quality first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you Tamara and Beba! You can explore the project Being Woman in the Time of the Pandemic on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nb.rs/en/women-s-practices-in-the-time-of-the-pandemic/\">Library's website.</a></strong></p>\r\n"

Since then, we’ve been actively supporting several of the actions across Europe within our sector, including <a href=\"https://www.sucho.org/\">SUCHO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.4ch-project.eu/\">SUM (4CH)</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, we want to take our active support one step further.

                body: "<h3><strong>The Impact Playbook and the DEN Academy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maaike Verberk has been director of DEN, Dutch Knowledge Institute for Culture &amp; Digital Transformation, since 2018. She was first introduced to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> by Harry Verwayen, a key driver behind Europeana’s Impact Framework and now General Director of Europeana Foundation. He shared Phase one of the Impact Playbook, dedicated to impact design, with her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maaike reflects, 'The Impact Playbook was an eye-opener because it was the first time I saw the concept of impact clearly standardised. Using the Playbook method moves you from being output and metrics-oriented to outcome-oriented. You think in a focused way about the change you want to bring about with and for stakeholders and in society. The Impact Playbook has made thinking about impact understandable and therefore manageable.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enthused, she joined the Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community</a> Steering Group, of which she later became chair. In parallel, within the digital leadership programmes of the <a href=\"https://www.den.nl/den-academie\">DEN Academy</a> for Dutch cultural professionals, Maaike has developed an Impact Awareness workshop format. Using Phase one of the Impact Playbook as a guide, she gives cultural managers an insight into the value of impact for their digital activities and audience development. The format has now been expanded to European heritage leaders in the Europeana-supported <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-requires-strong-leadership-introducing-the-den-academy-leadership-programme-pilot\">DEN Academy Leadership programme</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Impact awareness</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the Impact Awareness workshop, Maaike begins with a short introduction to the Playbook’s methodology and lets the participants practice with the Change Pathway canvas, one of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-one\">Phase one’s key resources</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She says, 'The idea is that they investigate which change they want to bring about with the stakeholder and which activities correspond with that. This invariably leads to surprising insights and results… They often have to cross a threshold because cultural institutions are accustomed to working from the perspective of activity rather than impact. The power of the change pathway canvas lies in the fact that - starting with the digital customer - you first determine what change you want to bring about. Only then do you decide which activity is appropriate… This way, they think beyond the number of subscribers or other quantitative data to the qualitative changes they want to bring about among their stakeholders. The workshop also gives them skills on how they can introduce and take the conversation about impact further in their organisation.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Impact is not only about measurability,' Maaike emphasises,&nbsp;'it’s about a mindset leap’. Maaike recently delivered an Impact Awareness workshop to several small Dutch Caribbean cultural institutions. 'The workshop gave them tools to think more fundamentally about the project-based approach, develop project results in the long term, and reflect on what they want to accomplish in a network. The method, therefore, also works for smaller, more project-driven organisations. I found it very powerful and received many positive responses afterwards.' <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/705304657\">Watch the closing session from this event.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Social relevance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of the workshop, Maaike regularly receives the question&nbsp;‘How can we measure impact?'&nbsp;Despite the publication of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-two\">Phase two of the Impact Playbook</a>, dedicated to impact measurement, she feels that, 'this is an area where we need a lot of capacity building. Impact measurement is still mainly anecdotal amongst cultural organisations.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The Dutch Arts council is currently investigating how more impact-related funding conditions can be developed. I hope - above all - that cultural institutions will embrace impact as part of their mission to be socially relevant. At DEN, we will also be using it more. For example, by asking questions about impact in advance when addressing a new issue. What change do we want to bring about and what activities are associated with that? You give your colleagues a valuable tool that contributes to internal awareness and a stronger <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-three\">impact narrative</a>. This will enable them to think about – and initiate - changes in the medium or long term.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Collaborating with Europeana since 2021, there have been two <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-requires-strong-leadership-introducing-the-den-academy-leadership-programme-pilot\">DEN Academy Leadership programme</a>s for managers of European cultural heritage organisations with short but intense Impact Awareness modules. 'During those one and a half hours, I see pennies drop,' she observes. 'At the same time, creating awareness is work in progress, for even in the Europeana Network Association, the power of impact methodology is not yet known by many.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Maaike, the value of the impact method is how it puts the digital cultural audience at the centre of digital transformation. 'Through impact, we as a cultural sector show that we matter. After all, we use public funding and have an essential role in society. Wonderful artistic work from the past and present touches people and sets them in motion. Successful impact assessment makes this foundation of our value in society visible.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested in learning more?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.den.nl/den-academie\"><strong>Find out about the DEN Academy&nbsp;</strong></a>and&nbsp;<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-8d1fc755-7fff-832a-eb0d-16f3edd5b0b8\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">download the Europeana Impact Playbook and&nbsp;resources to support Impact practice. </a></b></p>\r\n"

This international creative content brings people and cultural heritage together, encouraging everyone to create and share stories with openly licensed digital heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the Festival kicks off with our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/digital-storytelling-festival-opening-gala\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Gala on 10-11 May</a>, which is free to attend and includes interactive workshops and inspiring stories and storytellers from across the globe - you won’t want to miss it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>UPDATE: July 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Digital Storytelling Festival Opening Gala 2022&nbsp; is over and is now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/digital-storytelling-festival-opening-gala\">available to watch online</a>. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can you do at the Opening Gala?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hone your creative skills. Take part in workshops on creative writing, GIF-making, and Mediveal meme-making, and put our ‘7 digital storytelling tips’ into action. Medhavi Gandhi and Doug McCarthy’s guided tour of their favourite online resources will give you plenty of content to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hear from expert storytellers. Thomas Böhm &amp; Goethe Institute share ‘Time to Listen’, a collection of stories from all genres of art, from all over the world. Storytellers from KU Leuven tell us how and why they created a digital exhibition about ‘The Pill’. And find out how art, storytelling and education go hand in hand at the Hunt Museum and the Slovak National Gallery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Discover exciting organisations to follow. Find out how DailyArt Magazine, Splainer and Curationist use storytelling to engage their audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And a ‘Pecha-Kucha’ session will present a multitude of lightning talks to inspire and motivate!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the Opening Gala, we’ll open up the contest - there’ll be prizes for the best stories, as voted by Festival goers and a professional jury.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

So, to support the European Year of Youth, we have dedicated prizes for young people aged up to 25 in both the creative editorial and social media categories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be inspired by last year’s winners</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you joined last year’s Festival, you already know that it featured <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/discover-the-winners-of-the-1st-digital-storytelling-festival-b2d5b5c49561\">incredible stories</a> from around the world. We’ll be talking to some of the winners during the Opening Gala.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carola Carlino’s ‘<a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/story-of-cats-who-became-mummies-8163e1815e93\">Story of cats who became mummies</a>’ won the People’s Choice Award, using a text-based story interwoven with interactive images to take us on a journey to the ‘golden sandy lands of ancient Egypt’ in the first century BC and the rituals around the mummification of animals - and particularly cats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nick J Cave entertained and impressed in the Social Media category by <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/animating-old-morphing-pictures-28df9ef76090\">animating a series of images from the 1860s using GIFs</a>. Nick took a series of pictures showing changing states, like a man becoming a butterfly and animated them. ‘I think the results really bring to life the subtle changes between each picture as they loop continuously, moving from one state to another’, Nick told us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How we conducted our research&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To gain an overview of the Europeana Foundation’s carbon use in 2020, we investigated our footprint from our entire value chain. This included our digital services and our corporate operations: working from home and at the office, and our business travel. In cases where that data wasn’t available, we relied on secondary sources, including industry averages. Some exclusions due to lack of data included staff’s daily commutes, manufacturing or disposal of computer devices, and overnight stays during business trips.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our footprint</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From our work, we estimated that the Europeana Foundation’s carbon footprint in 2020 was&nbsp;87,300 kg CO2e. In everyday terms, according to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator#results\">United States Environmental Protection Agency calculator,</a>&nbsp; our total 2020 carbon footprint is equivalent to the energy use of 11 homes for one year, the consumption of 202 barrels of oil, or charging 10,619,403 smartphones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were encouraged to see that through use of renewable energy sources, we avoided around 65,000 kg CO2e of emissions and we compensated around 1,460 kg worth of CO2e through carbon offsetting. Thanks to the renewable electricity used at our offices in The Hague and by one of our hosting providers, our total footprint in 2020 is 69% lower compared to the baseline year 2018, but higher than the rough estimate for 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We found that the largest contributors to our 2020 carbon footprint were computer servers hosted by our other hosting providers and the workspace heating. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the footprint of business travel was low in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We also discovered that on average, working from home leads to net increases in emissions because less renewable electricity is used at home. This varies per employee. Generally less commuting reduces the footprint, but most of Europeana Foundation’s employees use public transport. We also found that expanding our digital services leads to a higher footprint. As a result, we should encourage all our providers to switch to clean, renewable energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Learnings for us - and you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reducing or stopping a carbon producing activity is the best approach to reducing a carbon footprint. However, this is not always feasible due to some of these activities being essential in the core of our work/operation - for example, digital services and travelling in a network organisation. Our next best option is then to explore alternative ways to reduce carbon emissions and energy use. We do this through:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Switching to clean and renewable energy</strong>. This makes a big difference to our carbon footprint. We encourage all our partners and providers to do so too.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Travelling less and only when necessary</strong>. There’s no way around it: travel has a big environmental impact. With the shift to digital conferences, webinars and online meetings, travelling is less indispensable. When travelling is necessary, we note that travelling by train has substantially lower footprint than flying, so we fly only if essential. We check carbon emissions when booking travel and we offset our journeys. We also promote other environmentally friendly travel practices such as using public transport, eating local and staying at eco friendly hotels.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Limiting the footprint of digital assets and services</strong> by sensible choices made during conceptualisation and development of a digital system, and by maintaining them efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Organising in-person, hybrid and online events</strong> and conferences with the environmental impact in mind. In a physical event, we aim to do this through a strategic choice of venue and the catering - local, seasonal, vegan and vegetarian - or other services. We go paperless and use digital media, and strive to ensure we have strong eco-friendly messaging surrounding our event so it’s clear how important it is to us and to our network.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Raising awareness</strong>, sharing what we learn along the way, and promoting sustainable, environment and climate friendly practices in our networks. For example, several Europeana colleagues have adopted travel by train practice after becoming aware of the air travel footprint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When energy reduction or switching to renewable energy is not possible, we consider carbon offsetting. Europeana has been offsetting part of its business travel in the past. In 2022 and onwards Europeana will offset all business trips.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will continually refine our carbon footprint investigation model to offer a more accurate and transparent assessment of our footprint. Exploring measures to reduce our impact is an ongoing process. As we learn more, we will revise our roadmap to incorporate new information, new findings, new approaches and new actions. And we continue to ask ourselves how we can reduce our impact on climate and environment, and make our work an even greater force for good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in exchanging knowledge, approaches and good practice related to climate action and the digital cultural heritage sector, you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community\">join the Europeana Climate Action Community.</a>&nbsp;You can also download and read the full report into our 2020 carbon footprint&nbsp;below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the project&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/\">Quarantine Archives project</a> was born in Belgium in the spring of 2020, following the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project aims to make archivists and citizens aware of the importance of preserving the traces of this particular period, not only to give tomorrow's historians the necessary sources to understand this crisis, but also to provide tools for archivists to better manage such a crisis in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project’s online platform was launched on 14 April 2020 thanks to a partnership between the French-speaking (AAFB) and Dutch-speaking (VVBAD) associations of the Belgian archival sector. Within a few weeks, more than twenty archive institutions in the country had joined the project: they launched calls for collections throughout the country and received pictures, drawings, texts, masks, and other initiatives from citizens, which were archived for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform connects citizens and archivists to be able to collect more content, as well as highlighting related initiatives and research. Unsuspected at the beginning, the project even seemed to offer a therapeutic valve to citizens shaken by the crisis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community and networking</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Belgian archivist community did not stop at the creation of the platform, quickly realising that a large part of the material it was collecting was produced online, especially on social networks where many initiatives of solidarity or diaries flourished. The Quarantine Archives platform also became a place to share experiences regarding web and social network archiving. More experienced archivists <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/2020/04/13/sites-web-blog-et-reseaux-sociaux-quelques-solutions-pour-archiver-le-web/\">offer tutorials</a>, others share <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/2020/07/02/archiver-le-web-en-confinement-le-temoignage-de-centres-et-services-darchives/\">their own experiences</a>. In order to highlight their work, participating archivists also launched a podcast <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/podcasts/\">‘Vis ma vie d'archiviste confiné-e’</a> on the platform, exploring how this crisis had changed their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These initiatives have raised a number of discussions and questions: if we don't archive these online journals, are we leaving it to big tech companies to do so? The crisis questiond&nbsp;the role of archivists;&nbsp;from ‘collectors’ of documents, some of them become ‘creators’ of&nbsp;documents, for example by collecting <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/2021/04/21/la-fgtb-pendant-le-premier-confinement-une-collecte-de-temoignages-oraux-initiees-par-lihoes/\">oral testimonies</a> from trade union leaders, cemetery managers&nbsp;or mask seamstresses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Exhibitions and content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to a <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/fr/2021/12/15/archives-de-quarantaine-le-bilan-pres-de-3-000-documents-recoltes-aupres-du-public/\">first provisional assessment</a> in December 2021, the Quarantine Archives&nbsp; project has collected more than 3,000 documents throughout Belgium. Most of the documents collected are digital and were collected around the first lockdown - there was less enthusiasm during further lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To promote the Quarantine Archives, in March 2022, two years after the first lockdown, the AAFB published a <a href=\"https://archivesquarantainearchief.be/expoaqa/s/expovirtuelle/page/expovirtuelle\">virtual exhibition</a>. It gathers about 40 documents collected during the crisis (photos, videos, audio testimonies, web archives, Facebook pages),&nbsp; selected by archivists and accompanied by their testimonies. This exhibition is aimed both at archivists but also at citizens in order to promote and share details about the archivist profession and to make them aware of the issue of their own archives. One participant in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPd_ez5r5Ys\">virtual opening of the exhibition</a> said, ‘It is really a great initiative to archive what citizens have done [during this crisis] and to present the profession of archivist.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over two years, the Quarantine Archives platform has played a unifying role in the Belgian archival sector. It has pooled the efforts of archivists to document the crisis, created links between professionals, brought many out of their isolation and raised awareness of their mission. Based on this first experience, the AAFB is now raising awareness among archivists and citizens to preserve&nbsp; the traces of other crises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the creation of Quarantine Archives has brought to light a need for Belgian French-speaking&nbsp; archives: the creation of a common virtual space gathering the individuals and structures that preserve the traces of what makes our society. In the long term, the Quarantine Archives project is intended to become a broader web tool, centralising and federating the cross-cutting issue of archives in society;&nbsp;a common point of entry for the researcher, the citizen and the archivist. The AAFB intends to continue its awareness of the importance of documenting our society for future generations, with a concern for&nbsp; heritage but also for democracy. The pooling will therefore continue, for the preservation of the&nbsp; memory of Belgium and the memory of the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Inspiring stories</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Women's History Month in 2022, 20 new stories were published on the Europeana website, in addition to the previously published editorials we promoted. In blogs, exhibitions and galleries, we told women's stories from the middle ages to the 20th century, featuring artists and performers, fashion, folk and craft as well as politicians and campaigners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working with partners based around Europe provided great opportunities to uncover new stories about women throughout the continent and beyond. Curated and created by six students at KU Leuven in Belgium, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/the-pill\">the Pill exhibition</a>, telling the story of the birth control pill as a societal game changer in the twentieth century, was a highlight of the 2022 season.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another example was a blog linking fashion and feminism by Laura Fiesoli from the Museo dil Tesutto di Prato and Marta Franceschini from the European Fashion Heritage Association, who worked together to create and publish '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/women-crafting-freedom\">women crafting freedom</a>'. They put a spotlight on a remarkable collection of fabrics and textiles called the Antonia Suardi collection, unveiling how embroidery was used as a way for women to show independence, creativity, and partake in social discourse. The piece fits in the current <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted\">Crafted project</a>, which fosters the artisanship and intangible histories behind different kinds of craft work, and offers an example of editorial which explores histories that lie on the intersections between intangible heritage, women's history, and fashion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were also excited to be able to publish further guest editorials from institutions including CRDI Ajuntament de Girona, ERT Archives, the Forum Hungaricum, Canisius College in New York (from Johanna Fisher, Professor of English and Women Studies, Co-director Women and Gender Studies), Khalili Collections, Kulturpool, Museo de Historia de Madrid and Museo del Tessuto di Prato. You can explore the editorials on our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Learning from institutions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alongside stories on the Europeana website, on Europeana Pro we spoke to different projects and cultural heritage institutions to find out more about how they are highlighting women's history. In <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/womens-history-month-2022\">these pieces</a>, we heard lots about how cultural heritage institutions can work to highlight women’s stories in their own collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thea Aarbakke, Academic Director and curator of The Norwegian Women's Museum reflected on the importance of looking at known objects in a new light in order to highlight women’s contributions. She writes, ‘Women’s history is everywhere! But sometimes we have to ask new questions of the collection and museum objects to find it. For example, there can be more women’s history related to the use of objects, instead of their production, which is more often related to men. If the museum presents object stories about both use and production the collections become richer and more interesting.’ <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/marking-women-s-history-month-with-the-women-s-museum-of-norway\">Read more</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sinéad McCoole, Curator of Mná100 project which documents women in Irish history 100 years ago, reflected on the importance of making connections between women’s global history. ‘It is important to tell the story of women and their seminal part in this Decade of Centenaries by continuing to make connections with archives, museums and libraries worldwide who may have Irish material.’ <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/marking-irish-women-s-history-with-website-mna100\">Read more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And more recently, the organisers of the ‘Being Women in the Time of Pandemic’ project at the National Library of Serbia have spoken of the importance of working to embed women’s history in narratives around collections, with Tamara Butigan advocating, ‘Open your institutions for women, listen to them, record their practices and preserve them as priceless collections for the coming generations. Make digital space for women’s history collections, create editorials, share on social networks to inspire others.’ <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/exploring-serbian-women-s-voices-from-the-pandemic-through-cultural-heritage\">Read more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to continue to share inspiring stories from women’s history, now is the perfect time to get involved in Europeana’s Digital Storytelling Festival. <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/creative-competition-e0e68aade270\">Find out how to take part and submit your story to the competition</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need some ideas, explore the inspiring stories already available on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Europeana’s Women’s History page</a> and use the <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/resources/home\">storytelling resources from the Digital Storytelling Festival</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Education within the ARMA project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages-arma\">ARMA project</a>, running until August 2022, aims to show how medieval reading culture evolved and became a fundamental aspect of European culture. So far, the project has seen around 28,000 items created between the years c.500 and c.1550 (medieval manuscripts, early printed books, coins and other objects) made available through the Europeana website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the project’s goals is to show the education community the importance of books and reading in medieval culture. Partners have improved access, use and annotation of these objects via IIIF and created digital educational tools by curating content, writing editorials, producing a video series and designing learning scenarios. The project has taken an innovative approach to co-creating content by working directly with educators at non-formal institutions and with teachers, lecturers and students at schools and universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Three partners of the ARMA consortium were involved in the development of these materials for post-secondary education. They tell us more about how they worked to share the materiality of medieval digital objects and bring them to life for students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Leiden University Libraries: an engaging video series</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leiden University’s manuscripts curator André Bouwman and ARMA officer Erik-Jan Dros describe what they did with manuscripts of the University library: ‘We made <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/activities/learning/postsecondary-education/video-series\">a video series in collaboration with Dr Irene O’Daly</a> (Book and Digital Media Studies, Leiden University). She teaches her students about the contents and materiality of medieval manuscript books. With the series, we aim to introduce new audiences to the distant but fascinating world of the medieval manuscript book. In eight short videos, recorded in the Library’s Special Collections Reading Room, O’Daly presents the materiality of the codex from different angles, such as script, lay-out, traces of scribes and users.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The videos help the viewer to experience part of the materiality of the manuscript book, such as form, size, but also sound, which is mostly lost in the traditional digitised form. We have incorporated some high-quality scans in the videos to show details that O’Daly discusses. In addition, every book she shows is made available as a digital facsimile by Leiden University Libraries on Europeana. This makes it possible to browse and view the manuscripts yourself, after watching the videos, for as long as you like, with ample opportunity to zoom in on details of your choice.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Each video introduces one aspect of the materiality of the medieval manuscript book. With a maximum length of five - six minutes, they are ideal to watch in the classroom or at home by the students in preparation for a class.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin: blogs and learning scenarios</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eef Overgaauw, manuscripts curator, and&nbsp;Markus Greulich, ARMA officer at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, have contributed to the educational resources of the ARMA project with educational blogs and learning scenarios. ‘We edited several blogs like the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/how-corbie-abbeys-medieval-manuscripts-connect-to-todays-fonts\">Corbie Abbey and today’s font</a> on Europeana that address both a wider audience and students in the field of higher education.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘These blogs are also connected to learning scenarios we created for BA students. These include <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yxHvdwFBLke6XVCVqVsd4hV9nfCaXC7v/view\">Book inventories (and what they tell us about reading in monasteries): The 11th century book inventory of Corbie</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWk2VghIVr9ZSCNTpWFQR4Cb8lnBt47f/view\">Discovering online-resources (as well as ancient authors) through medieval manuscripts from Corbie Abbey</a>. These scenarios highlight the importance of ancient and late antique authors for medieval monastic reading culture and teach students how to use a variety of online resources on ancient authors and texts.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘All the ARMA learning scenarios use the templates of the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana</a> blog to enable an easy integration into the Europeana educational network. The ARMA project partners are optimistic that a section for post-secondary education will soon complete the excellent website that is used by teachers and educators all over Europe.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bibliothèque nationale de France: worksheets, learning scenarios and tutorials</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On behalf of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Isabelle Breuil and Paloma Pucci created innovative educational resources for the ARMA project. ‘They are very much in line with recent projects developed at the BnF. Our two post-secondary learning scenarios, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IqWYbGeslVmr4WYS9BiRhTu9-W86bRpO/view\">Manufacturing Manuscripts</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdAidPUnUN8FWGhEcsoG7gApcm-tiAcs/view\">Manufacturing the Printed Book </a>explore the production of mediaeval manuscripts and printed books in the hopes of bringing these wonderful objects to life.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">`We were inspired by Markus Greulich, ARMA officer of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, to adopt the inverted classroom approach, and decided to produce interactive worksheets, one for the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/189Mrngp7RRkdrgbIgA4RX7vL0r4s6QYE/view\">Manufacturing Medieval Manuscripts</a> lesson and another for <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14i5nE71uWwEe26G7rshQPOU6Hz7P39KF/view\">Manufacturing the Printed Book</a>. These give detailed information, with image close-ups and links to digitised manuscripts so that students can easily access and explore them from home. We were also very happy to be able to integrate the Leiden videos into our worksheet on medieval manuscript production, incorporating links to the videos in key places where students can benefit from seeing the manuscripts being handled.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Our third learning scenario, Reading Medieval Coins, is aimed at primary level students. Inspired by our partners at Hunt Museum, we decided to incorporate an <a href=\"https://view.genial.ly/62790db7b3a0850017a69b7a/presentation-my-copy-reading-medieval-coins-english\">interactive online tutorial</a> with a role-play activity in class to help kids explore how reading in the Middle Ages could occur in everyday objects such as coins. These learning scenarios are available in French as well as German.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use these resources</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The video series, educational blogs, learning scenarios and galleries created for the ARMA project have been integrated into <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/post-secondary\">Europeana Classroom</a> and are also available on the<a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/activities/learning\"> ARMA website</a>. If you work in post-secondary education, we encourage you to explore them today. And if you don’t:&nbsp; look out for our next post about the work the project did for primary and secondary education! &nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carola Carlino</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a researcher with a strong interest in multimedia and digital storytelling experiences of cultural heritage, I am especially interested in those communicative practices based on participation and inclusion of people related to cultural heritage itself. For this reason, the example of digital storytelling that I like the most is the <a href=\"https://memexproject.eu/en/\">Memex</a> (Memories Experience) project that took place in the <a href=\"https://reggiadicaserta.cultura.gov.it/progetto-storytelling-digitale-memex-memories-experience/\">Royal Palace of Caserta </a>(Italy). The project involved six people over 60, who subscribed to the site and who created digital stories based on the relationship they had consolidated over many years with the cultural site, as visitors and inhabitants of the territory. The stories were published on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/reggiadicaserta\">Royal Palace of Caserta's YouTube channel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Georgia Evans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of my favourite places to go for digital storytelling is <a href=\"https://thingsthattalk.net/en\">Things that Talk</a>, an initiative of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Leiden. I particularly like the way that they tell the story of <a href=\"https://thingsthattalk.net/en/t/ttt:Tuvsqj\">The Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>. It’s such a well-known painting but by focusing on specific details like her clothing, and helping us to navigate from the ‘brushstrokes of her creation’ to her appearance even in airports, readers are encouraged to go on a journey with the painting through the ages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ad Pollé</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I see the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/sport\">Europana Sport</a> initiative as a great example of digital storytelling. The collection provides a wealth of sports stories from all over Europe and about all sorts of sports. There are hundreds of unique personal memories, such as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/256/contributions_df97dc60_e4b5_0139_9b0a_6eee0af4f399\">the tribute to Helena Marusarzówna</a>, a Polish skiing and WW2 resistance heroine, or a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/256/contributions_5c5a5ae0_e9d0_0138_e4ad_6eee0af5522d\">hockey practice in the 1920s</a> to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/256/contributions_3c8bad00_f3b7_0139_147a_6eee0af62a51\">the societal relevance of a fishing club during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>. There are also many beautiful and fascinating blogs about sporting legends and events,&nbsp; sometimes well known, sometimes hidden, for example the story about how Catalan surrealist painter<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/how-salvador-dali-supported-a-girona-rugby-team\"> Salvador Dalí supported a rugby team</a>, or the one about how Italian long distance runner <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/how-dorando-pietri-lost-the-1908-olympic-marathon-gold-medal?mode=preview\">Dorando Pietri lost the 1908 Olympic marathon gold medal</a>. The<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/seven-tips-for-digital-storytelling\"> seven tips for digital storytelling</a> may not have been used in all of these stories, but they certainly bear witness of the love of sharing personal experiences and hidden knowledge that truly inspires.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cristina Roiu</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a librarian, when it comes to storytelling I always think of IFLA's Sustainable development goals stories’ (SDG) Platform. <a href=\"https://librarymap.ifla.org/stories\">SDG stories</a> demonstrate how libraries and access to information contribute to improved outcomes across all the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and in doing so they are using all sorts of storytelling techniques. One of my favourite stories is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://librarymap.ifla.org/stories/Ukraine/LIBRARY%E2%80%99S-FAIRYTALE-TRAM-PROJECT-INCREASES-READING-ENGAGEMENT-AND-CONTRIBUTES-TO-CHILDHOOD-DEVELOPMENT/159\">Fairytale Tram</a>&nbsp; - a reading programme for children aged 3 - 10 years old, developed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chl.kiev.ua/\">National Library of Ukraine for Children</a>. Imagination, creativity, modern technical tools and good performing skills are all building a magical world for both adults and children.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Peter Soemers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As an art lover, I enjoy the editorials in the weekly newsletter ‘See all this’ (in Dutch) by chief editor Nicole Ex. In particular, I love&nbsp;the concise stories in which she reports and elaborates on the experiences of the refugees from Ukraine staying in her house. A few sentences are enough to evoke the special atmosphere and the brave strength from the two mothers and their children. Enjoy the <a href=\"https://newsletter.seeallthis.com/breaking-101/\">arrival</a> (illustrated by one of the children’s drawings of Nicole’s dog), the <a href=\"https://newsletter.seeallthis.com/breaking-105/\">inspirational behaviour</a> they show and evoke, their <a href=\"https://newsletter.seeallthis.com/breaking-107/\">pride and resilience</a> in difficult circumstances. This is exciting storytelling!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Thank you for sharing inVISIBLEwomen with us! Can you tell us a bit more about the initiative?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">inVISIBLEwomen is a campaign for gender equality in civic statues in the UK; a meeting place for supporters of&nbsp;greater representation of real women - not just symbolic ‘nymphs’ and ‘angels’ - in our parks, town centres and city streets, and for sharing ways that can be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s needed because the figures we are asked to ‘look up to’, both literally and figuratively, in our civic spaces have an influence on how we perceive the value of both women and men. If we never see any real women’s achievements celebrated, we are led to believe that they are simply not capable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What inspired you to start the project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">inVISIBLEwomen came into being in 2016 after I saw the London memorial to women who served in World War II. It took a while for me to realise what it was, because there were no women in it, just their empty uniforms hung around the plinth. That might have been quite poignant: illustrating the loss of life, but, when compared to the great mass of statues of male soldiers in the city, all fully physically present, it is a perfect illustration of the way in which women continue to be rendered invisible in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing this ‘memorial' to women made me consider how women are represented in UK civic statues. Some research confirmed my perception that men are vastly over-represented:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2016/03/i-sorted-uk-s-statues-gender-mere-27-cent-are-historical-non-royal-women\">the latest available figures (2016)</a> show that about 85% of statues are male and 15% female, of which 12% were nameless ‘symbolic’ figures with only 3% commemorating real women for their achievements. So that’s 3% to represent 50% of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How have you raised awareness of the initiative?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have acted locally, nationally and internationally and have forged links with a number of campaigns. I am one of the ambassadors for the <a href=\"https://maryclarkestatue.com/\">Mary Clarke statue campaign</a> in Brighton and I have had a presence at WOW, the London Women of the World Festival, for three years. I have been part of the Audacious Women Festival in Edinburgh and run workshops for university students and the public from Aberdeen to Basingstoke. I have written articles for magazines including the Women’s Institute publication, been interviewed for local TV and national BBC radio and quoted in national newspapers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Internationally, inVISIBLEwomen is a member of the International Association of Women’s Museums. I ran a workshop ‘Civic Statues in Istanbul; A Gender Mapping’&nbsp; at their 2018 conference in Istanbul, which is detailed in their subsequent publication ‘Feminist Pedagogy: Museums, Memory Sites and Practices of Remembrance’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also share regular posts on the site and social media about new campaigns, statues unveiled, national and international news stories about civic statues and their uses and the increasing public understanding of their quiet, persistent power. Supporters of the initiative are sent an Annual Update, featuring analysis of various cultural phenomena in that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What results has the project had?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2016 I have seen major changes in how statues in the UK are perceived. Notably, two major cultural associations - the Public Statues and Sculptures Association and Art UK - have both developed awareness of the issue and now have created dedicated sections on their sites for statues of women.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working on the available figures, there has been an astonishing improvement in the rate of women’s statues being erected. From the late 1800s until 2016, an average of 0.6 statues of women were raised each year. From 2016 to 2021, six statues were erected of women each year -&nbsp;a ten-fold increase. This goes only a small way to correct the huge imbalance, but is a significant shift in attitudes and these memorials to women have been exceptionally well received by the public. Statues have really been in the news over the past few years and their influence is becoming better understood.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Have there been any significant developments in your work in 2022?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have run inVISIBLEwomen alone since 2016. This year, however, I am pleased to say that I have been joined on the site by a group of active, experienced campaigners for statues of women in the UK - each has a place on the new page, ‘VISIBLEWomenUK’ with links to their sites.

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What results has the project had?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since 2016 I have seen major changes in how statues in the UK are perceived. Notably, two major cultural associations - the Public Statues and Sculptures Association and Art UK - have both developed awareness of the issue and now have created dedicated sections on their sites for statues of women.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working on the available figures, there has been an astonishing improvement in the rate of women’s statues being erected. From the late 1800s until 2016, an average of 0.6 statues of women were raised each year. From 2016 to 2021, six statues were erected of women each year -&nbsp;a ten-fold increase. This goes only a small way to correct the huge imbalance, but is a significant shift in attitudes and these memorials to women have been exceptionally well received by the public. Statues have really been in the news over the past few years and their influence is becoming better understood.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Have there been any significant developments in your work in 2022?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have run inVISIBLEwomen alone since 2016. This year, however, I am pleased to say that I have been joined on the site by a group of active, experienced campaigners for statues of women in the UK - each has a place on the new page, ‘VISIBLEWomenUK’ with links to their sites. They provide mutual support, sharing experience and advice about how to overcome the many obstacles placed in the way of memorials for women. Both new and existing campaigns are very welcome to join. The joint aim with the VISIBLEwomen group is to celebrate the great women of the past to inspire the great women of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start a similar initiative to highlight women’s history in their own country or area?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If there is any public interest/publicity about the issue, that is a good place to start. For example in Italy there has recently been a <a href=\"https://www.invisiblewomen.org.uk/gettingattention/post/208\">debate over just one statue of a woman</a> being added to a group of 78 men and another row over a <a href=\"https://www.invisiblewomen.org.uk/gettingattention/post/225\">sexualised image of a woman</a> purporting to illustrate a poem.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the Copyright Management guidelines?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Copyright Management Guidelines aim to support best practice in copyright management in cultural heritage organisations by highlighting steps to take towards a harmonised approach. They focus on establishing&nbsp;workflows to deal with copyright in collection management, providing sufficient copyright support or knowledge and integrating copyright needs in activities and projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines are structured around a simple matrix, which highlights the steps to take and breaks each step down to identify the resources you will need, the colleagues you will need to involve, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why were they created?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maintaining a harmonised approach to copyright management within a cultural heritage organisation is pivotal to fostering copyright best practice. It is also key to making the most of opportunities to develop organisational strategies and promote safe, open, and equitable content access, preservation, and re-use. These guidelines - which are free to use and download, and published under a CC BY licence - are available for all to use to work towards this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who are they for?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines are designed to aid anyone who works in a cultural heritage organisation and wants to help their institutions to develop robust and harmonised approaches to copyright management. These guidelines can be your aid in project planning, in strategy and team planning and in internal advocacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who created them?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines were created by the Europeana Copyright Community <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#steering-group\">Steering Group</a>. After the development of a first draft, they were shared with the Copyright Community for comments and feedback. The first draft was refined taking those into consideration. The guidelines were designed by <a href=\"http://www.rrook.nl\">Studio Rrook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can you access them?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines are available to download as a PDF - find out more and download them <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-management-guidelines-for-cultural-heritage-institutions\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join the launch event</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Copyright Community will be officially launching the guidelines at an online event on 8 June! We will introduce the guidelines, outline the steps in the document, and highlight how this resource can support you and cultural heritage more widely.&nbsp;<a data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\" data-stringify-link=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introducing-the-copyright-management-guidelines-tickets-345490179427\" delay=\"150\" href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introducing-the-copyright-management-guidelines-tickets-345490179427\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up now!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n"

They focus on establishing adequate workflows to deal with copyright in collection management, providing sufficient copyright support or knowledge and integrating copyright needs in activities and projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines are designed to aid everyone who works in cultural heritage organisations to help their institutions to develop robust and harmonised approaches to copyright management. They can be your aid in project planning, in strategy and team planning and in internal advocacy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The guidelines were created by the Europeana Copyright Community <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#steering-group\">Steering Group</a>. After the development of a first draft, they were shared with the Copyright Community for comments and feedback. The first draft was refined taking those into consideration. The design of the guidelines was made by <a href=\"http://www.rrook.nl\">Studio Rrook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Download the guidelines below and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/introducing-the-copyright-management-guidelines\">watch the recording of their launch</a>.

Now that the project has crossed the finishing line, we take a look back at what it has achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital collections and storytelling</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to the work of the project, more than 28,000 new collections items relating to sport were published on Europeana. These included <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=edm_datasetName%3A711_%2A\">digitised books relating to the history of sports in Scotland</a>, two collections of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=edm_datasetName%3A645%2A\">Italian sport newspapers</a>, archive photography relating to the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=europeana_collectionName%3A%282021648_DigitaleCollectie_CollectieGelderland%29%20AND%201928&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22The%20Dutch%20Olympic%20Committee%2C%20Dutch%20Sports%20Federation%22\">1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=edm_datasetName%3A576_%2A\">Romanian sport publications</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More than 60 different editorials were published, telling stories of the development and history of sports in Europe in blogs, an exhibition and galleries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Published in English, French and Spanish, the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/exhibitions/heroes-of-the-olympic-games\">Heroes of the Olympic Games</a> features profiles of around 50 athletes from across Europe and beyond, focusing on their lives and sporting achievements in the Olympic and Paralympic Games. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/sport\">Blogs and galleries </a>were published every month from November 2020 onwards, focusing on sport as played at local, national and international levels, the development of specific sports in particular countries, the stories of minority sports, histories of sporting clubs and communities as well as biographies and life-stories of individual sports people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project contributed to Europeana's seasons and campaigns including Women's History Month, Black History Month, GIF IT UP and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/ready-set-go-europeana-s-sport-season-kicks-off\">sport season in summer 2021</a>.</p>\r\n"

We were particularly pleased to be able to host most of these events in person, when the public health situation during the pandemic allowed -<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/engaging-the-public-with-europeana-sport-events\"> find out more</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The collection day events and associated online campaigns led to more than 300 sport stories on Europeana, published as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?query=europeana_collectionName%3A%28256_Sports_UGC%29\">user-generated collections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Sport partners also organised a number of events to help professional audiences engage with the project and sporting heritage.

                body: "<h3><strong>Why use the Tool?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You benefit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ENUMERATE Self Assessment Tool provides you with immediate resources and tips based on your responses. After filling out the questions, you will get a series of recommendations of helpful tools and resources based on your answers, for example, on how to create more impact for target audiences, how to develop a digital strategy or&nbsp;to support the digital transformation or capacity of your organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the ENUMERATE results have been analysed in summer 2022, the Self Assessment Tool will produce a benchmarking visualisation which can be viewed upon return to the platform. It will show you how your organisation’s results compare to others of a similar size, in a similar sector, or in the same country—information which you can use to support strategies, project proposals and reports. When circumstances change, you will also be able to submit a new response to the questions and track progress over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The sector benefits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using the tool&nbsp;will also help Europeana, the European Commission and European policy-makers to gain important insights into the issues faced by the cultural sector in Europe and how organisations can best be supported. It helps to design sector-specific performance indicators and targets for the cultural heritage sector. The more responses we get, the more detailed an insight we have and, the better we can support you in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hands-on help</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming weeks, Europeana will be hosting three ‘Cafés’ where we will introduce the Tool and can help answer your questions about completing the questions. Register for these events to be held on <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/enumerate-self-assessment-tool-lunch-cafe\">9 June</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/enumerate-self-assessment-tool-q-a-lunch-cafe\">15 June </a>and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/enumerate-self-assessment-tool-q-a-lunch-cafe-1\">23 June</a> 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ll help you navigate the Tool’s sections about: networks and audience; audience reach and participation; physical and digital collections; digitisation and digital strategy; standards; finances and staffing; and Europeana. If you have any questions about the Tool, you can also email <a href=\"mailto:enumerate@europeana.eu\">enumerate@europeana.eu</a> for support!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How the tool was developed</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ENUMERATE Self Assessment tool was developed by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/indices\">inDICEs project</a>, which began in January 2020. The project aims to uncover the impact of digital culture and digitisation in the cultural heritage sector and to address the need for innovative (re)use of cultural assets. It has gathered data on activities and impact that cultural heritage institutions were not already measuring, and over the last two years, has highlighted how crucial it is to introduce and support more data-driven decision making in the cultural heritage sector. The project issued important policy briefs and resources regarding cultural heritage value chains, open access policies and data monitoring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the core of the Self Assessment Tool developed by the project is ENUMERATE, an initiative designed to create a reliable baseline of statistical data about digitisation, digital preservation, and online access to cultural heritage in Europe for policy-makers. The results of previous ENUMERATE surveys—fielded in 2011, 2014 and 2017—informed policy and strategic decisions into investment in digitisation throughout Europe, and provided valuable statistics on the status of digital in the cultural heritage sector for all those working in it to explore. The ENUMERATE Self Assessment Tool has been updated and enhanced with questions relating to social media, user participation and data monitoring practices, but also with suggestions of helpful resources for cultural heritage organisations.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am a graduate of Southeast European Studies and International Relations and I got my PhD in History. However, I definitely differ from the image of a scholar that most people probably imagine. My professional experience first started in the private sector. For years, I was involved in international project and event management. At some point my innate curiosity, the pursuit of continuous development and intellectual enrichment, and the desire to be useful to society prevailed and I decided to switch to academia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transition was challenging, especially given the huge pay gap. Nevertheless, I do not regret the decision I made three years ago when I joined the Institute of Balkan Studies &amp; Center of Thracology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. I believe that the experience and knowledge I have gained in other fields help me in my scholarly work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently working on several national and international projects in the field of cultural heritage and digital humanities that give me the opportunity to engage in multi-year scholarly exchange and cooperation across locations. I am also writing my second monograph on European influences in the modern urban music culture in the Balkans. I intend to finish the book by the end of this year, which will pave my way to full professorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to being an Assistant Professor, I am also an Academic Coordinator in the institute I am affiliated with. As such, I collaborate with universities and research institutes, museums, libraries, archives and other institutions in Bulgaria and abroad. I am actively involved in science popularisation activities to share scientific knowledge with the general public. I organise open air and virtual exhibitions, workshops, public lectures, book fairs and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main challenges revolve around funding and while this affects all researchers, it can disproportionally affect these areas of research, such as the Humanities, which are not deemed a priority for many funding bodies. These challenges boil down to lack of funding and inadequate evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nonetheless, the positive aspects of my work are more, and they are more important. Some of my favorite elements are the independence at work, the opportunity to establish connections with researchers from other countries and to interact with and learn from people from different cultures, disciplines, and backgrounds. Last but not least, I greatly appreciate that the work in academia gives me the rare chance to be continuously inspired.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My motivation for joining the Members Council was that it was full of amazing people from widely varying backgrounds. The connections one makes and the learning opportunities that go along with it are immense. Working together in the Council allows us to create and innovate ways to embrace digital change and help people use cultural heritage for education, research, and creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, I will work to make different audiences understand the value of digital resources and their use. Further work is needed to understand specific ways in which this could be done in order to gain meaningful insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I will also support and promote the development of digital preservation policies, which in most organisations (especially in my home country) are scarce and underdeveloped. Owing to the shortage of funding, archival materials suffer from deterioration and technological obsolescence. In this context, cultural heritage institutions are confronted with major challenges that hamper the digitisation and preservation of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last but not least, I will encourage conversations about what cultural heritage data exists, what is recorded, and how it is being used at a local, regional, national and international level. Greater collaboration on infrastructure issues that enable interoperability and more integrated discovery of heritage data is a key requirement if the sector is to enable effective use and reuse of digital collections.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The event takes the form of a citizen lab at the House of European History in Brussels. People of all ages, backgrounds and experiences are welcome! If you want to take part, there’s still time! <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/built-with-bits-brussels-workshop-11th-june-tickets-341757745617\">Register on Eventbrite</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built with Bits Brussels builds on the New European Bauhaus values to encourage participants to consider how we integrate nature and our experience of it in a city like Brussels, and to use virtual spaces to be creative and experimental when exploring the relationship between function, beauty and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants might choose to discuss questions like: does Brussels need to reduce pollution by encouraging more cycling, pedestrianising larger areas and creating low-traffic zones? Should we focus on illegal dumping of waste? Or is it more important to make train and metro stations greener and more welcoming? Do you think our public spaces, gothic squares, Art Nouveau buildings and EU administration offices should have a more human and community-centred feel?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best ideas will form part of a mentoring programme for students of LUCA School of Arts and KU Leuven, in which students will be supported to further develop the ideas and produce a virtual version of a real space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the mentoring programme, participants will use virtual reality software and open source material from repositories like Europeana to image a better Brussels. Raising awareness of Europeana as a resource, and demonstrating how to find and reuse digital content will open up creative, cultural and educational inspiration and possibilities to the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nAbout the Festival of the New European Bauhaus&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/get-involved/festival_en\">Festival of the New European Bauhaus</a> will take place from 9 to 12 June 2022 and aims to bring together people from all walks of life to connect around the ideas that can shape our future. A future that is sustainable, inclusive and beautiful. As a hybrid event, core activities will take place in Brussels, with side events across the EU and beyond, everyone is welcome to get involved and join onsite and online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nAbout Built with Bits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Built with Bits Brussels follows on from the inaugural Built with Bits eight-week mentoring programme, which took place earlier this year and combined collaborative learning experiences and digital cultural content and technologies with the New European Bauhaus values. It was aimed at teachers and educators working with students in secondary education in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and explored how virtual experiences can be used within education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/looking-back-on-built-with-bits-an-educational-challenge-with-immersive-technologies\">an interview about the programme</a>, course conveners Daniel Llamas and David Mingorance told us that, ‘The programme focused not only on building virtual spaces, but also covered topics including user experience, art direction, design and conceptualisation, use of cultural material, types of licences, mediation, gamification and facilitation, concerning virtual spaces through weekly ‘learning pills’.’&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/built-with-bits-interviews\">Read interviews with all the winners of the first Built with Bits programme.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to create a positive impact and demonstrate to our audience that digital transformation can lead to a more sustainable, diverse and inclusive space for all. Our participants include students in higher education who may be the next generation of developers, creators, planners and architects. By making sustainable design a core consideration for them now, we hope they will carry that knowledge into their careers from the outset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Educating with medieval manuscripts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How did medieval reading culture evolve and become a fundamental aspect of European culture? This is a question which <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages-arma\">ARMA</a> - running until August 2022 - aims to explore. The project has made around 28,000 medieval items (manuscripts, early printed books, coins and other objects) available through the Europeana website, but has also focused on education. Partners have worked directly with educators at non-formal institutions and with teachers, lecturers and students at schools and universities to co-create content around these medieval items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The production of learning materials for primary and secondary education has been led by Hunt Museum, one of the <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/partners\">consortium partners</a>, with Hannah Bloom Teskey as main educator. Partners have developed games, video tutorials, learning scenarios and templates to bring children closer to the story of these medieval objects. Paloma Pucci, collaborator in this project of Bibliothèque nationale de France, was also inspired by Hunt's work, to develop an extra set of materials about coins for primary education. Find out more below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hunt Museum: learning calligraphy, design, ink making and reading with digital manuscripts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the life of the project, the Hunt Museum has developed three programmes for primary education: calligraphy, reading out loud and making ink.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/activities/learning/primary-education#h.3ted53qwcm8l\">calligraphy educational materials</a>, primary school pupils can learn about the technique’s process and history. They have the chance to compare and contrast examples of manuscripts from Europeana’s collections, explore historical objects associated with the practice of calligraphy, and to create their own piece of calligraphy using a hand-made calligraphy pen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Their <a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/activities/learning/primary-education#h.f4dntzwujeeb\">reading out loud programme</a> offers primary school students a greater understanding of the practice of reading aloud in medieval times, the shift towards silent reading, and how this changed our relationship with the written word. To motivate students to learn about it they will begin by playing the interactive Reading Aloud Game, suitable for any history and art lover. Try out the game below!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we all work. As we are moving into a different stage of the ‘new normal’, what does that look like for Europeana?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While I don’t think that we can say that COVID-19 is behind us, we are now thinking differently about how we work and about our working methods and modes. During the pandemic these new modes were enforced by necessity, but now we can see them as a positive opportunity to explore new approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Practically, this has implications for colleagues at the Europeana Foundation. We are literally changing what we think about being in an office through a physical transformation, and changing our assumptions about functioning as an office&nbsp; through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-are-developing-a-hybrid-working-culture-at-the-europeana-foundation\">hybrid working</a>, which also encompasses new technology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an approach that we will bring to our network later this year, as our conference, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2022</a>, will be hybrid, with events happening in parallel in person in The Hague and online. We hope that this approach will be a chance to collaborate with our networks and audiences in a new, varied way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana 2022 will be a hybrid conference - what topics will it explore?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/submit-your-proposal-for-europeana-2022\">call for proposals for Europeana 2022</a> will see several topics of key importance for the sector explored. Last year our conference introduced the idea of a data space, while this year we’ll be exploring how our sector will contribute to and benefit from it, keeping those key topics in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A data space asks the question: how can we realise the potential value of digital cultural heritage not just for our sector and audiences, but also for other sectors and across society? How do we access, share and reuse cultural data in a meaningful way? We have a real responsibility when we help to answer that; it’s not just a technical challenge - the unique contribution of cultural heritage to society needs to be at the front of our minds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, in the data space we want to bring together cultural heritage data in a standardised, interoperable format, giving cultural heritage institutions autonomy over their data while sharing it and operating in standardised ways. New technologies will be key for this, and this will be an important aspect of the conference as we explore topics relevant to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> including 3D, multilinguality and AI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, we want to bring data into this interoperable space because there will be an enormous benefit to society in being able to use and reuse that data. We will be able to better tell the European story in a way which encourages new, intersectional narratives and connects different communities. Our conference strands which explore storytelling and diversity and inclusion will help us start to consider what this could look like for our sector, and how we can support it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally, we aim to equip professionals to work within and with the data space by supporting the sector in its digital transformation. As a networked organisation, we are well placed to facilitate peer to peer learning and help colleagues throughout Europe develop new skills to operate within this data space. This will be achieved through participation and collaboration - a key theme for the conference - and through the presentations, training and webinars which will be delivered at the conference itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You mentioned the importance of people reusing cultural heritage data. Can you tell us something about how people are reusing Europeana material right now?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am constantly inspired by the many ways people <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-reuse-be-inspired\">reuse Europeana’s material</a>, but one of the examples I am particularly proud of at the moment is <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a>. This is a mentoring programme and educational challenge which invites students and educators to design beautiful and sustainable spaces with Mozilla Hubs. The results of this community effort have been incredibly exciting. The enthusiasm shown by participants demonstrates the crucial importance of engaging children with digital cultural heritage at a young age, and of encouraging them to interact respectfully in digital spaces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The strength of Built with Bits is that we collaborated and co-created the initiative with teachers, who are critically important in making these connections with young people. We are always looking for ways to engage with the education community through initiatives like this and I hope that they are a group who will be benefited by a common data space, to not just access the data it makes available, but to create with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You mentioned engaging with communities and of course the Europeana Network Association is an international community, including members from Ukraine and Eastern Europe. How is Europeana supporting those communities facing huge challenges?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are working to support these communities as much as we can, and specifically in the areas where we have expertise, for example, in relation to digital. When Russia invaded Ukraine, we shared a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/statement-of-solidarity-with-ukraine\">statement of solidarity</a> with the Ukrainian people, and have since established a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/supporting-the-digital-cultural-heritage-of-ukraine-working-group\">Working Group</a> to explore how we can support the digital cultural heritage of Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By working with UNESCO to coordinate activities, we have identified the main action groups that are operating in a similar role to us - <a href=\"https://www.sucho.org/\">SUCHO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.4ch-project.eu/\">SUM (4CH)</a>. We were able to supply funding and mobilise people in our communities who are knowledgeable about archiving and 3D reconstruction to support these groups, trying to locate expertise where we do not have it ourselves - a benefit of being a networked organisation. Our Working Group will help us build on this initial support and help to identify other relevant actions that can make a positive difference for Ukraine’s cultural heritage sector and our Ukrainian colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in the data space and other topics covered in this interview? There is still time to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/submit-your-proposal-for-europeana-2022\">submit a proposal for Europeana 2022</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>I began my internship with the Service Experience team in February. During my internship,&nbsp;which was part of my Master's student programme of Digital Humanities at KU Leuven, I built on Europeana's previous research to examine the needs, motivations and experience of people using the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">website</a>. I decided to invite eight visitors for a more in-depth study, aiming to learn more about their needs, experience with the website, and their suggestions for improving it. I chose to work with people with visual impairments because I believe that providing solutions accessible for this group would help not only people with disabilities, but everyone using the website. Data from this research filled in some of the gaps in the previous quantitative research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How I approached my user experience research</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">’User experience research’ refers to the different methods used to examine an individual’s experience of a digital product. It can be either qualitative or quantitative, but in this case, we chose an approach that was more in-depth, and developed for a smaller sample size. My research method consisted of an interview combined with usability testing (where we ask someone to complete a series of tasks to help us determine the usefulness and accessibility of the website). These results are qualitative, which means that they do not deal with quantity (numbers) but rather with qualities or characteristics. Due to its depth the qualitative data is usually based on the smaller sample size so the results should not be extrapolated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For my research, I spoke to eight participants between 22 and 74 years of age who had various levels of visual impairment and education. In our one hour conversation, I asked them questions about their lives, habits, and affinity with art. Afterward, I asked them to perform certain tasks on the website and then share their opinion. These tasks included reading a blog post and filtering the search results, navigating through the website, and interacting with various content and functionalities presented to them. I collected raw data in the form of notes and recordings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>My findings&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the collection of data, we conducted a thematic analysis to group certain&nbsp;themes into patterns. Based on the analysis, we learned why certain functions are not as&nbsp;accessible as they should be. Even though the interviewees were enthusiastic about the website, they still experienced some difficulties using it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Participants felt that Europeana needs to offer a high contrast mode function because the third-party extensions do not work well on the website. As an example, one participant found it difficult to navigate the website because, while using an extension, most of the icons blended into the background. ‘Only when I put my mouse over it can I see it’, said one of the participants. Responding to this feedback, I designed a prototype of a dark mode function that was tailored to the website and presented it to participants who found it more accessible. Europeana will explore the feasibility of implementing&nbsp;this feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the time of testing, we also found that the languages in which the website is available could be improved. When participants selected a language other than English, the titles of the articles were translated, but not the actual articles (blog posts and exhibitions.) This caused confusion for those whose first language was not English. One participant said, ‘When you choose the language, all of the content is still in English. Only name categories are in Spanish. It would be more accessible if all the text would be in the selected language’. Europeana is aware of this issue and will continue taking further steps to improve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, the colour filter on the search page (see the image below) caused some confusion. In general, participants liked the names of colors calling them ‘evocative’ and saying that they can picture what the color looks like from the names. However, some names were confusing. One of the participants said: ‘I don't know what the difference is between sea shine and antique white, mint cream, and honeydew. These colors look the same to me.’ Furthermore, they wanted to introduce a few simple colors among the more complex ones to appeal to an audience that may be less familiar with them. Europeana will look into this.</p>\r\n"

The campaign focused on&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />transcribing documents from two&nbsp;important collections held by Dublin City Library and&nbsp;Archive,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/1j92vr95r\">the Wide Streets Commission</a>, and<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7486/DRI.kk91v9531\"> Dublin City Council Manuscript Minutes</a>. These covered almost two hundred years of Dublin’s history from 1695 to 1881, and the city’s transformation from a medieval city to the modern capital we know today. The handwritten records have been available up to now in hard copy or in some cases as digital photographs. However the text has not been easily accessible, and because of that, these important sources have not been as widely consulted as they could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is something which the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enricheuropeana\">EnrichEuropeana+</a> project, which Transcription Week was run as part of, aims to address. The project is working&nbsp;to digitise these documents and make them available on Europeana, allowing them to then be transcribed during <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a> events via the Transcribathon.eu website platform. The resulting transcriptions can then be used to make improvements to the Transkribus automated transcription tool.&nbsp;Transcription Week was the first partner hosted transcription event of EnrichEuropeana+.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Adapting to an online format</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had originally planned to run a week-long set of in-person events and organise for groups of visitors from schools, historical societies and elsewhere, to visit an event space in our library headquarters. We hoped that they would take part in a two or three hour session with a training element and then undertake a few hours of transcription.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The COVID-19 pandemic changed that. As the pandemic and resulting restrictions continued we postponed the event twice and then decided that we needed to change our plan and stage Transcription Week as a fully online campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We structured the campaign with a preparation week, where we released contextual and instructional videos and encouraged potential participants to register on Transcribathon.eu. This material was also packaged for secondary school history teachers so that they could familiarise their classes with the idea behind the project and get them ready to take part during Transcription Week itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During Preparation Week we also looked at ways to involve interested professionals from cultural heritage and academic institutions. We gave a guest lecture to the <a href=\"https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/\">Department of Digital Arts and Humanities in University College Cork</a>, presented the project to staff from cultural heritage institute members of the DRI, and promoted the events through special interest librarian mailing lists. This built on earlier work where we had organised a training run with library staff from Dublin City Libraries and interested colleagues from other institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This outreach was important for disseminating the work and goals of the project, but each activity also increased the number of potential transcribers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Launching Transcription Week</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transcription Week itself was launched with a webinar which we held daily throughout the whole week. While the pandemic obviously shaped our approaches, it didn't put an end to our trans-European collaboration. Thanks to the move online, we could still have our colleagues present during our webinars, take part in the transcription work and take notes on what worked and what didn’t for their own runs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our daily webinars were popular with participants. They were originally planned as&nbsp; ‘Transcribe along with us’ events where people could ask questions and get help with any issues they encountered. But they also gave us a friendly space to keep in touch, identify pain points which we could refer back to the technical team in Transcribathon and importantly to hold conversations with our transcribers. The feedback we received here will guide our work going forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our call for participation had a generous response from the public and our volunteers transcribed over half a million characters in 842 different pages. They also geocoded about 1,000 locations in Dublin City centre, sometimes with single locations being mapped repeatedly over a number of decades as streets and buildings rose and fell. It was a great success!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Transcription Week’ has come and gone and we are now moving forward as the ‘Dublin Transcription Project’. We still have lots of material left to transcribe, and from discussions in our webinars and over email we know that our volunteers are interested in continuing to contribute. So we are reorganising. If ‘Transcription Week’ was a sprint then the ‘Dublin Transcription Project’ will be a marathon where we will pace things more sustainably. Instead of daily webinars we will host monthly online meetings which will incorporate guest talks from experts who can provide context on the collections being worked on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’re interested in learning more you can <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu/register/\">sign up to Transcribathon.eu</a>, or better yet sign up and <a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/runs/dublin-transcription-week/\">take part in our ongoing work</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Problematic or contentious cultural heritage content is part of a larger discussion around diversity, inclusion and equity happening now among professionals and in cultural heritage institutions. These institutions have an important role to play in education and research, and there is increasing acknowledgement by some institutions that items in their collections may represent colonial agendas, and that, in some cases, those objects have been removed from their cultural and historical context. Whether graphic medical content, derogatory descriptors, or other terms with controversial histories, there are many opportunities for confusion, and, potentially, harm. As the cultural heritage sector, we need to acknowledge this historical background and determine how to move forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Learning from each other&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we regularly receive questions about items people discover on the Europeana website. Sometimes the feedback is about an item that could be sexist, racist, or in other ways cause harm to those visiting it or being represented by it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The role of online platforms is often debated: do we have a responsibility not only to our audience, but also to the objects we share and their history? How can we, as an organisation, support and encourage discussion around these objects and the questions they reflect? Does providing access to content through our platform mean that we have a responsibility to act as content stewards? Content stewardship implies that, even though we aren't the creators of the objects we host, we have a responsibility in providing ethical access to that content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana&nbsp;is working to stimulate conversation about this topic by bringing cultural heritage institutions together for discussions; hosting spaces and events that allow for constructive dialogue and action; and supporting capacity building efforts throughout the sector that give institutions the tools they need to deal with potentially contentious aspects of their collections. We are also looking at what other organisations in our field are doing when faced with such situations, to establish information sharing networks, and identify good practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the Digital Public Library of America has released a <a href=\"https://dp.la/about/harmful-language-statement\">statement </a>on potentially harmful content as have a number of libraries such as the <a href=\"https://tischlibrary.tufts.edu/about-library/about/DEIJ/harmful-language-statement\">Tisch Library</a>. &nbsp;Other institutions like the <a href=\"https://collection.aiatsis.gov.au/\">Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies</a> and the <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/\">National Library of Australia’s aggregator</a> have opted for pop-up statements on their webpage, giving more context to visitors. The Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford University has begun working with <a href=\"https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/maasai-living-cultures\">representatives from the Maasai cultures</a> whose artefacts they hold, as part of an Indigenous Leadership programme organised by the NGO <a href=\"https://insightshare.org/\">Insightshare</a>.The National Museum of World Cultures recently published the influential publication '<a href=\"https://www.tropenmuseum.nl/en/about-tropenmuseum/words-matter-publication\">Words Matte</a>r' to contribute to the dialogue of word use in the museum sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Editorial approaches&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana has also been working to focus attention on groups of people who have been marginalised throughout history. For example, communication and content for <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/black-history\">Black History</a> Month in February and October and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History</a> Month in March were efforts to give visibility to people who have been instrumental in their fields of expertise, but are not given the visibility their contributions deserve, usually because they are part of marginalised groups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because some objects in our collections were created in different times and contexts, the way they portray certain groups of people may no longer be considered appropriate. When creating blogs and exhibitions, we try to present these objects in a way that helps people visiting our platform learn more about the wider context in which they were created. This gives us the opportunity to break through taboos, broach difficult subjects, and show different perspectives of an issue. Our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/exhibitions/china-in-perspective\">China in Perspective exhibition</a>, or our blog on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/blog/men-and-machines-the-queer-art-of-goesta-adrian-nilsson\">the queer art of GAN</a> are a few examples of how we can highlight themes like imperialism or homophobia in a historical context. To reduce the impact of exposing people to content they don't want to see, we use content warnings and contextualising introductions to help readers understand what is being described and shown.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Addressing challenges with both people and technology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps the biggest obstacle the cultural heritage sector faces when addressing contentious content is the sheer number of objects in collections.&nbsp;Embedding an inclusive approach in meeting this challenge allows minority and local communities and their allies to interact with their heritage and participate in its curation so we avoid misrepresenting their culture or using controversial language.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aggregators have an important role in the data and metadata preparation stage by developing and working on tagging systems and identifying potentially problematic content from the cultural heritage institutions they work with. The Diversity and Inclusion group of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum is exploring further how aggregators can play a role.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">User feedback is another crucial way to identify possibly problematic objects or descriptions. Europeana has a feedback button that can be used on any page on the Europeana website, and we encourage people to use the form it brings you to to share their view on any object or piece of metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Artificial Intelligence has repeatedly been suggested as a way to solve the issue of dealing with millions of objects to analyse. However, AI, much like people, learns from what it is taught and therefore also has its biases. It will be crucial to always keep in mind that algorithmic detection is never a full replacement of human labour: human validation and checking is needed to ensure the quality and accuracy of these algorithms. Promising examples of experimenting with machine learning to support curational work can be found at the <a href=\"https://dp.la/news/supporting-curatorial-work-with-machine-learning\">DPLA </a>and <a href=\"https://www.cultural-ai.nl/\">Cultural-AI</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transforming cultural heritage institutions and making content more inclusive goes a lot deeper than the discussion above. The need to challenge the structures and ideologies informing them is an essential part of the process. This process is neither quick nor easy, and we’re only laying its foundation. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/diversity-and-inclusion\">Learn more about what we're doing on diversity and inclusion in Europeana</a>, or contribute to Europeana's diverse editorial by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGdrNDoN4G08j2KHHPWke0gXliDXoTO4Ph6L27fJr5c-Oljw/viewform\">proposing a blog idea</a> about a subject you're interested in.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In early 2022, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/euroclio\">EuroClio</a> interviewed several cultural heritage&nbsp;professionals to ask them a rather difficult question: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/an-ideal-elearning-platform-reflections-from-cultural-heritage-institutions-from-across-europe\">'if time and money were not an issue, what would the ideal eLearning Platform look like?'.</a> We heard you loud and clear: the ideal eLearning Platform should be ‘Designed in collaboration with the end-user’. For this reason, in March we began offering a series of co-creation meetings, which see members of the EuroClio teaching community meeting with curators to comb through their collections, select sources that have a clear and strong educational value, and develop eLearning Resources that are ready for classroom use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-98d1e2c4-7fff-7857-7eb7-914c952d758e\">Co-creation meetings</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have hosted these meetings both in online and face to face formats. On 22 March, the <a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/\">Dutch Royal Library</a> co-hosted the ‘Delpher Teacher’s Day’, where a small group of teachers were invited to experiment with the <a href=\"https://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten?cid=cn:NL-S-NB-Kranten_c:ps_sc:adwords&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYx9u98e_j_p9FjTECfZoWv5h5UStk5NaAzVscZj1e5D7IsoFe9wynxRoCmeYQAvD_BwE\">Delpher Newspaper Database</a> for educational use. As a result of the day, teachers selected several newspaper sources on the theme of ‘Women’s Struggle to Vote’, which we are now turning&nbsp; into source collections and eLearning Activities with the help of the Historiana Teaching and Learning Team. Once ready, the developed material will be published on the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/koninklijke-bibliotheek\">Dutch Royal Library’s Partner Page on Historiana.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 20 May, together with <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/\">Photoconsortium</a>, the international association for photographic heritage and Europeana accredited aggregator in the domain of photography, we started a series of three online co-creation meetings. During the first meeting, we selected several themes that we wanted to explore with teachers from our community, including photographic portraits in Girona in 1920-1940, a Europeana gallery about madness and art, and a selection of photographs made by European tourists in China in 1965. Sources on these three themes (selected from broader online collections available on Europeana and fully reusable for educational purposes) have now become Source Collections on the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/photoconsortium\">Photoconsortium’s Partner Page on Historiana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the second meeting, together with the Historiana Teaching and Learning team, we started to design eLearning Activities that tackle these topics, and&nbsp;on 7 July at 10:00 (CEST)&nbsp;we will be hosting a final online session, where teachers from across Europe will be invited to provide feedback to the designed activities. If you interested in joining this final online session, reach out to me (<a href=\"mailto:alice@euroclio.eu\" target=\"_blank\">alice@euroclio.eu</a>)&nbsp;to receive the meeting link!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-2876dcaf-7fff-bbea-43de-159609f0028d\">Benefits for participants</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are still in the process of finalising the material with Delpher and Photoconsortium (follow EuroClio on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/euroclio?mc_cid=08f34624a2&amp;mc_eid=517108190f\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/euroclio/?mc_cid=08f34624a2&amp;mc_eid=517108190f\">Instagram</a> to see the final results), but we have already learned so much about the effect of these meetings on participants. We found&nbsp;that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Teachers treasure the possibility to talk with cultural heritage professionals about their collections. Collections are always wide and rich in sources that have a strong educational potential, and teachers appreciate the opportunity to talk directly with collections curators and share with them their needs and wishes. Curators often have the right answer, and can point to the perfect source that will do the trick.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Cultural heritage professionals appreciate the opportunity to showcase great content that they are proud of, but that would need a very specific search for teachers to come across naturally. With these meetings, they can get this content out there already packaged in a way that ensures it will be used in the classroom.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are planning to host many more co-creation meetings in 2022 and 2023. If you are a cultural heritage curator or educator who would like to set up a set of online co-creation sessions (three normally do the trick, but we can personalise the sessions and their content to better suit your needs!), or to explore the possibility of arranging a face-to-face co-creation day, let us know by reaching out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:alice@euroclio.eu\">alice@euroclio.eu</a>. We would love to engage with your content, and are sure that we’ll be able to create several engaging collections and activities together!</p>\r\n"

The Forum comes together to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices, and their outreach event is the perfect opportunity to find out more about what they do and how they can help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us on 11 July 2022</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following last year’s successful Aggregators' Fair, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum invites you to join their second outreach event on 11 July 2022.&nbsp; Anyone working in cultural heritage with an interest in sharing content and contributing to the common European data space for cultural heritage will find plenty to engage and excite them!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme will take attendees through the process of aggregation, from defining the purpose for digitisation and identifying content, to processing the data, to sharing it with wider audiences. Inspiring presentations and&nbsp;roundtable discussions will give attendees the opportunity to learn and share, while finding out more about best practices and key standards for data sharing throughout the sector. You can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Aggregator_Forum/EAF-outreach-2022-Digital-Programme.pdf\">read the full programme</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event takes place in the context of the transition from the Digital Service Infrastructure to the common European data space for cultural heritage. You will hear from Europeana’s domain, thematic and national aggregators who will discuss the landscape and organisation of aggregation in the current context of the data space and continue discussions initiated during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/building-the-common-european-data-space-for-cultural-heritage-together\">Europeana Conference held during the French Presidency</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/eaf-outreach-event\">Find out more.</a></strong></p>\r\n"

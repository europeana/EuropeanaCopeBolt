        title: 'Europeana and European Schoolnet - celebrating five years of collaboration'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>To celebrate five years of working\_together, Europeana and European Schoolnet have produced a new publication which explores their work promoting innovative learning with digital cultural heritage. We explore some of the highlights.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The ‘Europeana Education and European Schoolnet: Five years promoting innovative learning with digital cultural heritage, 2015 – 2020’ report highlights how Europeana and European Schoolnet have provided professionals and educational stakeholders with training tools and guidelines, available on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a> and the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Involving teachers in reuse of digital cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than 49,000 students reached, the last two years have been the most ambitious and fruitful years of EUN and Europeana collaboration, as we have worked on strengthening the community of teachers using digital cultural heritage in their classroom. Through all the activities related to training, dissemination, design of learning scenarios and competition, in the last academic year more than 2,000 teachers contributed to increasing the reuse of digital cultural heritage across curricula and at a transnational level by creating learning resources and sharing them on the\_<a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two new videos also showcase and celebrate the efforts made by the Europeana teachers’ community over the past academic year by exploring ‘Europeana in my classroom’ - you can see them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZpPLgsR8DM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Sharing best practices</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our collaboration has also resulted in the creation of a strong community of teachers, eager to enhance their capacity for using digitised cultural heritage material in their work. The community gathers the 13 Europeana Ambassador teachers and their 132 User Group teachers, but also the participants of the ‘Europeana in My Classroom’ Massive Open Online Course. For the last two years, the Ambassadors and User Group teachers have worked together on developing and testing new learning scenarios using Europeana content.<b>\_</b>The community works to gain a better awareness of the value of digital cultural data in education, to showcase best practices, regardless of the discipline, and to share advice with peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by their work, Europeana and European Schoolnet will shortly publish a booklet for teachers and educational stakeholders composed of the 30 best contributions of the 2020 Europeana Education Competition. Including 29 learning scenarios and a story of implementation, this booklet presents the results of teachers’ hard work, commitment and\_creativity. It aims to inspire and support the creation of learning activities that promote the integration of digital cultural heritage in educational activities. The booklet will be published soon and will be available in seven languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Opening the Europeana Education initiative to museum educators and other GLAM professionals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next two years, the Europeana Education initiative and European Schoolnet aim to reach more teachers and educators across Europe to provide quality learning, collaboration and critical thinking for our students and future citizens. We aim to involve museum educators and other GLAM professionals, to strengthen the links between formal and informal education through our Ambassador Network and user group, as well as resources on Europeana classroom and MOOCs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a teacher or a museum educator interested in taking part in the Europeana Education initiative? Follow Europeana Education on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EuropeanaEducation/\">Facebook</a> and\_<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332/\">LinkedIn</a> to hear about more opportunities to join the new Europeana Ambassador Network and User Group.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\"> join the Europeana Network Association Education Community</a> to network with new colleagues, get the latest news about education and the cultural heritage sector, grow your network and contribute to digital transformation in education with culture.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Known as WLM to everyone in the Wikimedia world, <a href=\"https://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/\">Wiki Loves Monuments</a> is a photography competition focused on capturing images of listed structures from the built environment and uploading them onto Wikimedia Commons under an open licence. It started in the Netherlands in 2010, and has seen thousands of participants upload hundreds of thousands of images in the past 10 years worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>WLM in Ireland</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ireland has been taking part in WLM since 2014, and in six years this has resulted in almost <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wiki_Loves_Monuments_in_Ireland\">7,500 images of Irish built heritage</a> uploaded to <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Commons under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0</a> which allows them to be used, shared, and enjoyed by the whole world. Despite the huge number of images uploaded, only 40% of the structures listed as eligible for the competition have a photograph on Commons. This leaves 60% of Ireland’s publicly accessible built heritage unrepresented on Wikimedia Commons, and thus Wikipedia itself - something which we try to address each year through the competition.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Using Wikidata, we are able to visualise that gap in photographs through <a href=\"https://query.wikidata.org/embed.html#%23defaultView%3AMap%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20%3Flocation%20%3Fimage%20(SAMPLE(%3Flayer)%20AS%20%3Flayer)%0AWHERE%20%7B%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP17%20wd%3AQ27%20.%20%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP2186%20%3Fwlmid%20.%0A%20%20FILTER(STRSTARTS(%3Fwlmid%2C%20'IE-'))%20.%0A%20%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP625%20%3Flocation%20.%20%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%3Fitem%20wdt%3AP18%20%3Fimage%20%7D%0A%20%20BIND(IF(isBlank(%3Fimage)%2C%20%22No%20Image%22%2C%20%22Image%22)%20AS%20%3Flayer)%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22en%22.%20%7D%0A%7D%0AGROUP%20BY%20%3Fitem%20%3FitemLabel%20%3Flocation%20%3Fimage\">this query</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Irish structures are those listed by the <a href=\"https://www.archaeology.ie/\">National Monuments Service</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.buildingsofireland.ie/\">National Inventory of Architectural Heritage</a>, and range from castles to bridges, churches to canal locks, and quays to fountains. The sites include the prehistoric right up to the 20th century, with many unassuming structures included which hold their own intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Our initial list in 2014 was dominated by archaeological sites listed by the National Monument Service, the familiar dolmens, cairns, mounds, castles and standing stones which are characteristic of the ancient built heritage of Ireland. We worked closely with the Service to ensure that all relevant sites were included, and there were no issues regarding safe access to the sites listed. In 2017 our volunteers worked with the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage to incorporate over 6000 structures which are similarly publicly accessible. These sites date from after 1700 and offer a different, and sometimes more challenging form of built heritage to photograph. I wrote a paper on how we developed our list over time, and the implications which <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/25800337/Crowdsourcing_Ireland_s_National_Monuments\">can be found here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Encouraging engagement with built cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As many of the buildings listed now have a public or cultural function, in particular libraries and local museums, they have been key to promoting the competition locally. In an ordinary year, this would have involved posting leaflets and posters to all the county libraries and museums,&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />but this year more than ever we will be relying on digital promotion through our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WikimediaIE\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WikimediaIreland\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wikimediaie/\">Instagram</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCME0KIqk13bdfdg_fqqYISA/\">YouTube</a>. In the past, when a winning photograph has featured a GLAM, such as <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kilmainham_Gaol\">Kilmainham Gaol</a>, this has spurred some interest from the site through reposting and sharing the image and news via social media channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a community, we use Wiki Loves Monuments as a demonstration of the power of open licence images to improve the profile and understanding of Ireland’s material culture through Wikipedia and its sister projects. There is an important role in running the competition annually, as the store of photographs can form an archive of the condition of the structure. One such case was the documentation of a fire at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erne_Palais_Ballroom\">Erne Palais Ballroom in Belturbet, County Cavan</a> in 2018. Unfortunately. images of the damaged structure were the first ones to be uploaded to Commons, but will form part of an important visual archive of the site moving into the future.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is a model for delivering learning content online to virtually any person with no limit on attendance. The ‘Europeana in your classroom: building 21st-century competences with digital cultural heritage’ MOOC helps teachers use digitised cultural heritage material in teaching by providing an introduction to the Europeana platform and specially developed resources that can easily be integrated into lessons. It also supports teachers to build learning scenarios using digital cultural heritage, in a framework of 21st-century skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The MOOC was first launched in April 2018 on the European Schoolnet Academy website and has since been repeated in English and translated into Portugese and Spanish. The course completion rate (calculated by dividing the total number of participants that completed the course were awarded a certificate for course completion by the total number of participants who started the MOOC) is better than the average 10% completion rate of other MOOCs. This suggests that participants were interested in the content and objectives of the MOOC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Social Return on Investment (SROI) impact assessment was conducted between July and August 2019 to explore and inform future approaches to measuring the value of Europeana Education’s value for its main stakeholder group, educators (Europeana Education co-ordinate and support the MOOC). SROI measures change in ways that are relevant to the people or organisations that experience or contribute to it. It tells the story of how change is being created by attributing monetary values to the estimated benefits for the main stakeholder groups and compares the costs of designing and administering the MOOC, as well as any other resources leveraged into it. This enables a ratio of benefits to costs to be calculated, and adds an economic perspective to the impact of the MOOC.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two different valuation techniques were applied in order to estimate the social return on investment: cost-related methods (based on proxies) and revealed preference methods. The findings presented here must be used with care, as a conservative approach was adopted to prevent overclaiming, following one of the key principles of SROI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the first method, proxy values were attributed by the researchers to two out of three effects of participation in the Europeana MOOC. This method suggests that, in terms of SROI, every euro invested is expected to yield €1.50 in return.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the second method the costs per teacher of the MOOC (average €37) was compared with the value of goods that the MOOC was equivalent to (for example, a smartphone, book or magazine), allowing stakeholders to choose the value. It suggested that every euro invested, to speak in terms of Social Return on Investment, is expected to yield €2.00 in return.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the key principles of SROI is to involve stakeholders from the beginning to the end of the process, which was regrettably not possible in this analysis. The report recommends that stakeholders are more involved in future SROI research, and that Europeana considers asking more outcome related questions as part of their data collection strategy. This report should therefore be regarded as a guideline for measuring and monitoring future value for stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Task Force publishes artificial intelligence in GLAMs survey results'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=strategy-in-motion\">Strategy in motion</a>’ series, Gregory Markus updates us on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">EuropeanaTech AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force</a>, which has just published the results of a survey of artificial intelligence (AI) in the digital cultural heritage domain.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana Network Association works through Task Forces, which are designed to help solve specific issues and challenges affecting the digital heritage field, and to contribute to realising the Europeana Initiative’s strategy.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">EuropeanaTech AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force</a>, which began on 1 December 2019 and runs until 31 January 2021, is running a horizon-scanning exercise and investigating the expected role and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in the digital cultural heritage domain especially with regards to collections analysis and improvement. We seek to gather a clear overview of how institutions, big and small, are working with or seeking to engage with AI technologies for their collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Progress in AI</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-innovation-agenda\">Innovation Agenda</a> published in 2019, demonstrated a strong desire from the Europeana Network Association to improve data quality, usability and retrievability; all of which can be improved through AI-related methodologies.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the role of AI has grown, providing multitudes of advances that help Europeana and cultural heritage institutions at large to improve access to their collections. Europeana has been making great strides in the past year, notably with the start of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/saint-george-on-a-bike-leverages-the-power-of-ai-for-european-cultural-heritage\">Saint George on a Bike </a>project, which aims to improve the metadata associated with imagery from European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many institutions, the global pandemic has hastened digital access for remote users. When we began this Task Force, we, like everyone else, did not foresee such a dramatic and immediate necessity for digital, remote access to collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who is using AI already?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran a survey to gain an understanding of who is already working with AI or has plans to do so, the different types of projects being run, the methodologies being used, the challenges faced, the success granted and the resources applied.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The target respondents from the survey were professionals working in museums, libraries, archives and research institutions as well as the wider industry (technology suppliers, creative industries, etc.) that work with cultural heritage data. A full Task Force report will be published in early 2021.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, we received over 60 responses from all around Europe and several international contributions. To encourage respondents, the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision promised to donate one goat to rural communities in need via <a href=\"https://www.oxfamgifts.com/gifts/donate-goat/\">Oxfam International</a> for every 20 survey responses. In the end, Sound and Vision donated four goats - thanks, guys!\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our interim report presents the initial takeaways from the survey. We found great interest in AI. Almost all respondents are interested in at least one AI topic and more than half show expertise in one of the topics. The core reason for engaging with AI for the respondents related to (meta) data quality. GLAM institutions aim to use AI for facilitating the exploitation (and to some extent, the production) of their digitised collections. These initial findings will be used to fuel further work during which the Task Force will more deeply investigate trends and outliers as well as best practices identified through the survey.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, through this Task Force, EuropeanaTech will have a glimpse into AI-related work within the Europeana Network Association. We will be able to share this with the community to improve knowledge transfer and awareness-raising and finally, be able to create programmes or support networks for all community members working with or hoping to engage with AI in the future.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you wish to share your thoughts or add to our report feel free to contact Gregory Markus at <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digital conference for Germany EU Presidency to explore copyright and capacity building'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Two complementary digital conferences organised by Europeana and the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek are supporting cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformations, by focussing on the importance of building capacity and skills to do with copyright. The conferences are organised as part of Germany's Presidency of the Council of the European Union, putting cultural heritage in the spotlight for Europe's policymakers. We take a look at these events as part of our ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=strategy-in-motion\">Strategy in Motion</a>’ series.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>From decision-makers to practitioners, we all have a role in ensuring that copyright serves research, education, innovation and creativity while respecting the legitimate interests of authors and rights holders. As technology develops, and borders dissipate in the digital environment, the policy landscape changes to open up new opportunities. The implementation of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM) Directive <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-reform-passed-by-european-parliament\">holds many promises</a> for the digital cultural heritage sector, including allowing institutions to make digital reproductions of all works in their collections, making in-copyright but out-of-commerce works available online and upholding the principle that what is in the public domain in analogue form stays in the public domain when digitised. Decision-makers, practitioners, rights holders and others have a role in making them a reality.\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana conference 5-6 October</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana web conference on ‘The role of copyright in the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector’ will reflect on the past, present and future of copyright and its role in serving and enabling digital transformation. This conference is part of the cultural programme for the German Presidency, thanks to the German Ministry of State for Culture and the Media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With practitioners refining and developing approaches to copyright, we will showcase examples, look into the CDSM Directive and beyond, discuss the challenges that remain and the opportunities to be seized, and together we will explore and shape what comes next.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While parts of the Europeana web conference on 5-6 October are invite-only, aimed at cultural policymakers from EU Member States, two sessions are open to all those interested in culture and copyright.\_ On 5 October, ‘Past, present and future of copyright and digital transformation’ looks at opportunities in the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive. And on 6 October, you can join ‘From policy to practice: copyright frameworks, standards and case studies to support the digital transformation of CHIS’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-web-conference-under-the-german-presidency-2020-tickets-117263591559\">Register now</a> to take part in\_ a rich interactive experience, digging deep into ideas, inspiring each other in new directions and taking some valuable insight home.

        title: 'Opening up conversations - how we are selecting proposals for Europeana 2020'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>With the call for proposals for Europeana 2020 open, and some exciting suggestions already coming in, Susan Hazan and Marco Rendina take a look at the role of the Europeana 2020 Selection Committee, its criteria for evaluating proposals, and how we are working to make the conference a truly co-created event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Opening up conversations during a pandemic</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This year has been a year like no other, and has presented challenges and opportunities unlike any we have faced before.\_ The global pandemic and the ensuing lockdown demanded that as an Initiative, we build upon our strengths and reimagine our roles in contributing to an open, knowledgeable and creative society through fostering digital capacity.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the beginning of the pandemic, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>, together with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators'\_Forum</a> (EAF) and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> (ENA) joined forces to support the cultural heritage sector in responding to the challenges posed and catalysed by this global crisis. One of the lessons we learned was about opening up conversations through online events, and we found new ways to connect beyond our traditional partners and networks to a far larger audience. \_Over the past few months, around 1,600 individuals registered to join these conversations via <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars\">webinars</a>, and an extraordinary number, of more than 500 professionals, subsequently joined the ENA over this period. At the same time, the EAF and its pan-European network of national and domain/thematic aggregators hosted several online capacity building events that supported hundreds of cultural heritage institutions in developing their digital skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Opening up Europeana 2020</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To continue enriching the Europeana Initiative with new perspectives, we have decided to open up 70% of the programme of our upcoming conference to listen to, and learn from, these new voices. Our\_Europeana 2020 programme committee includes representatives from the Foundation, the ENA and the EAF, and are responsible for selecting our keynote speakers and panelists. To make the event truly participatory they have also drafted a\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2020-we-re-looking-for-your-contribution\">call for proposals</a>\_and invited others\_to co-create the conference with us.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The call is open until September 30, and in addition to the application form, we encourage everyone to prepare a short video of 45 to 90 seconds to pitch their proposal. We are not asking for anything highly polished - even a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-FBnsM-1ka4\">video shot in the sunshine</a> will do. We look forward to hearing from those who nurture cultural heritage and are eager to share their experiences, their inspirational practice and, of course their dreams of celebrating culture. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2020-we-re-looking-for-your-contribution\">Find out more about the call.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana 2020 selection committee and criteria</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Selection Committee for these proposals includes a representative from each of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">six ENA Communities,</a> a representative from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Aggregators'\_Forum</a>, the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, and, of course, from the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>. Additionally, our call for proposals details how we would like to give the stage to proposals that will help others create meaningful and lasting social change. This could include ways to address difficult questions around how privilege affects access to culture and inclusivity, gathering diverse opinions, and developing guides on supporting social justice or greening-up their daily activities. To support this goal, the Selection Committee also includes representatives who are working on Inclusivity and Diversity initiatives across Europeana, as well as a representative from our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Selection Committee is pleased to publish the criteria they will be using to evaluate and choose the proposals for Europeana 2020, ensuring transparency for everyone who submits an application. You can see the full criteria <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference-call-for-proposals#selection-committee-and-selection-criteria\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 2020 selection process will go through several iterations with a strict timeline, in a blind review with all proposals considered for both Europeana 2020 as well as Europeana’s digital programme 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can view the selection committee and criteria on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference-call-for-proposals\">call for proposals</a> page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Submit your proposal\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are encouraging our speakers to be as creative and inspirational as they desire in this call for interactive and engaging talks, events, workshops, sessions or interventions. Proposals can be for sessions ranging anything from five minutes to an hour and we look forward to reviewing your proposal as soon as the call closes on September 30.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a science person that followed his heart to study history, I was happy to see the rise of computers in the humanities and the need for people who could mediate between both disciplines. I started as a heritage expert for a small IT management company. Their ambition to make heritage digital put me to work at various Dutch museums. I then became project manager at the University Library of Amsterdam. When Europeana began, I was a consultant for DEN, the Dutch knowledge Center for Digital Heritage. For them I was a work package leader in Europeana Inside, and program manager of Heritage and Location. Last year I helped the municipal archive of Rotterdam to migrate to a new archival management system. Starting this year, I divide my time between being a cultural entrepreneur and part-time employee at a museum again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an information manager for the <a href=\"https://www.annefrank.org/en/\">Anne Frank House</a>, one of the most popular Dutch museums funded by the father of one of the most admired people in the world, I am working on digital transformation in practice. I am starting at the base. Firstly, I am working with my colleagues in curation to make the collection, including the famous diary and the hiding place, usable and visible online. Secondly, I’m working on organising the infrastructure (information, technology, people) that emerged out of a decade of ICT projects into a basic architecture that is flexible, sustainable (also in terms of costs) and valuable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In search of a new digital way to tell young people about Anne Frank’s life story, Every Media and the Anne Frank House recently developed&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcSbG8QD7yQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Anne Frank&nbsp;video diary</a>: an online video series airing on YouTube and based on the diary of Anne Frank. The series made a big impact worldwide, enhanced by the fact that its&nbsp;broadcast coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. One episode got almost one million views, despite the fact that, because of copyright restrictions, it was not accessible in some countries like the United States.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Six months ago, I would have answered: making the organisation digitally aware- getting colleagues to understand that digital is not just another way of working, but requires a reinvention of their profession. Nowadays, it is COVID-19. Being a self-supporting organisation, our revenues dropped dramatically as a result of the pandemic. For the next two years, we have to cut a substantial number of our full-time employees. In the long run, we have to change the business model. Now that is the element I like, but I am afraid my job might be lost.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was elected, I worked as a consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.den.nl\">Dutch knowledge center for digital heritage</a>. I stepped forward as a candidate because I believed my broad experience across heritage and my independence would benefit ENA and as such I convinced the voters. I am very glad to say that even though my professional perspective changed completely, Europeana still helps me a lot on the job and I am convinced that my personal experiences from the digital heritage ecosystem are valuable within the council.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Run for a second term with a special focus on the interest of smaller institutions which, as with the Anne Frank House at the moment, find it a challenge to allow their staff members to focus on ENA activities during their working hours. I want to work on behalf of these institutions within the ENA.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We are excited to launch an upcoming series of webinars to support professionals in using the Europeana Impact playbook, supporting you to better plan, measure and understand the impact that digital cultural heritage creates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>“We believe that we are all better off if we understand how the things we do every day, week and month contribute to bringing about a change in people's lives.” <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Impact Community</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2015, we’ve been developing the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Playbook</a> so that we can better plan, measure and understand the impact that digital cultural heritage creates. We’re now launching a series of five webinars designed to take you through the Playbook, and to discuss what we mean by impact, why it’s important to think about your impact, and how you can best start measuring it. We’ll introduce the four phases of the methodology and some new developments, and illustrate this with case studies of how it has been applied in practice, with speakers with first hand experience from right across Europe. Throughout the series, we’ll be encouraging webinar participants to use the Playbook in their work and send their feedback to us (and potentially also join us in the webinars).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of five webinars gives us time to walk through the different steps of the Playbook, and capture the feedback and questions of those who are joining us along the way. However, anyone is welcome to join at any time. Each webinar runs between 15.00-16.00 and is scheduled as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/what-s-in-the-name-what-impact-means-for-us\">30 September 2020 - an introduction to what we mean by impact</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/design-your-impact-impact-playbook-phase-1\">28 October 2020 -\_ designing\_ your impact assessment</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/get-the-data-impact-playbook-phase-2\">25 November 2020 - get the data (right)</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/narrating-and-sharing-your-impact-story-impact-playbook-phase-3\">27 January 2021 - narrating and sharing\_ your impact story</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/looking-back-at-the-impact-assessment-process-phase-4\" target=\"_blank\">24 February 2021 - looking back - evaluating your processes</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our goal and how we’ll get there</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With external speakers and guests from outside of the Europeana Initiative, we’ll contextualise our work on impact assessment within the context of accelerated digital change brought about by the challenges of responding to the Covid-19 crisis. We want to explore what impact assessment means and how it can help us better understand and communicate the value of (digital) cultural heritage during these difficult times and in the future.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phases one and two of the Impact Playbook are <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=3fb954e84b\" target=\"_blank\">published online</a>, with phases three and four still in development. We’ll present the first outlines of those phases and illustrate potential approaches through a series of case studies, but most importantly, you, as the audience, will be able to help shape their development.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>About the Impact Playbook</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Impact Playbook </a>is an intuitive and collaboratively-designed guide to help you take your first steps through impact planning, measurement and narration. You can read more about it on Europeana Pro, but you don’t have to have any background knowledge to join the webinar series. If you’re interested in being more involved, you can join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Community</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Registration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Registration for future webinars will open shortly via Eventbrite - keep checking our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\" target=\"_blank\">event page</a>\_for information on how to join.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can watch recordings of these Impact webinars on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars#impact\">Europeana Pro webinars page</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>In summer 2020, as part of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">capacity building project</a>, we commissioned independent charity Culture24 to produce a report to help develop a shared understanding of what is happening in our sector to support digital capacity, to consider what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions and to provide a snapshot of digital capacity building initiatives in the sector.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This report was commissioned in conjunction with our community led peer-to-peer sensemaking workshops, a process that involved 64 participants from 22 countries over three weeks during the month of June 2020. The process was part of an ongoing effort by the Europeana Foundation to investigate digital transformation and capacity building across the European cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture24 worked closely with the Europeana Foundation and Michael Peter Edson and Jasper Visser during this period, and this report is intended to complement the workshops’ findings and outcomes.

        title: 'European Commission awards more than €900,000 to two new Europeana Generic Services projects'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The European Commission has approved funding for two new projects that will work to increase\_ the amount of high-quality content shared with Europeana - Europeana Sport and the Art of Reading in the Middle Ages (ARMA).</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The projects were in the reserved list of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2019-europeana\">2019 Europeana CEF Telecom call</a>, and were officially granted later funding in May 2020.\_The projects originally funded under this call were <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/pagode-europeana-china\">Pagode</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana Sport</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport</a> aims to increase the amount of high-quality content and metadata on the theme of sport in Europeana. The project will hold a series of events that aim to engage European citizens with their sporting heritage and raise awareness of the Europeana Initiative.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project coordinator, Antonio Davide Madonna\_from Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche, says, ‘Sport has the potential to attract a large audience and it is naturally linked to several topics of high social and educational value, such as cultural diversity, integration, social exclusion, gender equality, youth empowerment, and more.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Besides collecting high quality content from several cultural institutions, the project also aims to generate new content and new stories involving European citizens in their local communities, through the organisation of co-creation sessions and participatory events.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>ARMA</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/the-art-of-reading-in-the-middle-ages-arma\">ARMA - the art of reading in the middle ages</a>, aims to showcase how medieval reading culture evolved and became a fundamental part of European culture, through editorial activity and bringing newly digitised manuscripts to Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project Coordinator Doc. dr. Ines Vodopivec from National and University Library of Slovenia says, ‘The Art of Reading in the Middle Ages will gather over 20,000 digitized medieval objects from across Europe in a virtual ARMA-rium\_ – a digital bookcase of the European medieval written culture. The CEF funded Action will \"unlock\" the potential of digitised medieval manuscripts through curatorial and editorial enrichment of originals,\_enabling their educational contexts and further exchange of knowledge and experiences among curators and educators at cultural heritage institutions’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation is a beneficiary in both projects, joining partners from 10 EU countries as well as the United Kingdom. Milena Popova, Programme and Business Development Manager at Europeana says, ‘We are very pleased with the launch of the two new Europeana Generic Services projects. Both Europeana Sport and ARMA have a unique content focus and envisage robust audience engagement approaches, from participatory events on sport heritage to memorable educational experiences with medieval culture. We are looking forward to working with the project partners to deliver even more appealing and interactive digital cultural experiences for European and global audiences’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The projects will start on 1 October 2020 and run until early 2022.\_</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Union is working to create the infrastructure that will support its citizens, sectors and public administrations in their access to digital services. It is building ‘digital bridges’, through what it calls Digital Service Infrastructures&nbsp; (DSIs), to provide access to those services for the benefit of all. Europeana is the DSI that delivers services to showcase and provide online access to Europe’s digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana service is provided by a consortium of 21 partners, coordinated by the Europeana Foundation, and is funded under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We are currently on the fourth round of DSI funding for Europeana and so our current project is named ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi-4\">Europeana DSI-4</a>’. The second year of the DSI-4 project ended on 31 August, and so we are now embarking on the third year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">One year ends...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The coronavirus pandemic continues to affect all of us and we see that clearly in the ongoing challenges facing the cultural heritage sector. Many people are adapting to new ways of working, and we must thank all for their continued dedication and hard work, including Europeana Foundation staff, our partners and friends in the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and all of the projects we are part of across the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital transformation of the sector is accelerating, and together this year we have been exploring how the sector is reacting, and how we can build sustainable digital strategies to support it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An annual report for year two of Europeana DSI-4 highlights the great strides taken over the last 12 months. We’ve seen both the public-facing <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana collections website</a> and our site for professionals, Europeana Pro, renewed and made more accessible. We’ve seen the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum accredit a total of 38 aggregators, and develop a new aggregation strategy. And we’ve seen the Europeana Network Association come together at Europeana 2019 Connect Communities and its specialist communities, Task Forces and Working Groups continue to work together on issues common to the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n"

Its work takes the new<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\"> Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a> to heart, splitting our activities into three work areas, mapped to the three priorities in the strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1: Strengthening the infrastructure</strong>. This work area makes data publishing easier, continues to improve the Europeana collections website experience, and the discoverability of the digital cultural content and ensures our products are reliable and perform well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Improving data quality</strong>. Measures improve the quality and interoperability of content and metadata and enriches them through crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence and machine-learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Capacity building for digital transformation</strong>. Here, we develop events and training for aggregators and cultural heritage professionals. The Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum are maintained and nurtured, and specialist communities such as research grown, with Europeana Pro remaining the focal point for communications. National infrastructures are strengthened through engagement with Member States and a growing evidence bank of digital transformation activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An additional work package takes care of the administration and programme management elements associated with running&nbsp; DSI-4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plan for the coming year covers work done by the Europeana Foundation, its consortium of 21 partners, plus the Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators’ Forum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Julia Schellenberg, Europeana Foundation’s Programme Coordinator says, ‘The Europeana team look forward to the progress planned for the upcoming year and would like to express our sincere gratitude to all members of the consortium and all network members who donate their time and expertise voluntarily to make the Europeana Initiative a success.’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you'd like to get involved with our upcoming activities, please join the Europeana Network Association.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana 2020 will take place online between 11 and 13 November and you can now secure your place for free. Read on to find out more about our <em>designed for digital</em> conference and how together, we can build capacity in our sector to help create meaningful and positive change in our society.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Exploring the landscape of change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2020 explores the landscape of change in the digital cultural sector. Our powerful keynotes will discuss how we empower change through human, technological, policy and GLAM lenses. Dream with us and look to the future to help contribute to a sustainable, responsible and inspiring cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A conference developed by and designed for you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2020 is for you! We developed our conference themes through conversations with cultural heritage professionals, and our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2020-we-re-looking-for-your-contribution\">call for proposals</a> opened the floor to the sector. So if you work in, with or around digital cultural heritage, or you want to learn about it, make sure that you secure your place today.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Online and interactive\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Get involved by taking part in three days of panel discussions, workshops and more. We’re building a programme that will offer something for everyone, and you’ll be able to create your own programme to get the most out of it for you and your organisation. Plus, you can follow and join in post-session reflections shared live from the Netherlands as well as join discussions on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Connect with other professionals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just because it’s digital doesn’t mean we need to miss out on the important coffee breaks and evening socials. You will be able to join in with our fringe events, from a pub quiz to virtual tours, storytelling to sharing memes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Skill up</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2020 aims to help you develop your capacity for working with digital cultural heritage. Whether you want to learn the basics or gain a new skill, develop your knowledge or refine existing practice, there is something for everyone. And if you miss a session, want to share with a colleague or simply want to relive it, the majority of sessions will be recorded and made available for attendees so you have a permanent resource to inspire and inform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Secure your free place now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make Europeana 2020 as open and accessible as we can. This includes making it free, quick and easy to secure your place. Due to changing COVID-19 restrictions we need to be flexible in our planning, and therefore for now we’re asking you to<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2020-tickets-85762561129\"> secure your place</a> using our digital programme planner, Sched. From there you will be able to pick and choose the sessions that mean the most to you and join hundreds of other cultural heritage professionals from your PC, laptop, mobile phone or tablet as together we explore crisis, change and culture in the digital heritage sector.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'European Parliament Archives to curate 20 original exhibitions over four years in 24 languages'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Following the success of the ‘70th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, 9 May 1950’ exhibition, launched in May 2020 by Europeana and the\_<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/historicalarchives/en/home.html\">European Parliament Archives</a>, we are pleased to announce a partnership which will see the Archives unit curate around 20 exhibitions over the next four years for publication on the Europeana website.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Each exhibition will be published in 24 languages and accompanied by a short educational video subtitled in 24 languages that will be shared on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Addressing themes of democracy, peace and solidarity, the exhibitions will be produced in close collaboration with several departments of the European Parliament. Support will also come from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ep_newshound?lang=en\">Newshound</a> - the European Parliament’s monthly staff magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the partnership progresses, the Europeana Foundation will work with European Parliament Archives staff to allow them to work directly with the content management system to build the exhibitions themselves. This is part of ongoing work to help institutions to build their capacity and empower them with new digital skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas McCarthy, Europeana’s Collections Engagement Manager, says, ‘We're enormously pleased that the European Parliament Archives has chosen Europeana to support its extensive 2020-2024 exhibitions programme. Combining modern social and political history with extensive multilingual provision, these exhibitions promise engaging new experiences for Europeana's audiences.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ludovic Delepine, Head of the European Parliament Archives Unit, says, 'COVID-19 cases continue to rise in many EU Member States and national authorities are taking further measures to limit the spread of the virus. In this context, it's ever more important to embrace digital. The first partnership to deliver a digital exhibition with Europeana was a successful experience. Now we are working to make it \_\"business as usual\". With digital in mind, we have looked at the content in our exhibitions and are now including not just iconographic assets but also archive documents. We are looking for the right balance between images and texts and we look forward to finding out what our audience thinks of the new exhibition.' \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It was 30 years ago</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The second of this new programme of exhibitions is now online. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/exhibitions/30-years-ago-the-european-parliament-and-german-reunification\">‘It was 30 years ago</a>’ explores the European Parliament, the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the night from 9 to 10 November 1989, with absolutely no warning, the Berlin Wall opened at the same time as the communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) collapsed. The Cold War was coming to an end and a momentous page was being turned in Europe’s history. A month later, the Brandenburg Gate officially opened, definitively restoring free movement between the two Germanies. On 3 October 1990, German unification was achieved, effectively transforming the future of European integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the speed of events, the European Parliament played its role to the full, stepping up its efforts in response to these political developments. For several months, it provided a forum for the European leaders tasked with preparing the reunification of Germany. Concerned with the political, economic and institutional implications of this historic moment for the European Community, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) supported German reunification, increasingly calling for democratisation and respect for human rights in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition explores the building and the fall of the Berlin Wall and the European Parliament’s response to it.\_</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Art. History. Gaming. Education. The 2020 edition of GIF IT UP has it all. This annual competition, organised by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>, <a href=\"https://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</a>, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\">DigitalNZ</a>, challenges people to use digitised cultural heritage material to produce unique GIFs and share them online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the competition has an appeal to all culture lovers, encouraging students to make GIFs in educational contexts can also offer young people an opportunity to animate and engage with cultural heritage. This was evident during the two workshops we organised&nbsp;in 2018 with teachers and students at the Ion Neculce National College, Romania, in the special context of that year: marking 100 years since the end of WWI and the Great Union of Romania.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first workshop, students learned about Europeana’s impressive <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/83-1914-1918\">WWI and 1914-1918 collections</a> and participated in ‘Kahoot sessions’, where participants&nbsp;answer questions live (the answers are at times surprising and amusing). In the second workshop, they learned how to create GIFs&nbsp;using images from the same collections. The students learned a lot during those events while also having fun. After all, we already <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/romanian-students-engage-with-europeana-wwi-content\">had a long tradition </a>of using Europeana’s collections as educational material and inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anamaria Şune, a student at the Ion Neculce college, took part in the competition for the first time when she was 15 years old and managed to win the <a href=\"https://gifitup.net/winners-2018/\">People’s Choice Award in 2018</a>.&nbsp; In a short interview, she talks about her experience taking part in the competition - you can watch the interview and read a transcript below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>You&nbsp; probably know by now that the GIF IT UP competition is back again. Are you going to take part in this edition?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course! I can’t wait to make another GIF. It will be the third time for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you remember how it was when you participated for the first time?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I remember. I was in the 9th grade at the Ion Neculce College when we learned how to create a GIF during those interesting workshops organised by Europeana, the Romanian Academy Library and our college in 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Did you find it difficult to create GIFs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I first heard we have to use images from a huge digital archive like Europeana I thought it was difficult. I like to discover things&nbsp;quickly. With so many million pieces I didn’t know where to start from. But during our last workshop, with many examples, I found it easier to make. Europeana’s page about how to create GIFs was also helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did you actually learn during this experience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First of all I learned how to create GIFs. I learned how to search more quickly in such a huge deposit. I also found out about copyright, what images we can use from and what not. Still don’t know all about it, but to better look for ‘public domain’ items. My colleagues mainly used the Europeana 1914-1918 collection for their GIFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you feel when you received the Public Choice Award?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For me, this competition was a wonderful adventure. Emotions, cries, and a long waiting for the result. It was amazing and I learned so much about my&nbsp;country’s history. I felt as I did something very important and in the same time had a lot of fun! I discovered ‘a new me’!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-122b33c5-7fff-e506-c80e-947b251e80a5\">Thank you Anamaria!</b></p>\r\n"

As partners in the Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-dsi\">Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)</a>, Europeana and CLARIN are working together to embed cultural heritage content into CLARIN’s infrastructure. Since an initial pilot integration in 2017, CLARIN has regularly updated and extended the selection of cultural heritage objects it includes in its Virtual Language Observatory (VLO). This online search and discovery service focuses on the needs of scholars looking for language resources, and is integrated into the wider CLARIN infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New resources for researchers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A key part&nbsp;of this integration is improving user access to online analysis and processing possibilities for any resource found through the VLO. Such functionalities are available for a wide variety of cultural heritage resources 'harvested'&nbsp;through Europeana, ranging from renaissance era manuscripts and digitised newspapers to historical children’s books and oral history recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April 2019, we wrote about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/clarin-and-europeana-make-discovery-and-processing-quick-and-easy-for-135-000-cultural-heritage-objects\">the first resource integration</a>. We showed a powerful example of how people can process a language resource directly from their browser with a few clicks after discovering it. At that point, about 135,000 records had been sourced from Europeana and included in the VLO. Since then, we have carried out two additional iterations of selection and integration, resulting in over 275,000 records from Europeana, which is more than any other individual provider of metadata records currently in the VLO. Below, we present two additional examples of resources that are currently available, and demonstrate how they can be processed further.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-d860b5a7-7fff-6028-1260-902d03054fdb\">‘O kimmeryjskich pomnikach w Krymie’</b><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'<a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/record/europeana_58_item_47_0940431_47__nnbZXps\">O kimmeryjskich pomnikach w Krymie</a>', is a Polish book from 1882, provided by the Federacja Bibliotek Cyfrowych as a PDF, with its full text content available as a result of OCR (optical character recognition). As the animation below shows, someone using the VLO can explore processing options by selecting a link to an individual file and processing it with the Language Resource Switchboard. For this record, a variety of interesting natural language processing tools are available, most of them provided by the Polish CLARIN-PL consortium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The tool that offers this type of analysis for Polish is <a href=\"https://ws.clarin-pl.eu/respa.shtml\">ReSpa</a>. It can be started directly from the Switchboard, and by doing so researchers can quickly gain an understanding of the content of a work without even opening it! This can also be helpful to those who don’t read Polish, as the topic list can easily be translated using a generic text translation tool such as Google Translate. For this example, we can find out within a few minutes that, based on the content of the book, its main topic is monuments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A sector in crisis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the COVID-19 pandemic hit and institutions across Europe were forced to close their doors to visitors, we saw cultural heritage institutions demonstrate elasticity in response to the crisis in interesting, creative and effective ways, particularly when their collections are available in digital formats. However, it also presented new digital, financial, structural and personnel based challenges for a sector where no two institutions are alike. And COVID-19 is not the only crisis facing the cultural heritage sector. 2020 also brought further pressure for it to reassert its relevance to society - a society that demands, rightfully, better representation of its diversity from a sector that has a history of presenting largely only the perspectives of the elite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But in crises there are opportunities. We believe a cultural sector powered by digital will contribute to a Europe powered by culture, giving it a resilient, growing economy, increased employment, improved well-being and a sense of European identity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reacting and reflecting</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like many others across the sector, at Europeana we took a number of steps to react to the crisis, from <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-working-with-you-in-the-time-of-coronavirus\">working from home</a>, moving to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars\">online events</a>, creating and showcasing <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/working-with-you-and-for-you-in-the-time-of-covid-19\">resources for professionals</a> in the sector, producing <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/pandemics\">topical editorial</a> and leading a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe\">Discovering Europe</a> season to promote local tourism. We also wanted to provide a considered response, and took time to reflect and plan a project that would bring in voices from our community to help us map out how we can support capacity building in our sector and identify what institutions need to be well-supported in their digital transformation. From this, these two reports were born.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sense-making</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In June 2020 we launched a series of workshops that called upon our community to bring their perspective, experience and expertise together to identify new paths through - and beyond - the COVID-19 crisis for digital cultural heritage. The peer-to-peer conversations and discussions held in these workshops are presented in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-sense-making-workshops-findings-and-outcomes\">Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19 - sense-making workshops findings and outcomes</a>, written by digital strategists and the workshop facilitators Michael Peter Edson, and Jasper Visser.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Concurrent to the workshops, we worked closely with independent charity Culture24 to produce a complementary report <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-digital-transformation-agenda-and-glams-culture24-findings-and-outcomes\">The digital transformation agenda and GLAMs - Culture24 findings and outcomes</a>. By interviewing eight global leaders in the digital cultural heritage sector, considering what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions, and providing a snapshot of digital capacity building initiatives in the sector, this report builds on the themes that emerged from the workshops to help develop a shared understanding of what building digital capacity in our sector really means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The findings and outcomes from these reports are extremely rich and we encourage you to download and explore them, to compare your perspectives to those in the report and to consider how you can help us develop our thinking. At Europeana Foundation we’ve been doing this ourselves, and we have identified some key themes arising from both reports that are significant and urgent and which we will explore as a priority. Furthermore, we have agreed the need for a definition of ‘digital transformation’ that works for our network, and we’ll be working with our partners in the initiative (Europeana Network Association, Europeana Aggregators Forum) to agree this. We’ve listed the three themes we’ve identified as most pressing below, and for each we’ll be exploring questions such as how does this change what we do, and what else do we need to be doing to support our partners and network?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital divides</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>‘There is growing acceptance of the potential for digital, but at the same time, there is a lack of common vocabulary with which to talk about it.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reports highlight that the digital divide is much wider than we had previously thought. These divides can be social and technological, as well as between those who can access, are represented, and feel welcomed by digital cultural heritage and those who don’t. The divide also runs between countries who have well articulated digital strategies and infrastructures in place, and those who don’t. They run between institutions that have differing levels of digital capacity and capabilities, and even within institutions where staff have differing levels of digital literacy and skills. Crucially, digital divides are about our <a href=\"https://medium.com/@janefinnis/why-digitally-literate-leadership-is-so-important-right-now-3c2d9b214dde\">processes as much as systems and about people as much as hardware</a>. Bridging these divides will require different strategies, including investigating how our networks and narratives become more diverse and inclusive; and in parallel exploring&nbsp; how we can scale up the levels of technological maturity across institutions and countries in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Agency for change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>'There is a strong desire for change in the sector but a sense of inability to act on it.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because digital literacy is as much about understanding technology as it is about the human dynamics of change, both reports point to a need for professionals to develop ‘soft skills’ such as empathy, compassion, persuasion, change management, collaboration and other ‘non-digital’ skills to be ready for, support and lead digital change. These skills - combined with digital skills - can help foster digitally literate leadership at all levels of organisations. This means that we need to develop these skills ourselves and develop didactical approaches to transmit these skills, at scale, through the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregators Forum. We will need to take these insights onboard when we develop our capacity building framework in the year to come.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Collaboration is key</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>‘We need to think of the GLAM sector as, ‘one big company.’ Like a multinational organisation, in this company, we already share infrastructure, resources, knowledge, and experiences and could do this more in the future.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Underpinning much of the discussion in the workshops, successful examples of capacity building initiatives and the reports themselves, collaboration is seen as a key way to support and develop people’s digital skills and literacies. In a scenario where many museums, libraries and archives face (financial) difficulties it will be even more important than before to find efficiencies and economies of scale. Workshop participants noted how valuable being given the space to address these challenges with peers was. We will need to find out where the most pressing needs are, develop more of these opportunities to learn from each other, and develop and adopt shared standards and share infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Download the reports, draw your own conclusions and get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Foundation will work with the Europeana Network Association and Europeana Aggregators Forum in the coming months to explore how we can build on the reports and support the sector in these three areas as the start of an ongoing dialogue. That dialogue will be flexible, and working together we’ll agree on the different forms that it will take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s clear that there are many other themes and opportunities for us as a sector to consider and address. At <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2020</a>, the themes for our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2020-we-re-looking-for-your-contribution\">call for proposals</a> were taken from these reports and as we continue to explore the reports we expect to draw more out. We encourage you to download them, work with colleagues and networks to explore them and stay tuned for opportunities to collaborate with us as we further develop our capacity building work. You can use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BuildDigitalCapacity&amp;src=typeahead_click&amp;f=live\">#BuildDigitalCapacity </a>to discuss your thoughts, and if you haven’t already, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join our network</a> to become part of the biggest community of cultural heritage professionals in Europe.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Multilingual access to extend the reach and impact of the Europeana collections website has been a long term goal for Europeana, stretching back to 2009. Users also have growing needs and expectations for accessing material in alternative languages, based on their other experiences online. The vision of a full multilingual experience, for all 24 official languages of the European Union, is now within the realms of possibility because of technological advances. However capability, resourcing, and technical complexity are all current issues that limit the speed at which progress can be made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delivering on this strategy requires Europeana to break new ground for the cultural sector, and for this reason R&amp;D and implementation will need to iterate together. Expert solutions are proposed in this strategy, but will likely still evolve as experiments prove or disprove the proposals. Multilingual use cases addressed in this strategy cover the ability to navigate the Europeana website, read editorial content and website copy, search, and read item text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The core solutions for searching and reading item text across languages rely upon the:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Use of trusted vocabularies that come with existing multilingual coverage of metadata;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Translation of all metadata and text to English, so it can act as a pivot language for the areas not covered by the trusted vocabularies.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Multilingual coverage of the user interface, editorial and website copy, metadata, and full text content will be additionally supported by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Paid and community translators;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Use of real-time translation services from English to fill translation gaps.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the full strategy below.\_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>In addition to supporting the needs of the Europeana APIs and website, technical developments for Metis (the platform used by the Europeana Foundation to manage the aggregation of collection datasets from aggregators and cultural heritage institutions)\_need to consider the digital transformation needs of cultural heritage instiutions\_and aggregators in line with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a>. Aggregators need to see faster and more efficient publishing options, and CHIs need to see more value from being involved. The expectations of increased speed, improved data quality, and continual growth will put significant pressure on services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on user research, six use cases were explored, covering the use of current services, more regular updates, faster publishing, easier onboarding, improved data quality\_and improved content support. In response to these use cases, seven goal areas have been proposed as an interlocking solution to focus on over the coming years:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Maintain the current Metis service</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Speed up dataset updates</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Involve contributors in testing\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Enable fast track publishing workflow</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Add new data source options</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Encourage data enrichment</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Investigate content hosting</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Central to this strategy is the concept of an Extended Sandbox, that will provide aggregators and cultural heritage institutions\_with ways to speed up the publishing process and support digital transformation with new reporting and enrichment tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the full strategy below.\_</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>EuroClio, the European Association of History Educators, has recently produced a case study providing insights into the use of online collections for and by educators. In this post, we take a look at some of the key findings, which aim to help cultural heritage institutions understand how to make their content more accessible for education.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>COVID-19, cultural heritage and education</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted many of our old habits, and the cultural and the education sectors face unprecedented challenges. From having to close down physical spaces to reaching audiences online, these sectors have had to make quick steps towards digital transformation at a time when the potential and need for digital cultural heritage in education might never have been greater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of work has already been done to provide access to digital collections for use in education (<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">take a look at Europeana Classroom</a>). Yet in spite of this, or more likely because of it, there is still more that can be done to make online collections fit for education.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Fit for Education case study</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To encourage cooperation between people working in the fields of education and cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/euroclio\">EuroClio</a> has produced a case study providing insights into the use of online collections for and by educators. The case study is based on work done by EuroClio, historians and history educators from its network, who have worked to find and present over 1,000 sources from Europeana in more than 60 <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/historical-content\">source collections,</a>\_available at Historiana, EuroClio’s online platform.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case study aims to help cultural heritage institutions understand what educators look for while searching online collections, and how to make their content more accessible for education. These insights can help suggest the order in which pieces from collections can be digitised and help institutes think about reducing barriers to access.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Key findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The case study found that in order to use digitised heritage in practice, educators need relevant sources as well as clear and detailed information about these sources and their copyright. After all, a choice to use a source can be determined by these two factors. But how can cultural heritage institutions meet these demands and provide this information to educators in the most straightforward way possible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Relevant sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the possibility for teachers to explore individually chosen subjects varies, most are constrained by a (national) curriculum. This means that teachers and educators are likely to browse online collections with a specific idea of what they are looking for. In addition, teachers will often lack the time to fully explore a collection, or may not be aware of what sources are available.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help them in this process, cultural heritage institutions can start by researching relevant educational curriculums and ensuring that an online collection offers sources that relate to the them (without this leading to a limitation on the broader collections). A good strategy may be to curate your content according to broader themes and topics so that teachers can immediately browse all your content related to the Cold War, for instance, in one click.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clear and detailed information about the source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once teachers have identified sources that may be relevant to their classroom, to be able to fully exploit a source, they need to have a certain amount of information about the source available, such as the date of creation, the author and\_the purpose of the source. Indeed, a source can have different meanings depending on the context, time, author. As such, if the information relating to the source is as precise as possible, the teachers will know better how to use it. A good strategy to help them may be to think about the order in which you present information in descriptions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reuse possibilities for education\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure that teachers can use your source, they need to know that it is available for reuse, at least for educational purposes. Indeed, there is a copyright statement, <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/page/InC-EDU/1.0/?language=en\">In Copyright – Educational Use Permitted,</a> which informs people\_that the work is protected,\_ but also allows explicitly for educational use. In cases where cultural institutes do not or cannot opt for open licenses, 'In Copyright – Educational Use Permitted', is a good alternative. As well as ensuring the information is clear, institutions can consider providing a contact link in case teachers have more specific questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘Good enough’ quality for digitisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality of digitised sources often varies. For commercial use, it is very important that the quality is very high. For education however, the criterias can be different. Consider a source containing a text and an image where the text has the most educational value. In this case, the source can still be used by educators if at least the text is readable when enlarged, or an institution provides the transcript or translation of the text in the description. That way, the most important part of the source is still accessible to the educator and their students and can\_be used in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find more details and further insights by reading the full case study through the link below.\_</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Over the past few weeks, we have been inviting Europeana Network Association members to come forward as candidates for the Members Council. Today, we have the pleasure of introducing the 35 people who will be running in this year’s elections, each hoping to win one of the nine available seats. You can read more about each of them on the dedicated <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/members-council-election-candidates\">Elections page</a> and explore their profiles below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The candidates have varied areas of expertise, with&nbsp;their professional activities taking place in areas including academia, education&nbsp;and research, as well as organisations including GLAMS, non-profit and the creative industries. Amongst them, you can find many teachers, researchers, curators, archivists, librarians and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These candidates have interests in a broad variety of areas that they wish to work on and represent as Councillors: education, research, innovation and technical development, open data, copyright, policy, and impact. We are also pleased to see some candidates new to Europeana, and with varied length of experience in the cultural heritage sector. This wide range of interests and expertise will allow us to select the very best representatives for the ENA members and leaders of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">six ENA communities</a>, Task Forces and Working Groups for the coming three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The candidates have an opportunity to campaign and will be seeking your support from now until the elections kick-off during the General Assembly meeting 2020 of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">Europeana 2020 conference</a> on 12 November. We invite you to follow their campaigns on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?lang=en\">Twitter</a> (under the hashtag #EuropeanaElects), and in the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\">Europeana LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once we launch the elections at the General Assembly, our members will have one week until 20 November to select up to nine of their preferred candidates in the online voting. Additionally,&nbsp; members will vote on formal Association documents such as the Annual and Financial Reports. The results of the Council elections will be announced on 23 November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can meet the candidates below, and we wish them all the best of luck!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month, Clemens Neudecker discusses his work as a research advisor at the Berlin State Library and the value of being part of the Europeana Network Association.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During my studies, I met a student couple who were blind. I found that I could assist them by scanning and applying text recognition software (OCR) to literature to allow the contents to be displayed on a Braille keyboard or read out by a text-to-speech software. Later, the Digitisation Center of the Bavarian State Library was looking for someone with experience in OCR and I started working there while completing my studies. Soon I became responsible for creating an OCR workflow for the digital library and a few years later, the KB National Library of the Netherlands offered me a job as Technical Manager for the European OCR project <a href=\"http://www.impact-project.eu/\">IMPACT</a>. So I decided to move to the Netherlands, where I spent a wonderful five years in the Research Department of the KB. Six years ago, I moved back to Germany and joined the <a href=\"http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de\">Berlin State Library</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during my first working week in The Hague that I met with Julie Verleyen Terzi and Antoine Isaac from Europeana. Today, almost 12 years after first learning about Europeana, I still collaborate with Antoine and many Europeana Network Association members on a regular basis. The profound work relationships that develop between European cultural heritage professionals has made being part of the Europeana community the most rewarding for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My role is two-fold: as a Research Advisor, I advise the Deputy Director General on the development and implementation of the research strategy of the Berlin State Library and assist other departments and colleagues in their research activities and proposals. I also try to keep a close eye on current research in relevant information and communications technology (ICT) and\_ library and information science (LIS) fields and the digital humanities, identify areas of interest or opportunities for collaboration for the library and initiate proposals and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My other role is that of a Project Coordinator. When we are successful with a proposal, I often take on an active role in these projects by leading a work package or contributing in some other capacity. Next to continuing the work on Europeana Newspapers and the <a href=\"https://www.dnb.de/EN/Professionell/ProjekteKooperationen/Projekte/DDB-Zeitungsportal/DDB-Zeitungsportal_node.html\">German Newspaper Portal</a>, I currently have a few other projects in my portfolio that range across topics such as <a href=\"https://ocr-d.de/en/\">text recognition</a>, <a href=\"https://qurator.ai/\">artificial intelligence</a> or <a href=\"https://sonar.fh-potsdam.de/\">social network analysis</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I can still find some free time, I also like to diversify and start a <a href=\"https://lab.sbb.berlin/?lang=en\">lab</a> or help to organise hackathons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the broad range of responsibilities I have, it can be challenging to meet everyone's expectations at all times and switch contexts multiple times a day. Also, with multiple projects in parallel, there are naturally considerable administrative overheads which prevent me from committing more of my own time to the actual research being done. On the other hand, this is probably also my favourite element of the job: constantly traversing between different projects and use cases\_ensures the job never gets too dull.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge is the digital transformation of the Berlin State Library and its umbrella organisation, the <a href=\"https://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/about-us/profile.html?L=1\">SPK</a>. With about 2,000 staff members across five institutions including libraries, museums, research institutes and an archive, there is enormous potential to leverage. At the same time, there are massive challenges with changing processes and strategy to become more digital, and to create space to develop the digital transformation without leaving anyone behind. Finally, with research projects at the edge of technological innovation, the question of how to sustain and implement the outcomes in production is always a tricky task. \_ \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After a decade of collaborating with Europeana in various ways and seeing it actively develop, it was a good time to take on some responsibility in the governance of the Network Association and try to give something back. Over the years I’ve had opportunities to meet with and learn from many diverse colleagues in the network with a broad range of backgrounds and interests related to Europeana and digital cultural heritage. Next to libraries I do work a lot with researchers, but also companies from the creative industries. Trying to make sure the views of all these stakeholders are appropriately reflected in the activities of the network and its communities was another driver.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I currently have the pleasure of serving\_ as Chair of the Steering Group for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech Community</a> and I also contribute to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">AI in relation to GLAMs</a> task force. Naturally, I want to aid in the further development of newspaper content in Europeana and make sure we meet the needs of all stakeholders. Based on my various collaborations with researchers, I would also like to help make Europeana content generally more accessible and useful for researchers. Most importantly though, across my various activities and professional networks, I always try to spread the word about Europeana - although currently only from a safe distance! Once we have come out of this pandemic, one of my greatest wishes is to make such sprawling and lively events as the EuropeanaTech conferences return.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Biblioteca Estense Universitaria has recently launched a new digital platform which brings the institution’s rich and varied collections to the fingertips of students, teachers, scholars and whoever takes an interest in them. The platform, called the <a href=\"https://edl.beniculturali.it/home/cover\">Estense Digital Library</a> (EDL for short), contains the library’s entire collection of maps and musical documents, as well as the archives of Ludovico Antonio Muratori (1672 - 1750), an eminent Italian scholar who was archivist and librarian at the Estense Court in the first half of the 18th century.&nbsp; In total, about 8,453 documents are now available on EDL, and we plan to add a thousand more in the coming year. Users will be able to leaf through these precious and fragile documents through 750,000 high-resolution images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bringing together records in an interoperable platform</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform uses the International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"https://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>), as a set of standards which allow&nbsp;users to annotate and share documents with each other, and more importantly, compare works published on other digital repositories using the same protocol. The growing number of libraries adhering to the IIIF consortium means that EDL benefits&nbsp; from an ever-expanding universe of digital resources. Currently, EDL allows users to browse through not only the Biblioteca Estense’s own resources but also those of other libraries that use the same protocol, and so&nbsp;EDL allows access to over one million historical documents related to the Estense collection. This trove of information is gathered together by MediaLibraryOnline (<a href=\"https://www.medialibrary.it/home/cover.aspx\">MLOL</a>), a platform utilized by 6,500 Italian libraries which manages&nbsp; the front end of the EDL portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of EDL’s greatest accomplishments has been to bring together the records from different historical inventories and library catalogues into an online, unified register. Up until now, patrons of the library had to rely on a wide array of different sources to search through the collections, most of which were not available online. That was true also for the collections of maps, musical documents and the archives of Ludovico Antonio Muratori. Data about these holdings comes from over eleven different sources. In this respect, EDL is not&nbsp; the end of a cataloguing project but stands as a starting point for the reassessment and investigation of the Estense collections. By publishing what we know about our documents, we want to bring attention to them, especially the lesser-known and studied holdings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The portal also offers scholars and researchers an array of new tools to facilitate the sharing of information as well as the study and analysis of documents.&nbsp; Watch a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrEckz_SivA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a>&nbsp;about the platform (in Italian).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The annotation tool allows people to share details of pages, images and music directly onto the user’s social platform of choice, while also using the <a href=\"https://projectmirador.org/\">Mirador</a> image viewing platform to select and annotate them. Images can be annotated and every annotation recorded on lists that can be either private or public. The story tool is also particularly relevant for teaching and presenting and we hope it will be used widely. Entire volumes, single pages or even minute details can be selected to appear with commentaries in digital presentation, the so-called Stories, which again can be kept private or made public.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The work on EDL has just begun. The platform will continue to grow as more resources are digitised and added to the portal. This autumn, we are starting the digitisation of precious illustrated manuscripts dating back to the Italian Renaissance. We aim to share our collections through Europeana in the near future.</p>\r\n"

As the first fully online presidency event, we had the opportunity to open up some of the sessions to the public.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event offered an opportunity to bring member states representatives together and exchange views, successful approaches, and common challenges around copyright in the framework of the heritage sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is the role of copyright in the digital transformation of the heritage sector?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright determines the extent to which cultural heritage institutions can benefit from the opportunities raised by technological advancements. For example, while technology facilitates sharing digital reproductions of heritage with students, having to first obtain permission from a (sometimes unknown) rightsholder might raise some challenges. As the focus moves <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-initiative-position-consultation-on-opportunities-offered-by-digital-technologies\">from digitisation to digital transformation</a>, cultural heritage institutions wish to embrace new possibilities to better connect their collections with their audiences.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Frank Scholze, Director General, Deutsche Nationalbibliothek said, ‘It's our mission as institutions to actively embrace and shape the opportunities of digitalisation within our platforms and to make cultural heritage visible and accessible to a wider public in order to avoid the digital dark age. Due to these challenges the copyright system has to be adjusted and it's only possible if we find a proper balance of interests of all stakeholders, right holders and institutions'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this moment of impasse, a lot of expectations are being put on the implementation of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/copyright-in-the-digital-single-market-europeana-s-next-steps\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</a>, and at Europeana, we are hopeful that the changes it will bring will contribute to supporting research, education and access to knowledge.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Discussions at the event</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first day, we explored the background to digital transformation and copyright, where we stand, and what might come next. With that in mind, <a href=\"https://www.bibliotheksverband.de/fachgruppen/kommissionen/recht.html\">Dorothea Zechman</a>, <a href=\"https://fep-fee.eu/-Secretariat-\">Anne Bergman</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a> shared their thoughts on the topic and strongly agreed that there is a need to collaborate across sectors to achieve the best possible copyright framework for digital transformation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the second day, we explored tangible examples of copyright in the heritage sector. A range of speakers presented initiatives they were involved in with. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fred-saunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a> presented the risk management approach developed by the National Library of Scotland in partnership with the National Library of Wales, which has brought efficiency and consistency in how they approach copyright across the institution. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/evelin-heidel\">Evelin Heidel</a> described how networks of practitioners can advance discussions and support open access. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/juozas-markauskas\">Juozas Markauskas</a> and myself talked about efforts to develop copyright knowledge across the sector, and how rights statements and creative commons licenses and tools could support digital cultural heritage further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During group discussions, member states exchanged approaches taken at the national level, and we explored tangible steps that can be taken to support the heritage sector deal with copyright nationally and across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the input collected during the event, we will explore possibilities to further support and develop areas where there was consensus on their importance, for instance on how to make capacity building efforts more sustainable. We will work with the DCHE to provide a set of recommendations and ensure that the copyright views of the heritage sector across Europe are considered.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Watch the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-web-conference-under-the-german-presidency-2020\">recording of the open sessions</a> at the event.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Listen to professionals talk about their challenges and hopes for copyright in the cultural heritage sector in <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/showcase/7616082\">these short interviews</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Read the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-copyright-2020-2025\">Europeana Copyright Strategy 2020-2025</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

        title: 'In conversation with Commissioner Mariya Gabriel - Europeana XX Ambassador of Change'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The team behind the Europeana XX project share\_insights from their recent interview with European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, one of the project’s Ambassadors of Change, who shared her thoughts on the opportunities and challenges facing the cultural heritage sector in the time of COVID-19.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX. Century of Change</a> is a Europeana Generic Service that focuses on the 20th century and its social, political and economical changes as documented in photographs, videos, and works of art. To help promote the project, the project team has invited a number of leading public figures to act as ‘Ambassadors of Change’ for Europeana XX, a role which includes sharing their unique insight into topics relevant to the 20th century. We were delighted that Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education\_ and responsible for programmes such as Horizon Europe, Erasmus+ and Creative Europe, accepted this invitation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recently ran an online event where international journalists were invited to interview Commissioner Gabriel about Europeana XX. The Commissioner also spoke with the project’s editorial team, inspiring them with insights into, and strategies related to, cultural heritage. The goal is that both interviews are used to raise awareness of the project and to promote discussion on the topics relevant to it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the project is focused on change in the 20th century, it was inescapable that discussion would turn to the 21st century topic of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Commissioner shared\_her thoughts on the challenges and opportunities facing the cultural sector at this time.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This post offers a look into the Commissioner’s thoughts on this subject, in particular two issues close to her heart and critical to our sector: what the pandemic means for the sector’s digital transformation and the role of digital collections in education.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Digital transformation and COVID-19: opportunities and challenges\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For Commissioner Gabriel, the challenges that cultural heritage institutions face as a result of the pandemic are very real.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said, ‘During the last months I have seen that on one side we have extraordinary capacity of mobilisation and creativity, but on the other we need resources, we need targeted investments and greater support in some critical moments.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citing a recent Network of Museum Organizations’ (NEMO)\_report, Commissioner Gabriel noted,\_‘Three out of four museums indicated insufficient economic resources, insufficient staff time as biggest obstacles for digitisation and online accessibility. Just 30% claimed that they did not have the proper equipment to digitise.’\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However the Commissioner also noted how, ‘The report also tells us that four out of five museums increased their digital service in response to closing their doors during the pandemic, and almost half of them are now providing one or more online services.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And she reflected that if approached and dealt with in an open and innovative manner, the crisis may present not only a challenge, but an opportunity for the sector to significantly accelerate its digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The time is now, as the demand for well-curated, high-quality virtual access to culture has never been greater.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reflecting on the Commission’s own online use of culture in recent months,\_Commissioner Gabriel highlighted two relevant social media campaigns from\_ the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/\">Creative Europe programme</a> \_-\_ 'Creative Europe at Home'\_and 'Europe’s culture – close to you'.\_ The campaigns address specific challenges facing the cultural sector as a result of the crisis - Creative Europe at Home\_promotes the sector’s rich online response to engaging with its audiences as its doors closed temporarily during the crisis, while Europe’s culture – close to you promotes sustainable cultural tourism by highlighting Europe’s rich cultural treasures.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Commissioner noted,\_ ‘Given that cultural tourism generates 40% of the EU’s entire tourism income it is crucial that the cultural and creative sectors transform to respond to the current situation. Offering online or hybrid activities attractive to wide audiences is - and will remain - key .’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Digital education and its challenges\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the cultural heritage sector, the education sector has been deeply impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The sudden changes to classroom access have compelled teachers and their organisations to quickly rethink and adapt teaching methods and curricula to new virtual scenarios. Basic competences like digital skills and critical thinking are increasingly relevant.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, teachers and educators face an increased need to find alternative content and ways to engage with their students. One solution is the use of online material such as the collections offered by Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Gabriel said, ‘When we talk about Europeana, I’m thinking immediately about the extraordinary necessity of these kinds of platforms, where we have high quality content. The question is how to make this content accessible, that means that at the basis we have some challenges.’\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those challenges are varied, ranging from connectivity issues in certain areas of Europe, to limited interest in introducing cultural heritage as educational material into curricula, a decision that is up to each Member State. All of these are taken into consideration in the Commissioner’s new <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en\">Educational Action Plan</a> (2021-2027),\_ which outlines the EC’s\_ vision for higher quality, more accessible and inclusive digital education in Europe. The plan aims to foster the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem and enhance the digital skills and competences needed for digital transformation.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commissioner sees the benefits. She said, ‘With the proposal of the Educational Action plan we are giving ourselves a chance this time, to have at least a common framework, to have at least a common platform where we can share what already exists and spread this, to make this platform and Europeana more accessible, more inclusive.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Producing, transforming and reusing digital content for education is where it all starts, but by no means where it ends, said Commissioner Gabriel: ‘Fostering creativity through education is so important. That’s why I want to launch new initiatives to allow people to see artists, film makers and other creators at work. I fully believe that we, as politicians, cannot generate the same kind of stars in children’s eyes as when they get to experience how great works of art are made. Yet again: there’s work to be done and more resources are needed in order to support, nourish and endorse creative talent.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Synergies and collaboration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With a passionate plea for an intensified collaboration between the cultural heritage, educational and research sectors and their respective funding structures, the Commissioner acknowledged the need for further discussion and formalised synergies.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘These times of corona have shown once more that, when it comes to synergies, we should not only talk but start operationalizing and implementing. Why not create a European network by building upon existing projects and teams, to help avoid errors and capitalise on best practices towards a real sustainable effort?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representing different actors that meet at the crossroads of digital cultural heritage, the Europeana XX consortium strongly supports such a cross-domain, collaborative approach, that has already proved to be an invaluable asset at project level.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about the work of Europeana XX, explore their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">project page on Europeana Pro</a>.

        title: 'Explore our Europeana 2020 programme'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We’re very excited to announce the Europeana 2020 programme. With 70% of the programme coming from our open call for proposals, and selected by a committee representing the Europeana Foundation, Network Association, specialist communities and Aggregators’ Forum it’s a conference designed with and for you. Read on to find out how you can build your own programme and join us between 11 and 13 November for three days of inspiring and innovative sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>A conference designed for digital\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key design principles of Europeana 2020 was to fully embrace a digital experience. We appreciate it’s conference season in an already busy digital environment so we have designed the programme with the digital experience in mind. We have\_introduced shorter days, more interactive, shorter sessions, and\_included plenty of breaks, so that you can dip in and out and leave\_Europeana 2020 feeling invigorated by your experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Morning sessions with inspiring keynote speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2020 explores the landscape of change in the digital cultural sector. We are thrilled to have noted moderator <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/prasanna-oommen\">Prasanna Oommen</a> guiding us through the programme, and each day of the conference will start with an introduction from Prasanna followed by one of our exciting keynote speakers. They will address how we can empower change through policy, human, GLAM and technological lenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday 11 November we’ll be looking\_through a policy lens at the steps we need to take to ensure that we build upon the momentum and the lessons learned of the past months, to help\_shape our\_digital future and to secure our contribution to Europe. We\_are excited to be joined by a panel of thought-leaders in Policy, including <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/rehana-schwinninger-ladak\">Rehana Schwinninger-Ladak</a>, DG Connect and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sneska-quaedvlieg-mihailovic\">Sneska-Quaedvlieg-Mihailovic</a>, Europa Nostra. On Thursday 12 November, we’ll explore the human dimension of change as we respond to digital and social change as a sector. Renowned anthropologist <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jitske-kramer\">Jitske Kramer</a> will give the keynote and be joined by thought-leaders in the sector for a panel and Q&amp;A discussion. On Friday 13 November our very own <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/andy-neale\">Andy Neale</a> will look to the future of GLAM with 'A Travellers Guide to Digital Transformation' and be joined by cultural heritage professionals at the forefront of digital transformation, with practical experience at managing digital change within their organisations and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Afternoon sessions with thought-provoking and informative workshops and case studies</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the morning sessions will provide an introduction for everyone into key areas of change facing us as a sector in this extraordinary year and beyond, the afternoon sessions will allow us to break out and look at specific areas of crisis, change and culture. The interactive and engaging sessions, workshops and activities will support your knowledge, experience and practice, and share examples of digital transformation in action.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These breakout sessions are designed by and for cultural heritage professionals. They have been grouped by day to respond to three key challenges identified by the professionals who took part in our Digital Transformation in the time of COVID-19 workshops in Summer 2020, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-digital-capacity-sense-making-findings-and-outcomes\">the reports</a> that explored the findings in more detail. On Wednesday 11 November, the breakout sessions will explore digital divides, and ways we can bridge them. On Thursday 12 November they will look at how we can develop agency for change, individually and collectively. Finally, on Friday 13 November the breakout sessions will address collaboration.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Closing keynote</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re very excited to have <a href=\"https://kk.org/\">Kevin Kelly</a>, the founding executive editor of Wired magazine, as our closing keynote. He will discuss representations of the real world in digital form in 'Mirror World: Utopia or dystopia', and be joined by other leading minds for a panel discussion that we think will be a fitting close to Europeana 2020, Crisis, Change and Culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana Network Association General Assembly</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference will be preceded by the Europeana Network Association (ENA) General Assembly. This will be an invite only meeting for all ENA Members and won’t be visible on our digital programme. We sent out the invite to all network members yesterday, so if you are a member, check your inbox. If you aren’t a member already, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join now</a> and become part of the biggest network of cultural heritage professionals in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Networking and social events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No conference is complete without chances to network. Just because it’s digital doesn’t mean we need to miss out on the important social events.\_On our digital programme you’ll be able to check out and join in with our fringe events, including our Europeana pub quiz!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Build your own programme\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can now explore and start building your own programme on Sched, our official digital programme. If you previously registered your interest or booked your place for Europeana 2020 you will have been emailed information to join Sched. If you haven't, it’s not too late to sign up and explore the programme. All you need to do is book a ticket via eventbrite, and you will be automatically added to Sched. It’s the only place you’ll be able to access links to join the conference and various sessions, and gives you the opportunity to connect with other professionals, so sign up today and start building your own programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re very excited, and confident there will be something for any cultural heritage professional interested in dealing with crisis, change and culture. If you are new to the sector or before 2020 thought you had experienced it all, if you are working day to day in the sector or merely interested in the challenges we are facing and how we are dealing with them, we think Europeana 2020 is for you.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Our aim</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we started working on the new Europeana website in 2019, we discussed web accessibility as an important criterion. All European public sector websites should be accessible according to the European <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj\">Web Accessibility Directive</a>. Web accessibility means that websites, tools&nbsp;and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. Or, in other words: people can perceive, understand, navigate&nbsp;and interact with the web. And in addition, they can also contribute to the web&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/#context\">Introduction to Web Accessibility, W3C</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/billion-people-experience-disabilities-worldwide-so-wheres-data\">World Bank Blogs</a>, 15% of the world’s population experience some form of disability. It includes people who are blind, people who cannot hear, people with cognitive disabilities or people with physical problems. But web accessibility also has benefits for people without disabilities. This could include people who have a slow internet connection, older people, people using small screens or those having temporary disabilities, like a broken arm. In summary, web accessibility has benefits for all and it is an opportunity to reach a wider and more diverse audience.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In a broader context, web accessibility is just one aspect of diversity and inclusion. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we are making an effort to make our products&nbsp; accessible and our aim is to meet the international<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\"> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) guidelines level AA (WCAG 2.1)</a>.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We want everyone to be able to be part of - and enjoy - what we do. We want to help our partners to reach new audiences, whatever their accessibility needs. So we are always working on using existing and developing innovative technologies to make sure digital culture really is for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Meeting the guidelines</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accessibility guidelines are not only about code, they are also about design, text, media, language, forms, and documents. That means developers, designers, editors and product managers - among others - are all involved in making websites accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, one set of guidelines is about structure. It is easier for people to understand website structure when there are clear titles and headings, which make it easier to scan and navigate a webpage. And for people who rely on a screen reader a clear site structure is important. Our UX team identifies the design of these structural elements - for example, important headings have a larger font size than the less important ones. Developers represent the structure in code. And the editorial team uses&nbsp;these elements in their content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘We think about accessibility as soon as we start designing a new feature’, says Europeana’s User Experience Designer Romain. ‘The idea is trying to make sure nobody is excluded from the beginning. For me as a designer it means considering things such as colours and contrasts, size of elements, structuring content logically, making sure the text and labels are clear and understandable.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Verification of the guidelines&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To verify if the Europeana website meets the WCAG guidelines, we run both manual and automated tests. The automated tests, for which we use the accessibility testing tool <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">Axe</a>, are part of our build process. Every time a new feature has been added, tests check for accessibility violations. Senior Developer Lutz Biedinger says: ‘As a general rule of thumb I will try to stick to established standard approaches as much as possible, as these are the most likely to have accessibility solutions which users are already familiar with. Then at a basic level, I will rely on automated checks to flag known detectable issues. Finally, it's important to simply try it and let someone else also test the functionality in order to identify additional issues.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we always try to plan for accessibility, sometimes testing shows that things have to be changed to meet the guidelines. One example is ensuring enough contrast between text and background images. ‘The hero banner was initially designed for major visual impact, occupying most of the screen real estate while displaying the high-quality imagery that we have available’, explains Senior Visual Designer Carlos Marcelino.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />‘The text, while in a good position, would have to rely on a very contrasted image to be fully readable, which made choosing images a challenge. This made us rethink the whole section, having accessibility as a starting point, so we separated image and text entirely while retaining prominence in both elements.’</p>\r\n"

As part of the season, we are looking at how organisations are using sport to overcome social problems and explore heritage.

                body: "<p><em>Why did you set up <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/\">Sports Against Racism Ireland</a>?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There's a problem in the Irish Republic with xenophobia - it’s a small island, small population. Xenophobia can lead on to racism so we wanted to interrupt that.&nbsp; In Dublin, there were a lot of migrants coming in as refugees or waiting for asylum. In 1997, myself, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/frank-buckley-60334bb/\">Frank Buckley</a> who had previously worked in sport, and a renowned photographer called <a href=\"http://www.perryogden.com/about/\">Perry Ogden</a>, who was working with kids in Dublin's inner city, set up Sports Against Racism Ireland as a volunteer-driven organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Why did you want to focus on sport?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sport is universal. Almost every country in the world has its own traditional sport. People come into the country with their own games. Respecting them and incorporating them into what we do is very important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We punch above our weight in Ireland in terms of sporting achievements. We have a big cache of Olympic gold medals but nowhere to display them. Ireland doesn’t have a sports museum but we do have big archives of material. SARI has a <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/sport-against-racism-ireland/\">website</a> and social media channels but that’s as far as it goes in terms of digital activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our previous projects looked at how storytelling in sports could influence positive change in society in terms of cultural integration and social inclusion. We came into contact with Europeana Sport through one of our contacts in that project. This could be a unique opportunity to start thinking about creating a digital sports archive - we’ve been talking to the <a href=\"https://olympics.ie/\">Olympic Federation of Ireland</a> about becoming partners to do that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Can you tell us about what you do at the moment?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/sari-soccerfest/\">Soccer Fest</a> football tournament brings different community groups together. Within five years, Soccer Fest became the biggest intercultural seven-a-side football tournament in Europe with a volunteer committee and volunteer staff of 80 people. We’re still waiting to hear if we can run a scaled-down version of Soccer Fest this year. We usually have 32 men’s teams and 12 women’s teams. This year, it’ll be eight men’s and eight women’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/358834771\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/358834771\">SARI SOCCERFEST TRAILER</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sariireland\">Sport Against Racism Ireland</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/sari-soccernites-2020-is-back/\">Soccernites</a> programme involves more than 40 young people, mostly unaccompanied minors who come into the country from as far as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia. And they all play football together. And <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/hijabs-and-hat-tricks/\">Hijabs and Hat-tricks</a> brings young Muslim women into sport, mainly football. And from that, then into the community to become active citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/429987452\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/429987452\">Laura Rafferty and Raihana Zeroug</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/sariireland\">Sport Against Racism Ireland</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We run education programmes too. We did a pilot called ‘Ali’s Bicycle’ with the <a href=\"https://alicenter.org/\">Muhammad Ali Center</a> in Kentucky, USA, in response to the problem of homophobic and racist bullying. The reason Mohammed Ali got involved in boxing was that his bicycle was stolen when he was a kid. A police officer told him, ‘Don't talk to me, go down to the boxing club’. So that's how he started. It's an amazing story. Our kids relate to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a big international agenda. We partner with <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/\">UNESCO</a>, we’re part of the <a href=\"https://coachesacrosscontinents.org/\">Coaches Across Continents</a> programme, and <a href=\"https://www.streetfootballworld.org/\">Street Football World</a>, in Berlin. We’re part of the Corporate Social Responsibility programmes in <a href=\"http://www.beyondsport.org/project/f/federation-internationale-de-football-association-fifa-corporate-social-responsibility/\">FIFA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/social-responsibility/\">UEFA</a>. There's a strong human development element to what we do. We do a lot of work on the<a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\"> Sustainable Development Goals</a> for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What activities have you got coming up at the moment?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">10 years ago, one of the members of our Insaka Football Club, 15-year-old <a href=\"http://www.sari.ie/tribute-to-toyosi/\">Tayosi Shittabey</a>, was murdered in a racist attack. It was horrific.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Insaka’ is a word from Zambia and it means together, whether physically or conceptually. It's a thought space or a real space where the elders in the community pass on knowledge to the younger people. The Insaka Football Club was set up with support from Glentoran Football Club and had players from 15 different countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our commemorative event for Tayosi has been delayed this year because of COVID. We’re hoping it’ll be part of Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) as part of <a href=\"https://www.farenet.org/campaigns/footballpeople-action-weeks/\">FARE Action</a> weeks. So it’ll be a pretty big event in Dublin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>How can cultural heritage institutions get involved with SARI?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m a visiting lecturer in the <a href=\"https://www.cies.ch/en/education/fifa-master/about-fifa-master/\">FIFA Master</a> programme at De Montfort University in Leicester, UK and we are part of the History of Sport Department so I’m interested in partnering with organisations or individuals who want to get involved with us, particularly in doing more research.&nbsp; SARI is a partner in the pan-European project ‘<a href=\"http://www.sportitright.com\">Sport it Right</a>’ that uses the history of sport to focus on issues of discrimination in and through sport today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find out more about SARI at <a href=\"https://www.sari.ie/\">SARI.ie</a> and follow them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sariireland/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/SARI-Sports-Against-Racism-Ireland/105922832794822\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/sariireland\">Vimeo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarireland\">Flickr</a> or email info@sari.ie.</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/linbi\">LinBi project</a>, which ran between February 2019 and October 2020, focused on biodiversity and the documentation of the enormous variety of biological life on earth. This diversity is preserved in an equally wide range of formats - books, illustrations, specimen scans, glass plate photographs, sound recordings, herbarium sheets, video and more. LinBi brought together botanists, researchers, the media and the public in a collaborative effort to enhance and support appreciation and use of this essential European biodiversity material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Unveiling the data</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tasked with adding new items, enriching existing data and creating new connections between them, LinBi delivered over 1.5 million biodiversity data records to Europeana during the project. These records were enriched by crowdsourcing activity (read on for more information), and new, and sometimes surprising,&nbsp;links between content items were created by the newly developed content-clustering function of LinBi’s <a href=\"https://linbi.ait.co.at/\">enrichment platform</a>. Biodiversity data was enriched with new vocabularies aimed at making it more accessible to the non-scientific community and general public, and to support reuse of the content. LinBi developed a <a href=\"http://test113.ait.co.at/tematres/LinBi_Simple_Voc/index.php?\">Simple Vocabulary</a> which attached everyday terms such as ‘flower’, ‘plant’ and ‘animal’ to scientific biodiversity data.</p>\r\n"

The first (<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/edible-plants-from-the-americas\">Edible Plants from the Americas</a>) dealt with the often-surprising Latin American origins of common European foods; the second was <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/francois-crepin-and-the-study-of-wild-roses\">François Crépin and the Study of Wild Roses</a>, telling the story of Belgian rose expert Crépin and his lifelong, and ultimately unsuccessful, struggle to classify the enormous variety of roses. The third, published in September 2020, dealt with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/magical-mystical-and-medicinal\">Magical, Mystical and Psychoactive Plants</a>&nbsp;and their various uses and history. Exhibitions were published in a variety of languages, and the third exhibition is also now presented on panels at the <a href=\"http://www.rjb.csic.es/jardinbotanico/jardin/\">Real Jardín Botánico in Madrid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engaging the crowd</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Citizen scientists contributed to the quality of this enormous amount of data. They pored over herbarium specimens, transcribed handwritten label information and examined camera trap images to identify species. Crowdsourced enrichment was carried out on the multilingual <a href=\"https://www.doedat.be/\">DoeDat crowdsourcing platform</a> from <a href=\"https://www.plantentuinmeise.be/en/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw28T8BRDbARIsAEOMBcwaIqj9h3dG1qpUVdOC80C6Kc-lYvvcZMPo6FzislArpUjOZ6ANaGQaAqreEALw_wcB\">Meise Botanic Garden (MBG)</a>. There was close collaboration between the <a href=\"https://www.nhm-wien.ac.at/en\">Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (NHM)</a> and MBG, focussed on transcribing herbarium specimens from the <a href=\"https://www.univie.ac.at/en/\">University of Vienna</a>. This collaboration resulted in a successful sub-project (focussed on butterworts) in July 2020, and a second task (focussed on Brazilian coffee plants) was carried out in October. Results from these quality-enhancing projects are available to a broad audience via Europeana.</p>\r\n"

It needs no great insight into the human condition to understand that the future of the planet depends greatly upon maintaining rich biodiversity. LinBi’s goal was to direct public and media attention to existing and new material which documents such diversity, by pointing users to the wealth of material available, and to create connections between content items. We hope that we have contributed in some small way to greater awareness of the rich detail, long history and essential importance of biodiversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about the project and to contribute to enrichment, <a href=\"https://linbi.eu\">explore the LinBi project site</a>.</p>\r\n"

It’s an integral part of any creative workflow and development process, as it gives foresight of the final product, predicts or flags challenges and bottlenecks and consolidates ideas across teams and organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, our design approach is human-centric, particularly when it comes to user experience. We make sure that the output in our products serves our audiences in the best way possible. This ensures that they can be used by a wide variety of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Designing an online experience&nbsp;for cultural heritage collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A website experience is fully designed even before development work starts, underpinning the project and giving its first (primitive) appearance. The new Europeana website was no exception. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We designed three main ‘flows’ for users to help them to engage with the website and the cultural heritage items it highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Discovery by browsing</strong>: we designed the website to ensure that our general audience could engage with and explore the huge amount of interesting content in our collections t<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />hrough suggesting ‘related collections’ to encourage browsing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

We analyse information from a variety of sources and make decisions based on hard data rather than assumptions and second-guessing. For example, we&nbsp;track clicks on our pages to understand the areas that have more engagement, and if those match the elements we want to give prominence. If that’s not happening then we’ll iterate the design and retest it. Internal stakeholder feedback is also factored in, adding to the wide variety of input we are able to draw information from, and translating into more inclusive and representative decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Designing a product is an organic process that has a clear start but never ends, with additional requirements, improvements and fixes. There's always a chance to tinker and improve or add something to the original design. Iteration is the natural process of improving and building upon a robust and flexible design, adjusting it to an ever-changing world with new requirements, needs and styles.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are always looking for people who are willing to participate in testing the new features of the Europeana website.

From May to October as part of the Discovering Europe season we published 61 editorials in total: 28 blogs and 33 galleries. The diverse topics covered included the history of hiking in Europe, a portrait of vintage Ibiza, sustainable tourism, and the European Capitals of Culture 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These stories included contributions from 10 cultural heritage organisations and 4 Generic Services projects - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Common Culture</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-archaeology\">Europeana Archaeology</a>,<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-media\"> Europeana Media</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX</a>. We also developed many new <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/europeana-classroom\">learning resources</a> for and with our educational partners. All in all, a remarkable 2,105 items from 410 organisations in 38 countries were showcased during the Discovering Europe season!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

With cultural tourism representing 40% of tourism in Europe, and badly affected by COVID-19, the season was launched alongside other initiatives which aimed to highlight the richness and innovation associated with cultural heritage tourism in Europe. This included the Directorate-General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture (DG EAC)’s ‘Europe’s Culture Close to you’, and the Joint Research Centre’s Cultural Gems app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We showcased a number of these initiatives, and encouraged our partners and professional audiences to share their own, on a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/discovering-europe\">‘Discovering Europe’</a> page on Europeana Pro. This webpage for cultural heritage professionals showcased relevant initiatives, campaigns and projects which shone a light on cultural heritage and tourist destinations throughout Europe, and highlighted apps and tools from Europeana projects which support engagement with cultural heritage attractions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here on Europeana Pro news, a complementary theme also explored cultural heritage tourism in the context of the Discovering Europe season. We looked at a number of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/reopening-means-rethinking-examples-to-inspire-and-inform\">re-opening initiatives from GLAMS across Europe</a>, as well as digital initiatives organisations had taken to extend the online reach of cultural heritage in this period (including a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/discovering-art-nouveau-danube-heritage-through-a-map\">map to discover Art Noveau Danube heritage</a>, and online initiatives from <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/an-interview-with-european-historic-houses\">European Historic Houses</a>).</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>A promise for mass digitisation</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012L0028\">Orphan Works Directive</a> was adopted in October 2012 and sought to facilitate the mass digitisation projects going on across Europe by removing some copyright barriers. It created an exception to copyright, so that the digitisation and dissemination of orphan works (works still protected by copyright, but whose authors or other right holders are not known or cannot be located) could be done without necessarily seeking permission from every rights holder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Member States had to adopt the Directive. However, the Directive’s provisions have a limited scope, cumbersome requirements and some legal uncertainty. While they were to some extent meant to be safeguards for rights holders, this resulted in a Directive with limited applicability, as demonstrated by the low numbers of orphan works declared in the <a href=\"https://euipo.europa.eu/ohimportal/en/web/observatory/orphan-works-db\">EUIPO database</a> and the testimonies of cultural heritage institutions that they are unsuccessful when using these provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April 2019, the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</a> was adopted. Among other important provisions, it contained new articles on out of commerce works that seem to offer a more promising solution for mass digitisation projects in the cultural heritage sector, with the possibility of relying on extended collective licensing and a fall-back exception to copyright. While they are currently being implemented by European Member States, there seems to be a clear overlap between their scope and that of the Orphan Works Directive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From August to October 2020, a survey about the application of the Orphan Works Directive across the European Union was conducted to evaluate the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Directive as an instrument to promote the digitisation and dissemination of orphan works. The survey is the first step of the review process foreseen in the Directive itself, which could be followed by a report on its application and a possible proposal for its amendment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Europeana’s answers to the survey</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout the survey, we noted that with two relatively overlapping systems in place, cultural heritage professionals are likely to use the one that provides the best solution, with the other one remaining mostly unused. We therefore recommended considering retracting the Orphan Works Directive. We also noted its clear flaws so that the same mistakes would not be repeated again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We noted the following:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The diligent search for rights holders is problematic, with the sources it is mandatory to consult often irrelevant and difficult to access. Pertinent sources are sometimes not included.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The time and resources that an institution needs to dedicate to conducting a diligent search present challenges, particularly as after completing this process there is still no full guarantee that the institution will always be able to use the work lawfully.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The very limited scope of the Directive in different types of works is a clear downside; including embedded works (for example, the multiple works contained in a scrapbook) in those whose rights holders have to be searched for makes the determination extremely time-consuming and almost impossible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Directive does not provide a sufficient level of clarity regarding the compensation that rights holders can claim; this lack of clarity has strongly disincentivised cultural heritage professionals from relying on this scheme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The EUIPO Orphan Works database can be cumbersome when working with large datasets and is not sufficiently interoperable with the repositories of cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having two overlapping schemes is likely to raise a lot of uncertainties for cultural heritage professionals, for instance when trying to assess which of the two options to rely on. The out of commerce works provisions in the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive, while tackling the same challenges, offer much better solutions and less cumbersome conditions, perhaps to a large extent given the lessons learned from the Orphan Works Directive, and we are hopeful that they will deliver their promise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

So, let's shine a light onto this and get people to pay attention. It has grown organically and we now have 8,000 followers on <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BlackandIrish/\">Facebook</a>, 42,000 on <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/black_andirish/\">Instagram</a>, and a couple of thousand on <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSQAcP2M/\">TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Why is Black and Irish important to you?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our platform has been used as a lightning rod to unite everyone. Forget about racism, forget about the issues and the struggles. It’s about coming together, to talk about your heritage, to figure out our history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are very specific stereotypes that Black people are denoted against - we're great at sport or really talented at music, and that's it. There’s far more than that to us. Younger Black people play into those stereotypes - when the only successful Black people they see are athletes or musicians, then they think that if they’re going to be successful themselves, that’s what they have to pursue. Why don't we ever see any Black teachers in Ireland? Because Black students are not seeing any Black teachers. So how can they aspire to be one? We're trying to break that cycle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

When you hear stories, an outpouring of emotion, or someone being vulnerable, you can empathise with it. We felt that was a very good way to highlight the racial struggles of people of colour in Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What’s your interest in Europeana Sport?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/digital-repository-of-ireland\">Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI)</a> said they’d like to archive what we do. The initial connection to Europeana came through that. We’re going to run a Black and Irish people in sports week in January 2021 to highlight what it’s like being a sports person who is a person of colour in Ireland. We hope that the stories shared on Black and Irish w<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />ill make their way into <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/114-sport\">Europeana’s sports collection.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What’s the link between Black and Irish and cultural heritage?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We all come from varying cultures. I'm Black and Irish. But if you were to delve into my Black roots, my African roots, I'm Nigerian, Yoruba. There's some rich, rich culture in there. A lot of people don't understand our culture, and don't understand our history, myself included. I’m interested in how we make this more mainstream. How do we get people more interested in their heritage? I feel like I should have been interested in my heritage 10 years ago. How do we get that taught in school?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">October was Black History Month and we’re still fighting for similar things today as we were 200 years ago. And similar mistakes are being made. It is bewildering to me that we're still having those same conversations today. Regardless of colour of skin, we are not aware of our heritage, we're not aware of our history, we're not educated enough in it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

We need to find some way of disseminating that information down, so it doesn't die off with the older generation, because it's more important now than ever.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We are happy to announce the results of the 2020 Europeana Network Association (ENA) Members Council elections. Of the 35 candidates who came forward in this year’s elections, our members chose nine of them to fill the open seats in the Members Council between 11 and 20 November.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On behalf of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Elections and Voting Committee</a>, we are excited to introduce the following new Members Council representatives (in alphabetical order):\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/alexandra-angeletaki\">Alexandra Angeletaki</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/cosmina-berta\">Cosmina Berta</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/larissa-borck\">Larissa Borck</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/milena-dobreva\">Milena Dobreva</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/evelien-hauwaerts\">Evelien Hauwaerts</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/georgia-manolopoulou\">Georgia Manolopoulou</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fred-saunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nienke-van-schaverbeke\">Nienke van Schaverbeke</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/peter-soemers\">Peter Soemers</a> has been re-elected. Over the past three years, he has proven his dedication and experience, and we are delighted to welcome him back for one more term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations to all our elected representatives!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased to see that the new Council represents a broad range of interests and expertise, and creates a good balance of backgrounds, nationalities and sectors in the ENA. We look forward to the new Councillors taking on active roles, engaging\_ in and leading ENA activities and steering the work of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">six ENA communities</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly elected Councillors will serve a three-year term. The rest of the Councillors, elected in 2018, will continue to serve for another year. We will be introducing them throughout 2021 in our Pro series ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=professionals+in+focus\">Professionals in Focus</a>’ but feel free to get in touch with them personally as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Elections and voting process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2020 elections campaign started on 1 September. Voting opened during this year’s General Assembly meeting on 11 November and ran until 20 November. Of the 2086 members, who confirmed their membership by November and were eligible to vote, 752 participated in the elections. Candidates campaigned on social media under the #EuropeanaElects hashtag. We recorded a 36% percent participation rate.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with choosing their new representatives, ENA members voted in favour of key Association documents including the <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=295b83ee89&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">ENA Annual Report 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=4cb00bbd79&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Activity Plan for 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=fc87becc07&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Financial Report 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=63a17f1dfe&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Provisional Budget for 2021</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Electing the new Management Board</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Council will be composed of 36 elected members who will officially start working together on 1 January 2021. The newly elected Councillors will also be invited to join the third Council meeting of the year on 3-4 December 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of their first tasks will be electing a new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a>. By early January 2021, all 36 Councillors will have had an opportunity to step forward to be elected as two of the six Board members. The elections will take place in mid January, internally within the Council. We will come back to you with the results by the end of January.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Thank you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank all the candidates who ran for this election, and hope to see you remain as active members in our communities - and possibly campaign again in the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would also like to sincerely thank those Councillors who completed their terms and will be leaving the Council after three or six years for all their expertise and fantastic work: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/stephan-bartholmei\">Stephan Bartholmei</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ellen-euler\">Ellen Euler</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kate-fernie\">Kate Fernie</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-de-niet\">Marco de Niet</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-streefkerk\">Marco Streefkerk</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, we are grateful to all the voters who dedicated time to approve the formal documents and choose their new representatives. We invite you to have a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Elections%20documents/voting-and-elections-results-2020.pdf\">complete final results</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Website development for cultural heritage content at Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This November on Pro, we share the practices we follow when developing the Europeana website to ensure that people have a positive experience browsing millions of cultural heritage objects. This post looks at our development processes, best practices, and tools we use to ensure that our application is robust and resilient.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Content management for digital cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, we made the decision that we needed to take our processes and technologies for the Europeana website to the next level. We wanted to deliver faster, with fewer bugs, and offer an experience closer to what people see on social networking websites so that people could have the best experience exploring digital cultural heritage items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2020, we <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-new-europeana-collections-website\">launched the new Europeana website</a> using <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/reducing-costs-and-increasing-development-productivity-through-cms-outsourcing\">Contentful</a>, a software as a service (SaaS) content management system (CMS) provider that allows us to combine editorially controlled pages with our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">EDM modelled cultural heritage objects</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contentful enables us to structure our website in the way we want and combines all of our existing CMSs into one. It is virtually codeless, so the team needs no insight into the inner workings. Content structures of the website are designed using the Contentful user interface and relationships between this content are defined there. Contentful is a headless CMS, meaning it is not connected to our front-end interface, which is a client of the Contentful APIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enable a quick and reload-free experience, we rewrote our application using JavaScript in the Vue.js/Nuxt.js framework (a development language and framework). Once you’ve loaded the Europeana website into your browser, it stays there, only requesting data not already available on your machine, which makes requests directly to the APIs rather than going via a server. This ensures that the website does not frequently reload and offers a faster experience for the user.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Reducing bugs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We take great pride in our application in terms of performance and security. We develop our software following our <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/europeana-dev-guides/\">software development guidelines</a> and ensure that all code integrated has unit test coverage of at least 80%, meaning that individual code components used by the website work as expected. We achieve this by ensuring that all our functionalities have end-to-end (E2E) tests using a framework called Cucumber (which is written in the amusingly named scripting language Gherkin!). This includes accessibility testing, and you’ll find more about that in our Pro post on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/making-the-europeana-collections-website-accessible-to-all\">accessibility</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our functionality has associated E2E tests, and we ask that all partners who develop for the Europeana\_website follow these same best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Code and process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana\_website team develops in two-week sprints, following standard scrum rituals - a framework which helps us to work together and continually iterate. While we follow a roadmap and requirements from our funders, we review planned work every two weeks based on current business needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All development tasks are agreed upon by the Product Owner beforehand and ultimately signed off by the Product Owner. When code is completed, a review takes place within the development team to ensure that it is up to standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the application source code for the Europeana collections website is available in our <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/portal.js\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Localisation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want our audiences to be able to explore cultural heritage in their own languages, and are pleased that the Europeana collections website can be explored in 24 European languages. To facilitate this, we use a third-party application called Lokalise, which helps us give different language translators access to the site, and quickly obtain professional translations.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we have English as a default language which users can fall back to if necessary, and people can look at content that is written in languages other than their own, the intention is for users to browse the site in their own localised version.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you spot an incorrect translation please email me (<a href=\"mailto:dasha.moskalenko@europeana.eu\">dasha.moskalenko@europeana.eu</a>) including the original term used on the website and the correct translation - we will address it as soon as possible!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>See our development in action\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you enjoy the performance improvements we made to the Europeana website and they elevate your experience! Enjoy browsing cultural heritage from across Europe.\_\_</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a> is working to better support young, new and emerging professionals as they enter and navigate the field of cultural heritage. The Task Force team have been identifying challenges facing new professionals and aim to deliver recommendations for the implementation of a new professionals programme in January 2021. Throughout 2020, the Task Force has been progressing its work and collaborating with external individuals, organisations and initiatives to feed into sustainable recommendations for the mutual growth and development of both new and experienced professionals within the Europeana Network Association. One of these collaborations has been with the <a href=\"http://www.esach.org\">European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage (ESACH)</a>, which Task Force Members Marius and Carlota lead.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ESACH is a youth-led network of students and young professionals within cultural heritage. Its driving reflections are: how do we engage with the past elements of our culture(s)? How and why do we protect culture as an element of a contemporary cultural system? What do younger generations consider as heritage, and how do they envision to safeguard and experience it? In 2020, more than 120 ESACH members make cultural heritage visible, from the local level to the European sphere, joined by the idea of 'Sharing Heritage'. Below, Marius and Carlota discuss ESACH’s work and involvement in the New Professionals Task Force.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ESACH provides a number of different activities around youth engagement in cultural heritage. Why is this important?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marius</strong>: For me it is all about establishing new ways of communicating and discussing heritage. But there also are tangible and positive outcomes for all those involved in our projects, like building up CVs, acquiring new abilities and developing a professional network for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carlota</strong>: Cultural heritage is an essential part of our future. It is part of our identities, our cities and regions, our sense of emotional belonging, and essential for sustainable development. By increasing youth participation in cultural heritage, we make sure that young people can decide the kind of world they want to live in the future. It is a direct form of empowerment that takes into consideration culture as a basic human right.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you want to get involved with Europeana’s New Professionals Task Force?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marius</strong>: First, because Europeana for me stands out for a way of communicating heritage that adapts to the societal implications of our digitised societies. Second and most importantly, because talking about New Professionals means talking about those shaping the notion of cultural heritage for the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carlota</strong>: I really admire Europeana’s values and work towards making the cultural heritage sector more open, accessible and up-to-date, so I was very excited with the opportunity to collaborate. At the same time, new professionals usually start being students, so I thought it was great on Europeana’s side to think forward and already start considering this fact when developing the recommendations of the New Professionals Task Force.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the key challenges facing students and new professionals?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marius</strong>: I think the greatest challenge for students is to get an idea of the different ways you can work in and with cultural heritage. Regarding new professionals I would say that it is all about finding access and building an own network. It also involves the contractual conditions for entry-level jobs, although the conditions and challenges differ quite significantly between several European countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carlota</strong>: The current health crisis has hugely affected students and new professionals. On the one hand, the suspension of in-presence teaching and the move towards online learning has affected students in a number of ways: students are increasingly isolated and disconnected, and are finding it difficult to carry out their studies due to the closure of libraries and archives. The dependence on technology has especially disadvantaged students from lower socio-economic backgrounds or those in rural areas. On the other hand, new professionals, especially young professionals and recent graduates, have been affected by the economic crisis that has hit the cultural sector, as they tend&nbsp;to hold temporary contracts which are more easily terminated or not renewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can established organisations and experienced professionals support new professionals and/or involve youth participation in cultural heritage?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marius</strong>: There is an easy answer to that: including and listening! Together with our institutional partner Europa Nostra we are working on establishing ESACH as a bridge between students, young and emerging professionals, giving them a gateway to established institutions in the field within Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carlota</strong>: Organisations can set up an internship program, making sure that enough budget is allocated to pay interns a living wage, and establish dedicated programs for the ongoing education and training of new professionals. Experienced professionals can provide invaluable mentoring, raise their voice against unpaid and exploitative hiring practices, and use their position to promote and enhance the initiatives of students and new professionals. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have you planned for the coming&nbsp;year?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marius</strong>: We have a wide program of online, face-to-face events and publications ahead. This academic year, we are developing an online conference series called <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/events.html\">ESACH Talks!</a>, which features short presentations by members followed by a group discussion. And&nbsp; we just launched a call for the <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/news/esach-europa-nostra-internship-programme\">ESACH / Europa Nostra Internship program</a>, which will start in the new year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carlota</strong>: Our 2020 Conference had to be cancelled due to the pandemic, but we are planning to carry out the next one in Madrid in Spring 2021. Finally, the ESACH Book <em><a href=\"http://store.mazupress.com/advances2020\">Advances in interdisciplinary cultural heritage studies</a></em>&nbsp;is out now, featuring essays and articles written by students and young professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana 2020: Crisis, Change and Culture was held over three action packed days, with over 70 speakers covering 50+ sessions and over 900 cultural heritage professionals joining from across the globe. Read on for a recap of Europeana 2020 and to find out how to rewatch the sessions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>First things first: we’d like to thank everyone who made Europeana 2020 such a success, from those of you who took up the challenge and created interesting, inspiring and challenging sessions to those of you who gave up your time and expertise to attend and take part. We estimate over 900 people attended and we would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to you all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">capacity building work</a>, Europeana 2020 was designed to look at three specific areas - digital divides, agency for change and collaboration. Over three days we hosted nearly 50 sessions looking at these from a variety of perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bridging digital divides</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Wednesday 11 November together we explored digital divides and ways to bridge them.\_ Sessions explored themes as diverse as web accessibility, crowdsourcing, digital literacy, Open Access, 3D and building bridges between migrant and host communities through digital cultural heritage, amongst others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Agency for change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Thursday 12 November sessions explored agency for change, with topics covering storytelling, impact, creative responses to COVID-19 and a CALM approach to digital skills development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Collaboration is key</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On Friday 13 November, sessions looked at collaboration in all its facets with sessions on human-centred approaches to AI, Wikipedia and OpenGLAM in schools, using social media to build communities and best practices from across GLAM on climate policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Rewatch the keynotes and panel sessions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to all of our fantastic community-led sessions, our keynotes explored change through policy, human, GLAM and technological lenses, and we brought together experts from the field to discuss these in more depth and to answer your questions. A selection of the keynotes are available to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqmcH-mOlMLye22zBrS-jLftYCO5PRDrJ\">rewatch</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Relive Europeana 2020</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve uploaded the parallel sessions to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWuI05K5RPk&amp;list=PLqmcH-mOlMLygaV7LXaY2mQqMCs-iYFqb\">Youtube</a>, and these are now available for you to view, alongside the other webinars aimed at professionals in the cultural heritage field that we have produced this year. For each session you can find some information about what the session covered, who the expert speakers are, view any related presentations and of course re-watch the sessions themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also still explore the #DigitalAperitivo social event which took place on the second day of Europeana 2020. This online event, organised by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Community</a>, encouraged participants to come together and share the culture they love on social media, in multiple languages! Over the event itself 599 tweets using the hashtag were shared, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DigitalAperitivo&amp;src=typed_query\">over 839 tweets </a>and 130 instagram posts\_were shared in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Complete our post-event survey</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We will be sending out a post-event survey by email to everyone who booked a Europeana 2020 ticket. Just like you, we like to learn and develop our work, and we're issuing this\_survey so we can hear from participants\_on a range of topics, to help us\_better understand the impact of the sessions, and keep developing and refining\_how we deliver a great annual conference. Your feedback is really important to us, so keep an eye out for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Join us for Europeana 2021</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re very excited to announce that Europeana 2021 will take place between 8-12 November 2021, so please mark that date in your diaries. We don’t yet know what form Europeana 2021 will take, but to be the first to hear news about it, complete the short form below.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The METIS Sandbox - or finding joy in working with data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Metis Sandbox is a functional application that enhances the overall data aggregation workflow from data providers to Europeana. In this post, we take a look at what the pilot, developed as part of the Europeana Common Culture project, has achieved.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture</a> project aims to develop a harmonised and coordinated environment for Europeana’s national aggregators, as well as improve content and metadata quality to increase user satisfaction. As part of the project, three pilots (Metis Sandbox, the Linked Open Data Aggregator and 3D Content in Europeana) experimented with novel approaches for aggregation which were tested by national aggregators (NAs) and validated with cultural heritage institutions (CHIs). The Metis Sandbox pilot was led by Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) and delivered in close collaboration with the Europeana Foundation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a long time aggregator for Europeana, the DDB had hands-on observations and experience to bring to the pilot. The process of getting DDB data published in Europeana often took a long time (sometimes up to six months), for various reasons: the data was not valid according to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> and needed to be corrected by the DDB or by the cultural heritage institution/intermediate provider; or it was noticed that the data quality was poor and data or mapping corrections were needed. All this was accompanied by back and forth communication between Europeana’s Data Publishing Services (DPS) Team, the aggregator, sometimes an intermediate aggregator, and the CHI. This loop had to be repeated several times until everything was correct, taking a vast amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This led to the question: what if aggregators could see how data looked in Europeana\_without involving the DPS team? They would be able to perform corrections before even sending the data to Europeana. It would have the potential to profit all aggregators by reducing the number of steps necessary to publish data through Europeana, as well as the to-and-fro communication!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so the Metis Sandbox was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technical aspects</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Metis Sandbox allows the processing of sample datasets according to the Metis workflow. From data import, validation, transformation, normalisation and enrichment to publication it reproduces step by step the processes applied within Metis, Europeana’s core infrastructure for data aggregation. The system issues reports for every step if an error is reported and provides a link to a preview environment at the end of the process, allowing the user to see their data in a copy of Europeana. The data output by the system contains all the automatic enrichments and technical metadata generated by Europeana, as well as the quality tiers for content and metadata.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The\_ DDB was the first to test the pilot.\_ And oh what a joy it was! It’s not often that the words 'data' and 'joy'\_are to be found in the same context, but being able to see the data along with the content and metadata tier meant that this was the case. From the moment it was tested, the Metis Sandbox had a direct impact on the improvement of the DDB’s data workflow and the quality of the submitted data.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was then time to involve other aggregators from the Europeana Common Culture project and get more feedback about the Metis Sandbox. Several national aggregators in the project were involved in testing and evaluation and the results were very encouraging: 83% of the participants found it useful and signaled that they would be happy to use Metis Sandbox for future deliveries to Europeana. The most appreciated features of the tool were content and metadata tier calculation, data validation, and the detailed error/warning reporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is on the books for the future of Metis Sandbox?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Future development</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Metis Sandbox is, next to Metis, one of the pillars of<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\"> Europeana’s Aggregation Strategy</a> published in October. Building on the pilot developed during the project, Europeana Foundation will further extend it to provide, together with Metis, a solution which provides ways of speeding up the publication process in Europeana, to support the digital transformation of aggregators and cultural heritage institutions and improve data quality. The public release of Metis Sandbox will be available in spring 2021.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/process\">sharing data with Europeana</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\">read our Aggregation Strategy</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Generic Services (GS) projects are an annual funding initiative under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom\">CEF Telecom Programme</a>, which started in 2016. The programme aims to support the development of the Europeana Core Service Platform and, on a broader level, the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-projects\">11 Generic Services projects</a> were completed, making significant contributions in three main areas: high-quality data, innovative technologies and capacity building. The projects contributed to a wide reuse of, and audience engagement with, digital heritage content and increased awareness of the Europeana Initiative across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Content and data quality</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During 2020, GS projects delivered more than 3.3 million new records to Europeana on a wide range of topics, from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/uncovering-hidden-stories\">archaeology </a>to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/magical-mystical-and-medicinal\">natural history</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/blue-skies-red-panic\">life in the 1950s</a>. Additionally, they improved and enriched over 5.2 million content records and metadata. GS projects also contributed new types of content, aggregating 800 3D models and more than 173,000 crowdsourced annotations to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Data-centered tools&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Six tools created by GS projects enable cultural heritage institutions to benefit from innovative technologies and improve their aggregation infrastructures and processes, with special focus on metadata enrichment and 3D.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of tools support content search in Europeana by encouraging metadata improvements and linking metadata terms to Linked Open Data (LOD) repositories.&nbsp;For example, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/linbi-enrichment-platform\">enrichment platform</a> created by the LinBi project provides tools for linking, enriching and creating new objects following <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) guidelines. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-archaeology-vocabulary-services\">vocabulary services</a> developed by&nbsp; theEuropeana Archaeology project is an online mapping tool which interlinks metadata terms with LOD resources. Meanwhile, Europeana Common Culture developed the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/innovating-metadata-aggregation-in-europeana-via-linked-data\">Linked Open Data&nbsp;pipeline</a>, an aggregation channel offering tools for harvesting LOD and converting it from one vocabulary into another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Common Culture project also developed <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">Metis Sandbox</a>, a functional application that enhances the overall data aggregation workflow from data providers to Europeana. It reduces the time required for quality checks when submitting data by allowing the processing of sample datasets according to the Metis workflow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Share3D project developed the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/dashboard\">Dashboard tool</a> to help cultural heritage professionals create 3D models in line with the EDM and submit these to Europeana, while the Common Culture project delivered&nbsp;a lightweight 3D viewer which allows the URL of a 3D resource to be easily integrated in the EDM record and shown on Europeana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Audience engagement tools</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the digital age, cultural organisations strive to retain, support and engage their online visitors, something which a number of tools developed by this year’s Generic Services projects support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crowdsourcing campaigns are increasingly popular among cultural heritage institutions as an entertaining way of engaging the general public to enrich the data and metadata of cultural heritage objects. Two GS projects in 2020 addressed this need: the dedicated <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/crowdheritage\">platform</a> developed by the CrowdHeritage project allows cultural heritage institutions to create tailored campaigns to improve their metadata, while <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a>, which was enhanced by EnrichEuropeana, supports transcription and enrichment of content from manuscripts, letters and other handwritten text from Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two GS projects supported Europeana as a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-task-force-launches-europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">powerful platform for storytelling</a> by creating tools that allow experts and non-experts to engage with Europeana content and create digital narratives. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/storymaker\">Storymaker tool</a> from the Share3D project allows anyone to make digital stories with 3D content. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/movescollect-and-movesscrapbook\">MovesPlug In and MovesScrabook</a> by CultureMoves offer a browser extension to save Europeana content in digital scrapbooks, and then mix and remix it with private digital collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/enhanced-unified-playout-service\">Enhanced Unified Playout Service</a> by Europeana Media offers heritage institutions a state-of-the-art media player specially designed for cultural heritage audiences to improve the reuse of audiovisual heritage. Additionally, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/motionnotes\">MotionNotes</a>, developed by CultureMoves, is a multimodal video annotator that facilitates the use of Europeana content and digital technologies in art and dance performances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CultureChatbot developed<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/culture-chatbot\"> AI-based software</a> which allows CHIs to interact with their visitors across online platforms, from their collections websites to social media accounts. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">See the Chatbot in action on Europeana Pro</a>. Meanwhile, museum educators and teachers can create easily online learning resources with the cultural heritage content available on Europeana by using the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/builder\">eActivity Builder</a> developed by Opening Up Historiana project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Capacity building</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Common Culture delivered a series of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars#sharing-data\">webinars </a>around data aggregation and sharing, from open and FAIR data to semantic enrichment. The Fifties in Europe’s Kaleidoscope together with CultureMoves created the massive open online course <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/course/creating-a-digital-cultural-heritage-community\">Creating a Digital Cultural Heritage Community</a> for cultural heritage professionals to introduce them to innovative practices for audience engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can explore all the tools created under the Europeana GS projects in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/services-and-tools\">Services and Tools</a>&nbsp; section of Europeana Pro. Try them out and contact the project partners to discuss open questions or possible implementation in your institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To hear about future GS developments and calls, follow our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/projects\">Project section</a> in Pro and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Europeana Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month, Robert Davies speaks about involvement in projects with Europeana and the importance of capacity building.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost half a century ago (!) I got a postgraduate qualification in Library and Information Science.\_After this I started a job at the British Council, the UK’s ‘cultural diplomacy’ agency, for which I spent 14 years living and working in Jakarta, Singapore and Cairo, in between several\_stints in London. In 1990, I set up the first of a sequence of organisations which ran projects and did international consultancy, mainly in information and education. We won our first ‘telematics for libraries’ project under the EU research framework in 1993. Following increased EU attention to culture - and its future digital context -\_ around 20 years ago,\_ we ran a lot of EU projects, including a number of predecessor actions to Europeana. And with the birth of Europeana, I helped initiate or was closely involved with six or seven best practice networks, research projects and similar actions, under its ‘umbrella’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2016, I have been working with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marinos-ioannides\">Marinos Ioannides</a> and the team at the Digital Heritage Research Laboratory, Cyprus University of Technology. We have been awarded the European Research Area and UNESCO Chairs in Digital Heritage. We also coordinated the ViMM (Virtual Multi-Modal Museum) CSA 2016-19. Currently, I’m working on the EU study on Quality in 3D Digitisation of Tangible Cultural Heritage as well as on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture Generic Services project</a> where, at the moment, I’m looking at digital heritage crowdsourcing across Europe as an aspect of capacity building. Incidentally, I am speaking at\_ a webinar related to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/crowdsourcing-of-digital-cultural-heritage-tickets-129271838549\">Crowdsourcing and Digital Cultural Heritage</a> on 15 December which anyone reading this is warmly invited to join.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, aside from trying to keep an organisation going for 25 years, the greatest challenges - and professional satisfaction - have been linked to the\_ complexity of new conditions and trying to help bring about change. I can think, for example, back to the 1990s - of working with libraries, museums and archives in Central and Eastern Europe to become engaged with the EU; and helping gain large-scale EU funding for the libraries of historically disadvantaged universities in South Africa. Then, later, a series of actions to support transposition of the Directive on Public Sector Information (PSI)\_ into Member States’ law. A few years ago,\_I co-authored a World Bank Global Development study and report on digital dividends in rural China. Each of these challenged the limits of my knowledge and competence in various ways. Helping get a fairly high proportion of the content metadata into Europeana in its first phase, through several different projects, was also a big test!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been invested in Europeana since its very beginning and consider that it remains the key initiative in European cultural heritage in the digital era. I was earlier involved in several Task Forces, and it felt a natural step to stand for election to the Members Council. I was delighted to be elected - there are a lot of excellent candidates in the Europeana Network Association!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I joined the Management Board of ENA earlier this year and am currently involved in the discussion around increasing inclusivity and diversity within collections and in the representativeness of our community. This is very important to me. Beyond that, I would like to help ENA to complement the Europeana Initiative\_by interacting effectively with cultural heritage Institutions around ‘digital transformation’. I also see community engagement and a stronger contribution to local identity and ‘sense of place’, as something Europeana can strengthen with ENA support.\_\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Looking back at the ENA Members Council in 2020'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In 2020, the Europeana Network Association (ENA) Members Council has successfully adapted to a new way of working in the midst of a global health crisis. Take a look at what our Councillors have explored this year as they work towards developing new digital audiences,\_services, skills and societal impact.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>A focus on digital transformation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020 the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> (the body of formally elected representatives of the ENA) have met virtually three times. The topic of digital transformation, in light of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/mission#strategy-2020-2025\">Europeana Strategy 2020 - 2025</a> and the COVID-19 crisis, has been a key topic of discussion in all meetings. In March, Councillors discussed how the ENA can actively contribute to the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector and the role they ENA could play. They continued their exploration at the second Council meeting in July, where they examined the results of June’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-digital-capacity-sense-making-findings-and-outcomes\">sense-making and capacity building workshops on digital transformation</a> in breakout sessions. Councillors recognised a sense of urgency in the cultural heritage sector and a desire to use the momentum for accelerating its digital transformation, for the Europeana Initiative to work together to bridge the digital divides and to create a capacity building framework that addresses the sector’s needs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the final Council meeting of 2020 in December, Councillors provided feedback on a proposed definition and understanding of digital transformation and Europeana’s role in it. They were able to discuss the pains and gains of cultural heritage professionals, identify common needs, and make recommendations for the scope of the Europeana Capacity Building Framework.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Supporting the ENA</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Council meetings this year have also overseen the ongoing organisation of the ENA. Councillors approved all <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">ENA community</a> work plans and budgets for 2020, planned the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/renew-your-membership-and-keep-working-with-us-in-the-europeana-network-association\">2020 membership campaign</a> and explored outcomes of the ENA impact assessment and satisfaction survey. Councillors discussed the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on activities and community budgets, and received regular updates on the Europeana Aggregators Forum, the ENA Climate Group, and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-restructures-its-governance\">new governance model for the Europeana Foundation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 11 November 2020, ENA members and Councillors gathered virtually at the ENA General Assembly, which took place at the start of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/catch-up-with-europeana-2020\">Europeana 2020 conference</a>. This saw members approve the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2020/General-Assembly-minutes-2019.pdf\">Minutes of the 2019 meeting of the General Assembly</a>, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=295b83ee89&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">ENA Annual Report 2020</a>, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=4cb00bbd79&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Activity Plan for 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=fc87becc07&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Financial Report 2019</a> and <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=63a17f1dfe&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">Provisional Budget for 2021</a> and reflect on the ENA’s achievements over the year. They also looked at the goals and aspirations for ENA in the coming year, which include\_ invigorating the Network and its members, strengthening communities, working on capacity building and focusing on sustainability. Read the full aims in the <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=4cb00bbd79&amp;e=a3abf5d9e3\">2021 Activity Plan</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Addressing inclusivity and diversity</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the third and last Members Council meeting of 2020 on 3-4 December 2020, the Council spent time reflecting on the General Assembly meeting and Europeana 2020 conference. The ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> presented the Council with a proposal for a position paper which could act as a policy outline to support ENA actions on inclusivity and diversity. The Council agreed to collaborate with the Foundation and the EAF to form a task force that can provide a better understanding of the options the Europeana Initiative has to increase inclusivity and diversity across the cultural heritage sector. The task force can work on a roadmap and organise targeted, peer-to-peer sense making workshops led by experts in the field of inclusion and diversity in order to get a better understanding of the scope of the problem space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task force recommendations will plan next steps and measure progress. In this context, a group of volunteers came forward to actively work together to address the topic of anti-racism as an integral part of the approach to inclusivity and diversity. The fact that the Council engaged in a constructive and open discussion on this kind of sensitive societal issue is a sign of ENA maturing, its Council’s collective spirit and willingness to learn and evolve in a positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>New Councillors\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the Council said goodbye to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/stephan-bartholmei\">Stephan Bartholmei</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ellen-euler\">Ellen Euler</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kate-fernie\">Kate Fernie</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-de-niet\">Marco de Niet</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-streefkerk\">Marco Streefkerk</a>, who have reached the end of their current terms. We profoundly appreciate and value their contributions to ENA activities over the past few years and hope to keep working with them as ENA members! We also welcome the nine <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-network-association-welcomes-its-nine-new-members-councillors\">newly elected Councillors</a>, who were introduced at the last Council meeting of 2020.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors will meet again virtually in spring. The minutes of all the Council meetings are available on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/documentation#network-association-updates\">Europeana Pro</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>As part of the the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture project</a>, three pilots (Metis Sandbox, the Linked Open Data Aggregator and 3D Content in Europeana) experimented with novel approaches for aggregation which were tested by national aggregators (NAs) and validated with cultural heritage institutions (CHIs). Trinity College Dublin (TCD) led the 3D pilot in collaboration with the new National Aggregator for Ireland, Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Aggregating 3D content&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DRI has been providing solutions to preserve, curate and provide sustained access to Ireland’s cultural heritage data since 2015. In October 2019, DRI achieved Europeana Accredited Aggregator status, having developed an aggregation service for Irish Cultural Heritage Institutes as part of the Common Culture project. TCD then set out to extend this aggregation service by adding support for 3D content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first step was to investigate best practice for 3D content aggregation in terms of file formats, metadata and EDM integration. Currently the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> provides quality guidelines for textual, image, sound and video content, but there is little guidance available for 3D content. An investigation carried out by TCD found that there was a huge variation in the types and quality of content which was tagged as 3D in Europeana. TCD worked with the Europeana Network Association’s 3D Content in Europeana Task Force contributing to the recommendations for 3D content published in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">Task Force final report</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making 3D scans available&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the Task Force published its recommendations, work began on extending the DRI aggregation service to support 3D content. An initial dataset was provided by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) consisting of territorial laser scans of scenes, archaeological monuments, famous statues and bridges captured using Faro Focus S120 and Leica TS15 scanners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the substantial scans can be viewed using desktop software, they pose a challenge for web based applications where the data needs to load quickly for display in a browser with user friendly interactions. Using a variety of tools, 3D replicas of the scenes were reconstructed to provide lightweight versions of the source files in interoperable formats (although the source files remain available alongside these versions). A detailed description of this preprocessing is available in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-14-3d#3d-activities-of-the-europeana-common-culture-project\">Europeana Tech Insight issue 14</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3D embeddable viewer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next step was to provide users with the tools not only to view but to interact with 3D content. The JavaScript WebGL API, which is built into most modern web browsers, makes it possible to build web-embeddable 3D viewers. A range of options are available, including commercial platforms like Sketchfab as well as self-hosted solutions such as 3DHOP or Smithsonian voyager.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the 3D pilot, TCD decided to build a custom embeddable viewer which would allow organisations to integrate the tool into their own platforms without any of the fees associated with commercial solutions, which would also support a larger range of file formats than some of the self-hosted alternatives. This was developed as part of the DRI National Aggregator platform, and consists of a <a href=\"https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/g732sz11t\">lightweight viewer</a> that leverages an open source framework for robust 3D display using the Three.js JavaScript library. The viewer is also available as a <a href=\"https://repository.dri.ie/embed3d/g732sz11t/files/gb19tt955\">standalone version</a> suitable for embedding. For embedding purpose, TCD followed the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Europeana Publishing Guidelines</a> and made the viewer compliant with the oEmbed API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Innovating metadata aggregation in Europeana via linked data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Aggregating linked data has the potential to improve data interoperability at global scale. A linked data pilot, developed as part of the Europeana Common Culture project, has investigated this potential, and in this post we take a look at what it achieved.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Aggregating linked data\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Linked data is a way of publishing structured data on the web that allows metadata to be connected and enriched. This ensures that different representations of the same content can be found, and links made between related resources. Aggregating linked data has the potential to bring cost benefits and improve data interoperability at global scale, and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-common-culture\">Europeana Common Culture</a> project investigated the feasibility of using such linked data for aggregation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana already operates a scalable and sustainable metadata aggregation model for the cultural heritage sector. Aggregating linked data would mean that data providers would more easily be able to share their metadata with cultural heritage aggregators who made use of linked data. For providers not yet publishing linked data, implementing it for participation in Europeana would also provide them with the benefit of being able to use their linked data for other applications, and with other domains besides cultural heritage, such as Internet search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Working with data providers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot ran from May 2019 to June 2020. It was coordinated\_by Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (NISV) and delivered in close collaboration with the Dutch Digital Heritage Network (NDE) who supported the project by providing knowledge, software and infrastructure to run the tests.\_The pilot\_involved three types of participants in the Europeana ecosystem: data providers,<b id=\"docs-internal-guid-7ae8f3a9-7fff-ce14-7e6c-2fb7bef91641\">\_</b>aggregators and the Europeana Foundation. Twelve data providers joined the pilot, but not all of them were fully aware of the technical challenges that this novel approach would bring. Four of the providers were not able to deliver a dataset as linked data, and two other providers delivered datasets with insufficient data for aggregation into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the six successful cases, five providers already had in-house knowledge or an existing implementation of linked data, and for one, it was its first effort in publishing linked data. Our conclusion is that there is much interest in implementing linked data among data providers. However, it requires a significant level of resources when an organisation does not have any previous experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Pilot outcomes\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot applied an approach for linked data aggregation based on two specifications for delivering a linked dataset for Europeana. These had previously been successful for a small-scale pilot in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy project</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first specification is that dataset-level metadata should be provided by using well-known vocabularies. It includes the kinds of dataset distributions that data providers can use, and the required metadata for each.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second specification addresses the use of <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a> linked data for describing cultural heritage objects according to the requirements of Europeana and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>. Currently, Europeana only supports ingestion of metadata in EDM. However, experiments on applying Schema.org to metadata descriptions of cultural heritage objects have shown that it can provide good quality data, which is capable of fulfilling the requirements of Europeana. This specification provides a general level of guidance for use of Schema.org metadata that, after conversion to EDM, will result in metadata that is suitable for aggregation by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot also resulted in a toolset for linked data aggregation that is designed for use by Europeana aggregators and aggregators of other similar networks. Although the toolset functionality is tailored for the EDM, aggregators using other data models may add their own conversions and validations using the standards implemented by the toolset. The toolset is based on Docker containers which preserve the technical independence of its tools, making the solution portable to different environments, and scalable, giving the possibility to apply the toolset to small or large collections. The\_toolset and its source code is available in <a href=\"https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/lod-aggregator\">Github</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Future work</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of areas for future work have been identified. Data providers would benefit from tools for preparing their linked data. The validation tools implemented in the toolset can also be used in the creation of services for data providers, allowing them to check the validity of their data at earlier stages of linked data publication. An initial step in this direction was conducted by testing the aggregated linked data using the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">Europeana Metis Sandbox</a>.\_A second line of work starting in 2021 will focus on components for interoperability and integration of the toolset into aggregators’ systems. This work will be coordinated by The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision in the Dutch national project Digitale Collectie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about linked data, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-common-culture-webinar-loda-the-linked-open-data-aggregator\">watch our webinar</a> from\_ October 2020 about LODA - the Linked Open Data Aggregator, and if you are interested in the topic and would like more chances to discuss it,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">join the EuropeanaTech</a> community.</p>\r\n"

With the pandemic this year, there was no possibility of doing face-to-face physical events, so after some eager discussions in February 2020, a group of passionate individuals decided to pole-vault online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We launched at the end of May, bringing together a number of cultural organisations from across Ireland who were interested in collecting and sharing their sporting and cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

There are stories about many different sports - pole vaulting, Gaelic football, surfing, showjumping, the Special Olympics, hockey, kendo, running, football, horse riding, kung fu and tennis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are stories from prominent sports people as well as members of the public - we were not just interested in key sporting achievements, but also about people's experience in a wide range of sporting participation and experience. One story contributed by Dublin runner, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/256/contributions_1396dde0_e09f_0138_7fbb_6eee0af55a94\">Mary Egan</a>, is about her recovery from breast cancer thanks to the solidarity and support of Porterstown Parkrun and the Porterstown Panthers running communities and how important this was for her well-being and mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are stories from the past - such as the development of surfing in Ireland more than 70 years ago, the perils of pole-vaulting with bamboo in the 1930s or how people started practising kendo in Ireland - as well as stories from the present day.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />What did you learn?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just putting the word out on social media and inviting people to share a story didn't seem to work as well as a more personal approach. It was really important that there were sporting organisations amongst our partners who had existing networks of sports people which we were able to reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached out to national governing bodies for different sports, who were already having a very busy year but who cooperated in different ways. For example, Surfing Ireland took on a role in our project finding archive photographs from the early days of surfing in Ireland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought it was important to engage and reach out to minority voices and marginalised groups so their sporting stories and experiences would be part of the campaign. We also received feedback supporting the need for this approach to ensure Ireland’s Stories was pro-actively working to be better representative of diverse voices and experiences across Ireland. For example, we’ve been collecting and&nbsp; working with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/sport-against-racism-ireland-talk-sport-for-cultural-integration-and-social-inclusion\">Sport Against Racism in Ireland</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-social-media-storytellers-black-and-irish-are-exploring-history-and-overcoming-stereotypes\">Black and Irish</a>, <a href=\"https://irishstreetleague.com\">Irish Homeless Street Leagues </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/item/256/contributions_61700b00_92dc_0138_7911_6eee0af40f32\">Sanctuary Runners Ireland</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also found it important to talk about our experiences and lessons learnt at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-lunch-cafe-3\">Europeana Lunch Café on Europe’s Sport Heritage</a> and Europeana Sport webinar:<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-sport-webinar-engaging-audiences-with-sport-and-culture\"> Engaging Audiences with Sport and Culture&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How has the pandemic shaped your activities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of these stories have connected people together around their love for sport, exercise, friendship, community and wellbeing. It would be brilliant to continue this type of digital story collecting and support Europeana as a home for our collective memory and shared experiences. There’s clearly a huge appetite for it during COVID-19, as many simply want to remember and share significant moments with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of our communication has been about asking people to share stories. We've been encouraged by volunteers in sport organisations who are looking to digitise their sports memorabilia, encouraging others to participate in the campaign.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elsewhere in Ireland, as part of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work</a> season, the Hunt Museum in Limerick, hosted an international symposium and collection day called <a href=\"https://www.huntmuseum.com/whats-on/europe-at-work-ardnacrusha-memories-symposium\">Ardnacrusha Memories</a> to highlight how the Shannon Hydro-Electric Scheme played a pivotal role in the social, economic and industrial development of Ireland in the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maybe with people cocooning due to the lockdown, this has been an opportunity to connect with them&nbsp;in their community to share their stories. Ireland’s Stories is continuing to collect individual sporting stories and also engage with local communities, libraries, archives, museums, galleries, and other types of cultural heritage organisations to collect and share sporting heritage and experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the challenge</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">250 years ago, on 16 December 1770, Ludwig van Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany. Cultural heritage institutions around Europe have organised concerts, exhibitions, talks and the <a href=\"https://www.bthvn2020.de/en/\">#Beethoven250 event</a> to celebrate the anniversary, and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\">Europeana Education community</a> was eager to join! In October, we launched <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reinventing-beethoven\">#reinventingBeethoven</a>, a creative, educational challenge for students in primary and secondary schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The challenge aimed to encourage students’ creativity with cultural heritage resources from the Europeana website and to introduce music as a powerful educational tool in the classroom for all subjects. We invited teachers to introduce Beethoven’s life and work to students and coordinate the creation of an artwork, with prizes for the most popular pieces. We suggested that they use the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/es\">Europena website, editorials</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/es/europeana-classroom\">educational resources</a> for inspiration, and explore the collections of other relevant museums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engaging students and teachers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Engaging young learners with cultural heritage resources can be a fantastic way for them to explore historical and diverse topics, but we understand that teachers are sometimes limited on the time they can dedicate to these. For the #reinventingBeethoven challenge, Europeana Education tried to make participating as easy as possibly by producing resources, content and guidelines for teachers to use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We published content on the Europeana website to engage young audiences in the challenges, including a new gallery called '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/es/galleries/life-and-works-of-beethoven\">Life and works of Beethoven</a>' and&nbsp; two blog posts '<a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/2020/11/beethoven-ode-to-joy-a-cultural-kaleidoscope/\">Beethoven's Ode to Joy: a cultural kaleidoscope</a>' and '<a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/2020/12/geniuses-and-their-disabilities/\">Geniuses and their (dis)abilities</a>'. These covered two key topics related to the challenge, and a <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/europeana/ludwig-van-beethoven-1770-1827-the-9th-symphony-and-the-european-values\">Historiana’s source collection</a> encouraged students to learn more about the socio-historical context around Beethoven’s life and work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Entries and voting</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The competition ran from 26 October until 3 December, and we were delighted to see 28 groups of students from 11 countries around the world take part. On 10 December, we invited our online followers and jury (composed of (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/altheo-valentini\">Altheo Valentini</a>, Co-Chair of the Europeana Education community; Giuseppe Mossuti, Project Manager at European Schoolnet; and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/lorraine-besnier\">Lorraine Besnier</a>, Junior Project Manager at&nbsp;EuroClio) &nbsp;to vote on 13 of these artworks to select two winners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Voting took place via the tool <a href=\"http://padlet.com\">Padlet</a>, and the call for votes was published on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EuropeanaEducation/\">Europeana Education Facebook Group</a>, where it was enthusiastically shared by members. In total 12,716 votes were collected!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The winners</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>#reinventingBeethoven Jury Award</strong> goes to the Happy Birthday Beethoven project created by 11-14 year-old students, coordinated by Elisabetta Nanni from the IC Rovereto Nord (Rovereto, Italy). The project created an interactive exhibition around Beethoven’s life and work and an escape room in Beethoven’s Bonn house.</p>\r\n"

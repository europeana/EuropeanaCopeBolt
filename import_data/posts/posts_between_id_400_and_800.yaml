        body: "<p><em>By Julia Fallon &amp; Neil Bates, Europeana Foundation </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 47 candidates from 18 countries to choose from, you might need a little help in deciding who gets your vote to join the new Members’ Council at as one of the 25 Network Councillors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the nomination process we asked each candidate to select 5 keywords that they most identified with. To get an idea of which keywords best represent our 47 candidates, we have created a word cloud that highlights the most selected words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are very pleased that the three core values identified in <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Strategy 2020</a>: Usable, Mutual and Reliable are also important to the candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(2).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 280px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Word cloud generated using the keywords that were chosen by all 47 candidates. Europeana (CC-BY-SA) </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are very excited to see that candidates come from far and wide, even outside of the European Union. Explore the interactive map below to see where the candidates come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network Members are invited to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/cast-your-vote\">cast their vote</a> by midnight Friday 7th November. It is important to remember that for your vote to be counted, you need to be a registered member of the Europeana Network.You can join in a matter of minutes by filling out the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/network/apply\">registration form on Europeana Pro</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can view the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates\">individual profiles of each candidate</a> in a dedicated <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/elections2014\">Elections 2014 section</a> of the Europeana Pro website, which highlights their background and the keywords that represent them best.

        title: 'Europe’s cultural heritage institutions deserve better'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This blog post by Paul Keller was first published on the <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/opinie/europes-cultural-heritage-institutions-deserve-better-2/%20\">Kennisland</a> website</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of us looking forward to copyright rules that enable European cultural heritage institutions to provide online access to their collections, two important things happened last week: on Wednesday 29th October, the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm%20\">Orphan Works directive</a> (OW directive) came into force and on Saturday 1st November, the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019_en\">new European Commission headed by Jean-Claude Juncker</a> assumed office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first event marks the failure of the existing system, while the second one is reason to give us hope for a more meaningful modernisation of the European copyright system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the current system does not take into account the needs of cultural heritage institutions is painfully illustrated by the Orphan Works directive. After years of legislative wrangling, Europe came up with a ‘solution' for the problem of orphan works(1) that requires cultural heritage institutions wanting to make orphan works available to undertake complicated searches for rights holders, before they are allowed to publish them. In most cases, the resources required for such searches are completely out of balance with the cultural and economic value of the work. This means that the Orphan Works directive may be a useful tool for making small numbers of high profile works available, but not as an enabler of mass digitisation projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/0d063187-9833-452a-9018-7e467afff9fd.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 640px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Cilip1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 506px;\"><a>Image Properties</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Images: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cilipmarketing/sets/72157648603957658\">Cilip Marketing</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the OW directive ended up as a crippled tool that fails to address the problem it was designed to answer (enabling mass digitisation of collections), is the result of a number factors: strong pressure from rights holders and their representatives to preserve the underlying principles of copyright even in a situation where they do more good than harm; the lack of coordinated advocacy efforts from cultural heritage institutions at the European Level; and a weak European Commission that was split on copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to the last point there is reason to hope that the situation is changing. The Juncker Commission that came into office on the first of November has made the modernisation of copyright one of its top priorities. In his <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/about/juncker-commission/docs/ansip_en.pdf\">mission letters to the Commissioners in charge of a connected Digital Single Market</a>, Juncker made it clear that he expects his team to come up with 'ambitious legislative steps' towards 'modernising copyright rules in the light of the ongoing digital revolution' within the next six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, the time to start fighting for copyright rules that enable cultural heritage institutions to properly function online is now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cultural heritage institutions deserve better copyright rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is at stake? The current copyright rules affecting cultural heritage institutions were drafted long before most institutions became active online and long before governments and users began pushing for the online availability of collections. Given this, it is not surprising that the rules no longer make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Europe's cultural heritage institutions deserve better than an OW directive that does not support mass digitisation and that forces them to spend scarce public resources looking for rights holders who have abandoned their works and may not exist at all. These resources would be much better spent on digitising and contextualising collections.</li>\r\n    <li>They deserve better than a copyright directive that allows them to digitise works only in certain special cases(2). Digitising heritage collections constitutes the most fundamental shift in how we preserve our cultural memories since the invention of the printing press. We need copyright rules that make this transition possible with as little friction as possible.</li>\r\n    <li>They deserve better than a copyright directive that allows them to make works available only via ‘dedicated terminals’(3), and specifically bans making works available online under an exception. Do we really expect our kids to go to the library to use a 'dedicated terminal' when they carry devices that provide access to the entire world in their pockets?</li>\r\n    <li>Libraries in particular deserve better than a lending directive(4) that leaves them at the mercy of publishers when they want to lend out e-books. Public libraries providing public access to all books did not come about because publishers were so generous as to authorise them to do so; we have public libraries because they are important. That fact does not change because books are increasingly consumed in digital formats.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>In short, Europe needs a copyright system that enables universal online access to the collections of our cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Opposing interests?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who or what is standing in the way of efforts to make this a reality?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically publishers, authors and their representatives have been deeply sceptical of any expansion of copyright exceptions that allow cultural heritage institutions (and other types of beneficiaries) to use copyrighted materials without the express permission of rights holders. A close study of this stakeholder group’s responses to the public consultation on a review of the European copyright rules reveals that their primary concern is ‘unfair competition between libraries (and similar institutions), and [their own] commercial offers’(5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while cultural heritage institutions argue in favour of exceptions that would allow them to make available online works that are not in commercial circulation anymore, publishers (and authors) are concerned that cultural heritage institutions will use broader exceptions to unfairly compete with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, these two positions seem rather easy to reconcile. The non-commercial use of material that is no longer commercially available by cultural heritage institutions would, by definition, not compete with the commercial activities of publishers and authors. Instead, the responses to the consultation point to two complementary roles that need to be enabled by an updated copyright framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publishers and creators should be enabled to continue to produce and exploit creative works without having to compete with public institutions. Cultural heritage institutions have a duty to ensure that those parts of our cultural heritage not in commercial circulation are available for the public to consult online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The time to act is now</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Juncker Commission gears up its efforts to modernise European copyright rules, the cultural heritage sector has no time to lose. It must ensure that the above message is communicated loud and clear to policy makers in Brussels and in individual member states. One of the reasons why the Orphan Works directive is so woefully inadequate is that cultural heritage institutions have not managed to effectively coordinate their efforts in Brussels, while rights holder representatives have a long history in doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Change is not something that is going to happen by itself, it requires institutions from across Europe to make their voices heard(6) and explain that the cultural heritage sector deserves much better.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Orphan works are works that are still in copyright where the author or other rights holders cannot be identified or located and which may therefore not be published because permission to do so from the rights holders cannot be obtained.</li>\r\n    <li>See <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML\">article 5.2.c of the Copyright directive</a> that allows specific acts of reproduction made by publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums, or by archives.</li>\r\n    <li>See <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML\">article 5.3.n of the Copyright directive</a> that allows use by communication or making available, for the purpose of research or private study, to individual members of the public by dedicated terminals on the premises of Libraries, Archives and Museums.</li>\r\n    <li>See <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/;ELX_SESSIONID=1prRJXXKy1SSn7fbtccHyjPkLRG9hSrTy3GXyQGqGtG27SXQJZ7Z!977335980?uri=CELEX:32006L0115\">Directive 2006/115/EC</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right.</li>\r\n    <li>See the European Commission’s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/docs/contributions/consultation-report_en.pdf\">report on the responses</a> to the Public Consultation on the Review of the EU Copyright Rules.</li>\r\n    <li>For example by talking to policy makers, writing to MEPs and making sure that European organisations representing your sector are making this issue a priority for the months to come.</li>\r\n</ol>"

        title: 'Cultural heritage institutions re-ingesting enriched metadata'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Guest post by Sam Alloing, Inés Matres, Nathalie Poot and Antoine Isaac</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fostering the re-use of content in Europeana, <a href=\"http://europeana-inside.eu/%20\">Europeana Inside</a> launched a pilot recently using enrichments made by Europeana for the content provided within the framework of the project. Semantic and multilingual enrichment is a process by which the content providers’ metadata is linked automatically to external resources such as multilingual vocabularies and gazetteers, providing more context to the data and pulling in additional information such as other language labels and alternative spellings. With this pilot, Europeana Inside tested a new functionality introduced in the Collections Management Systems (CMS) of several museums in Europe via the Europeana Connection Kit (ECK). In the following post, we present the outcomes of this pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Content re-ingestion is an opportunity introduced and tested by Europeana Inside, by which providers get metadata about their objects back, after it has been processed in the Europeana Inside connection toolkit (ECK) and Europeana. It constitutes the last evolution of the ECK. Through this functionality that connects the aggregator with the CMS of the participating cultural institutions, ECK is used to retrieve, select, re-ingest the content from Europeana back to the collections’ source with minimal intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enrichment tracking and re-ingestion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/blog/multilingual_and_semantic_enrichment.html\">Europeana Inside</a> provided information on the type of information contained within a metadata record that can be enriched by Europeana (agents, concepts as well as geographical and time coverage). Enriched records can be found directly in the Europeana portal as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Go to the Europeana portal and click right below ‘all providers’</li>\r\n    <li>Select the collection for which you want to check enrichments (the collections are listed under their aggregating project / facet)</li>\r\n    <li>Once on the collection grid, click on one of the objects.</li>\r\n    <li>The collection number provided by Europeana is located in the URL after '/record/'.</li>\r\n    <li>Enter the desired query in Europeana:\r\n    <ul>\r\n<li>europeana_collectionName: 000000* AND edm_agent:*</li>\r\n        <li>europeana_collectionName: 000000* AND edm_place:*</li>\r\n        <li>europeana_collectionName: 000000* AND edm_timespan:*</li>\r\n        <li>europeana_collectionName: 000000* AND skos_concept:*</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Ines1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 70px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Query that retrieves enriched records directly on the Europeana.eu portal</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘enrich and return’ functionality developed by Europena Inside uses the API, which contains more precise enrichment information than the information displayed on the portal, which mixes providers’ enrichments with Europeana’s. ECK makes it possible for cultural institutions to retrieve the enrichments in their own CMS, thus fostering the re-use of content in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all cultural heritage institutions that publish data on Europeana are familiar with the enrichment process. Guidelines about the enrichments should be made generally available like the EDM guidelines. Content partners can gain more insight about how and in what fields the enrichment takes place by following up the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gyB44C4wdD6eLTiZie57xGsf8dNmy2RMLGCv7fy-_4c/\">developments</a> of the enrichment task force. Understanding the enrichment process would not only ease the evaluation process of the enrichments, but it would also help content partners to improve their metadata in such a way to increase enrichment success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it has been regarded as a promising test, institutions are preoccupied; in case correct metadata is provided and incorrect data is displayed, cultural institutions would desire that a workflow exists to get errors fixed. Cultural institutions expect it to be as easy to share their collections as to amend or report inaccuracies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the pilot, following participating institutions are able to consult enriched records from within their own collection system: the National Gallery-Alexandros Soutzos Museum (GR), Benaki Museum (GR), Royal Museums of Art and History (BE), Stiftelsen Lansmuseet Vasternorrland (SE), Pet?fi Literary Museum and Hungarian National Museum (HU). These museums have adopted in their CMS the ‘enrich and return’ functionality already during the project, therefore they were able to evaluate it. In the future, other participants of Europeana Inside and other cultural heritage institutions will have this functionality available by updating their collections’ software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaluation of enrichments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In collaboration with Europeana, a survey to evaluate the enrichments was elaborated and twelve content partners from the Europeana Inside Consortium analysed and evaluated the enrichments. Here is what was asked:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Identify the fields from the original metadata that have been enriched (agents, places, time periods, concepts)</li>\r\n    <li>Provide feedback on the quality of the enrichments. Are they accurate? Explain why or why not.</li>\r\n    <li>Which from the enriched fields do you consider to be the most useful?</li>\r\n    <li>How do you plan to re-use the enriched data?</li>\r\n    <li>What do you consider to be the main advantage of the enriched metadata?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>From the possible fields to be enriched by Europeana, the multilingual enrichments provided by <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">Geonames</a> for geographical information and <a href=\"http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/en/about/\">GEMET</a> and <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/About\">DBpedia</a> for concepts, were identified as the most valuable. Some institutions stated that their public could be very interested in using enriched agent information, if this is accurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural institutions identify that one added value of the enrichments is to overcome language barriers. The most probable use of multilingual enrichments is to improve the front end search functionality on their own websites. Another practical use is to combine enrichments with the original metadata, in order to supply enriched records to future aggregation processes (e.g. to other portals). But in order for this to happen, enrichments have to prove reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some patterns for inaccuracies or other issues relating to semantic enrichment:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Places: Europeana finds wrong matches for certain geographical coverage information, especially when they are ambiguous localities or towns (e.g. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/spk-ethno2\">http://bit.ly/spk-ethno2</a> this trumpet was found in Trujillo, Peru, but in the enrichments list, we find Trujillo in the Spanish province of Extremadura).</li>\r\n    <li>Some content providers noticed that there is a quality score of completeness provided by Europeana but not provided with documentation or criteria for this ranking.</li>\r\n    <li>Agents: Even though the Europeana API keeps track of which enrichments come from the source and distinguishes them from the enrichments, in the display on the Europeana.eu portal, some information provided by the original metadata is displayed as enrichment (e.g. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/spk-ethno1%20\">http://bit.ly/spk-ethno1</a> the original metadata record had information about the contributor). Cultural institutions take the display issue very seriously; actually the capacity of ECK to preview the records in Europeana before providing metadata has been evaluated as most useful.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>For Europeana, this metadata re-ingestion study is important feedback for its enrichment work. It confirms some of the finding on an earlier EuropeanaTech <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech/-/wiki/Main/Task+force+multilingual+semantic+enrichment\">Task Force on Multilingual and Semantic Enrichment Strategy</a>. The task force had analysed controlled vocabularies, collections, and metadata fields on the Europeana portal in order ´for the metadata enrichments to enfold their whole potential and act as facilitators of multilingual access´ (here is the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/468623/8b75b054-712e-432b-a0f7-761898e6f60e\">full report</a>). The Task Force had already resulted in better documenting the enrichment process at Europeana, and assessing some of its successes and shortcomings. The Europeana Inside study further demonstrates interest from data providers for the enrichment, giving more motivation to Europeana for measuring the quality of the current enrichment rules and enhancing them. It also hints that many data providers are willing to spend resources trying to make enrichments better. In the past, some enrichment issues have been fixed after individual requests – and the Europeana team was happy to do so. This could be further generalised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data aggregators will very likely have a great role to play here. As they are the experts of their domain, they could even develop their own enrichment processes, alleviating the need for Europeana to do so at a more general level. They are also in the best position to help distilling the application scenarios on the provider side. This would in turn trigger more motivation – and hopefully more resources – to enhance the quality of metadata at the level of Europeana’s entire network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Ines2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 318px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Metadata of a record provided to Europeana by the Pet?fi Literary Museum in their CMS (Qulto)</em> <em><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Ines3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 321px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The same object after returning the enrichments from Europeana on concepts by GEMET and geographical information by Geonames</em></p>"

        body: "<p><strong>We are once again looking for designers, artists, developers, start-ups and other entrepreneurs to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage from Europeana in innovative and creative ways! </strong>Europeana Creative is pleased to announce its <strong>final challenge</strong> encouraging <strong>YOU </strong>to design and submit products, applications and designs that reuse Europeana content in the theme of <strong>Design</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Design Challenge</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the Europeana Creative - Design Challenge is to engage designers, artists, developers and entrepreneurs to explore and experiment with with cultural heritage content available in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (1).jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 394px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Process of co-creation for a Design Pilot at the Workshop in Helsinki</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We challenge ingenious minds and makers to rethink and redesign our common culture, and produce innovative and novel interpretations that make use of digital cultural content and data sourced from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> or <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>. The <strong>Europeana API</strong> allows you to access 2000+ collections and incorporate them into apps, games, products and websites. You can even create mash-ups when connecting Europeana's API with other sources or APIs. The possibilities are endless!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge opens on the 30th October and online submissions are welcome until the deadline: <strong>15th January, 2015 at 20h00 CET </strong>via <a href=\"http://ecreativedesign2015.istart.org/\">http://ecreativedesign2015.istart.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should you create?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome a wide range of works for the Challenge, and appreciate contemporary and creative approaches to the digital cultural heritage materials. For example, including but not limited to results of digital fabrication, media art, design objects, web/mobile applications and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please keep in mind that the submitted works must re-use materials that are sourced through Europeana. Please also check the license of the content, making sure that re-use for your project context is allowed. To make things easier, discover <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/can-i-use-it/\">here</a> reusable content available in both the Europeana portal and API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give you some more concrete idea of works that could be made using the Europeana content, below are some examples. These are meant as examples only, so let your inspiration run free and propose new innovative ideas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· Make a fabric print using pictures from a museum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· Create an installation using audiovisual media from archives</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· Program a piece that generates algorithmic music from old sound recordings</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· 3D print contemporary designs based on old objects</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· Design an app that remixes old paintings</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where to find content and inspiration?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to help inspire you Europeana Creative has developed a pilot application to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content and a little bit of imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture Cam has been developed by partners <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/underside.php?indhold_id=435&amp;i_recent=1\">Spild af Tid</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ait.ac.at/research-services/research-services-safety-security/next-generation-content-management-systems/prototypes-and-demos/image-similarity-search/?L=1\">AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology</a> as the design theme pilot; a “live” digital similarity tool that takes you on a playful journey into the fascinating collections within Europeana by using your web camera. You can easily scan an object, and Culture Cam captures and analyzes it and comes up with search results of similar color, shape or pattern. This pilot is still in its demo phase so please watch this space for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To discover further pilots that have been developed over the course of the project (in natural history and history education, social networks and tourism) click <a href=\"/structure/pilots\">here</a>. Ideas and examples of creative re-use are also available on the Europeana Creative <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/web/europeana-creative/news\">blog</a>.

        intro: null
        body: "<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e237772a-eab7-4871-a325-dcf82ec047f4.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 391px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of our partners who represent Europe’s libraries, archives and museums make use of Facebook. It is a great way to show people something about your institution or collections, reach out to potential visitors (and stay in touch with them after they’ve visited), communicate events or other news, or even organise contests or other engaging activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not everyone is aware of the many features that Facebook has to offer and how these can be used to make most of your institution’s online presence. Based on our experiences with sharing heritage content on social media, in particular Facebook. Europeana's distribution and engagement team will be sharing their top tips for Facebook for memory institutions in 5 blog posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Links, texts, images &amp; attribution 2. Deciding what to share &amp; selecting your best 3. Targeting &amp; Timing 4. Promoting events &amp; gathering audience feedback 5. Measuring your reach and impact</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blogs are not about ‘getting more followers’, or how to create a Facebook page in the first place: we assume that you have an active Facebook presence, and already do have some experience with using Facebook. So if you’re interested to get more out of your Facebook presence, then this blog series is for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course we are open to your questions. Apart from the topics mentioned above, we’d like to know if there are other aspects of Facebook you’re interested in. I am happy to answer any questions you might have - please contact me via wiebe.dejager@europeana.eu or on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wdejager\">@wdejager</a>.</p>"

        title: 'How Europeana Cloud will address aggregators’ challenges and issues'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Only once the data is in EDM format, can it be forwarded for inclusion in Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Europeana’s network of aggregators come from many different backgrounds. Some take a thematic approach (like <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/home.html\">Europeana Fashion</a>), while others work from a national standpoint (such as <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/?lang=en\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>) or with certain sectors (like <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a>). </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their diverse range of roles and focus points, there is one task that is common to all Europeana aggregators: the harvesting of metadata from individual libraries, museums or archives (in many different formats) and the mapping of that data to the Europeana Data Model. Only once the data is in EDM format, can it be forwarded for inclusion in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud hopes to make this challenge easier, and for that reason the project has recently spent a few weeks conducting interviews with the aggregators that contribute data to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interviews explored the technical and strategic challenges the aggregators faced in performing this role. A longer presentation on the results of the interviews can be <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/078d111e-91f6-4a59-b134-af4c82262023\">downloaded</a>, and a summary is available below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/40908244\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our key findings were that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Metadata mapping is a slow process, with too many steps, services and internal discussions;</li>\r\n    <li>Tools for ingestion and mapping are not as reliable as they could be and there are some worries about the availability of data;</li>\r\n    <li>Ingestion and mapping tools have poor usability and sometimes cannot be used without technical expertise;</li>\r\n    <li>Aggregators need the ability to curate (ingest, map, enrich) their data at greater speed;</li>\r\n    <li>Aggregators need better mechanisms for managing identifiers and authority files;</li>\r\n    <li>Many see possibilities for enrichment but do not have the tools for it;</li>\r\n    <li>The hosting of content (as opposed to data) is not an urgent problem for any aggregator but is becoming strategically important;</li>\r\n    <li>Problems with the restriction of metadata to CC0 are universal, however few rated it as an urgent problem</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Europeana Cloud is now working to develop a set of products that respond to these aggregator needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, the project will be working to see how improved services for the ingestion and mapping of data can be adapted to be made part of Europeana Cloud. Rather than each aggregator relying on separate tools, a more sustainable service could be established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A set of product requirements will be published at the end of the year. This will form the basis for ongoing conversations with aggregators throughout 2015. Our aim is to make Europeana Cloud a service that aggregators can start using when the project ends in 2016.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>You have been hearing about the new Europeana Governance structure. And now it is time to participate in governing Europeana as a Network member. Nominations are open now. What does this mean for you? We asked the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Network about these changes and how they affect the Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nick Poole, Chair of the Europeana Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eaa356c5-8e7a-4610-bbbc-9a4283c66b0a.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. Why the change in the Governance structure and how will it impact the Network members?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> The Europeana Network is only as good as its members. And for each of the members to have a voice - a say in the way we realise our common goals - we need a more democratic way of functioning. I truly believe that the new Governance structure will make this possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we released our <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Strategy 2020</a> a few months ago, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/2226604/maximized?p_p_auth=lOFW1iby\">we said that it isn’t about telling people what to do</a>, it’s about giving expression and shape to our shared goals and then enabling us to make decisions at an individual and collective level that help us to achieve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the Network, come forward with support for your representatives or stand for election to the council. Collectively, you decide who will represent you on the Members’ Council. The more people you have representing you, the more influence you will have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/next-steps\">Support the Network</a> in making a more democratic, accountable and effective Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Johan Oomen, Vice Chair of the Europeana Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/JohanGovernance.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q. So how do I as a Network member participate in these changes? And what exactly will my elected representative do?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> As truly democratic body, the new Europeana Members’ Council will be decided by all of us. We, the members of the Network, each have a role in the new Governance structure. Once the nominees are announced, if there are more nominees than positions, you will be called upon to vote for the candidate who will best represent your interests Or do you believe that you can represent the interests of a large cross section of the Network? http://pro.europeana.eu/submit-a-nomination Come forward now as a candidate for the Members’ Council! I hereby announce my candidacy. Anybody in the Network can do the same by 28 October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elected councillors will be actively engaged in mobilising the Network, regularly communicating developments to the members that they represent, and voicing the opinions of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Network member has one vote. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/the-elections-process\">Let’s make it count</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana Creative and its partners will be present at the Mozilla Festival 2014 in London</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Creative project will animate one session entitled: Redesign your cultural heritage! The aim of the session is to connect the digital cultural heritage offered by <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> to communities of designers and artists who wish to use open cultural content - data, pictures, sound, videos - as inspiration and sources for new derivative works, such as animations and films, media art installations, textile patterns, and other design artefacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(3).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 200px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image by http://2014.mozillafestival.org/</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this hands-on session the facilitators, <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/underside.php?indhold_id=435&amp;i_recent=1\">Spild af Tid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/en/\">Aalto University</a>, will guide you through making of open cultural works on specific themes and introduce participants to digital and open cultural heritage online. The aim is to facilitate creative re-use in multiple levels and accommodate various skills of participants - both more experienced and beginner open cultural hackers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an outcome each participant or group will create an open cultural work, which will be documented online and presented at the end of the festival. Each participant will be asked to share their designs back to the open design and art community in reusable forms and licensed under Creative Commons license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that the works created in the session will be further developed and submitted to our <strong>next Europeana Creative Challenge Design which will soon open its call for candidates. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will you be there? Join us at @eCreativeEU and #mozfest</strong></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Guest post by Sejul Malde, <a href=\"http://www.WeAreCulture24.org.uk/\">Culture24</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/b9e535e1-4293-4d40-9004-c3875b271f46.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 605px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?q=%22Walter+Naumann%22&amp;qf%5Bindex%5D%5B%5D=a\">Walter Naumann</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana, with Culture24 from the UK and Plurio.net from Luxembourg, are organising a series of three free workshops for collection holders across Europe that explore how digital collections can be used to better reach and engage tourist audiences. They’re being hosted by the Wallonia-Brussels Foundation, in Brussels and take place this November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops have the following themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>17 Nov 2014 – Art Nouveau collections</li>\r\n    <li>19 Nov 2014 – Battle of Waterloo-related collections</li>\r\n    <li>20 Nov 2014 – First World War collections</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>These workshops will explore how each of these themed digitised collections can be utilised to reach out to tourism audiences. Tourist audiences represent a key audience segment for museums in Europe and are increasingly looking for new ways to engage with cultural content, especially online. Content from digital collections represent a vital, yet under-used asset for museums to respond to these changing tourist audience needs. Each of these themes have been identified as key opportunities to explore tourism demand for digitised collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops are free and are ideally for directors, curators and other relevant (collection-related) managerial staff of European museums that have collections relating to the prescribed themes. If you represent an alternative collection holder/hold a different position but are interested in attending, you are welcome too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please also note that although we have asked attendees to cover any costs incurred relating to their attendance at the workshop, we can in certain circumstances cover these expenses for collection holders if they prove to be a barrier for attending the workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about each workshop, including details of how to book your spot, please click on the links below (we have also included the Eventbrite links for each workshop where you can book directly).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/7379461/invitation-collectionstourismworkshop-artnouveau-17nov-pdf-371k?da=y\">Art Nouveau themed workshop</a> - <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reaching-and-engaging-tourist-audiences-with-digital-collections-art-nouveau-17th-november-2014-tickets-13326083675\">Eventbrite page</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/7379460/invitation-collectionstourismworkshop-waterloo-19nov-pdf-406k?da=y\">Battle of Waterloo themed workshop</a> - <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reaching-and-engaging-tourist-audiences-with-digital-collections-battle-of-waterloo-19th-november-tickets-13432965361\">Eventbrite page</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.keepandshare.com/doc/7379459/invitation-collectionstourismworkshop-worldwarone-20nov-pdf-358k?da=y\">First World War themed workshop</a> - <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/reaching-and-engaging-tourist-audiences-with-digital-collections-world-war-one-20th-november-2014-tickets-13432913205\">Eventbrite page</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions please contact Sejul Malde at Culture24 on Sejul@culture24.org.uk</p>"

Who are you wearing?’. This is a common phrase yelled at celebrities during red carpet events, be it the Academy Awards, Grammys, etc. But, no one is asking these people what open source tools they’re using. Rightly so, they probably aren’t using any, or perhaps they unknowingly are. For example, Spotify was built using a <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/third-party-licenses/\">dozen open source tools</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to ask the experts who develop, use, expand, and improve these tools to talk about who they’re using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We at EuropeanaTECH think it is time to give developers in the digital cultural heritage sector the spotlight; to share their favorite open sources tools to use, open source applications that they have developed and look forward to, and to talk about what they would like to see developed in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our new series for <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/\">Europeana Labs</a>, a different developer will be asked these 4 questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. What open source tools are you currently working with? 2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications? 3. What are you currently developing? 4. What would you like to see developed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re looking for more open source tools, be sure to check out our #FLOSS Directory</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to be featured, please e-mail: gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</p>"

        body: "<p>A couple of weeks ago, before the <a href=\"/blogpost/and-the-2nd-challenge-winners-are-timepatch-and-buitenplaats-mob\">2nd eCreative Challenges event</a> in Barcelona, we had the chance to gather the different partners at <a href=\"http://fabraicoats.bcn.cat/en/\">Fabra i Coats</a>, a big space where <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a> has its city headquarters. We held an intense workshop in order to brainstorm and be inspired about sustainable business models for <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (6).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-facilitated between Platoniq and <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/\">Kennisland</a>, the sessions began with strategic presentations from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> about the current development of the project, followed by recommendations and insights from partners like <a href=\"https://medialab.aalto.fi/\">Aalto Media Lab</a>. Later, stakeholders’ perspective on labs were discussed, including web development company <a href=\"http://www.pimpampum.net/en\">Pimpampum.net</a>, consultancy for financing the creative industries <a href=\"http://www.peacefulfish.com/\">peacefulfish</a> and a new social incubator in Barcelona, <a href=\"http://barcelona.impacthub.net/\">Impact Hub</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (7).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the workshop was dedicated to breaking-out into thematic groups. Each focussed on how to improve Europeana Labs’ value proposition to communities and developers, lab environments and incubators or investors. In the groups, participants discussed and identified several areas of improvement and exploration using the <a href=\"http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/bmc\">business model canvas</a> approach, followed by a final sharing of results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (8).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reporting back for each group and deciding on key recommendations for Europeana Labs´ future development, results are now being processed. Some will soon be incorporated in order to take further steps in the development of Europeana Labs as a better service and tool for creatives. In this way, it will contribute to the way they can invigorate economy and common resources with innovative ideas and new businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (9).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pictures by Platoniq, under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license. </em></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Sarah McSeveny-Åril, senior advisor digital cultural heritage at the Arts Council Norway, writes about the EAwareness Norwegian chapter</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/1a481bc8-f565-4417-a422-3c18b76edbe8.jpg\" style=\"width: 273px; height: 380px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Linda Van der Spa Her's story </em><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022611/H_DF_DF_6077.html?start=1&amp;query=At+de+skulle+arresteres&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">At de skulle arresteres visste jeg ikke!</a>, Arts Council Norway, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>´Ready to record in.. 3-2-1´, I signalled a silent countdown with my hand and nodded encouragingly to 85-year-old Inga Karlsen who was sitting in front of me. She took a breath, looked down at the manuscript she had written and started to speak. To my confusion, I couldn’t understand a word of what she was saying. As the microphone I held picked up the melodic ups and downs of her voice, I quickly looked down at the neatly typed Norwegian text in front of her searching for a clue as to what was going on. It then struck me - Inga had decided that it was time to tell her story , and to tell it in her mother tongue, Sami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this summer, the Arts Council Norway organised a national awareness-raising campaign based on World War Two as part of its work in the EAwareness project. The aim of the campaign was to reveal the untold stories of this time, with particular focus on the more sparsely documented role of the Sami people in the war effort and the events surrounding the burnings and evacuations of Northern Troms and Finmark. The Norwegian public were encouraged to search their attics and cellars, to speak to surviving relatives about their memories of the war, and then share these untold stories through the creation of digital stories. This was their history, and they were going to tell it their way; and this was exactly what Inga Karlsen did when she shared <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022611/H_DF_DF_6074.html?start=14&amp;query=Inga+Karlsen+&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">her story</a> about her little brother and the Russian prisoners in Sami.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital storytelling workshops and an Open Archive Day were organised throughout the country as part of the campaign activities. Cultural sector employees, teachers and individuals met in two locations in northern Norway on the 3rd and 5th of June to create digital stories using material available via Europeana, from Norway and brought from home. ‘In connection with the Europeana Awareness campaign, “War history’s black hole”, I came across a report with information about my great-grandparents and maternal grandfather. It turns out that they were to be arrested, and fled to Sweden during the Second World War! This is completely new information for me and my family, and has now become a story that can help fill a hole in our war history,’ tells workshop participant Linda Van der Spa Her whose story can be found <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022611/H_DF_DF_6077.html?start=1&amp;query=At+de+skulle+arresteres&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">here</a> (in Norwegian).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open Archives Day was a coordniated effort between 12 archives* on 3 June, where they opened their doors to the general public, offering to help them register and digitise their material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was over 25 digital stories - a number which is still increasing - ranging from forgotten anecdotes about life during the war to personal stories from this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are familiar with the requisition of vessels and vehicles for use in a war or crisis situation. However, in 1944 there was also a law regarding the requisition of the dogs to be used by the German army in the war effort. Listen to the story <a href=\"http://digitaltfortalt.no/things/forordning-4mars-1944/H-DF/DF.6030\">Soldier’s best friend</a> to find out how was it for those who experienced foreign troops coming for their family pet (in Norwegian).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Norway2farfar%20tyk%20soldat.jpg\" style=\"width: 223px; height: 380px;\"><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022611/H_DF_DF_6075.html?start=1&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A20226*difo&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=Min+farfar%2C+en+tysk+soldat&amp;rows=24\">Min farfar, en tysk soldat</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inger Kristin’s father had kept the photo carefully hidden in his wallet, never showing it to anyone. Who was the handsome young man in uniform in the picture? Was it just the uniform that turned out to be the problem? <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022611/H_DF_DF_6075.html?start=1&amp;query=europeana_collectionName%3A20226*difo&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=Min+farfar%2C+en+tysk+soldat&amp;rows=24%20\">My grandfather, the German soldier</a> is a granddaughter’s story about her grandfather who was a German soldier stationed in Narvik, but who sadly disappeared shortly after the war ended. (in Norwegian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did the Norwegian pilot Otto Andreassen from the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=330+skvadronen&amp;rows=24\">330 Squadron</a>, based in Scotland throughout the war, get a message home to his family to say he was alive and coming home?

Following the campaign, awareness of Europeana in Norway increased by 75%, with coverage of the campaign in both local and national media. These stories are now able to play a unique part in enriching Europe’s shared collective memory. Ensuring that current and future generations have the opportunity to explore a richer version of this period of Norwegian history through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*List of archives involved: Opplandsarkivet Maihaugen, Statsarkivet i Trondheim / IKA Trøndelag / NTNU Universitetsbiblioteket / Trondheim byarkiv, IKA Møre og Romsdal, Arkiv i Nordland, IKA Kongsberg, Statsarkivet Hamar, Statsarkivet Bergen, Samisk arkiv Kautokeino, Statsarkivet i Kristiansand.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>On the Europeana Pro blog, we want to highlight the good work being done by the Europeana Network. This time, María Luisa Martínez-Conde (Project manager at the Spanish Ministry) from the Hispana project tells us more about the history of the project, what they do and their plans for the future.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/d4e869cc-1192-46b3-92c5-d08ceaff1f0f.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 697px;\"><br><em>Image: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022701/oai_bivaldioai_gva_es_7122.html?start=46&amp;query=Sanlucar+de+Barrameda&amp;startPage=25&amp;rows=24\">Vinos y Finos : Sanlucar de Barrameda, [1920-1925]</a> Biblioteca Valenciana Digital (Public domain)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><a href=\"http://hispana.mcu.es/\">Hispana</a> is the common access point to Spanish cultural and scientific digital heritage coming from repositories all over Spain. It also gathers information about current and planned digitisation projects. It began work in September 2005 and was launched as a search service in March 2006. In November 2008, when Europeana was launched, Hispana became the Spanish national cross-domain aggregator for Europeana. It now helps Spanish libraries, archives, museums and other memory institutions to make their collections available via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 1 September, 2014, the directory of digitisation projects includes 604 projects. Of these, 207 have implemented an <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/\">OAI-PMH repository</a> that is harvested by Hispana. As a result, Hispana currently allows access to 5,070,428 digital objects. It has experienced a rapid growth in the past six years - when it was launched in March 2006, it gave access to less than 120,000 digital objects coming from 25 repositories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was born as an initiative of the unit for library coordination of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport. Because of this, the libraries are so far much better represented than museums and archives. In fact, Hispana harvested exclusively from library repositories until March 2010. At the moment <a href=\"http://cer.es/\">CER.es</a>, the aggregator for Spanish museums, is harvested by Hispana as well. To date, 39 museums are contributing to Hispana and to Europeana. There are also archives contributing to Hispana, among them the General Archive of Simancas and some regional and local archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the large number of libraries contributing to Hispana, 81.8% of the digital objects are texts,17.9% are images. Sound and video files only take up 0.3% and are therefore very much under-represented. This composition of the database was one of the reasons for the implementation of the Europeana API in the Hispana portal to enrich the collection with material from other cultural institutions. Hispana harvests everything that has a link to a digital object: any object, any audience, any subject, any format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of September 2014, Hispana channels to Europeana more than 2,240,000 records, a figure that represents 85% of the Spanish contribution. It’s the second largest Europeana data provider after <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the challenges for Hispana is to allow users to retrieve records on a topic without language limitations and to find records similar to those retrieved. To improve this feature, Hispana is carrying out a process of semantic enrichment of its records. It links them to the <a href=\"http://id.sgcb.mcu.es/\">Spanish Subject Headings List</a> that has been converted to SKOS and linked to subject headings in English (LCSH), French (Rameau), German (GND) and other Spanish official languages, Catalan and Galician up to now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some data providers are also enriching their records by linking them to Dbepdia and VIAF. This is in keeping with the policy of the Ministry that promotes the implementation of OAI-PMH repositories according to the Europeana Data Model and the above mentioned semantic enrichment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past eight years, Hispana has reached a high level of standardisation of digitisation projects with special attention to metadata schemas and quality policy. It has also facilitated the easy channelling of the Spanish contribution to Europeana.</p>"

It has two important parts: a digital online platform and location-based ‘mini-games’. The used location-based technology is BEACON. The inspiration comes from the region Kennemerland, where there are a lot of buitenplaats - a summer residence for rich townspeople in the Netherlands. During the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century the region Kennemerland became very popular among people from Amsterdam and so the buitenplaatsen in this area have shared history, but also have their own unique stories to tell. By playing the game families can explore, experience and discover these beautiful heritage sites and their intriguing life stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/108333622\">Pitch by project Mobile location buiten plaats game at Apps&amp;Cultura Demo Party for Europeana Creative</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of Jennemie Stoelhorst, Leader of the project, \"these sites are unlocked in a contemporary and interactive way using modern technology\". Lost heritage (both tangible and intangible) is visualized again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Creative congratulates the winners and is looking forward to the future collaboration!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don't worry if you missed this chance!

        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/\">Sound and Vision</a>, one of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/partners\">Europeana Creative partners</a>, is always looking for new and innovative ways to make audiovisual heritage open and searchable. The institute holds a collection of over 800.000 hours of material, of which a portion is also available for creative re-use. The <a href=\"http://openbeelden.nl/.en\">Open Images</a> project provides access to over 4.500 videos and <a href=\"http://www.geluidvannederland.nl/\">Sound of the Netherlands</a> allows re-use of over 2.600 Dutch soundscapes. As part of the Europeana Creative project, Sound and Vision commissioned Australian artist Andy Thomas to create an inspirational digital sound sculpture re-using two bird sounds from its archive. The result is a visually mesmerizing artwork that has been very well received. If you would like to know more about how this video was made and how it went viral, please continue reading!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://openbeelden.nl/media/739047/Nachtegaal__Kanarie.en\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BIRD-1-MAIN-FINAL-(0-00-41-00) (1).jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Still of the Nightingale &amp; Canary animation - Andy Thomas (CC-BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How was the video produced?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound &amp; Vision asked Andy to briefly explain how he created this beautiful artwork. “I start by listening to the sound carefully, going for a walk, and concentrating on the sound, then I do some sketches, and search the internet for inspiration, nature related inspiration, such as flowers and insects, whatever I feel suits the sound vision that I see in my imagination.Then I experiment with forms in my 3D software to try to emulate these visions. I take the waveform of the sound run it into 3ds Max and activate simple geometry with the audio float controller then use the geometry as either an emitter or a surface constraint. Then I use a variety of different particle effects: FumeFX, KRAKATOA, RealFlow, Phoenix FD, and I especially like the XSI ICE system. Finally I render with Vray.” Check out <a href=\"http://www.andythomas.com.au/?p=586\">Andy’s website</a> for some more visuals of his inspiration and the software he used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Viral video alert</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The video was put online mid-August and shared via different channels, such as Facebook, Twitter and email. The most successful channels were Vimeo and YouTube. The video was chosen as a <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/103364847\">Vimeo Staff pick</a> a few days after the upload, which resulted in a whopping 285.000 video views to date. The artist had interviews with Wired Magazine and reviews on several major blog sites such as Vice and <a href=\"http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/08/audio-life-forms-andy-thomas/\">Colossal</a>. He also received offers from several large studios about producing concept art and video content for projection mapping projects. The video will shortly be featured on the French National TV channel Canal+ in ''<a href=\"http://www.canalplus.fr/c-infos-documentaires/pid4583-c-ms-l-oeil-de-links.html\">l'Oeil de Links</a>\", which is a weekly program that highlights every aspect of the internet used as a creative and social tool.The video was also uploaded on Europeana’s YouTube channel and added by YouTube to their Google+ page a week later, resulting in nearly 30.000 views to date. With 2,917 likes on Vimeo and 457 likes on YouTube, we can say that the video was very successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/103364847\">Nightingale and Canary</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user5362504\">Andy Thomas</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiring Creative Industries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial aim of the Nightingale &amp; Canary video was to inspire creative industries to submit their own ideas to a Europe wide <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/challenges\">competition</a>, organised by the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/\">Europeana Creative</a> project. This objective was achieved as there was a noticeable amount of submission for the Challenge coming Dutch creative industries. The video also stimulated collaborations outside the EU. Andy was invited to the planetarium in Melbourne with the possibility of doing a show next year. He is also teaming up with a fellow digital designer to create an installation for the <a href=\"http://whitenightmelbourne.com.au/\">White Night</a> event in Melbourne in February next year, which is a projection festival that spans the entire city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Creative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bird sounds video is part of the Social Networks pilot, called <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots#socialnetworks\">“Sound Connections”</a>, which is led by Sound and Vision. It allows communities to enrich a variety of soundscapes (birds, aviation and city sounds) on an interactive map. See for instance the bird songs <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/en/explore/birdlife\">pilot page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Adapted post, originally published at <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201409/creating-inspirational-video-archival-bird-songs\">Sound &amp; Vision's blog</a>.</em></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>On 30 August, the <a href=\"http://1989.enrs.eu/\">Freedom Express</a> started its journey through Eastern and Central Europe, wrapping up last week in Berlin after travelling through Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Germany. <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-boards-the-freedom-express\">Neil Bates of Europeana boarded the Freedom Express</a> study trip as a participant and an ambassador for Europeana. Born in 1986, Neil was only 3 years old when the defining events of 1989 took shape; in this blog post he briefly shares his experiences and reflections on the historic journey that traced those events, 25 years on.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(10).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 430px;\"><em>Map of the journey together with a group picture of the Freedom Express particpants standing in front of a section of the Berlin Wall at the East Side Gallery. Photograph by Krzysztof Dobrogowski / ENRS</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In July, I was excited to learn that I was one of the lucky ones to be asked to join this trip along with 1<a href=\"http://1989.enrs.eu/#study-trip-participants\">9 other young Europeans</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.enrs.eu/\">European Network of Remembrance and Solidarity</a> organised the study trip with the aim of tracing the historical events of 1989, a year that transformed Europe. Twenty-five years on from those generation-defining events that triggered the collapse of Communism in Europe, the organisers want to start discussions about that watershed. During the two weeks, I was honoured to meet with the key protagonists and witnesses of the events of 1989 from the perspective of the different revolutions across the region. Some of those people who I had the opportunity to sit down with included a number of Gdansk shipyard workers, members of the Polish Trade Union, organisers of the Pan-European Picnic and a number of prominent political scientists and historians. Thanks to the <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/\">89 Voices</a> project that I have been working on for <a href=\"http://europeana1989.eu/\">Europeana 1989</a>, during the trip I was eager to delve into the past through the untold stories from people who lived through this period. Through Europeana 1989, I have developed a strong interest in firsthand memory preservation through audio recordings and photography. That is why I created 89 Voices, an oral history project that in conjunction with Europeana 1989 aims to record and preserve 89 fascinating firsthand accounts from individuals who experienced the fall of communism and the reunification of Europe. While on the trip, I was able to preserve new stories for the 89 Vocies project, which will be posted in the coming weeks. One that stands out most for me is a memory that I recorded while in Romania. In the story, <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/post/96963141915/brindusa-armanca\">Brindusa Armanca</a> describes the memory of how her family got caught up in the Romanian revolution in Timisoara. However, at the end of the recording she shares her most emotional memory, when she bore witness to the death of a woman on the streets during the protests. She recalls; ‘When I worked as a journalist, I researched who she was, and now I know. I went to the cemetery and put a flower on her grave. Even if only one person had died in the revolution, somebody has to be punished for that death.’ Aside from being able to discuss the events of 1989 with the people that were not only there, but helped shape those important events, we also had the opportunity to meet current thought leaders and politicians to discuss the impact of those events on the world today, such as Ma?gorzata Omilanowska, Deputy Minister of Culture and National Heritage of Poland, and members of the Hungarian Parliament. We, as participants, were encouraged to think about solidarity and discuss how we think the movement has shaped the world today, and how as young Europeans, we can ensure the legacy and spirit of solidarity continues for future generations. Through these discussions and sometimes debates, we have all shared our thoughts, opinions, experiences and general reflections on a specially created <a href=\"http://1989.enrs.eu/blog/\">collaborative blog</a>, which I encourage you to explore. <img alt=\"Neil\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(11).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><em>Where the iron curtain once stood: Neil stands on the Hungarian-Austrian border near the town of Sopron, the location of the Pan-European. Europeana (CC-BY-SA)</em> For a full run down of what happened on the trip, you can read the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/category/europeana1989/\">blog posts that I have written for the Europeana blog</a>. These posts pick out highlights from the trip and showcase what happened in each of the countries that we visited. We were filmed by a documentary crew who followed us for the entire journey and recorded our reflections on freedom and solidarity. The Freedom Express documentary is due to be premiered in Warsaw in February 2015. In the meantime, <a href=\"http://www.arte.tv/guide/de/051396-008/yourope\">ARTE TV will be screening a short programme on 27 September</a>. This short documentary follows the journey through two of the participants, who share their experiences during the trip. I was one of those selected for the ARTE TV documentary; so I invite you to tune in on 27 September to hear me share some of my thoughts about the experience.</p>"

The project started in February 2013 and brings together 19 partners from 10 European countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apps4Europe has introduced the ´Business Lounge´ format, a special programme that connects developers with investors and incubators and guides the app creators in bringing their projects successfully to the market. With ten local business lounges added to hackathons across Europe and an online competition annually, the project aims to find the best open data applications and startups that Europe has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/d71cc1a7-47e9-4b93-8dbb-0d4fe221a8a5.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>First business lounge in Amsterdam, 29 June 2013. By Simon Webbon, rights reserved.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year’s finalists for the international business lounge showed solutions in retail, culture, hyperlocal media, mobility and sustainable energy. Culture was well represented by four apps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.appsforeurope.eu/article/muse-open-source\">Muse Open Source by Glimworm</a>, an IT company based in the Netherlands. Muse is a free software platform for publishing native iPad apps for digital libraries with cultural heritage content.

One of the institutions that made their public domain collection available through Europeana is Biblioteca de Catalunya. Their own collection consists of more than 13,000 items. To learn more about Biblioteca de Catalunya's stunning public domain collection, we spoke to Eugènia Serra Aranda, the director of the library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening up the collections of Biblioteca de Catalunya has been part of their strategic goal. However, there is more than strategy; there is also drive and passion to give people access to information and knowledge as much as possible. `We do not have a specific open access policy, but our strategic documents include several references to the commitment of the library to promote open access. We understand that open access is the way to facilitate a wider access to knowledge and to promote the development of societies.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biblioteca de Catalunya opened up the entire collection of incunabula (a book, pamphlet, or printing that was printed —not handwritten—before the year 1501 in Europe), all the papers of the Catalan poet Joan Maragall, and part of the collection of parchments, letters, printed music, maps, photographs, etc. We asked Eugènia to highlight a significant piece from their public domain collection, but with so many items, she said it was difficult to pick only one:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'There’s the Cançoner Gil; it is a spectacular songbook from the 14th century of Occitan origin. It doesn't contain the musical notation - just the poems to be read by troubadours. It is a handwritten document, made of parchment with precious initial letters and decorated margins. The story of how it came to this library is interesting. At the beginning of the 20th century, this book belonged to a professor who put it on sale. It had a very high price and there was more than one library interested. In order to assure that the document would remain in Catalonia, ten wealthy patrons decided to gather the amount necessary to acquire it, and then they donated it to the Biblioteca de Catalunya. Ever since, it continues to be one of our most appreciated treasures.´</p>\r\n\r\n<p>´I would also like to remark on the collection of books of patients of the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=hospital+de+la+Santa+Creu&amp;rows=24&amp;start=97&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Biblioteca+de+Catalunya%22&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen\">Hospital de la Santa Creu</a> in Barcelona. The Biblioteca conserves the collection of books of admissions from the 15th-18th centuries, in which sick people were registered when they entered the hospital. It is a collection of extraordinary value for demography, onomastics, and to understand the way of life and customs of this period. The description of many patients includes a name, surname, age, gender, origin, clothes, belongings, sometimes the disease and if they died or left the hospital healthy.´</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore Biblioteca de Catalunya’s diverse public domain collection <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;start=25&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Biblioteca+de+Catalunya%22&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Fpublicdomain%2Fmark%2F1.0%2F*\">through Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article was written as part of Europeana’s previous #PublicDomainMonth - a month dedicated to sharing knowledge, best practices and events all related to the Public Domain.

        title: 'Europeana enriches its data with the Art and Architecture Thesaurus'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Getty Research Institute announced last March the <a href=\"http://vocab.getty.edu/%20\">release of their Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)</a> as Linked Open Data. This release opened many opportunities for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AAT is a rich, structured and multilingual vocabulary including terms, descriptions, and other information for generic concepts related to art, architecture, other types of cultural heritage and conservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AAT has always been an important resource for Europeana’s data providers, especially museums. However, until now Europeana was not in the position to exploit it: firstly because the vocabulary was not openly available, secondly because Europeana didn’t have the technical means to exploit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implementation of the Europeana Data Model (EDM) was the first step towards the re-use of widespread vocabularies such as AAT. EDM embraces the principles of the Semantic Web and therefore can be seamlessly integrated with a network of vocabularies at a semantic level. EDM gives support for contextual resources — the so-called ‘semantic layer’, including concepts from ‘value vocabularies’ like thesauri, authority lists, classifications, either coming from the network of Europeana’s providers or from third-party data sources. Since EDM is geared towards re-using existing semantic resources, the publication of AAT as Linked Open Data was an opportunity to seize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It offers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>an unambiguous reference to a controlled, trustable subject representation</li>\r\n    <li>machine-readable access to multilingual labels</li>\r\n    <li>machine-readable access to semantic relationships</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Europeana developed internally a small enrichment tool in order to ‘dereference’ the AAT URIs, i.e., fetch all the multilingual and semantic data attached to AAT concepts from the centralised open Getty linked data service. It is really easy, as the AAT linked data are represented with SKOS, which is also the model EDM re-uses for describing concept data (cf. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation%20\">EDM documentation for more details</a>). In the meantime, several Europeana partners were contacted and asked to re-submit their data in EDM, replacing their old AAT labels (provided as a simple text string) by the new AAT URIs in the EDM fields. These URIs are identifiers giving access to the data representing the AAT concepts over the web. The AAT URIs have a base <a href=\"http://vocab.getty.edu/%20\">vocab.getty.edu/</a> to which is added the identifier of the concept. The AAT URIs were dereferenced when the objects that referred to them were ingested in Europeana, bringing in the additional AAT data such as label translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following collections were re-published in the Europeana portal:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Rijksmuseum. For instance: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/AK_MAK_1498.html\">http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/AK_MAK_1498.html</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>Member Institutions of the Partage Plus project: Bildarchiv Foto Marburg, Muzej za umjetnost i obrt, Zagreb, Kunstbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin and Digitales Kunst- und Kulturarchiv Düsseldorf. For instance: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2026116/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Bildarchiv_Foto_Marburg_obj_20046013_fmd481373.html\">http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2026116/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Bildarchiv_Foto_Marburg_obj_20046013_fmd481373.html</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>Museo Galileo. For instance: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/02301/urn_imss_image_018825.html\">http://europeana.eu/portal/record/02301/urn_imss_image_018825.html</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>Erfgoedplus.be. For instance: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2023004/24062A23_priref_229.html\">http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2023004/24062A23_priref_229.html</a> (see more objects from these data providers below)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>In Europeana, enrichments are visible in the portal display, as shown in the http://europeana.eu/portal/record/02301/urn_imss_instrument_402089.html object below. The AAT URIs can be seen in certain metadata fields such as Format and Type. All multilingual labels fetched from the AAT linked data service are displayed in the foldout ‘Auto-generated tags’ area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/19b0752e-6d41-4861-be0f-343b8335e497.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slide2.jpg\" style=\"width: 544px; height: 362px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The enrichment of Europeana data with AAT data offers strong potential for the developments of multilingual services (cf. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech/-/wiki/Main/Task+force+multilingual+semantic+enrichment\">Final report of the EuropeanaTech Task Force on Multilingual and Semantic Enrichment Strategy</a>). It complements nicely the data of other open and multilingual vocabularies that Europeana encourages providers to send links to, such as <a href=\"http://www.dnb.de/EN/Standardisierung/GND/gnd_node.html\">GND</a>, <a href=\"http://www.iconclass.org/\">Iconclass</a>, <a href=\"http://viaf.org/\">VIAF</a> or any domain vocabulary following the EDM recommendations for metadata on contextual resources (See these <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=(edm_agent%3A*viaf*+OR+skos_concept%3A*mimo*+OR+skos_concept%3A*partage*+OR+*d-nb*+OR+*iconclass*)\">examples</a> of objects enriched with the MIMO or the Partage Plus vocabularies or GND or Iconclass or VIAF). In particular, Europeana is able to translate the terms according to the language of the interface selected by a user based on the translation provided by vocabularies. For the previous example, above, if the language of the interface is switch to Dutch, the term ‘astronomy’ is translated to ‘astronomie’ based on the labels of <a href=\"http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300054534\">http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300054534</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slide3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the benefits of using AAT also extend to cases where object descriptions have been described with an ad hoc, local vocabulary, if this vocabulary has been mapped to AAT by its creator or a third party. Europeana would then exploit semantic relations and translations across a network of vocabularies, pooling all the contextual data together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana also performs automatic metadata enrichment with other external value vocabularies and datasets by creating links to objects in Europeana as described in the previous Europeana Blog http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/trackback/a-multilingual-and-semantic-enrichment-strategy A Multilingual and Semantic Enrichment Strategy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The increased dependency of Europeana services, such as query translation, on semantic and multilingual enrichment illustrates the need for rich vocabularies that are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>technically available (through Linked Data or in dedicated repositories), properly documented, and in open access.</li>\r\n    <li>well-connected together, e.g., equivalent elements in other vocabularies are indicated</li>\r\n    <li>multilingual.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Europeana was involved as an external reviewer of the AAT release, and will continue its efforts in demonstrating the potential of Linked Open vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thank Antoine Isaac, Yorgos Mamakis, Georgios Markakis, David Haskiya, Péter Kiraly, Andrew MacLean and Dean Birkett for their work and the Europeana data providers for their data contributions.</p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana's marketing specialist Neil Bates is participating in the Freedom Express as a Europeana representative. But what is the Freedom Express and why is it relevant to Europeana? Neil answers a few questions...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/476ca6f9-bd8d-4337-856d-b5f83b8bc6c7\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Neil Bates, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the Freedom Express and why was it conceived?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Freedom Express takes twenty young Europeans on a journey, during which they trace the events that transformed Europe. Twenty-five years after the spectacular events that triggered the collapse of communism in Europe, the organisers of the campaign are once again raising questions about that watershed. They are showing young people what the world was like on both sides of the Iron Curtain, and they are asking a new generation of Europeans what, in their opinion, has survived of the spirit of community and solidarity of 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The itinerary includes street-art projects, city games, meetings with opposition activists, joint filmmaking and a collaborative blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who is behind this project?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make the project happen, European Network Remembrance and Solidarity has brought together ministries of culture and major institutions dealing with twentieth-century history in Poland, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and the Czech Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main organiser: European Network Remembrance and Solidarity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-organisers: National Centre for Culture (Warsaw), Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship (Berlin), Research Institute and Archives for the History of Regime Change (Budapest)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is Europeana involved in the event? And why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will be on the Freedom Express to help promote the Express’s aims and journey through social media and other communications. It also means I get the opportunity to introduce the other participants to Europeana 1989. A workshop with the participants was organised while they were in Gdansk. The1-hour workshop introduced the group to the Europeana 1989 project and highlighted some of the fascinating stories that have been preserved as a result of the project throughout Central and Eastern Europe. We will also be holding a collection day for Europeana 1989 while the group is in Berlin. The Freedom Express participants are all invited to take part in the collection day and to meet members of the general public that bring along their stories. They’ll also have the opportunity to get involved in the process of digitisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did you get involved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I applied like everybody else. I have a strong interest in the events of 1989, even more since I began working for Europeana and got involved with the Europeana 1989 project. I used 89 Voices as a basis for my application - an oral history project that aims to record and preserve 89 fascinating firsthand accounts from individuals who experienced the fall of communism and the reunification of Europe. It worked, and I was selected as one of the final 20 from over 100 applicants from across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/1bccc254-19a6-4b01-b795-a481c124e21e\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The tour begins, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a><a href=\"http://facebook.com/europeana1989\"> 1989</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will you represent Europeana on the trip? What will you be doing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will be using the trip as an opportunity to deepen my knowledge of the events of 1989 and speak to the pivotal protagonists of that time, directly. Personal stories, memories and experiences can help others to understand what it was really like to live in the period and they provide a different perspective. And by capturing them for Europeana 1989 and 89 Voices, we can share the experiences of this important period in our history widely online today and for future generations. So I will also continue with my work on the 89 voices project, as well as update media and contribute to Freedom Express and Europeana blogs. Every opportunity on the trip is used to interview and photograph participants, organisers, guest speakers and general members of the public. And I will also be on the other end of the microphone, taking part in interviews based on my reflections for a number of documentaries that will be produced surrounding the Freedom Express.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What sort of updates can people look forward to from you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can expect new 89 Voices to be uploaded regularly, as and when stories are preserved. You will also find regular updates via Europeana 1989’s social media channels, in particular on Facebook and Twitter. In addition, along with the other 19 participants, I will be contributing to a collaborative blog on the Freedom Express.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"http://facebook.com/europeana1989\">http://facebook.com/europeana1989</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/europeana1989\">http://twitter.com/europeana1989</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana blog: <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/\">http://blog.europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedom Express blog:<a href=\"http://%20http//1989.enrs.eu/blog/\"> http://1989.enrs.eu/blog/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        title: 'Local history in Europeana'
        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Jef Malliet, <a href=\"http://www.erfgoedplus.be/\">Erfgoedplus.be</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Awareness produced ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/c02abf91-401a-4baf-ab90-759b54b65db8\">Guidelines for Europeana users interested in pursuing local or family history themes’</a>. We believe that this document contains valuable elements for further work, reflection and discussion beyond the context of the EAwareness project and that it is worth sharing with the wider Europeana community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Awareness (2012-2014) wants to encourage participation in Europeana among new users and contributors. New or improved technical solutions are developed. Additional new partnerships with relevant community networks are investigated and initiated. One such potential target group consists of local collections and archives. Their holdings are often considered not very relevant for history research at a broad level; only for local history and genealogy research. When the material and the research stay local, there is not much purpose in providing online access to an international community. However, when events or people disappear from the local records because they moved to other places, then remote accessibility becomes extremely important. Local history and genealogy produce information very similar to UGC (user generated content), which is worth sharing for the same reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requirements of promotion, lobbying and visibility have till now attracted the attention in Europeana prevalently to a ‘masterpiece’ focus. ‘The New Renaissance’, the 2011 report of the Comité des Sages, recommended that ‘ Member States should ensure ‘that by 2016 they have brought all their public domain masterpieces into Europeana’ (p. 26). However, there is a growing group of people who believe that the concept of Europeana is better suited and more valuable for providing access to local heritage objects and content, which otherwise are very hard to find and access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This point of view is the basis of projects such as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeanalocal%20\">EuropeanaLocal</a> (2008-2011) and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/locloud\">LoCloud</a> (2013-2016). In particular, local heritage is more powerful than ‘masterpieces’ as it involves more people with heritage and history. It helps people to better understand the objects and issues they meet in daily life. Thus, local heritage is very suitable for education and for broadening the interest in culture and heritage in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guidelines document builds on other work that was done in EAwareness. Besides a general overview of the meaning and importance of local and family history, it provides information about how they can interact with digitised resources and in particular with Europeana. Europeana could help with finding ‘local’ information outside the specific location of a research. Or, through UGC, it can provide a channel for collecting and providing access to otherwise unavailable knowledge (e.g. the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-1914-1918\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-1989\">Europeana 1989</a> projects – fig. 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Fig1ugc.png\" style=\"width: 412px; height: 226px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fig.1 </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guidelines are not limited to readers of Europeana, but make suggestions that are relevant for data providers and for Europeana itself. National archives across Europe have digitisation projects of person-related registers and have set up special pages for helping genealogical researchers (e.g. Norway - fig. 2). International associations provide specialised websites for sharing genealogical information (e.g. Geneanet - fig. 3). By looking into the various phases of a local history or genealogical research, the guidelines describe why Europeana should not try to compete with such dedicated websites, but that it can offer access to useful complementary information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Fig2norway.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 419px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fig.2</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Fig3geneanet.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 255px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fig. 3</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘guidelines’ do not set final rules, the topic concerns an open domain, where still much needs to be learned and developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

The overall objective of this project is to increase the competitiveness of European tourism by creating an innovative transnational tourism product that capitalises the shared value of European UNESCO cultural heritage sites and complements national, regional and local policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of main the outcomes of the project was to create a thematic transnational tourism product focused on World Heritage sites, addressed at the youth. At present, people can take inspiration from the thematic itineraries we have created by accessing the project website (<a href=\"http://euheritage-tour.eu/EuHeritageTour/Create_a_Tour.html\">the itineraries</a> are described in details), get information about local accommodation and transportation, leisure and so on. The final beneficiaries (the youth) can find the same information on the <a href=\"http://www.euheritage-tour.eu/TOURGUIDE/EUHeritageTOUR-TourGuide-Basic-EN.pdf\">digital Tour Guide</a> we developed (it can be downloaded from the website) and through the mobile app (android).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from September 2014, we will work to turn the inspirational thematic itineraries into bookable tourism products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other outcome of the project is an eLearning course for World Heritage capacity building, open to everyone, but in particular to the stakeholders in charge of managing and promoting the World Heritage sites. It can be <a href=\"http://euheritage-tour.eu/EuHeritageTour/The_1st_eLearning_Course_-_Basic.html\">accessed directly through the project website</a>. We also produced a release exclusively for mobile devices (iOS platform, <a href=\"http://www.euheritage-tour.eu/Elearning_resources/elearning_kit_iOS.ibooks.zip\">ibook</a>). The average duration is 4 weeks, but it depends on attendance. The course will be open free of charge till September 2014; to access it, you are requested to register on the eLearning environment we developed on the project website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p><em>By the <a href=\"http://euheritage-tour.eu/EuHeritageTour/Home.html\">EUHeritageTOUR</a> project team </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/d729b504-b2b9-4720-be27-f3d410422032.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 425px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe's cultural heritage is unique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its abundance and diversity are testimonies of a rich past, as well as the foundation of a common future. European cultural heritage is widely recognised as a vehicle for cultural identity and EUheritage TOUR wants to put this on a pedestal. Europeana is one of the project partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, <a href=\"http://www.euheritage-tour.eu/EuHeritageTour/Home.html%20\">EUHeritageTOUR</a> is focused on Europe's World Heritage sites, recognised by Unesco for their outstanding universal value. Since the World Heritage convention was signed in 1972, over 900 sites have been awarded this status and the majority of them are located in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of EUHeritageTOUR is the tourism potential of these World Heritage sites. On the one hand, we elaborate an attractive tourism product, on the other hand we are focusing on capacity building of stakeholders in both the cultural heritage and tourism sector. The project is specifically aimed at both young professionals and young tourists, but is obviously open to everyone interested in participating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/92244072\">EUheritageTOUR teaser</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/euheritagetour\">EUHeritageTOUR</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main outputs of the project:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>EUHeritageTOUR cultural route: The concept behind the EUHeritageTOUR cultural route is that ‘differences’ and ‘commonalities´ of national/ regional/ local peculiarities, represented by the UNESCO World Heritage sites throughout Europe can effectively contribute to the rise of local /inter-regional social cohesion, a stronger local and collective pride and a greater sense of European identity.</li>\r\n    <li>An e-learning course: The EUHeritageTOUR project has developed an e-learning course open to everyone - but in particular to the stakeholders in charge of managing and promoting the World Heritage sites. The contents of the e-learning course were developed on an analysis of the most interesting and innovative good practices in the field of management and promotion of the heritage sites and properties in Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This is part one of a two-part article on the EUHeritageTour project. </em></p>"

It was two days filled with fruitful discussions, hard work and celebration of what has been achieved thus far. The aim of this meeting was not only to focus on the final tasks and activities within the last six months of the project, but also to mobilise the remaining energy reserves and to motivate each other for the last stage of this adventurous journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Events/brighton_asm2015_01.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" id=\"aui_3_2_0_1735\"><em>Highly motivated: Platoniq’s Enric Senabre has the right attitude</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the Workpackage updates on the current state of affairs and future activities, lively discussions about the Content Re-Use Framework and about judging the potential winner(s) of the final <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/design-challenge-open-for-applications?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">Design Challenge</a> took place. It was a pleasure to see the great performance of <a href=\"http://www.europeanalabs.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>, which had been established shortly after the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/europeana-creative-s-general-meeting-and-progress?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1%26_33_keywords%3Dvienna%2B%26_33_page%3D1%26_33_page%3D1%26_33_struts_action%3D%252Fblogs%252Fsearch%26_33_redirect%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fpro.europeana.eu%252Fweb%252Feuropeana-creative%252Fnews%253Fp_p_id%253D33%2526p_p_lifecycle%253D0%2526p_p_state%253Dnormal%2526p_p_mode%253Dview%2526p_p_col_id%253Dcolumn-2%2526p_p_col_count%253D1%26_33_itemsPerPage%3D20%26_33_itemsPerPage%3D20\">first All Staff Meeting</a> one year ago. The site already has 2,218 registered API keys, 18 blog posts and more than 111,000 pageviews in total! The soon to be published Content Re-Use Framework looked promising and all partners are eager to work with this tool in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Design Pilot was presented for the first time to a wider consortium audience. The interactive web application encouraged the Europeana Creative staff to pull out their mobile phones and try out the “<strong>Culture Cam</strong>”, a digital “live” similarity tool that uses a web camera to recognize a colour, a shape or a pattern and then match this with cultural heritage objects in Europeana. When you scan an object in front of your computer’s webcam, Culture Cam captures and analyses the given object and comes up with search results of similar colour, shape or pattern directly from the Europeana archive. <a href=\"http://culturecam.eu/\">Click here</a> to try it yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course the Europeana Creative consortium is required to prove how creative they are and used VanGoYourself to re-enact Johann Velten's Prison Scene. The next and last reunion of all partners will be at the final All Staff Meeting and the subsequent Final Conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Events/brighton_asm2015_02.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 922px;\" /></p>"

        title: 'Business Model Workshop for Design Applications Re-Using Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On the past 23rd May, the last Business Model Workshop was organised in Helsinki, at the <a href=\"https://medialab.aalto.fi/\">Media Lab of the Aalto University</a>. In the same fashion as the other editions, the aim was to trigger a discussion on how to develop a business model that underpins and encapsulates the successful reuse of digital cultural heritage content like in this case via <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> -this time as far as Design-specific applications are concerned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The business models were related to the concepts identified in the co-creation workshop, which preceded the organisation of the business model one. The projects which presented the best potential were further explored, and translated into viable products or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model\">business model</a> refers to how value is created, delivered and captured within an organisation point of view. Value takes several forms such as cultural, economic, social, environmental, etc. (thus not being limited to a common perspective that refers only to for profit businesses). It can be developed not only within organisations but also specific projects, products or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This specific workshop resorted to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\">business model canvas methodology</a> to provide a framework and a guideline on how the “Design” pilot can be explored in a sustainable way, while at the same time provide “inspiration” for the challengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An expert on business modelling was invited to guide and support discussions. Jukka Ojasalo (adjuct professor at AALTO University) introduced the Service Logic Business Model Template, an own developed version of the original Business Model Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur. The Service Logic Template emphasises a deeper understanding of implicit and explicit customer needs. According to the author, the focus of this canvas is strongly on the perspective of the customer, and not on the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The business canvas that was used for this workshop takes into account 9 elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Customer’s World and Desire for Ideal Value</li>\r\n    <li>Value Proposition</li>\r\n    <li>Co-creating value with the customer</li>\r\n    <li>Interaction and co-production</li>\r\n    <li>Key Resources</li>\r\n    <li>Key Partners</li>\r\n    <li>Mobile Resources and Partners</li>\r\n    <li>Cost structure</li>\r\n    <li>Revenue Streams and Metrics</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/business_model_workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 543px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Ojasalo, Katri and Jukka Ojasalo (forthcoming 2014), “Adapting Business Model Thinking to Service Logic: An Empirical Study on Developing a Service Design Tool,” in The Nordic School – Alternative Perspectives on Marketing and Service Management,</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 prototypes were developed after the co-creation workshop using the Service Logic Business Model Template:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Pattern Gems: through this prototype service, professional-amateurs in design can find high quality reusable images which can inspire them to create and share new patterns for clothing, furniture, interior design etc. that are printable on a broad range of different design products (e.g. chair, wallpaper, T-shirts, jackets);</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>eFab: this prototype offers an environment for designers, DIYers and students to make Europeana content digitally \"makeable\" by use of 3D-printers and laser cutter. The final product - the digitally fabricated object - can be used for for example decoration, to build theater stages or to sell in museum shops.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Collage: this prototype is a customisable online tool and mobile application targeted at a general public and design professionals that allows new masterpieces to be created from the reuse of works of art, in a fun and pedagogical way. Europeana content can be accessed, transformed and placed for public viewing and rating. Own creations can also be uploaded and used to mix heritage and new content.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>As an example of the very interesting thought process in the workshop, a business model called “Pattern Gems: Create your own patterns from vintage images” was developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pattern Gems’ business model can be translated as a service targeted at professional-amateurs (Pro-ams) in design/creators/makers; students, amateurs that like to create patterns and have the ambition to go from amateur to professional level. Designers are offered a very smart search tool (enabling search on similarity, color, forms etc.) through which they can search through inspirational Europeana content (example collections, e.g. high quality cut-outs of butterflies from different paintings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revenue is generated by sharing sales of design patterns with registered designers. It also liaises with external related services that are already on the market, like platforms where fabrics can be ordered and professional tools and services that you can use to mask and cut images (e.g. Adobe InDesign).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/business_model_workshop2.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>View of the filled-in Service Logic Business Model Template</em></p>"

        body: "<p>On the <strong>16th of July from 17h - 20h CET </strong>the team from Europeana will be organising a h<strong>ands on workshop demonstrating how to use the Europeana API and include it into your applications.</strong> This workshop &amp; webinar is being brought to you through a <strong>collaboration with Apps&amp;Cultura Barcelona</strong> and their annual <a href=\"http://appscultura.hackathome.com/en\">Hack at Home competition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an idea for a great application but are a little overwhelmed by what <strong>Europeana content</strong> you could use, how to access it or maybe the usage restrictions then this is the workshop for you! After all, Europeana is a platform providing access to more than 30 million digitised cultural heritage objects from Europe’s libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections so we understand it can be difficult narrowing it down!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Agenda:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Welcome &amp; Introduction (17.00 - 17.20)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Showcasing Europeana content (17.20 - 17.30)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Barcelona specific datasets (17.30 – 18.00)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Europeana Api (18.00 – 18.20)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Questions &amp; Answers (18.20 - 18.45)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Networking (18.45-20.00)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_and_webinar.jpg\" style=\"width: 1141px; height: 660px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Example of Shoe related content available on Europeana </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the workshop, why not explore the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> platform so you can familiarise yourself with what is currently available and come prepared with questions relating to the Europeana API &amp; specific data sets you’re looking for. We have also developed a series of <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots\">pilot applications</a> to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content via the API and a little bit of imagination. Meanwhile don’t hesitate to contact us on api@europeana.eu if you have any questions or need additional support to access the data you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_and_webinar1.jpg\" style=\"width: 466px; height: 108px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions relating to the second round of <a href=\"http://ecreativechallenges2014.istart.org/\">Challenges on Tourism &amp; Social Networks </a>this will also be a great opportunity for you to ask and receive feedback/support!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event will also be web streamed and recorded so if you can’t make it on the day to Barcelona you’ll be able to watch online or catch up after the event. Please find the webstreaming video below where to can <a href=\"http://%20bit.ly/WeJKho\">click and watch live</a> from 17h on the 16th of July &amp; contact us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eCreativeEU\">Twitter</a> to ask questions to the experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We look forward to meeting you on the 16th of July in Barcelona or online for the webinar!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dissenyhubbarcelona.cat/main/index.html\">Dissney HUB Barcelona</a>.

        title: 'Hacking cultural tourism with “selfie” reenactments of digital heritage: an interview with the project leaders behind VanGoYourself'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a> is the first Europeana Creative pilot launched, which went live in May 2014 as part of Culture24's <a href=\"http://www.culture24.org.uk/places-to-go/museums-at-night\">Museums at Night festival</a> of late night openings in the UK. The website encourages people to recreate a painting with their friends and share the photograph in their social media channels. The paintings come (via <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>) from a mix of cultural institutions like the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\">Rijksmuseum</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp\">Van Gogh Museum</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en\">Royal Museum of Fine Arts</a> in Brussels or the <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/\">National Gallery of Denmark</a> and represent the richness of Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site allows you to choose the level of difficulty ('easy’ or ‘challenging for a master), as well as selecting paintings with ‘selfie' potential or ones ‘for lovers’. The service is free and simple to use, and links up to existing widely used social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/hacking_culture4.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 378px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Homepage of VanGoYourself</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a great launch with substantial coverage on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2r61wKgwMSdGdQST1hyHLLb/putting-you-in-the-picture-with-a-restaged-masterpiece\">BBC's new Arts</a> website and five live public participation events in Museums, we pause to interview the two Europeana Creative partners behind VanGoYourself: Jane Finnis from <a href=\"http://www.weareculture24.org.uk/\">Culture24</a> and Frank Thinnes from <a href=\"http://www.plurio.net/\">Plurio.net</a>…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural selfie? Artistic avatar? How would you define and describe the potential of VanGoYourself? Where does the idea come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jane</strong>: VanGoYourself is a really simple idea that is all about allowing people to have some fun with art. The idea comes from some research that shows that if audiences are not looking for 'functional ' information then they want an emotional connection. VanGoYourself is set up to give them the space to make their own connection to a painting in their own way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Many users do not just simply recreate the painting, but they produce a reinterpretation of the painting and its message. Some of them are just funny, but a surprising number of the recreations are really deep and meaningful. This illustrates the creative potential of VanGoYourself as people do not simply consume the artwork, but it triggers the users' own creativity. The BBC coined the term 'cultural selfie' for the project but I feel this is just too reductive. I prefer to say that people have 'VanGo'd themselves', meaning that people entered in a dialogue with a great piece of art and came up with their own answer to it. For a short moment they behaved a bit like an artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/hacking_culture3.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 1038px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Frank</strong>: Being a big fan of strong women in art history, <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/judith-beheading-holofernes-caravaggio-merisi-1571-1610-vangod-by-agenceculturelle/\">I used \"Judith beheading Holofernes\" </a>to illustrate in a very subtle way how the crisis has finally reached Luxembourg...

Which are the most successful paintings reenacted so far?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jane</strong>: Initially, we received a flurry of 'selfie-style' pictures because of the media coverage by the BBC and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/10834099/Tired-of-looking-at-paintings-Now-you-can-get-inside-them.html\">The Telegraph</a> which used the term 'cultural selfie'. As a result, users initially kept copying the selfie style images because these were what they saw shared in their own social media channels. This meant that for the first few weeks we had a lot of selfies twinned with the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/van-gogh-1887-self-portrait/\">Van Gogh self portrait</a>, as all the shared images linked back to the same painting and people just copied their friends and did their own version of the same image. We responded by re-ordering the paintings and after a while we broke the pattern and the quantity of the images started to go up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We now receive mostly pictures where the users recreate artworks in more creative ways. We have a large number of recreations of the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/the-last-supper/\">Last Supper</a>, because it is clear that people naturally think of this painting whenever they have a dinner or gathering with a larger number of friends or family. This is especially true when it is a goodbye dinner or the last reunion of a circle of colleagues, for example the Last Supper recreation of a <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/the-last-supper-leonardo-da-vinci-1452-1519-vangod-by-mr-laceys-a2-biology-class-iivi-form-newport-iow/\">biology class before their final exams</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portraits depicting only one or two people are also very popular, too because it is something that can be easily done between friends, like for example \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/portrait-of-a-woman-with-smokey-eyes/\">The Woman with Smokey Eyes</a>\" from the Villa Vauban in Luxembourg, \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/two-women-from-naples/\">Two Women from Naples</a>\" from the Simeonstift in Trier (Germany), \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/madonna-and-child/\">Madonna and Child</a>\" from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam or the very popular \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/paintings/idyll/\">Idyll</a>\" from the Royal Pavilions in Brighton which shows a kissing couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which uses you’re seeing have more potential for the cultural tourism sector? How do you think the project can evolve? Is there new content already or to appear for re-use in the near future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jane</strong>: The project was a proof of concept to demonstrate how people can connect emotionally online with art. Looking at the submissions it is clear that we have successfully done this. The challenge now is to see if the project can also work on a local level, with a selection of only local images and be used as a local promotional engagement tool. This could be something like Mons, Belgium who are capital of culture in 2015, or maybe even a subset of images from a single collection, like The Van Gogh Museum. We are exploring this idea and are already talking to The Arts Council for Norway about how to create a specific version for Norwegian art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frank</strong>: We are adding more paintings from different venues each month, for example new images from the Byzantine Museum in Athens went live in June and were used in a live recreation at a Europeana event last month. We are continuously evolving our selection of art works, aiming for a bigger variety of artworks and for a better experience for the users. We are also working on partnerships with the collections in order to promote VanGoYourself via specific events, for example with the Van Gogh Museum or the Simeonstift in Trier. We are also working together with local tourist offices which support the promotion activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which ones are your favourite “VanGo's”? Which ones have you find more interesting or shocking?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frank</strong>: I really got blown away by the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/amsterdam-orphan-girls-nicolaas-van-der-waay-1855-1936-vangod-by-martin-mohr/\">recreation of the Amsterdam Orphan girls</a> by the user Martin Mohr: he recreated every single girl on its own and then put all the single images together. I also like the recreation of Mantegna's \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/christ-as-the-suffering-redeemer-andrea-mantegna-1431-1506-vangod-by-dahupp/\">Christ as The Suffering Redeemer</a>\" by three blokes having a beer after sunbathing. For some this might be shocking, because it is a rather funny recreation of a religious scene. For me, it is freedom of expression. I also like very much the recreation of a \"<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/prison-scene-johann-velten-1807-1883-vangod-by-wochenspiegel-trier/\">Prison Scene</a>\" by the editorial team of a local newspaper, because the original painting shows one of my forefathers who fought for democracy. At first glance the recreation looks like a break in an ordinary meeting. But when you compare the recreation with the original you are surprised about the details of the recreation. The stove on the flipchart is just genius!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/hacking_culture1.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 901px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>License of this image: <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a> - License of original image: Amsterdam Museum - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jane</strong>: I am very attached to the first recreation we ever did of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/tired-of-just-looking-at-paintings?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%2F-%2Fblogs%3F_33_advancedSearch%3Dfalse%26_33_keywords%3D%26_33_delta%3D5%26_33_cur%3D5%26_33_andOperator%3Dtrue\">Last Supper with the Europeana Creative co-creation team</a>. Plus the one I did with my son Jem blowing bubbles in his West Ham football kit!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also love the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/the-story-of-susannah-defterevon-sifnios-vangod-by-europeana-for-research-tourism/\">one from the Byzantine Museum</a> because it was so fun to directing everybody and because people were at first a bit reluctant, but then became really enthusiast about it. Finally, I have to mention the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.tumblr.com/\">VanGoYourself Tumblr</a> which is a feed of ALL the images that are submitted, the good and the bad. There is something about this mix that makes the good ones stand out even more. It is also *very* funny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/hacking_culture.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 1020px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>License of this image: <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a> - License of original image: Byzantine and Christian Museum - <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC-BY</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you expect to find in terms of other “cultural hacks” for the tourism sector with the forthcoming eCreative challenges? Since the event will take place in Barcelona in September, what content from cultural institutions in that region you think can be interesting for apps like this one?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Jane</strong>: What's most important to us about the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/web/europeana-creative/challenges\">tourism challenge</a> is to see how other people take on the challenge to connect people emotionally with cultural heritage online. What else can they come up with that has space for the audience to connect and engage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Frank</strong>: It would be great if local museums or collections would open up their digitized collections, in good quality, with a more open license for reuse. The best practice example of this is of course the Rijksmuseum who have put everything online in high resolution, under a public domain license, so that everyone can use it without restriction. The results are amazing - and we could have easily made an entire \"RijksYourself\" website with the material from that museum! We know that many content stakeholders are still afraid of opening up their collections in this way, but we hope that positive examples like VanGoYourself can demonstrate clearly the need for cultural collection holders to make their content earlier to reuse online - we call this making your content 'fit for purpose'.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>What if you could easily help to geolocate and enrich sounds from birds, airplanes and city sounds and then share them via social networks? If this sounds interesting to you, keep reading about what we are building and how you can do something similar in order to enter our second round of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/challenges\">Europeana Creative Challenges</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prototype under development</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are building, as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots\">another Europeana Creative Pilot</a>, a prototype that uses <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/\">Historypin</a>’s mapping and timeline tools to allow sounds clips from birds, planes and city soundscapes to be surfaced on a map where they can be explored by location and filtered by time. The user interface facilitates discovery and exploration whilst enabling the enrichment and sharing of Europe’s audio heritage by individuals and online communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/challenging-social-networks4.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 374px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><a href=\"http://wearewhatwedo.org/\">We Are What We Do</a>, creators of Historypin, have mapped its database to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> so sound records can be ingested from the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a> (BL) and <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> (NISV) via the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana API</a> into the platform. NISV and the BL have mapped their sound collection datasets to EDM, so that they can be ingested into Europeana and enriched where necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characteristics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The user interface is being built with mobile in mind and optimised for tablet and desktop computers, so users will be able to use the Pilot on a variety of devices. Users will be invited to explore the sounds via the map and encouraged to enrich them through calls to action in the introductory copy and the comment box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/challenginsocialnetworks02.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 323px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAs we want to facilitate participation and enrichment as well as exploration, we will be incorporating further annotation functionality in future phases of the Pilot. Users will be provided with the ability and add links to other content, adding contextual and experiential value to individual sound files, from sources such as Europeana, Wikipedia and others. We are also planning to allow user­ generated images and sounds to be uploaded!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital content (re)used</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision is using sounds gathered during the <a href=\"http://www.geluidvannederland.nl/\">Geluid van Nederland</a> (Sound of The Netherlands) project. These sounds come from both the institution’s archive as well as user generated content (UGC). The content is all available and currently <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/#groups/het-geluid-van-nederland\">hosted on SoundCloud</a>. Almost all the sounds (2,505 items) are available for re­use either under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> BY, BY-­SA, or BY­-NC­-ND license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/challenging-social-networks2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 364px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audio recordings supplied by the British Library come from a number of different sources. Around 1,000 recordings come from the <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/sound-maps/uk-soundmap\">UK Soundmap project</a>, which are <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/britishlibrary\">uploaded to Audioboo</a>, and were crowd­sourced during the project. The remainder comes from various environmental and wildlife recording collections, including the <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/environment/british-wildlife-recordings\">British Wildlife Recordings</a> (640 recordings) and the <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/AR-Gregory-Kenyan-bird-recordings\">A.R. Gregory recordings</a> (around 700 recordings of birdsong from Kenya). Where possible, the content is being made available under the Creative Commons BY licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Future work</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future We Are What We Do will integrate with the Audioboo player. This will enable user commenting, the ability to add links and to do more sophisticated and interesting things with the links e.g. categorise them or show thumbnail images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far sample sounds (around 50 for each theme, from both BL and NISV) from each of these collections have been added, and in time we plan to add more to each sub­theme. We may also add more sub­themes with different sound collections. As we start to share the prototype with communities we will see how people use it and respond accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if you take the challenge?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The starting point for this pilot was a <a href=\"/blogpost/europeana-creative-workshop-in-palma-on-soundscapes-and-social-n\">co-­creation workshop</a> in Palma de Mallorca, facilitated by <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a> in November 2013. We chose the approach described above for this pilot from a number of different possible scenarios, each combining audio files with other visual elements like pictures and videos from Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you’re a developer or cultural hacker and are also interested in creating new applications and services reusing audio content in order to be shared via social networks, take a look at other potential “what if” scenarios we discussed during our co-creation workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/challenging-social-networks.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 269px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like any of our ideas below or they have inspired a new idea of your own we are waiting for you elaborate it further and send us your application for our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/tourism-%26-social-networks-challenges-are-now-open-for-applications\">next Challenges</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>”<strong>What if</strong> as a biology teacher I could post to my students' homework folder a collection of recordings and photos of local species for my class to hear and incorporate in their chosen species report”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> a fan of ancient music I could share online original sounds of old instruments as well as their history, images, extra recordings, etc”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> as an art lover or museum visitor, I could walk around an exhibition with paintings and listen to the sounds that these paintings might produce (e.g nature, street, conversations), and share my comments &amp; impressions online”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>\"<strong>What if</strong> as a music lover I could find similar music and explore connections based on its metadata (period, place of performance, tradition, etc) as well as analyze the audio, in order to detect style changes, origins, other similar periods and influences\".</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> as a tourist I could upload and download historical audio records or choose them from an interactive platform to build up my own historical touristic experience in a defined location”.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> as an artist I could transform sounds from a sound archive into images”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>\"<strong>What if</strong> as a teacher I could assign my students to create an audio mix using sounds of people, places, times, etc and share/present them to tell a story, perhaps with their own narration\"</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> as a cultural activist I could record on my mobile and mix on my laptop the sound on a building site near my house with a propaganda speech and make a techno mix to share with my Facebook friends ”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>“<strong>What if</strong> as a sound designer / sonic artist I could paint sounds (different colours for different themes) on a canvas and/or transform all sounds in a sound archive into images”</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps you already have a great idea and have favourite <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=TYPE%3ASOUND&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen\">sounds or audiovisual materials from Europeana</a> which could be re-used in a creative app?

        title: 'Tourism & Social Networks Challenges are now open for Applications'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>If you missed the opportunity to participate in our first round of challenges then don’t worry, we’re pleased to announce that Europeana Creative is once again looking for creative developers, designers, start-ups and other entrepreneurs to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage from Europeana in innovative and creative ways! Our second Challenge is to create applications that reuse Europeana content in the themes of <strong>Tourism</strong> or <strong>Social Networks</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best ideas in the themes of Tourism and Social Networks will receive a tailor made <strong>Incubation Support Package</strong> as a prize, helping to bring your product idea successfully to the market! The prize consists of specialist support measures delivered by a team of experts providing business mentoring, technical support, assistance with identifying and accessing finance, facilitation of business partnerships, access to specialised testing environments, marketing and promotion support. Read more about <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d70db467-f1aa-464b-b352-293a53f15458&amp;groupId=1538974\">the Incubation Support Package</a> here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to help inspire you with the new round of challenges Europeana Creative has developed some innovative <strong>Pilot Applications</strong> to demonstrate the things you can do with Europeana content and a little bit of imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Tourism Pilot Application</strong> is called, <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a> and is the brainchild of <a href=\"http://www.culture24.org.uk/\">Culture24</a> in the UK and <a href=\"http://www.plurio.net/\">Plurio.net</a> in Luxembourg. Our Tourism Pilot is a genuinely different and surprisingly deep way for visitors to engage with heritage, based on emotion, playfulness and curiosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever wanted to recreate a version of Vermeer’s <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/collectie_SK_A_2344.html\">Milkmaid</a> in your own kitchen or get together with your friends on a Saturday night out and recreate the scene in Leonardo Da Vinci’s <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=the+last+supper&amp;rows=24\">The Last Supper</a>? VanGoYourself wants to get people to rediscover and engage with classic paintings from around the world in a new and exciting way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Last%20Supper%20760.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The birth of VanGoYourself! The Europeana Creative team having supper in Mons. License of this image- CC-BY-SA License of original image- Fondazione Federico Zeri - Universita? di Bologna - Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VanGoYourself encourages you to recreate classic scenes from some of world’s most famous paintings in a contemporary setting, which you can then share with your friends on social media. The site features works from Masters such as Van Gogh and Rembrandt - with over fifty paintings from more than ten collections in seven European countries all just waiting to be recreated!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/vangoyourself.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 309px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the VanGoYourself website, with some of the VanGo'd images so far</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service will be used by tourist offices, museums, cities, tour guides and others to promote specific destinations, sites and events. Why? Because above all, the tourism sector seeks to provide visitors with a great experience of a place in order to get them to return to a destination or to tell friends and family about it in a positive way. The Tourism Pilot could help to provide that experience. It can easily be integrated in existing marketing schemes and is very \"light-weight\" in terms of costs and management. This is something visitors and tourists can do together, as friends or as a family, and can then share with more people online. It's inherently sociable and playful – and everyone loves an interesting or amusing photo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Social Networks Pilot Application</strong>, Sound Connections, is currently in beta so watch this space for more inspiration. The objective of the Social Networks Pilot, developed by <a href=\"http://wearewhatwedo.org/\">We Are What We Do</a>, is to attract suppliers of websites with social elements to embed Europeana content in their services. This Pilot has harnessed the Europeana API to integrate sounds from the British Library and Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision, via SoundCloud and AudioBoo, onto Historypin.com, a map based collaborative history platform. <a href=\"http://www.ontotext.com/\">Ontotext</a> has supported this integration with services for geo-referencing of data based on entity extraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/tourist_and_social_network_challenge.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 279px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/tourist_and_social_network_challenge1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 283px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot will focus on bird and airplane field recordings, as well as city sounds from Amsterdam and London. The user interface for the pilot will allow users to explore, listen to and enrich these sounds. Communities of interest and their social networks, such as bird watchers and plane spotters, will be invited to interact with the audio content. They will be able to link to content from sources such as Europeana, Wikipedia, Flickr and even upload material from their own personal collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that you are now sufficiently inspired and understand the themes of our new challenges. Over the course of the next weeks we will also be publishing a series of blog posts sharing unused ideas that were generated during co-creation workshops for the Pilot Applications. These can act as further inspiration for you or maybe you’d like to take one of these ideas and develop it further into a finished application and submit it as your own entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an idea but are a little overwhelmed by what Europeana content you could use, how to access it, or maybe the usage restrictions then take a look at our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/europeana-labs?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%2F-%2Fblogs%3F_33_advancedSearch%3Dfalse%26_33_keywords%3D%26_33_delta%3D5%26_33_cur%3D2%26_33_andOperator%3Dtrue\">blog post</a> on Europeana Labs. <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> is a novel Open Innovation platform that sets out to provide its community of users with everything needed to start using the Europeana APIs and develop apps that re-use digitised cultural heritage objects. Here you can learn about the data, see what others have created, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects, which include books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more. Don’t hesitate to contact us on api@europeana.eu if you have any questions or need additional support to access the data you need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The deadline for applications is August 28th 2014 at 16h CET</strong>. The best applications will be invited to pitch their concept at our <strong>Open Innovation Challenges event in Barcelona on the 23rd of September 2014</strong>, hosted in collaboration with <a href=\"http://appscultura.hackathome.com/\">Apps&amp;Culture</a>, where the winners will be chosen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ecreativechallenges2014.istart.org/\">Apply here now</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Members of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/about-europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative project consortium</a>, creatives &amp; designers from <a href=\"http://mediafactory.aalto.fi/\">Aalto Media Factory</a> and local business model experts from <a href=\"http://www.forumvirium.fi/en\">Forum Virium Helsinki</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/en/\">Aalto University</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hanken.fi/public/en/\">Hanken University</a> all gathered on the 22-23 May in Helsinki for the<strong> co-creation workshop for Design.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The aim of the co-creation workshop</strong> is to come up with new and interesting ideas on how to re-use <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/\">Europeana content</a> . We then take the idea and develop it into a real life product, process, app or tool to illustrate how easy and fun it can be to reuse the huge amount of items stored in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We already have <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots\">4 pilot applications</a> developed on different themes, after their corresponding co-creation workshops, like Natural History Education, History Education, Social Networks and Tourism, and this co-creation workshop was all about Design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The first day</strong>, co-facilitated between <a href=\"http://mediafactory.aalto.fi/\">Aalto Media Factory</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/en/\">Platoniq</a>, was spent scenario building and prototyping with local creatives. Animators, graphic designers, film makers and product designers collaborated together to come up with new and interesting ideas on how to<strong> re-use Europeana</strong> content for design, also based on different content samples which were prepared with the help from the design point of view by <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/underside.php?indhold_id=435&amp;i_recent=1\">Spild af Tid</a> .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/cocreation_workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Scenario building at the Co-creation Workshop in Helsinki</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Many ideas were generated </strong>including a collaging tool to help people design and produce their own comic strips, a 3D printing process helping people to accurately recreate old artifacts, a knitting tool allowing knitters to develop knitting patterns inspired by images in the Europeana database, a paint by numbers and collage tool allowing anyone to re-create their own masterpiece at home, and finally a platform for designers facilitating easier access to historic and artistic content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Events/design_challenge_open.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 394px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Collaging Tool idea for a Design Pilot developed at the Co-creation Workshop in Helsinki</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/files/blogimages/cocreation_workshop1.jpg\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 700px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Process of co-creation for a Design Pilot at the Workshop in Helsinki</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>On the second day </strong>we selected our favorite three ideas and delved further into the process of developing viable business models for each of them. Each idea was assessed on its merits, value, revenue potential and sustainability. The process we used to assess and develop the ideas is called the <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> and it’s a fascinating process to develop and assess an idea you might have in a business context.

You will just have to watch this space to see which idea is developed based on all the above as the pilot application in the category of Design... We’re very excited to see what happens and hope you are too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to Aalto Media Factory for hosting the workshop and Platoniq for co-facilitating it. Many thanks as well to all those who came along to share their expertise and inspirational ideas to keep innovating in the re-use of Europeana content!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join the debate and stay tuned for upcoming news at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/eCreativeEU\">@eCreativeEU</a> or on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaCreative?ref=hl\">Facebook</a>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Pictures by Platoniq, under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> license. </em></p>"

        body: "<p>Discover art in a whole new way with VanGoYourself.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Ever wanted to recreate a version of Vermeer’s <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/collectie_SK_A_2344.html\">Milkmaid</a> in your own kitchen or get together with your friends on a Saturday night out and recreate the scene in Leonardo Da Vinci’s <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=the+last+supper&amp;rows=24\">The Last Supper</a> ? A brand new website, <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself.com</a>, designed <strong>via the Europeana Creative project</strong> to get people to rediscover and engage in classic paintings from around the world in a new and exciting way. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VanGoYourself has just been launched today May 15, 2014 with great exposure on the BBC Arts website. Check out the video to learn more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VanGoYourself </strong>encourages you to recreate classic scenes from some of world’s most famous paintings in a contemporary setting, which you can then share with your friends on social media. The site features works from Masters such as <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=who%3a(Gogh,%20Vincent%20van)&amp;rows=24\">Van Gogh</a> or <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=who%3ARembrandt&amp;rows=24\">Rembrandt</a> - with over fifty paintings from more than ten collections in seven European countries all just waiting to be recreated!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participating collections are the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Amsterdam Museum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels, the National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen, the Herbert Gallery in Conventry, the Royal Pavilion and Museum in Brighton, the Compton Verney Museum (UK), the Villa Vauban in Luxembourg, the Saarlandmuseum in Saarbrücken and the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift in Trier, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Last%20Supper%20760.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The birth of VanGoYourself! The Europeana Creative team having supper in Mons. License of this image- CC-BY-SA License of original image- Fondazione Federico Zeri - Universita? di Bologna - Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>So how does it work? </strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First channel your inner artist then pick a classic painting from the selection on the VanGoYourself website. Get together with your friends to recreate the famous scene, take a snap and upload it to VanGoYourself, which will twin your new master with the original artwork for you to share on social media, thus immortalising your artistic talent for all to see!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site allows you to choose the level of difficulty –do you want a painting that is \"easy\" or \"challenging\" to recreate? You can choose paintings with \"selfie\" potential or ones \"for lovers\". The site is free and simple to use, and links up to existing widely used social media channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/vangoyourself.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 309px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the VanGoYourself website, with some of the VanGo'd images so far</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Who is behind it?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>VanGoYourself is a <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana </a>Innovation created by a group of people who love museums, paintings and having fun. It is the brainchild of <a href=\"http://www.culture24.org.uk/\">Culture24 </a>in the UK and <a href=\"http://www.plurio.net/\">Plurio.net</a> in Luxembourg, both non-profit, independent art entrepreneurs with a sense of humour. They have a track record of successfully working internationally to support arts and heritage venues to reach audiences online and to challenge the views of some people who think museums can be boring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work is part of Europeana Creative, the European Commission funded project to enable and promote the greater re-use by creative industries of cultural heritage resources aggregated by Europeana. Europeana is a digital platform that makes Europe’s cultural heritage open and freely accessible in a range of ways and places. Anyone can explore, discover and share more than 30 million items from museums, libraries, galleries and archives across Europe at Europeana.eu from their mobiles, computers or tablets and Europeana’s API is available to creative and cultural organisations and industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>VanGoYourself is a responsive webservice built in WordPress by <a href=\"http://www.surfaceimpression.com/\">Surface Impression</a> in the UK. The design is by the Europeana Creative partner <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/\">Spild af Tid</a> in Denmark and the image twinning tool is built by the Europeana Creative partner <a href=\"http://www.ait.ac.at/\">Austrian Institute of Technology</a> in Vienna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What is the added value of VanGoYourself for museums and collections?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service offers a genuinely different and surprisingly deep way for visitors to engage with heritage, based on emotion, playfulness and curiosity. As well as existing as a simple online service, the idea can be deployed by tourist offices, museums, cities, tour guides, etc to promote specific destinations, sites and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides the touristic sector with a way for audiences to have an emotion collection to a place through a playful interaction with its own cultural heritage. It has been built so that spin off collections of twinned images can be offered based on the collections from one specific city or museum. This can then be used to support live events, workshops and participatory activities and easily integrated into existing marketing schemes in a light weight and cost effective way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Follow the discussion and share your twinned images at <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself.com </a>or on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VanGoYourself\">@VanGoYourself</a></strong></p>"

        body: "<p><strong>Zeitfenster, Trimaps and Pathway Authoring Tool for Museums!!!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 29 April 2014, the finalists of the Europeana Creative Challenges in History Education and Natural History Education were invited to Brussels to pitch their concepts and ideas at the <a href=\"http://newfrontiersforeuentrepreneurs.eu/\">New Frontiers for European Entrepreneurs</a> event in Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pitching session was the last part of the Challenges. The invited finalists had already passed the online judging round that ended on 14 April 2014. In the Natural History Education theme, the application <strong>Pathway Authoring Tool for Museums </strong>from <strong><a href=\"http://www.agroknow.gr/agroknow/\">Agro-Know</a></strong> won the competition. Within the second Challenge track in the History Education theme the jury nominated two winners: <a href=\"http://trimaps.com/en/\"><strong>Trimaps</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://www.zeitfenster-app.de/\"><strong>Zeitfenster</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=4e1e5667-f79f-4d43-bab7-dd25c24474ef&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1399473608467\"><br><em>Nico Kreinberger, eCreative Team, presenting the Challenges </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘The <strong>Pathway Authoring Tool for museums</strong> and science centres is a web-based tool for building complex web resources with a story-like structure. It empowers education and content experts at museums to make the most of authoring, publishing and sharing technologies, while using, reusing &amp; remixing the world’s high quality collections of open digital resources. The tool also aims to collect visitor data, enabling museums to make better decisions about visitors’ preferences and needs’ </em>says Madalina, representative from Agro-Know and pitcher for this tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=ed88cdfa-4a34-4218-ab99-81dce8cdf64f&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1399474217142\"><br><em>Madalina, from Pathaways Authoring Tool for Museums winner of the Natural History Education Challenge</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trimaps </strong>is a web-based tool including a mobile application to enable geolocation on historical maps contained in the Europeana database. With reference to the Europeana database, the project aims to re-use historical maps at touristy sites. When you visit a city, and you are told ´there was a fortress here 500 years ago´, having access to a historic map of the city would help build the picture. With it, you can see precisely where you are on that map. The objective is to make these maps available on mobile devices and enable geolocation on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=9dc42449-fc3e-4ecb-b830-b0a35e9c54be&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1399474232115\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jonathan, from Trimaps one of the winners of the History Education Challenge</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe second winner <strong>Zeitfenster </strong>is a mobile application for smartphones and tablets. The application allows users to time travel through cities, places and events and experience different times and topics exactly at the location where it took place years ago.Zeitfenster uses historical images and films mixed with authenticated background information using Augmented Reality, Location and Cloud Based Services. All of this allows users to merge the real-time environment with the images to get feeling of going back and forth in time. They also can take an image of their own to personalise and record their experience to share with other people. The app also lets them buy historical stock images as gallery prints. ‘With this, we create cultural awareness and offer an emotional approach to historical topics in order to experience them on location,’ said the Zeitfensterapp developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=7e51d707-60ee-4822-b536-c84b9ca0cb73&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1399474226834\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Zeitfenster team, video pitch (the team was unfortunately not able to be present at the event)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For the next three months the Challenge winners will receive a tailored hands-on Incubation Support Package </strong>provided by experts from the cultural and creative industries in order to help them to spin their product successfully into the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=b0ebe55e-e675-4ece-bb49-c812a89c1781&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1399475103618\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Creative Jury meeting after the pitches</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Creative congratulates the winners and is looking forward to the future collaboration!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And don't worry if you missed your chance to enter the first round of Europeana Creative challenges, we will <strong>soon be opening two new challenges relating to Tourism and Social Networks</strong> and we strongly encourage you to apply if you have a creative idea on how to re-use Europeana content for these two new themes.

        title: 'Introducing Semantika'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>An interview with Nina Zagoranski, the CEO of Semantika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is Semantika, what is your mission?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.semantika.si/\">Semantika</a> is a software development company based in Maribor, Slovenia. We’re the leading provider of museum documentation software and related services in Slovenia, with our collections management system Galis being used in almost every Slovenian museum and gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have over 10 years of experience in software development, web solutions, mobile and multi-touch applications, specializing in natural user interfaces and human-computer interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love what we do. An inspiring work environment and customer satisfaction are our main priorities and this is what makes us better every day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow is Semantika involved in Europeana Creative?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started as a part of the Natural History Pilot team, working closely with the Natural History Museum in Prague to develop an educational game showcasing the potential to re-use Europe's digitized cultural heritage, available on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>. The development of the Memory Match game – a classic game of finding pairs combined with a natural history quiz - is well under way. We think it’s very cute and fits the Europeana project perfectly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Pilots/Memory_Match_home_341.png\" style=\"width: 341px; height: 256px;\" /><br />\r\nThe first screen of the Memory Match app (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few months into the project we got an even greater role in the project – we took over the development of the Europeana Labs portal, one of the most important outcomes of the whole project. <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> is a novel Open Innovation platform that sets out to provide its community of users with everything needed to get started using the Europeana APIs. The portal is already live in the beta stage and we are looking forward to further development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=4d02a816-14e8-4453-940e-b20dae92d859&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1398758964942\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Semantika is involved in three European projects at the moment. Each one of them is a different story, but they all teach us valuable lessons of cooperation, planning, compromising and flexibility. The best part by far is the networking, meeting people from all over Europe and expanding horizons while travelling around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tell us more about the pilot you are working on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Creative is a big project with many partners. It’s been quite a challenge to even come up with the idea of the pilot, but now it’s much fun working on it. We love the design part with all the cute illustrations and the process of refining the idea, so that the game gets better and better with each iteration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many different people are involved in the pilot, so the feedback is very diverse and interesting. We’re learning and improving all the time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about the Europeana Creative pilots <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What piece of advice do you want to give people on the way?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stop dreaming and start doing! It probably won't be easy, but you should never give up. Hard work always pays off – one way or another. If you find something you love to do, then you'll never have to work a day in your life! ;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/semantika.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\" /><br />\r\nSelect the set of cards and the difficulty of the game (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/semantika1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 376px;\" /><br />\r\nA quiz question appears after a pair is found (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/semantika2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 376px;\" /><br />\r\nExplore objects in Europeana and create your own set of cards to play with (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>"

        title: 'UX Session with European Teachers about History Education Tools'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Recently <a href=\"http://www.webtic.nl/\">Webtic</a> performed a user investigation around the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots#historyeducation\">History education tools they are developing in Europeana Creative</a>, with teachers from different countries: England, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, and some more. The activity took place during \"<a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php/2014-history-beyond-textbooks-london-united-kingdom/3649-new-international-course-history-beyond-textbooks\">History beyond textbooks</a>\", a <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/\">Euroclio</a> seminar in London about how to use digital resources for cross-border history education with new tools and approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ux_session.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UX session was divided into two sessions. The first session focused on getting feedback about the existing website, printed learning materials and the two tools under development (compare and contrast, and visual analysis of sources). Teachers' feedback was either submitted online during the event or handed over on paper immediately afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ux_session1.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 386px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the second session teachers were split into three tables, each addressing a different set of questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TABLE 1 - Preparing lessons</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If you could have an assistant what kind of work would he or she take over from you?</li>\r\n    <li>What would be the amount of time you’d like to spend on creating / preparing a lesson?</li>\r\n    <li>How does this compare with the actual time you are now using to prepare a lesson?</li>\r\n    <li>What elements take most time?</li>\r\n    <li>What would help you to reduce this preparation time?</li>\r\n    <li>Describe your perfect workplace!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TABLE 2 - Using learning resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How do you create a learning activity?</li>\r\n    <li>What is the biggest challenge in creating a learning activity?</li>\r\n    <li>What are your biggest challenges when using existing learning activities (either book or online)?</li>\r\n    <li>What are the most effective ways of cooperation between students and you as teacher?</li>\r\n    <li>What ways of interacting with your students do you prefer to have in your learning?</li>\r\n    <li>How can a provider of learning resources help you to ?nd what you are looking for?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TABLE 3 - Imagine a new tool</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>What could it do?</li>\r\n    <li>How would it look and feel?</li>\r\n    <li>What kind of sources would you need?</li>\r\n    <li>How would students and teachers interact with the tool?</li>\r\n    <li>How would you like to communicate with the students before they start working with the tool?</li>\r\n    <li>Do you want it to be a group or individual activity?</li>\r\n    <li>How do you want the results to be measured / collected?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these two sessions, the main goals of the event, getting feedback on products under development in Europeana Creative and obtaining insights about how teachers work throughout different countries, were achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From these results Webtic will define a framework of bottlenecks every teacher is facing when working with online tools, in order to create guidelines for developing educational apps. With these guidelines, it will be possible to fine-tune the existing betas of tools and sketch new possible tools that are of real benefit to the teacher.</p>"

It is one of the most significant research institutions worldwide in biological and geological disciplines and plays are major role in the research on evolution and biodiversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/introducing_the_museum4.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 288px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Biodiversity Wall in the “Evolution in Action” exhibition</em> <em>(© Museum für Naturkunde Berlin)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collections of the museum are directly linked to research. They comprise more than 30 million items relating to zoology, paleontology, geology and mineralogy. The collections contain spectacular pieces such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>the Berlin specimen of the primeval bird <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_ECREATIVE_MFN_GERMANY_Archaeopteryx_2014_02.html?start=3&amp;query=Archaeopteryx+lithographica+berlin&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">Archaeopteryx lithographica</a>; <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_ECREATIVE_MFN_GERMANY_Archaeopteryx_2014_02.html?start=3&amp;query=Archaeopteryx+lithographica+berlin&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\"> </a></li>\r\n    <li>the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_ECREATIVE_MFN_GERMANY_140127_Mittellfuss_Brachiosaurus_02.html?start=2&amp;query=Brachiosaurus+brancai+berlin&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">dinosaurs</a> from the Tendaguru excavation site (including Brachiosaurus brancai);</li>\r\n    <li>the original piece of <a href=\"http://www.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/en/presse/hintergrundinfos/discovery-of-uranium/\">uranium</a> on which its first scientific description was based.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The large exhibitions in the museum, in particular the new permanent exhibitions, give 500,000 visitors per year an insight into current research. The original research items are on display. The exhibitions are complemented by extensive educational programs for all ages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/introducing_the_museum3.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 507px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>The Museum für Naturkunde building in Berlin (© Museum für Naturkunde Berlin)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How are you involved in Europeana Creative?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MfN is mainly involved in the development of the Natural History Education Pilot. In close collaboration with our project partners <a href=\"http://www.exozet.com/\">Exozet Games </a>and <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2\">NMP </a>we design a serious <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/introducing-exozet-games?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">adventure game</a> based on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/pilots#naturalhistory\">Europeana content</a>. We contribute specific content as well as our educational and scientific knowledge. Content sourcing in the field of natural history is our second main task in Europeana Creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWho at MfN is involved in Europeana Creative?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the MfN various employees are involved in Europeana Creative. Gregor Hagedorn, Head of the Digital World at MfN, leads the project at MfN. Ulrike Sturm, scientist, coordinates the project at MfN and is responsible for the educational and scientific concept. Curators and museum educators support the pilot with their knowledge and advice.

Oliver Coleman (left) and Dr. Jason Dunlop (right) appears as a character in the game (photos, left and right: ©<em> Museum für Naturkunde Berlin; graphics, center: <em>© Exozet Games</em>)</em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which content are you providing to Europeana and what is your aim to do so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitised content of several important zoological, paleontological and mineralogical collections were mobilised during the OpenUp! project and are already available at Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A selection of available collections:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>2,362 images of the butterfly collection</li>\r\n    <li>11,014 sounds of the animal sound archive</li>\r\n    <li>3,555 drawings of the famous scientist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg</li>\r\n    <li>4,991 images of the paleological collections</li>\r\n    <li>14,789 images of the orthoptera (grasshoppers) collection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural history is part of our cultural heritage and it is important that people feel related with both their natural and cultural heritage. By opening digital representations of our collections to the public, we want to help people to engage with nature and discuss issues of nature conservation, biodiversity loss and natural resource depletion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is your favourite piece availabe at Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, I have two favorite pieces at Europeana. The first one is the sound of a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_TIERSTIMMENARCHIV_MFN_GERMANY_TSA_Vulpes_vulpes_DIG_99_5_1.html?start=2&amp;query=red+fox&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=TYPE%3ASOUND&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3AOpenUp%21&amp;rows=24\">red fox</a> (barking of an adult pair; CC BY-NC-ND). The fox is an animal which feels familiar and every child in Europe knows how it looks like. But when I listened to the song “What Does the Fox Say” I realised I was not able to answer the question. Listen to our animal sounds helped me to bridge this gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My other favorite piece is one of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_EHRENBERG_D_MFN_GERMANY_MB_ED_2230.html?start=6&amp;query=Ehrenberg+drawings+infusorien&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">Ehrenberg drawings</a>. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (1795–1876) was one of the most famous and productive scientists of his days. In a period of almost thirty years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, rock – nearly all material which might contain living or fossil microscopic organisms – and described thousands of new species. The drawing displays subterranean infusoria (infusoria is an outdated term for tiny aquatic organisms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/introducing_the_museum.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 585px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Drawing by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (CC BY-SA Museum für Naturkunde Berlin)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who will be interested in the content? What would be your desirable result for the content usage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone interested in natural history might be interested in our content. Using its data, images or sounds in a didactic way could support educational material and projects. Also the content could be interesting to cultural and creative industries like designer or game industries. I wish for a re-use in unexpected ways and fields which encourage new audiences to explore their surrounding and to come closer to nature.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>An interview with Florian Berger, who works as a software developer and IT consultant at Exozet Berlin. In addition he is writing his PhD thesis on adaptive educational games.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is Exozet Games? What is your mission?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.exozet.com/\">Exozet </a>is one of Germany’s leading independent game developers, which specialises in the development and distribution of mobile and online titles. The game development studio works hand-in-hand with leading publishers and licencing partners, both on its own products and on commissioned products for the international market. Popular Exozet games include Catan, Carcassonne, HABA Orchard and Emily the Strange. Exozet’s 140 employees are working in Berlin, Potsdam-Babelsberg and Vienna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet01.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 200px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Exozet's main office right at the top flor of the old Tempelhof airport in Berlin.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your role in Europeana Creative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Europeana Creative project, we are developing a serious game which serves as the Natural History Education Pilot application. The game is a “hidden object adventure game” where the player takes the role of an employee of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, and solves an old mystery on location. By playing the game, the player learns about natural history facts and research methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our role is to develop game play and ideas, coordinate these with the scientists and develop the final game as a software product for commercial release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet02.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 330px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>With a view of the abandoned air field, the Exozet games unit develops mobile, casual and educational games.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your goal for the Europeana Creative project?</strong><br><br>\r\nOur goal is to develop an entertaining game that achieves a high degree of scientific accuracy. In this process, we strive to demonstrate that Europeana content can be used for compelling digital entertainment in ways that may not be obvious when one looks at the bare database items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet03.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dr. Jason Dunlop, curator of the collections Arachnida and Myriapoda at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, appears as a character in the game.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What challenges did you face so far while working on Europeana Creative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest challenge is to balance the game play ideas from our designers, the demands for accuracy from the scientific partners and the selection of available items in Europeana. Not all our ideas satisfy the standard for a learning game immediately. This is an ongoing and fruitful process, but requires quite some iterations between the project partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge is to bring the Europeana database content into a form that we can use in the game. Europeana provides photographs of exhibition items in a range of sizes and angles. Some images have scratches, shadows, labels or frames that require additional refinement. Plus, our game features a hand-painted look that would conflict with the photographic quality of the original Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a consequence, our graphic artist re-paints or overpaints almost every image that we use, creating a derived work in the process. While he keeps the image as original as possible, he carefully fits it into the overall style of the game, as well as into the lighting conditions present in the scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet04.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Images out of the Europeana database are not always fit for immediate use in the adventure game.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet05.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To fit the hand-painted style, our artist overpaints the image, while keeping its original impression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do you take along for the future?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributing to such a large project is hard work, and from time to time the coordination processes can be a little intimidating. Then again, both the input from and the insight into the very diverse work that the project partners are doing has been inspirational and definitely broadened our view. We will gladly be part of such a project again, and we will consider openly available content more in upcoming work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about the pilot you are working on. What are the highlights?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot builds upon “adventure game” genre that dates back to the very beginning of computer games in the 1970s, and still enjoys widespread acclaim, especially in Germany. We are developing a modern variant of such a game, running on an tablet computer and controlled via touch interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlights of the game are a compelling story, hand-painted graphics and scientific puzzles that are informed by actual field experts from the natural history museums in Berlin (Museum für Naturkunde) and Prague (National Museum). The game enables the players to explore actual museum locations (which we from time to time have slightly reworked for dramatic effect).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet06.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 316px;\"><br><em>Schloss Tegel, an actual location in Berlin where famous natural scientists Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt lived, appears as a game background <em>–</em> although we added a secret entrance for dramatic effect.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for developers who are considering working with Europeana content?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Europeana already features a wealth of content, it surely is a moving target. On the one hand, re-users should carefully study the licences, as these can vary, and might impose restrictions on the manner of re-use. On the other hand, if the licence permits it, re-users should not be afraid to change and tweak content until it fits the purpose. This way the richness of Europeana can be deployed to maximum effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes Europeana content will not quite match the requirements, most prominently when the image resolution is too low. In such cases, it may be worthwhile to contact the original contributor and ask them to submit an improved version. Seeing their exhibit used in another context might provide them with an incentive to improve the content they contribute to Europeana further, for the benefit of potential users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducingexozet07.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 316px;\"><br><em>The adventure starts at the basement of the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, which is an actual location.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All images © exozet.

        body: "<p><em>(An interview with Nique Sanders, the designer of the software design and development company.)</em><br><br><br><strong>Who is Webtic and what is your mission?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Webtic is a two-person company with a long history rooted in hacking and a great passion for design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=f835c713-c3c0-45b6-8587-ffb7e8d4938f&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1396937705515\">Paul Jongsma, the programming half of Webtic, taught himself programming and soldering as a boy at 17 and never lost the drive to learn new things and take on challenges in this ever-developing market. While working for <a href=\"http://www.sita.aero/\">SITA</a>, which builds and maintains a ‘closed Internet’ for airline companies, he was one of the initiators of the <a href=\"http://www.hacktic.nl/\">Hack-tic</a> network and later founded together with two other guys <a href=\"https://www.xs4all.nl/\">XS4ALL</a>, the first public internet provider in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=1abd242d-49de-40aa-a686-5bd33129f85e&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1396937705513\">And I am the designer. I started out as a graphic designer, but picked up the abilities of a user experience designer, information architect and manager along the way.<br>\r\nDepending on the assignment, we work together with other programmers, designers or interface gurus to create exactly the right product for the contractor.<br><br>\r\nOur main drive is always to bring more to a project than expected, and to build an innovative product together with all the people involved, from contractor to casual visitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your role in Europeana Creative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=046ae37e-e257-4dbc-b550-bfce0508edab&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1396937705520\"><br><em>An impression of the tools created for the learning section of <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">historiana.eu</a> (CC BY-SA Webtic)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the flag of Europeana Creative, together with EUROCLIO and USEmedia, Webtic is creating new and innovative tools for teaching and assisting in building the Europeana Creative website.<br><br>\r\nWithin the time span of two years, we are creating:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>a learning section for the existing website Historiana.eu, where teachers can attach and share their own learning activities;</li>\r\n    <li>a search-and-select tool, where sources can be enriched with metadata specially developed for historians; and</li>\r\n    <li>two tools for learning.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The tools are used to compare and contrast cultural heritage sources and to analyse visual sources. We focus on a new way of teaching where students are in control of their own learning process and where the teaching takes place beyond the text book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=f0868d46-b5f5-4dd7-9191-4f4e89c8bdc8&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1396937705522\"><br><em>What do we do? (CC BY-SA Webtic)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this will be built on the framework of Historiana, which was created earlier and which will be adapted to enable the creation and maintaining of heavily interconnected information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=504a13b3-7f31-4260-8f81-aa8cdf71e7cf&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1396937705503\"><br><em>How do we do this? (CC BY-SA Webtic)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal for this project is to give meaning to the cultural heritage available through Europeana and to create innovative learning tools that seamlessly fit with the way teachers would like to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the main challenges you face?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are certainly some challenges along the way. We definitely had to be flexible and go with the flow. But working with such a great pool of people with such diverse backgrounds and cultural differences is great. It did shake us up and we learnt a lot from listening to other arguments, ideas and different opinions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about the pilot you are working on. How did everything evolve?</strong><br><br>\r\nWith a team of people that consists of such diverse backgrounds, it is important that everybody participates in each other’s work. There are no boundaries between the work of a designer, a teacher or a developer. Everybody involved needs to know how students learn nowadays, how they communicate and how teachers with different cultural backgrounds can build their material without great technical restrictions.<br>\r\nAnd also the educational work field is changing. Nowadays it is so much more than just a textbook. Looking for ways to exploit the technical opportunities and use them to the benefit of the students’ learning process is challenging and fun.<br>\r\nWe’re still looking for ways to create a solid business model around the pilot. In a market where schools are challenged to do more with less budget, it’s all about being creative, not only financially but also about the future of developing.<br>\r\nWith a team that is used to building something as it comes along, we needed a lot more structure than we’re used to. Agile development, scrum meetings and Google Hangout calls are really new to us.

        body: "<p><strong>Europeana Labs is live!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve been following our blog over the past few months, you’ve previewed the first Europeana Creative pilot apps and maybe even been inspired to enter our Open Innovation Challenges. Now it is time to welcome you to Europeana Labs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Labs is a novel Open Innovation platform that sets out to provide its community of users with everything needed to get started using the Europeana APIs to develop apps re-use digitised cultural heritage objects. Here you can learn about the data, see what others have created, and find out how to build simple but powerful queries to extract bespoke results from a dataset of over 30 million objects - books, photos of art and artefacts, audio clips and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been developed over the past year by Europeana Creative’s technology partners in consultation with the developer community, who told us what things would help them to make best use of the Europeana APIs. The Europeana Labs Beta site is the first major step towards putting in place the things we were told, but also a chance for us to learn more and make improvements before a full launch in late June.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that Europeana Labs no longer exists.

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Blog post by Callum Lee</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Finding Value in European Project Funding</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At <a href=\"http://www.ecbnetwork.eu/\">European Creative Business Network</a> (ECBN), we think that there are big opportunities for the creative industries in the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme. Inspired by <a href=\"http://geeksonaplane.com/about/\">Geeks on a Plane</a>, we put creative agencies on a train to find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our colleagues at the <a href=\"https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/creativektn\">Knowledge Transfer Network </a>(KTN UK), we ran an intensive three-country tour of the great programmes and partners that could form the core of a successful bid for Horizon 2020 funds. When we weren’t visiting projects, we got participants working by asking them to design off-the-wall projects that might win Horizon 2020 funding. And we used Europeana Creative as a demonstrator project to show what could be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Tour Aimed to Inspire, Engage and Find New Partners</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty creative agencies came along, either KTN’s UK partners or ECBN members. They included <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/\">Creative England</a>, <a href=\"http://www.e-c-c-e.de/en/%E2%80%8E\">ecce</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kosice2013.sk/en/%E2%80%8E\">Košice 2013</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\">Nesta</a>, <a href=\"http://medea.mah.se/\">MEDEA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/\">Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council</a>, <a href=\"http://www.creativescotland.com/%E2%80%8E\">Creative Scotland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/\">University of the Arts London </a>and <a href=\"http://www.brightonfuse.com/%E2%80%8E\">Brighton Fuse</a>.<br><br>\r\nThe tour aimed to study inspiring projects that show how European funding can bring real value to organisations and businesses, and to help them meet, talk to and collaborate with new partners for future projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/horizon2020.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 411px;\"><br><em>The Waag Society’s FabLab in Amsterdam (image: Callum Lee CC BY 2.0)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Creative Project Partners Were Found at Every Step of the Tour</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we are proud of the Europeana Creative project, we made sure that some of the project <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/partners\">partners </a>on it were represented at every stage, including <a href=\"http://www.mfg.de/\">MFG</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\">Kennisland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ebn.be/\">EBN </a>and also <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/en/content/dg-connect\">DG Connect</a>. (We would love to have been able to include all 26 project partners.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we used Europeana Creative as an example of a great project that brings together partners from across Europe to do something inspiring. Although it isn’t a Horizon 2020 project (in that it’s not funded by the H2020 precursor, FP7), it’s still an innovative example of how digital technologies can be used to create real value from Europe’s cultural resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/horizon2020_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 474px;\"><br><em>The tour outside A-Lab, a start-up incubator (image: Callum Lee CC BY 2.0)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making Sure Projects Provide Value</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we learnt one thing from the tour, it’s making sure that you don’t win funding for the sake of it – but ensuring the projects you deliver bring your organisation real value. Again, Europeana Creative provides lessons. First, the project will have a legacy in the business models that are developed and in the Europeana Labs that are built. Second, it fits the bigger picture, as there is increasing recognition of the value of the cultural and creative industries in Europe, and re-use of digital content is an important strand in the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/\">Digital Agenda for Europe</a>. And third, it provides us with a real example of how European funding can develop something innovative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?img_id=2124476&amp;t=1396439268842\"><br><em>Harry Verwayen at Europeana (image: Callum Lee CC BY 2.0)</em></p>"

Too broad? Then think about the potential of original content related to collections of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/collections#History\">postcards from the First World War, German documents from that conflict, Napoleon artwork, old geographical maps and drawings of famous battles on artwork</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=5e0728a8-7d61-45d1-8310-63b67882253f&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395843835061\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some samples of the type of content you can re-use for your project proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could you do with this type of content? In our second co-creation workshop, we were inspired by the development and re-use of content collections such as the ones at <a href=\"http://dbnl.org/\">The Digital Library of the Netherlands</a>, or 3-D animation of caves with prehistoric drawings at the <a href=\"http://lascaux.culture.fr/#/fr/00.xml\">La grotte de Lascaux website</a>, or <a href=\"http://docsteach.org/\">interactive lessons at the US National Archives</a> with primary sources to foster historical thinking, or the app <a href=\"http://www.beedocs.com/\">Beedocs</a> for multimedia timelines… All very inspiring examples!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What Do We Have Running Right Now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have formulated a product definition and requirements, as well as the relevant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\">business model canvas</a> for digital applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of developing a learning section for our History Education Pilot on <a href=\"http://www.historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> to stimulate the re-use of digitised heritage available through Europeana in history education came up during the brainstorming. It’s under development now. You can watch a short presentation about it (and some of the work that inspired the development):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=3e4eb6c6-7417-42c4-a94b-6d0c675461e2&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395843835061\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A visual project summary (still in beta) by Webtic. (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have similar ideas to build on our pilot? If so, you can submit it as your challenge entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here Are Some Other Ideas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Dealing with multiperspectivity:</strong> What if students could see very visually the evolution of a city, with different infographic layers to compare how immigrants influence its development? Or if a student could search for a biography of an important historical figure, add historical context and enrich it with related open content about other people, newspapers, buildings, etc.?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Compare and contrast:</strong> What if students could write a postcard to an ancestor or relative inspired by a selection of postcards sent by others who lived in historically momentous times? Or if they could compare portraits on a timeline or map to learn about the formation of identity over time?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Critical analysis of sources:</strong> What if students could visualise time by using historical maps and cartoons from different periods given by the teacher, to understand changes over time. Or if a student could identify similarities in propaganda from various wars, with contextual information about the origins and use of war, in order to understand issues that concern governments in wartime.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Encourage historical thinking:</strong> What if students could see and search through handwritten letters, with options to transcribe and read transcriptions, so they can learn about communication in history? Or if a student could follow or re-live historical scenes or events via Twitter by viewing or communicating old content (documents, postcards, newspapers) that would appear daily, in sequence? The student would not know how the story would end, in order to experience the suspense and uncertainty of the historical events.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Innovative ways of presenting a narrative:</strong> Students could have their own World War I newsreel using digitised material from the war, record a new voice-over to experience the sights and sounds and the emotional reality of war. Students could create a family tree using portraits of monarchs adding contextual information about the pictures, in order to understand interconnections between European societies.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=a6377e8c-64b4-4c16-897c-39a00d43455c&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395843835061\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of a learning app for geo-locating layers of open content about immigration and discussing about it, produced during the co-creation workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think you can develop an educational prototype based on any of the above ideas? Or do you have a completely different concept for a digital tool help teaching or learning about history?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ecreativeeducation2014.istart.org/\"><strong>Show us what you’ve got!</strong></a></p>"

Too broad? Then think about the potential of original content related to collections of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/collections#Nathist\">butterflies, flowers, beetles, minerals or fossils</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=3a858f7b-499f-449c-831c-de24a2277bc9&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395752203412\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Some samples of the type of content you can re-use for your project proposal.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nWhat could you do with this type of content? In our first co-creation workshop, we were inspired by customised digital magazines following the example of interfaces like <a href=\"https://flipboard.com/\">Flipboard</a> or personal remixable canvas like <a href=\"http://www.museapp.org/\">Muse-app</a>, or collections of open educational resources such as the ones on <a href=\"http://www.iacademy.mobi/en/\">iAcademy</a>. We consider these very inspiring examples!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a brainstorming session, we formulated a product definition and requirements, as well as the relevant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\">business model canvas</a> for digital applications (read the report <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/project-documents/-/document_library_display/yP06/view/1594730/68901?_110_INSTANCE_yP06_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fproject-documents%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2FyP06%2Fview%2F1594730\">here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of this process, we came up with the idea for a museum adventure game and a memory card game for the pilot projects. They are now under development, but here are two short presentations about the products (and some of the work that inspired them):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Adventure Game screencast by Exozet Games<br />\r\n(CC BY-ND Europeana Creative)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=074bdb03-6eb4-4f2d-929e-6037d4b9665d&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395752203411\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diagram and adventure game screencast by Exozet Games<br />\r\n(CC BY-ND Europeana Creative)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Memory Game screencast by Semantika<br />\r\n(CC BY-ND Europeana Creative).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=dee5f210-9378-4062-9768-0230c679e668&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395752203412\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Initial idea and memory game screencast by Semantika<br />\r\n(CC BY-ND Europeana Creative).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Few Other Ideas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Natural History Education Co-Creation Workshop threw up a few more ideas. Perhaps you will find something inspiring for your challenge entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Virtual timelines or exhibitions about species, with comments.</li>\r\n    <li>A fossil hunting app that takes you through a city, based on geo-location or augmented reality.</li>\r\n    <li>Or a puzzle where you combine parts of different images from fossils or animals in order to build a new one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=22e462f1-3b56-40a9-9487-423f081a6086&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1395752203412\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diagram of a fossil hunting app developed during the co-creation workshop (CC BY-ND Europeana Creative).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think you can develop an educational prototype based on any of the above ideas?

        title: 'Introducing ENoLL, the European Network of Living Labs'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/\">European Network of Living Labs</a> (ENoLL) is the international, independent non-profit association of bench-marked living labs with<a href=\"http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/livinglabs\"> more than 340 accredited living labs</a> worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is ENoLL, and what is your role in the Europeana Creative project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_lab\">Living labs</a> are real-life test and experimentation environments, where users and producers co-create innovations, in a trusted, open ecosystem that enables business and societal innovation. Living labs enable the co-creation of user-driven and human-centric research, development and innovation of technologies, products and services focused on the well-being of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A living lab employs four main activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Co-creation: co-design by users and producers.</li>\r\n    <li>Exploration: discovering emerging usages, behaviours and market opportunities.</li>\r\n    <li>Experimentation: implementing live scenarios within communities of users.</li>\r\n    <li>Evaluation: assessment of concepts, products and services according to socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive and socio-economic criteria.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The living lab movement is a relatively new concept, so ENoLL also acts as a point of reference for public and private organisations engaged in experimentation environments and those interested in enhancing innovation on a systemic basis. One of the characteristics of the ENoLL network is its diversity. As innovation ecosystems, living labs are active in many different domains (e.g., health) or/and can have a more territorial component (e.g., cities, regions) with a multi-thematic approach. Culture, art, design and creativity are important domains in the ENoLL community, and we’re participating in numerous different European initiatives focused on supporting creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducing_enoll_blog01.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our role in the Europeana Creative adventure is multidisciplinary. We will be taking an active role organising the second and third round of challenge events whereby creative entrepreneurs and developers will be asked to re-use <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> content on the subjects of tourism, social networks and design. We’re also part of the team communicating and disseminating information about the project and challenges, so we are collaborating with our network and other partners to spread the word and get people excited about this great project and its five challenges. We are also involved in work on the Europeana Labs Network, as there are common points linking the work of Europeana and the ENoLL strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do you think are the benefits and challenges for creative industries when collaborating with cultural heritage institutions? Can you tell us about past collaborations and experiences and what’s interesting for you as a network of living labs?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main challenges when collaborating with partners from such different industries is that it can invite all sorts of culture clashes. The scientific, technological, business and arts worlds are at times incredibly different, and with so many different schools of thought it can be difficult to make sure everyone understands everyone else. Yet, at the same time bringing together such diverse partners can provide brilliant opportunities to re-think how information is shared and can create fruitful synergies between partners and institutions that normally would not have a chance to collaborate. Here at ENoLL, we don’t have a huge amount of experience collaborating directly with cultural heritage institutions, but some of our ENoLL members do (for example, a living lab in Barcelona called <a href=\"http://www.i2cat.net/en\">i2CAT</a>). ENoLL has also identified a trend in some museums and libraries aiming to integrate open innovation and living lab activities in order to create an ecosystem of citizens, visitors, entrepreneurs and educational actors around their physical space (for example, some ENoLL members are museums or actors linked to them).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/introducing_enoll_blog02.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 440px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENoLL has a lot of experience in the field of open innovation and the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/\">Digital Agenda for Europe</a>, so this is what makes Europeana Creative especially interesting for us. We also have experience in collaborating with creative industries, more specifically, enabling creative industries for the future internet in a project called <a href=\"http://www.specifi.eu/\">Specifi</a> and a design-based project called PELARS which will be designing tools (including furniture) to engage students with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please tell us about the opportunity the ongoing Europeana Creative challenge events could represent, to support and give visibility to new ideas and projects from the creative industries, also from other innovators in the field of technology and culture.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The re-use of digital content is an essential part of the Digital Agenda for Europe, and these challenges help to bridge the gap between technology and the arts. Europeana is providing access to over 30 million digitised cultural heritage objects from libraries, archives and museums and the phenomenal size of this resource brings an invaluable pool of inspiration to practitioners in the creative industries and beyond. These challenges will hopefully expose innovators in the technology sector to the potential social and economic value of cultural content and increasingly engage cultural experts with digital developments and the power that technology can bring.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Foundation – Digital Objects and Tools to Remix and Use Your Cultural Heritage'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a> is the governing body of the Europeana service. It is set up for the purpose of fostering collaboration between museums, archives, libraries and audiovisual collections in Europe. We asked Pavel Kats, Development Manager at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>, a couple of questions. Continue reading to find out how <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023601/oai_eu_dismarc_GHT_001_P11716A22506.html\">tango </a>and Europeana Creative are related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the role of the Europeana Foundation and what is its role in the Europeana Creative project?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways to describe Europeana and a currently popular coinage in our office is that of a “catalyst of change” in the cultural heritage sector. We like to think of ourselves as a place where novel digital technologies are put to the service of the cultural heritage sector; where European cultural riches are published and accessed in contemporary ways – where the digital future meets the cultural past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog Posts/europeanafoundationdigitalobjects01.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 301px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One of the sections of the Europeana homepage.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our role in the Europeana Creative project is to leverage our aggregation network and technical platform to explore new ways of disseminating and re-using cultural heritage content. With the help of our partners who have expertise in web design, software development, semantic technologies, outreach into creative communities, licencing policies and related areas, we will explore these new ways. It will complement our platform, built over the recent years, with products, technologies, legal frameworks and business models to become relevant in the new content economy of the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does your work in Europeana Creative fit in with the overall strategy of the Europeana Foundation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s overall strategy is very much about what we do with the content after we aggregate it. In this sense, the Europeana Creative project is the first real opportunity to explore how we can really engage European citizens in seeing, watching, hearing and reading it. We believe creative industries to have the multiplier potential for us – if we succeed in serving them right, we can reach many more eyes and hearts than by addressing end users directly. Therefore, the project is perfectly in line with our strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog Posts/europeanafoundationdigitalobjects02.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Card-sorting session with the Europeana team and other Europeana Creative partners (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, we believe that the connection with creative industries should be a two-way street. People working in these industries – designers, programmers, artists – can help us in many ways. Our goal in the project is to go the extra mile to understand what Europeana can give them, but also to allow them to take it themselves, because at the end of the day, European cultural heritage belongs to the citizens. By opening up data of the memory institutions, advocating for clear licencing, and developing an open source aggregation and dissemination platform, we are offering a complete toolset for the re-use of cultural content. Encouraging professionals to apply and improve this toolset is a goal of the project and of Europeana in general. Establishing and improving our dialogue with the creative communities is also a major part of Europeana’s overall strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Labs, when will they be live and what services will they offer?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Labs is our first concrete offering to professionals in creative industries – in essence, the toolset mentioned above. It is an online one-stop destination that features our content and technical means to access it in a very clear way. We assume no previous knowledge of complex data models, technologies or IP rights intricacies – just come as you are and grab content that you like that is allowed for re-use. And apply the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/api-introduction.html\">Europeana API</a> to integrate it into your work. Therefore, the Europeana API and everything around it – clear documentation, use cases, tips and tricks – is a major ingredient of Europeana Labs. At a later stage, we will explore how we can add physical aspects of supporting and incubating ideas. But now our priority is to release the first public beta version of the website that will go live in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog Posts/europeanafoundationdigitalobjects03.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 293px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Wireframes for the internal alpha version of the Europeana Labs platform, currently under development by Europeana (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you encountered challenges in the project so far and are there any other challenges you anticipate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, we are just through a third of the project, so it is better to speak of future challenges. There are a lot of them, as we are entering a new terrain unknown to us, where standards are already set very high. High quality media content is abundant today and the API economy is thriving – this leads to high expectations from anything new on the API market. To succeed, we should work with partners on both sides (i.e., memory institutions and creative and commercial partners) and do a lot of advocacy work. On the one hand, we need to convince memory institutions that it is worth opening up quality content to increase the public’s engagement. On the other hand, we must show creative industries and commercial partners the potential of working with the cultural heritage sector. It takes two to <a href=\"http://www.dismarc-audio.org/GHT/GHT001/001_11795_a.mp3\">tango</a> and our main challenge in Europeana Creative is arranging this tango party, while making sure that we ourselves – as a DJ if you wish – facilitate this encounter at the highest standard.</p>"

        title: 'Starting the Evaluation of eCreative Pilots'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Now that some of the pilots under development have gone through the different phases of co-creation, identification of requirements, visual design, connection with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana content</a> and different levels of basic performance, it is time to begin the prototype evaluation, especially in relation to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability\">usability</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience\">user experience</a>. We will be assessing the learning materials created for <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/the-history-education-pilot-takes-off\">History Education Pilot</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/natural-history-educational-games-underway\">two games related to natural history content</a>, which have specific target audiences in the educational sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the critical aspects of any interface is the way end users interact with it (in this case, especially in connection with learning aspects). An early testing with people from different backgrounds usually helps to improve it, by incorporating new and fresh looks to the work being done. This method would help the three development teams to identify better ways of displaying features or options in the product, in relation to Europeana content or more broadly, when there’s still time for improvements in the final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery (27).jpg\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 700px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One of the previous expert discussions about indicators for the History Education Pilot.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“How does this starting screen engage me?”; “Do I find the basic elements in order to clearly begin using the game or app?”; “Are the words in each menu easy to understand and follow?”; “How can I know where I am within this environment?”; ”Can I reach the objectives of what’s suggested in the product presentation?”...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are just some of the questions addressing important issues and indicators for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation\">usability </a>of the pilots, to be asked during the tests or right afterwards. Small groups will be tested using a method adapted from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol\">think-aloud protocol</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Caf%C3%A9\">world café</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/start_the_evaluation.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 350px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Prototype of one of the history education tools developed by <a href=\"http://www.webtic.nl/\">Webtic</a> for comparing and contrasting sources.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s the aim of two events that will run simultaneously on March 3, as structured evaluation sessions at the <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> in Brussels and <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a> in Palma. Participants in the tests will sit separately to solve specific tasks, while we take notes and document their experiences. Those dynamics could represent different types of improvement, apart from a valuable interchange of knowledge between participants in the sessions, educators and experts in the field of online applications for learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re looking forward to the results of these tests and the first evaluation meetings of the pilots. They mark a series of milestones in Europeana Creative, and are important developments parallel to the first call for our challenges... (Haven’t you heard about our challenges yet? <a href=\"http://ecreativeeducation2014.istart.org/\">Here’s the link to the call we just launched</a>, don’t miss this opportunity if you’re a developer or a digital creative of any stripe!)</p>"

        title: 'Inspired Discussion Europeana Creative in Vienna'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Creative1.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by Tim Bocek via <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en\">Flickr CC-BY-NC-SA 2.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This past week Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision's Research and Development team members Johan Oomen, Lizzy Komen and Gregory Markus ventured to the Austrian National Library in Vienna to attend the Europeana Creative all partner meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Creative’s goal is to support and promote the re-use of cultural resources available via Europeana through the development of 5 different pilot applications (history education, natural history, tourism, social networks, and design). These applications showcase how creative industries and cultural institutions can combine forces to design tools and apps that users can use not only to view cultural heritage objects but also become more actively engaged. Sound and Vision's Lizzy Komen is the lead coordinator for all of these pilots and is also directly in charge of designing the social networks pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Social Networks Pilot</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The social networks pilot will make use of a varied array of audio content. These sound assets are supplied by Sound and Vision and <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">The British Library (BL)</a> who both have experience with crowdsourcing projects such as the <a href=\"http://www.geluidvannederland.nl/\">Sound of the Netherlands</a> and <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/sound-maps/uk-soundmap\">UK Soundmap</a>. Pilot partner <a href=\"http://wearewhatwedo.org/\">We Are What We Do</a>, known for their social media platform <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/\">Historypin (HP)</a>, will develop the user interface. Additionally, <a href=\"http://www.ontotext.com/\">Ontotext</a> will enrich the sounds with geo-locations and dates, which will allow exploration on a map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Creative2.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound of the Netherlands uses geotagged sounds and allowers users to sonically explore the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot will create an interactive application and engage communities to enrich these sounds with freely reusable images, information, and metadata from Europeana, Historypin and other sources on the web. This application will, as it grows, grant end users the ability to listen to the audio of a woodpecker, view various images of the bird, read scientific and historical texts about the bird, contribute more information all in one place. However, birds are but one simple example. Other themes will relate to things like city soundscapes where users can sonically explore a city via History Pin’s map interface while also viewing relevant images, reading stories, and seeing videos that correspond to the area that the sound was originally recorded. The prototype version of the pilot will be delivered in spring 2014, while the final version will be ready by January 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Creating the Future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting granted the Sound and Vision team the opportunity to coordinate with over 50 members of consortium to ensure that everyone was on the same page and had the opportunity to express their ideas and opinions about the direction of the project. There was no shortage of things to say. The brainstorming sessions were heated and intense. In the end this allowed the best ideas to surface after having received input from some of Europe’s leading cultural, creative and technological institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Creative3.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things were run on a tight schedule by Project Leader Max Kaiser. Image: Katharina Holas <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">CC-BY 2.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will become of these ideas in the coming months? Well some pilots are still being designed and developed others are being prepped for the challenge section. The challenge section will invite web developers, entrepreneurs or creative wizards to use the developed pilots as inspiration and encourage them to develop their own applications using cultural heritage resources. The first challenge will be held in Brussels in April.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More info</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To stay up to date on the activities of Europeana Creative, follow the project on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eCreativeEU\">@eCreativeEU</a>.</p>"

They are coordinated with the final goal to support and promote the re-use of cultural resources available via <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the work in progress related to launching (very soon!) a first online version of the <a href=\"http://www.europeanalabs.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a>, an online space for remixing and using cultural and scientific heritage for inspiration, innovation and sharing, to the necessary strategic and practical issues of access to digitised content with enough resolution and rights clearance for generating new applications and uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/general_meeting.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 460px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the slides from Kennisland about the importance of generating innovative re-uses of content based on specific curated and prepared assets of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting was an important milestone for several pilot apps and games under development. The progress and main issues were shared with the rest of the partners, which was an opportunity of gaining more feedback before they are tested and evaluated in different lab settings. Like the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/the-history-education-pilot-takes-off\">History Education tools</a>, which will give access and new approaches to teachers and students for learning and discussing key moments. As well as persons in the history of Europe, or the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/natural-history-educational-games-underway\">two digital games under development</a> that could be used by students of different ages in order to learn more about Natural History.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important area of the project shared at the meeting in different sessions, and this way more agreed and improved, is the forthcoming <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/13\">Challenges call</a> for educational applications and tools, which will allow participants from the creative industries in this field to submit their idea for joining our co-creation community of app and software developers, entrepreneurs, designers, educators and collection curators. So stay tuned following us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eCreativeEU\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Europeana-Creative/1417144211864059\">Facebook</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development/201402/inspired-discussion-europeana-creative-vienna\">Here</a> you can read another post about the meeting from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/general_meeting2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 744px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the different sessions, there was also room for another proof of concept of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/tired-of-just-looking-at-paintings\">Tourism pilot</a> under development, where Europeana Creative team re-enacted the famous picture of the <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CongressVienna.jpg\">Congress of Vienna by Jean-Baptiste Isabey</a>.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The Europeana Creative team are developing a genuinely different and surprisingly deep way for tourists to engage with heritage, based on emotion, playfulness and curiosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recreate a painting with your friends, then upload and share your photograph, twinned with the original, for others to enjoy. Decide how ambitious you feel, then choose to recreate an easy, medium or hard painting from a selection of classics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service will be used by tourism offices, museums, cities, tour guides, etc. to promote specific destinations, sites and events. After all, the tourism sector seeks to provide visitors with great experiences in order to get them to return to a destination or to tell friends and family about it in a positive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana_creative/13\">pilot</a> scheme could help to provide that experience. It can easily be integrated into existing marketing schemes and is very \"light-weight\" in terms of costs and management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service will be free and very simple to use. The website helps you to choose a painting to recreate. Once you have taken your picture, it is twinned with the original. You can also then share it through your own existing digital channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is something visitors and tourists can do together, as friends or as a family, and can then share with more people online. It's inherently sociable and playful – and everyone loves an interesting or amusing photo!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The B2B Targets</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main targets for the use of the tourism pilot prototype are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Tourist offices or public tourist bodies (from local to national / cross-border)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Museums and other content providers or cultural venues</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea could be used to directly engage visitors in fun ways with cultural assets of the destination, generating interest as well as connecting them with art-historical themes and information in a deeper way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The B2C Targets</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end user – or client – for the service will be a tourist or visitor who is digitally active. It is aimed at a wide group of tourists who may want to engage with paintings, images and photos, but don’t simply want to look and learn in very formalistic ways: because they are not interested in it or because they already know a lot about a destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea taps into a key emotional desire for fun and sociability. It both triggers and is based on natural curiosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea could be used:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>To engage tourists in paintings relating to a specific destination.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>To re-experience historical events that happened at a specific place.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>To create tangible and extraordinary souvenirs and memories of the trip.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>To support the creation of additional memories after the trip, for example, recreate images that have been discovered during the trip with the family.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific targets could be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Young audiences (children, teenagers, school classes)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Families</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Niche audiences with a very deep and specific interest in a destination, i. e., WW1, gardening, art nouveau, etc.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>City breakers and tourists with a relatively shallow interest in cultural content</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Tourist groups (recreating a painting instead of the \"usual memory shot\" in front of the bus)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential users would be attracted via marketing campaigns of the B2B partners of the project, i. e., tourist boards, museums, cities, etc., or social sharing that uses previously created recreations of paintings as the key promotional images.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe website can be used on any device (computer or mobile) and anywhere – with an Internet connection. The website will guide the user through the process in a simple four-step approach:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Select the painting/image you want to recreate.</li>\r\n    <li>Take a picture with your camera of your re-enactment or upload the image of a re-enactment that you've already prepared.</li>\r\n    <li>Twin and adjust the photo with the original image/painting.</li>\r\n    <li>Share it with your friends and family (mail, FB, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, etc.).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scenario</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The working title of the tourism pilot is \"VanGo(gh)Yourself\". The working title was inspired by the Van Gogh exhibition in Mons and the popular \"<a href=\"http://www.elfyourself.com/\">ElfYourself</a>\" application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scenario was chosen as the most promising scenario for a prototype because it will allow the pilot partners to focus on the development of a curation tool that enables the easy selection and integration of objects from Europeana in new applications where they would be contextualised, geolocalised or just simply re-used and displayed in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The need for such a tool was at the centre of every single scenario developed by the participants of the Europeana Creative Tourism <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana_creative/news/-/blogs/under-construction%3A-methodologies-for-co-creation-workshops-with-europeana-content?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana_creative%2Fnews%2F-%2Fblogs%3F_33_advancedSearch%3Dfalse%26_33_keywords%3D%26_33_delta%3D5%26_33_cur%3D2%26_33_andOperator%3Dtrue\">Co-Creation Workshops</a> in Verdun and Mons (November 25–27, 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/tired_of_looking.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 525px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Initial collaborative diagram of the VanGoghYourself pilot scenario during the workshop in Mons</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simplicity of the concept is ideal for the test and promotion phase of the prototype, because the front-end development will be kept relatively light-weight due to the use of existing platforms and a very simple overall concept: select a painting, take a photo, pair it with the painting, publish it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally: We have chosen \"VanGo(gh)Yourself\" because it is a genuinely different and surprisingly deep way to engage with heritage, based on emotion, playfulness and curiosity. It is something creative and innovative that also leaves a lot of room for improvement for the future open innovation challenge phase where more complex scenarios can be explored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Last Supper 760.png\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 570px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Europeana Creative tourism pilot team recreating the Last Supper in a restaurant in Mons.

        title: 'Looking behind the Scenes of Creating a Visual Identity for Europeana Creative'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>To communicate the outcomes, progress and achievements of the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/\">Europeana Creative</a> project online and in print requires an elaborate strategy and some experienced minds. This is where <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/\">Spild af Tid</a> is brought into play. Spild af Tid is a Copenhagen-based design and illustration studio working across visual media. We asked Christina Holm from Spild af Tid questions about their work, so keep on reading to know more about Spild af Tid and their involvement in Europeana Creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is Spild af Tid and what is Spild af Tid’s role in Europeana Creative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a multidisciplinary approach to design and do interactive, spatial, digital and classic printed works for a variety of clients: TV and cinema title sequences, illustrations, interactive installations, production design, apps, books, exhibition design, visual identities, video design, posters, campaign films, websites and music videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our participation in the Europeana Creative project is multidisciplinary as well. So far we have been responsible for developing the visual identity for Europeana Creative and designing a variety of digital and printed dissemination material. Graphic designer Laura and project manager Christina are the primary people running this task – with Jakob on the side as the creative director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=52bc0f7e-21b4-4b0c-9148-0a81f891f8e2&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1389878157321\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Visual identity of Europeana Creative (photo: Spild af Tid)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014 and 2015 we are going to play a significant role in the development of the design pilot application. Additionally we are in close dialogue with the project team of the tourism pilot application as design partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=b33c026d-3972-4145-a375-44961ff991a4&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1389878178228\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Christina and Laura at work (photo: Spild af Tid)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are collaborations with cultural heritage institutions interesting for you as graphic designers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage institutions represent a large part of our client portfolio. As a designer, working on an assignment for a cultural heritage institution is usually considered a prestige project because of the potentials of working very innovatively and at a high level of creativity. At least this is our experience based on more than ten years of work with cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An eminent example would be our collaboration with the Museum of Copenhagen on <em><a href=\"http://www.copenhagen.dk/en/whats_on/the_wall\">The Wall</a></em>, a huge interactive multi-touch installation providing people to navigate in space and time in a three-dimensional collage of Copenhagen, based on the photo collection of the museum. Additionally, <em>The Wall</em> allows users to be co-producers of the city space installation by contributing their own images, film and comments. From the very beginning, the museum’s level of ambition of this loosely defined idea was extremely high. How to realise the idea became the main challenge, though during the two-year long process the level of ambition was never being compromised. <em>The Wall</em> has been awarded several prestigious prizes and is today one of our main flagship cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within our industry it is well known that working for cultural heritage institutions does not make you rich. The budgets are usually low compared to the effort of work, so the motivation should never be profit. Also the decision-making is definitely not the smoothest part of the project. You really have to be passionate about the design solution itself and enjoy the privilege of working closely together with cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you create the visual identity of Europeana Creative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a brand strategic perspective one of the key thoughts, when starting up the design project, was to develop a sub-identity closely related to the master identity (the Europeana Brand Guidelines). We decided to unfold the beautiful selection of Europeana imagery in a more contemporary and explicit way. Also the bright Europeana colours could be used more actively in order to create an appealing visual language when communicating to the audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when starting up the design project, we knew which identity elements to use: logo, typographies, colours. The image part became the most interesting element to work with, as we discovered something amazing was happening when adding colour layers to the cultural heritage image material. And when focusing on unfolding the images and making it a significant identity element, it made really good sense to simplify the logo. We tinted the logo to achieve a floating, light and contemporary visual expression, and it also became a tool to clarify the basic idea of the Europeana logo which is formed from the combination of thought bubbles as a symbol of generating new ideas. This is indeed an essential key message to the Europeana Creative target groups according to the mission statement for the project as a whole: to encourage creative re-use of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=23468c56-67e0-4a04-be98-877174aa1ed9&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1389878166396\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Designing the Europeana Creative logo (photo: Spild af Tid)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, by re-using the existing Europeana identity elements in new, creatively appealing ways we felt very loyal to the overall idea about \"re-use\". We went further and developed an entire new graphic element based on layers of images, patterns, colours and tints: the prism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=3e2a3817-b594-4b07-829e-6ed949600876&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1389878162433\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Working on the prism (photo: Spild af Tid)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of patterns and creating layers of graphic elements is already widely used in the Europeana identity, though the shape and composition of the prism added a highly contemporary and significant twist to the design. At the same time, the prism is a metaphor for adding new perspectives on given topics and creating different layers of interpretations – an ideal message to the target audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might all have noticed already, we chose the \"raspberry red\" to be the Europeana Creative colour. There is simply something special about the colour pink. When merging it with a spectacular pattern image from 1820 by K. M. Sternberg from the National Museum in Prague, it added to the colour a substantial visual expression and we fell in love right away. Functionally, the raspberry red acts as the primary colour in a colour hierarchy for strong identification across online and offline media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main practical challenge was to find a variety of old and new material and to obtain high-resolution, rights-cleared versions. The visual identity has been met really positively among the other partners in Europeana Creative which is absolutely great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/general-press-images\"><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=2b0514ab-6687-408e-a909-c01b740a3841&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1389879047440\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>K.

As the project is developing a sustainable, open infrastructure, allowing for the upload and then the re-use of metadata related to Europe’s cultural heritage, there are many possibilities for developing tools on top of this infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1249/1252804592_c8dcc489a5.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Floating cloud. Image credit:&nbsp;Alastair Dunning / CC-BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These will be tools of use both to aggregators and data providers, but also for those providing third-party tools for end users in different sectors, for example, research, education or the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure that the connections between different projects can be exploited, a Cloud Coordination Group has been established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides members of Europeana Cloud, this group includes representatives from the <a href=\"http://www.locloud.eu/\">LoCloud </a>project, which is coordinated by Riksarkivet (National Archives of Norway) with MDR Partners. Whereas Europeana Cloud is focusing on an infrastructure for aggregators, LoCloud aims to provide a cloud-based service for aggregating and storing data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, LoCloud has a very distinct focus on providing a tailored service for small and medium-sized cultural institutions. Discussions within the Coordination Group have therefore begun on how the LoCloud services might be made sustainable by integration with Europeana Cloud; something made much easier by the pre-existing technical interoperability between the two projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> is the other critical member of the group. One part of this project is to develop Europeana Labs as a forum for experimentation with Europeana’s data for the creative industries (e.g., publishing, tourism).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are obvious connections with Europeana Cloud here – how will Labs exploit the data uploaded to Europeana Cloud? What kind of data will be available? What creative and experimental uses of that data would be possible? And under what licensing conditions? Indeed, a Revised Europeana Licensing Framework is a common goal of the two projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cloud Coordination Group also invites other members with overlapping interests. The <a href=\"http://www.tagcloudproject.eu/\">TagCloud </a>project aims to enhance experience of cultural heritage by sharing users’ preferences via a cloud-based infrastructure. The group will be working on exploring how best their deliverables can be incorporated into the other projects in the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you have a project that could contribute to this group, please contact the Europeana Cloud coordinator, Alastair Dunning (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/coordinating-clouds?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-cloud%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">contact details</a>).</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana Creative Workshop – Bridging the Gap with the Creative Industries – December 2, 2013 @ DISH2013 in Rotterdam</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> project is bridging the gap between cultural heritage institutions and creative industries through a focused program of pilot applications and incubation. In the high-level expert workshop “Bridging the Gap with Creative Industries”, taking place at DISH2013 in Rotterdam on December 2, invited experts will join partners from the Europeana Network and the creative industries community to discuss and debate case studies of creative industry engagement, hoping to draw out strategic themes, factors for success, trends and principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop is part of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1893329;jsessionid=00993BC0E2AF249D1B4B7B2D6BEADA0B\">Europeana Annual General Meeting</a> (AGM), a key event for Europeana and its Network, and the <a href=\"http://dish2013.nl/\">Digital Strategies for Heritage (DISH) Conference</a>, a biannual international conference on digital heritage and strategies for heritage institutions. Business for creative industries is one of the main themes of the conference this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keynote speaker Bernd Fesel, deputy director of the European Centre for Creative Economy (ecce) and chairman of the European Creative Business Network (ECBN) will frame the discussion in his opening address. This will be followed by parallel table discussions in which participants from cultural heritage institutions and the creative industries will brainstorm together on how they can better collaborate for mutual benefit in the future. The table discussions will cover three thematic areas corresponding to Europeana Creative’s pilot applications and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/13\">open innovation challenge events</a>: education, tourism and social networks. Pilot leaders will be on hand throughout the session to share their experiences and the challenges encountered so far in developing the first Europeana Creative apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concluding panel discussion will synthesise the ideas generated in the parallel table discussions and translate these into concrete, actionable recommendations on how to bridge the gap between cultural heritage institutions and the creative industries. Join us to have your voice heard!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=178190ff-804d-4a6a-82c9-270ee7d51124&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1385461834333\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programme December 2, 2013</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.45–9.25: Registration open</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9.30–10.30: AGM plenary program</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10:30–10:40: Plenary introduction workshop</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10.45–11.00: Start workshop and keynote Bernd Fesel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11.00–12.00: Round-table discussions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.00–12.30: Panel discussion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop will take place at De Doelen, a conference venue (<a href=\"http://www.dedoelen.nl/\">www.dedoelen.nl</a>) close to the Rotterdam Central railway station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the Workshop</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop is open to participants of the Europeana Network Annual General Meeting and interested guests from the creative industries. Want to join? Please contact João Gonçalves, project manager of the European Business &amp; Innovation Centre Network, via Joao.Goncalves@ebn.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants can register as Europeana Network members (registration is free) and attend free of charge both the AGM and the reception on the evening of December 2, which is open for all AGM/DISH participants. All Europeana Network members will be compensated for travel and subsistence according to the Europeana v2.0 reimbursement rules (1 night to be refunded).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About Bernd Fesel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernd Fesel is an independent promoter, researcher and advisor in the cultural creative industries in Europe.

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The curator of the <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/\">“Retronaut” website</a> believes that the images of the past that we find the most striking are those which are the most at odds with the ideas we have - those that challenge and disrupt our ideas of history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivid colours in a photo taken 100 years ago can seem unreal even though the image is actually more realistic than the sepia version of the same print, but because we're used to seeing that era through a black and white lens, the colour shot seems incongruous and doesn't fit with our mental map - making it more interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds of the past can have a similarly disruptive effect. The world of 100 years ago was no more silent than it was black and white, but because it is only relatively recently that we've been able to capture and store sounds for posterity we're not all that used to thinking about what the past would have sounded like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So while an <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92060/1F98A4B63FF920871E14C3112038F77684C45451.html?start=40&amp;query=einstein&amp;qf=TYPE:IMAGE&amp;startPage=25&amp;rows=24\">image of Albert Einstein</a> has a strong recognition factor, very few people would be able to recognise <a href=\"http://www.dismarc.org/index.php?form=display&amp;oaiid=MACR/USA560759733&amp;db=0\">his voice</a> were they to hear it. When people do hear a recording of the great scientist, the impression left can be novel and strong, the sonic dimension enriching our mental map bringing the past into the present in a more arresting way than silent imagery ever could do on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=189268ba-584f-4202-b72c-ab259f46ade8&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1386840947607\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_in_palma2.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 394px;\" /></a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe aim of the Europeana Creative workshop facilitated by <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a> at <a href=\"http://www.esbaluard.org/en/\">Es Baluard Museum</a> in Palma was to look at ways of delivering the sounds of cultural heritage and history to an audience in ways that are fresh and innovative. The workshop explored how to do this through social networks and their crowdsourcing possibilities, in order to inform and define upcoming work in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/13\">Social Networks pilot project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants were asked to supply <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2_nSswqxLk9jtdaBt9FcnZ5Cs1Mv3bGxsYNeZUF7ro/edit\">raw materials in the form of sound clips</a> to help give focus to the discussion. These had to correspond to the following themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>street culture</li>\r\n    <li>cultural heritage soundscapes</li>\r\n    <li>speeches</li>\r\n    <li>nature</li>\r\n    <li>industry</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the sounds submitted were very basic, for example the <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/177257-rain-falling-on-my-tent-at-greenbelt-festival\">patter of raindrops</a> on the roof of a tent. However, even this simple sound can become interesting when a bit of context is added. A description tells us that it was recorded at a greenbelt protest, a timeline and map tell us when and where it was recorded, and, once a photo is added, these otherwise inert resources combine into something that depicts a piece of history that would otherwise have been unremarkable and quotidian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other samples included <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/240637-bells-of-dalton-parish-church\">church bells</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richarddevine/multi-channel-field-recording\">bees</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/beeldengeluid/schiphol-landen-van-een-boeing\">landing jets</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lucdebruijn/poelkikkers-in-het\">mating frogs</a>, the hissing <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/beeldengeluid/heineken-brouwerij-algemene\">valves of a brewery</a> and more. Over two and a half days of brainstorming, a slew of ideas began to emerge on how to organise and present these sounds. We moved from a collaborative \"scenario forecast\" of possible apps and platforms, to a discussion and selection process which ended up in five of these scenarios being more visually defined by participants, in the shape of collaged prototypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_in_palma4.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 428px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proposed \"listen to the city\" project would take the idea of the audio guide common to galleries and museums onto the street. This concept would allow audio walking guides to be configured (wifi-connectivity permitting) for the individual traveller, and could enable city monuments to have sound effects or themed content connected to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-tourists would also be able to use such a service, the idea's proponents suggesting that themed soundscapes could be made available to commuters. For example, the daily train ride to work could be peppered with the industrial sounds of yesteryear as the train passes geographic points where factories used to operate, or on another day maybe a nature sound theme could be chosen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_in_palma3.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 428px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as \"listen to the city\" there was the more abstract proposal of a \"sound palette\" - an app that would allow users to \"draw in sound\", linking clips together by drawing in different \"colours\" corresponding to themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also discussed a \"family stories\" widget - an idea which would involve the mapping of recorded family interviews onto a family tree in a tool for the avid genealogical researcher present in every family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another idea was a portal for train geeks and fans to engage in challenges sourcing audiovisual and contextual information about rail transport. Fans could add geolocations and comments and could compare and share their findings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/workshop_in_palma.jpg\" style=\"width: 780px; height: 585px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential merits of a \"search by sound\" facility were given some attention, applications of it including a tune-finder, a bird-call identifier and a general facility for uncovering serendipitous similarities between arbitrary recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also up for discussion was the more ambitious possibility of a more creatively interactive tool which would allow users to compose sounds by juxtaposing things like industrial jack-hammer noises with recordings of 1930s propaganda speeches, or the combination of the sometimes eerily similar sounds of the natural world with the mechanical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the ideas proposed and discussed were interesting in their own right and could be used for the challenges that will start in 2014, although not all of them were viable. We measured viability in terms of technical feasibility, appeal and usability, potential business models, as well as the amount of content available to power them. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> has a limited number of sounds that are licensed for re-use, and while that number will grow as time goes on, as of yet these assets are too thematically diverse or too thinly distributed geographically for some of the more ambitious applications on the drawing board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, this is a pilot project and a small-scale proof of concept will be delivered by next June based on the outputs of this workshop, with the participation of partners like <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/\">Historypin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">The British Library</a> and <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>. To see what form that takes and to get a glimpse of how Europeana hopes to work with sound in the future, keep watching this space!</p>"

        body: "<p><em>This blog by Cheryl Tipp first appeared on the British Library <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/sound-and-vision/2013/11/europeana-creative-the-wildlife-recordings-of-lawrence-shove.html\">Sound and Vision blog</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February of this year Europeana launched an exciting new project that seeks to promote and facilitate greater re-use of cultural heritage resources. Through a series of pilot applications, open innovation challenges and spin off projects, Europeana Creative will demonstrate that Europeana, an online portal which provides access to over 29 million digitised objects, can provide the creative industries with both inspiration and actual content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe British Library is one of the project's 26 European partners and will be providing access to 3,000 digital sound recordings with particular emphasis on wildlife and environmental sounds. One of the largest contributions will come from the historic collection of British wildlife sound recordist, Lawrence Shove. With an interest in both the sounds of individual species and the wider natural soundscapes of Britain, Shove soon developed a comprehensive collection of wildlife and environmental sound recordings. By the 1960s he had become one of Britain’s best known wildlife sound recordists and worked on a number of published records including <em>Woodland Birds</em> (Discourses, 1966) <em>Dawn Chorus and Nightingale</em> (Discourses, 1969).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/2e2fe4e9-3452-4ff5-b9cd-38c78b993e1c\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment over 450 recordings from the Lawrence Shove collection can be found in the<a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings\"> British Wildlife Recordings</a> section of <a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/\">British Library Sounds</a>. Highlights include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings/022M-W1CDR0001421-0300V0\">Sea coast atmosphere, Skokholm Island 1965</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings/022M-W1CDR0001425-2200V0\">Blackbird song, Devon 1961</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings/022M-W1CDR0001421-1800V0\">Skylark song, Devon 1966</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings/022M-W1CDR0001422-0100V0\">Yellowhammer song, Devon 1966</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaking these sounds and their associated metadata available through Europeana Creative will increase the visibility and awareness of this rich collection and encourage creative re-use in innovative and imaginative ways. It's been an interesting journey so far and we'll keep you posted on all the latest developments as the project progresses.</p>"

        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> (EUN) is a network of 30 European Ministries of Education based in Brussels, Belgium, that aims to bring innovation in teaching and learning to Ministries of Education, schools and researchers. EUN is a key partner in the Europeana Creative project supporting and testing the educational pilot applications being developed. Its extensive network of education specialists and its innovative laboratory space, the <a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/\">Future Classroom Lab</a>, are valuable assets for the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Creative Partner Runs Future Classroom Lab in Brussels</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUN is hosting and supporting <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/\">Europeana Creative</a> activities in its <a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/\">Future Classroom Lab</a>. The Future Classroom Lab is a fully equipped, reconfigurable, teaching and learning space developed by EUN, its supporting Ministries and leading educational technology providers. It has been designed as a “<a href=\"http://www.openlivinglabs.eu/\">living lab</a>” where policy-makers, ICT suppliers, teachers and educational researchers can come together to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) Rethink how new technologies can support the educational reform process at both national and European level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) Engage in regular workshops, seminars and courses on how existing and emerging technologies can have a transformational effect on teaching and learning processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(3) Develop new economic models so that teaching and learning activities designed for the future classroom can be brought into the mainstream and delivered at scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=32f2962a-ac31-435f-91f5-b8c98e98a72d&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1382607970842\"><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=b6a9801e-380e-42c5-8bbe-53abee1c0147&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1382607990540\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>European Schoolnet's Future Classroom Lab in Brussels</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Educational Resources and Data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Creative fits with EUN’s overall strategy through its focus on innovation, interconnectedness, opening up European cultural digital data to the public and especially its activities to develop tools to enhance the availability of tools and open assets for European educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content, tools and services that will be made available via the Europeana Labs website will enhance activities in the Future Classroom Lab and generate opportunities for users to creatively remix and re-use open digital cultural resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Save the Date: Europeana Creative App Prototypes Showcased on November 6–7</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUN is hosting the <a href=\"http://edrene.org/seminars/seminar10brussels.html\">10th </a><a href=\"http://edrene.org/\">Educational Repositories Network</a><a href=\"http://edrene.org/seminars/seminar10brussels.html\"> Seminar</a> on November 6 and 7 in Brussels. The <a href=\"http://edrene.org/\">Educational Repositories Network</a> (EdReNe) brings together web-based repositories of learning resources with content owners and other stakeholders within education in order to share, develop and document strategies, experiences, practices, solutions, advice and procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through its biannual seminar, EdReNe builds collaborative links between national and other types of repositories and publishers’ associations. Two Europeana Creative partners, the Prague <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2\">National Museum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a>, the European Association of History Educators, will participate in the upcoming <a href=\"http://edrene.org/seminars/seminar10brussels.html\">10th EdReNe Seminar</a> and present prototypes of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/natural-history-educational-games-underway?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">natural history education</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/the-history-education-pilot-takes-off?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fnews%3Fp_p_id%3D33%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">history education pilot applications</a> being developed in the project.

        body: "<p>After the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/co-creation-and-business-modelling-workshops-underway\">first co-creation workshop</a> last May at the <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/\">Prague National Museum</a>, there has been significant progress in two different pilots for teaching and learning using natural history content. With the coordination from that museum and the <a href=\"http://www.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/en/\">Museum für Naturkunde</a> in Berlin, as well as contributions from other <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/partners\">Europeana Creative Partners</a>, the development companies <a href=\"http://www.exozet.com/\">Exozet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.semantika.si/\">Semantika</a> are starting to give shape to two educational games which connect their educational features to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=what:natural%20history&amp;qf=TYPE:IMAGE&amp;rows=24\">Natural History content in Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the pilots will be an adventure game, a mix of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_adventure_game#Point-and-click_adventure\">“point and click” adventure</a> and a hidden object game. The user will take the role of an explorer of a natural history museum, solving different puzzles to unveil a big secret.<br><br>\r\nThe educational factor of the game is in the need for the user to learn about history, science, evolution etc. while solving different puzzles. They will see real content from museum collections through the diverse digital objects that come via Europeana (from crabs to spiders or dinosaur’s bones).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=667aa17b-7ebd-444f-ab6a-3a2a25cdc998&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1381403830142\"><br><em>First draft of the main characters and some of the scenarios for the game</em><br><br>\r\nThe game’s primary target platform will be a tablet computer with touch interaction, and its development team are currently working on the design of the main screens and characters and the interactions of the first puzzles to solve, as well as the technical requirements for getting the content via Europeana.<br><br>\r\nThe other pilot, more targeted at early primary school children, consists of a digital <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29\">card memory game</a> and quizzes, which will present high quality content from different themes in the natural history domain, also directly obtained via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=c3ecd0f6-b259-4e56-ab30-fe3528c75929&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1381403906015\"><br><em>Mockups of two of the main screens of the game</em><br><br>\r\nIt will be developed for different platforms such as tablets and mobiles, and will include the possibility for users to generate new playing card sets, editorial and questions. We hope that it will then be useful in different educational scenarios, from teachers generating homework to students creating their own sets as assignments, or even parents or curators preparing an ice-breaker activity prior to a visit to a museum.<br><br>\r\nThe application will also generate questions and answers about the content the user has to match, in order to amplify its educational potential and potentially provide enriched data back to Europeana.</p>"

The current implementation supports users who are exploring the content of <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and looking for images that share similarities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=2def2134-a928-4009-8d4c-cc6d45e0c97e&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380869025486\" /><br />\r\nImage Similarity Search Process</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe search service demonstrated within <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/group/europeana-creative/admin/-/document_library/view/1594726/60801?_20_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fgroup%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fadmin%2F-%2Fdocument_library%2Fview%2F1594726\">this paper</a> was developed in the context of the ASSETS project by <a href=\"http://istc.cnr.it/\">ISTI-CNR</a> to improve the user experience when exploring Europeana datasets. It is re-used and enhanced within the Europeana Creative project, with the goal of supporting discovery of content suitable for inspiring the creativity of professional designers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the context of the Europeana Creative project, ongoing research activities are related to the re-use of cultural heritage content for inspiring creative design. Several categories of cultural heritage objects have been identified for use in this context. The current version of the search algorithm provides a good overall retrieval accuracy on the given dataset, but there are certain types of images for which search performance doesn't meet the expectations of professional users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=1a195f75-4fe9-4212-bb1d-5dd8922de5d0&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380869727223\" /><br />\r\nScreenshot of the <a href=\"http://62.218.164.177:8080/imagedemo/\">demo</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently AIT is working on increasing the size of the dataset that will be re-used for the implementation of the design pilot application and optimising the effectiveness of the retrieval algorithms for particular classes of objects. Additionally they aim to integrate the service within the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/api-introduction.html\">Europeana APIs</a>, making it available for any stakeholders building domain-specific applications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorking with Cultural and Creative Industries<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAIT's staff are from very technical backgrounds; one challenge they experienced when working with cultural heritage institutions and creative industry hubs is that AIT focus more on complexity (back-end) while domain experts concentrate on usability (front-end). Domain experts are often not aware of the power of particular technologies, or may not understand what they are good for (something called 'knowledge acquisition bottleneck'). Aligning the terminologies and the goals of the two communities is the key for successful collaboration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWorking with domain experts is both a challenge and an opportunity. For AIT, it is a challenge to be able to fulfil their expectations with the developed applications, and an opportunity to learn new concepts and new ways to make use of technology and to face new ways of perceiving developments such as image similarity. Consequently, this will lead to identification of new research questions and possible implementations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow It Works<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe implementation is based on open source technologies. The MPEG-7 descriptors are computed by using the LIRE feature extractors and the approximate similarity search algorithm uses the Melampo library. The core of the retrieval process is represented by the computation of the similarities between the query and result images. This is performed by employing the cosine similarity computed on colour and shape features extracted from the original images, namely the MPEG-7 Sclable Color, Color Layout and Edge Histogram descriptors.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current search algorithm has a retrieval accuracy able to satisfy the expectations of public users navigating through the Europeana repository, and it may satisfy the expectations of professional designers searching for certain types of content like paintings, drawings, glass or porcelain objects. For other categories of objects, shape-based descriptors and algorithms may perform better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFuture work will focus on identifying algorithms that are able to maximise the retrieval performance on each of the selected classes of images. We plan to evaluate additional image descriptors (e.g. local and shape-based descriptors) and search algorithms to better satisfy the expectations of design communities.</p>"

        title: 'Under Construction: Methodologies for Co-Creation Workshops with Europeana Content'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://youcoop.org/en/\">Platoniq</a> (open source culture developers) and other partners are developing a methodology and set of activities for co-creation workshops related to the Europeana Creative challenges. The themes of these challenges are natural history education, history education, tourism, social networks and design. The workshop activities promote the re-use of <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana-related content</a> in new digital applications. The activities take participants through a series of actions they can take when designing digital projects and software applications collaboratively. The workshops take them from idea generation to initial wire-framings and development planning following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile</a> project management principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=1ae35864-e4b3-455a-90bd-83e6a5d0ab5e&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380267820907\"><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=1ae35864-e4b3-455a-90bd-83e6a5d0ab5e&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380267820907\" /></a><br />\r\nScenario planning at the Natural History workshop in Prague</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The methodologies try to guide participants, conducted by a facilitator, from scenario planning to collective decision-making, definition of personas and their relation to cultural objects, and finally to group design and visual definition of ideas. In this <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/project-documents/-/document_library_display/T28g/view/1594725/60301?_110_INSTANCE_T28g_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fproject-documents%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2FT28g%2Fview%2F1594725\">first version of the methodology</a>, each activity is described individually, with the recommended duration, materials needed, goals and instructions. We recommend that each workshop starts with a programme of short presentations (5 to 10 minutes) that outline the technical possibilities, areas of interest and available content. This helps everyone to understand the context of the task. Finally, the workshop should reflect on the results and outputs of the activities and create a \"backlogs\" list that will outline the next steps and tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=dbc4f9e4-e5a8-47ba-bc03-d1d7f3e4c4a3&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380267837659\" /><br />\r\nCard samples with Natural History content from Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a project under development, the activities described in the document can be considered as a work-in-progress, since they are still being adapted and tested. Partners' experiences in the first two co-creation workshops designed around the natural history education and history education themes, for example, are influencing the shape and format of the next co-creation workshops on the tourism and social networks themes. However, the current version could already be adapted for other incubation processes and spaces such as digital labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=2ca3c5d2-551e-44aa-8a7e-b09bae5c7b83&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1380267890765\" /><br />\r\nDesign in action at the History Education workshop in The Hague</p>"

        body: "<p>Within the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> project, EUROCLIO (European Association of History Educators) and Webtic (web development company) are working on a pilot project that stimulates the re-use of content from<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\"> Europeana</a> and in history education, an important area for creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history education pilot will offer history educators easy-to-find and free-to-use educational resources (sources, learning activities and tools) that are designed to stimulate historical thinking, multiperspectivity and active learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of the history education pilot will be on the re-use of content that is relevant for the First World War. Material will be selected from Europeana projects, such as <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana1914-1918</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\">European Digital Film Gateway</a> and used for the development of learning activities. The sources and learning activities are organised around content areas that highlight different aspects of the war, such as “Experiencing and Reporting the War” and “Remembering the War”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=ed9c99d5-8727-47c2-8f6e-f558f92e9bf8&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1379590405291\" /><br />\r\nWireframe of the main page</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selection of sources and the development of learning activities are done by an international community of contributors, who are history education specialists from the EUROCLIO network. EUROCLIO plans to continue to work with a community of contributors from its network to tackle other key moments and development in history and heritage that are relevant in Europe and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=9c51344d-85ca-40b9-a2ef-d63a6bdbb9a7&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1379590600700\" /><br />\r\nWireframes of the search and selection tool</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the issues and priority tasks until now have been: to explore and document key dates of the First World War and how related content could be used; to produce different mock-ups and designs for the main screens of the tool; to produce clear definitions of end-users and potential features of the site; to identify already existing tools or services which can be embedded; to identify filters for metadata; to identify content licensing issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a> and <a href=\"http://www.webtic.nl/\">Webtic </a>are building on the experience gathered from the<a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\"> Historiana</a> project, a pioneering initiative for exploring European history and heritage – a platform that will also be used to disseminate the educational resources developed in the pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=b993f3ae-4907-45dd-a263-0c6eb1a97182&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1379590422087\" /><br />\r\nMockup of the image analysis / selection tool</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot is being developed in collaboration with Europeana Network members, such as the Imperial War Museum and the Austrian National Library. The added value of working with the Europeana Network is that the sources from various content providers make it possible to create educational resources that are international and help educators to look beyond their national history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history education pilot stimulates the re-use of digitised heritage by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>The creation of an international collection of sources – that are historically relevant and free to be re-used for education – around content areas that are common for history education across Europe.</li>\r\n    <li>Making it easy for history educators and students to find these sources by adding metadata that is useful for history education to this collection and developing a search and selection tool.</li>\r\n    <li>Using existing – and developing new – tools that can be used to stimulate innovative teaching and learning of history with digitised heritage online. The tools will be used to promote multiperspectivity in history education, as well as encourage critical thinking and effective analysis of sources.</li>\r\n    <li>Working with a community of contributors on developing learning ideas (with students’ and teachers' material) that have been peer-reviewed, freely available, and demonstrate how the selected source material and tools can be used in practice.</li>\r\n    <li>Presenting the learning activities on the Historiana website, making clear how the learning activities relate to specific historical content, historical thinking skills and other aspects of history education.</li>\r\n    <li>Making PR material to present the sources collections, tools and learning activities as a package – around a key moment or development in history – that educators can pick and choose from.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of the tools are a direct result of the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/news/-/blogs/co-creation-and-business-modelling-workshops-underway?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_pos%3D2%26p_p_col_count%3D6\"> first co-creation workshops</a> organised by Europeana Creative, which saw different user scenarios and prototypes generated and discussed along with previous research carried out by EUROCLIO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, the team working on the pilot is working on the selection of source material as well as the development and prototyping of tools (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/project-documents/-/document_library_display/T28g/view/1594730/59902?_110_INSTANCE_T28g_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Feuropeana-creative%2Fproject-documents%2F-%2Fdocument_library_display%2FT28g%2Fview%2F1594730\">detailed overview here</a>).

        body: "<p>Europeana Creative is in full swing. With pilots under way and challenges being organised, it's important to take a moment to think about what it is the project is trying to achieve. WP7 has just submitted its initial <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1538974/1601973/eCreative_D7.2_EBN_v1.0\">dissemination plan</a> which introduces the project's key messages, answering the vital question of 'What's in it for creative industries and cultural heritage organisations?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're already involved in the project, whatever your role, knowing what's in it for our audiences will help you to keep your thinking and your activities on track. If you're not involved yet, we hope that we've expressed our messages in a way that will have you chomping at the bit to join in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've also got a great leaflet inspired by the key messages and designed by project partners Spild af Tid.

        body: "<p><strong>The first Europeana Creative co-creation and business model requirements gathering workshops took place in Prague and The Hague in May, providing a framework for the pilot applications to be developed in the education themes, history and natural history.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set against the backdrop of the Prague National Museum, the natural history workshops brought together participants from a variety of backgrounds ranging from content providers and developers through subject specialists to business experts. Superbly facilitated by project partner Platoniq, workshop participants developed and structured different concepts for apps addressing the natural history education theme. Ideas ranged from educational apps inspired by the “A Night at the Museum” concept to a fossil hunt to teach young teenagers about the natural history in Prague through an augmented reality challenge. Each concept was measured against a set of criteria including level of innovation, usability and “Europeanability” among others and a first version of a possible user interface was developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=b4f7da65-0d1e-40b0-85cd-aabbddc47861&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1379605316438\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One week later in The Hague the history education workshops took place. Based on the same methodology used during the Prague workshop, participants had the opportunity to discuss and develop app concepts for history education. Ideas ranged from “My Newsreel” where students and users could create their own newsreel based on World War I video material from Europeana to “A tool for critical analysis of sources” aimed both at students and a broader public with a general interest in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=58f6a3ea-b1f9-4df3-9196-1dd7ec5a5db3&amp;groupId=1538974&amp;t=1379605504510\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day of both workshops participants proceeded to discuss and develop the most appropriate business models for each of the app concepts. This began with a discussion of market forces and key trends leading to the development of a business model canvas for each app concept. The most feasible ideas will be further developed and available as pilot Europeana Creative apps in July 2014.</p>"

        title: 'New recommendations outline ways to strengthen Europeana’s future relationship with Wikimedia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In light of the <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu\">Europeana 2020 strategic plan</a>, what shape should Europeana’s relationship to Wikipedia and the wider Wikimedia community take in the years to come? To find an answer to this question, a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/task-forces\">Europeana Network Task Force</a> was formed with a mix of people drawn from the Europeana network of GLAMs as well as active members of the Wikimedia community. It was chaired by Jesse de Vos from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, now at Wikimedia Netherlands, and had a clear mission to reach final recommendations that benefited both Europeana and Wikimedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, the group has produced a report outlining ten ways in which Europeana and Wikimedia can build on their successful cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/GLAMwiki.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 261px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first task was to create an overview of all past Wikimedia activities that Europeana has had involvement in. This <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/Projects\">list of past and current projects</a> was built on-wiki (where else?) and shows very clearly the depth and breadth of the existing relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half of the six-month review then focused on developing 10 strategic recommendations which would make this relationship even stronger over the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Europeana has a long standing relationship with the Wiki community. With the development of the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMwiki_Toolset\">GLAMwiki Toolset</a>, publishing to Wikimedia has become an intrinsic part of our publication policy and we would like to expand on this relationship for the benefit of our data partners. The recommendations in the report of the taskforce amplify that ambition, and we will investigate how we can act upon each of them.”</em><br>\r\n(Harry Verwayen, Europeana Foundation)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be achieved by considering a Wikimedia-component to both current and future projects. Europeana can also play an important role by enhancing relationships between GLAMs and the Wikimedia network, as well as sharing knowledge about practices in each of these communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important aspect of the report was the recommendation that Europeana further integrate its systems and technology with Wikipedia and other Wikimedia platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page\">Wikidata</a> is a key part of this, as a fast-growing project with enormous potential for linking collections, carrying out authority control, and synergy with Europeana’s systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of a dedicated Wikimedia coordinator and ‘product owner’ was another significant outcome. The creation of this position means that each of the ten recommendations can be fulfilled to their full potential. This new team member can also look at the opportunities to integrate Wikimedia in each of the major forthcoming Europeana projects, such as “1914-18”, “Sounds” and “Fashion”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final element to the report considers the possibilities for cooperation between Europeana and Wikimedia as they seek external funding for projects, with the possibility of Europeana becoming Wikimedia’s first <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_affiliation_models/Movement_Partners\">movement-partner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the different strands to the report offers groundwork for exciting developments that can form future planning, and we would like to thank all members of the Task Force, as well as numerous others who gave their valuable insights during the creation of this report.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>“Making the beautiful thing”; this was the theme for the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeanatech2015.eu%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYOKkyRk3dkFnPi8cAS3zpFRjTwQ\">EuropeanaTech 2015 Conference</a> in Paris at the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bnf.fr%2Fen%2Ftools%2Flsp.site_map.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGx25YAJAlNGQBZ7mdfEHlj7daPUA\">National Library of France</a> on February 12 and 13. But what is the beautiful thing? Most people would say that art, paintings, photographs, stories and sculptures, are beautiful things. Though this is true, this was not a gathering of artists - at least not in the traditional sense. EuropeanaTech 2015 instead brought together a crowd of expert developers, innovators, and technical pioneers in the field of digital cultural heritage. The beautiful thing they are united in making? Meaningful interaction between the public and their cultural heritage. And, as <a href=\"http://discontents.com.au/\">Tim Sherratt</a> from <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a> reflected, it’s “an ambitious undertaking”.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/16373589757\" title=\"Europeana Tech Day 2 by Europeana EU, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Europeana Tech Day 2\" height=\"\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7425/16373589757_70a3e0cd97_c.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><sub>George Oates and Seb Chan at Europeana Tech. By: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\">Europeana</a> (CC-BY-SA)</sub></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The conference themes ranged from data quality, data modeling, re-use, multilingualism, open data/open source, discovery, and the influences on ways people interact with digital heritage. We cannot dictate their experiences, but we can make them as rich as possible.For an audience of back-end developers, however, such a conclusion might not seem obvious. Yet, during his keynote on Thursday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andyhkn\">Andy Neale</a> from <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\">DigitalNZ</a> raised a very valid point: don’t leave your end-users to the marketing and front-end teams; keep them in mind every step of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Publish First, Fix Later </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tim Sherratt wants to call the users who help improve the OCRed texts found on Trove “discovery engineers” not “volunteers” or “contributors”. Why? Adding an enrichment to digital assets not only improves the front-end experience, but makes the back-end run faster, enabling better connections between items. Trove knows OCR is not perfect, but believe that this should not inhibit publishing. Andy Neale, meanwhile, openly declared that the quality of metadata on DigitalNZ varies greatly in quality, but they still choose to publish. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Welty\">Chris Welty</a> from <a href=\"http://research.google.com/\">Google Research</a> stressed how vital metadata quality is and how necessary data is for the future of cognitive computing. But despite <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html\">Google’s astounding accomplishments</a> in this area, Welty highlighted that the public have come to accept that results from algorithms based on machine-learning are not perfect. As he underlined, with innovation, two thirds of the project will fail, no matter what. We’ll call this rule “publish first, fix later”. The takeaway is that institutions shouldn’t hide their data or developments: the public are understanding and happy to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Search or Curation? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://intelligentheritage.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/878_4aa86b3d9906f.jpg\">Seb Chan</a> from Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum said “search is a niche solution to a broad problem” and he was quick to admit the poor data quality at <a href=\"https://www.cooperhewitt.org/\">Cooper Hewitt</a>. Is it poor though? <a href=\"http://www.cooperhewitt.org/2015/02/16/random-beauty/\">Their data</a>, as Chan points out, is structured in a way that humanises it moving away from standard metadata formats and presentation. Chan also observed that “people don’t go to a museum to perform a search” so why should this be a key issue for digital platforms like Europeana? In a keynote given on the final afternoon that chimed with Chan’s, <a href=\"http://abitofgeorge.com/\">George Oates</a> from <a href=\"http://goodformandspectacle.com/\">Good, Form and Spectacle</a> asked a big question: How does one make a digital space feel like a public space? Oates, who was responsible for the design of platforms like the <a href=\"https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/bookreader\">Internet Archive’s Book Reader</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/commons\">Flickr Commons</a> is well versed in facilitating interaction between the public and culture, and ensuring that the public gains as much as possible during digital encounters with cultural heritage. She declared that she no longer wants or needs a search box, but instead longs for better pathways and more help navigating through the huge amounts of data and art already available. This is exactly what Europeana will achieve with the new Channels feature and the Content Re-Use Framework that Europeana’s Bram Lohman presented in Paris. Both of these features will make it easier for the public to find high quality, enriched, and freely useable content.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/16371844868\" title=\"Europeana Tech Day 1 by Europeana EU, on Flickr\"><img alt=\"Europeana Tech Day 1\" height=\"\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/16371844868_8ca1354e4c_c.jpg\" width=\"600\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><sub>Reuse panel discussion at Europeana Tech. By: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\">Europeana</a> (CC-BY-SA)</sub></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Planning for the future by building on the past</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech 2015 focused a lot on the future. This is a bit paradoxical for a group of people from “memory institutions”. In the words of Seb Chan, “memory institutions are pretty good at forgetting what they did before”. During the open data/open source chef’s table, there was a strong discussion on the future of data and software in the cultural heritage sector. The need for documenting past work as thoroughly as possible and making current work highly visible arose as a major priority. It’s cliché, but archivists and historians know that preparing for the future relies on the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s things we can do to enable this. On Friday morning, ways the EuropeanaTech Community can make their work visible to the Europeana Network were presented. These include the “<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/#tag=floss\">Who’s Using What</a>” column to share software developments, favorite tools, and plans for the future; the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/flosseurtech\">#FLOSS Inventory</a>, a catalogue for finding relevant tools to help expedite technical development, and the new EuropeanaTech Insight, a multimedia publication about R&amp;D developments by the EuropeanaTech Community. These three outlets allow the community to make use of past knowledge and work, engage in current undertakings and make plans for future ones. EuropeanaTech also offers the opportunity for <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/task-forces\">task forces</a> to investigate, solve and improve challenging aspects the community faces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learning to experiment, fail and grow </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning from and building upon the past means accepting failure. This interesting paradigm was presented by Chris Welty from Google Research, and he stressed the importance of experimenting, assessing, failing, and trying over and over again until you find that “golden nugget”. This raises some potential challenges for EU-funded projects, which, by design, seek to limit the risk of failure. Does this mean they have to be less progressive and innovative? The EuropeanaTech conference itself provides the answer here, demonstrating that Europe has no shortage of good ideas. Though there is always room for more innovation to be stimulated, this can be achieved by catering for bursts of free experimentation, for instance with events like the <a href=\"http://www.locloud.eu/News/LoCloud-Hackathon-winner\">LoCloud hackathon</a> held at the Google Cultural Institute in Paris the day before the conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot was packed into two days, and every corner of technical development in digital cultural heritage was touched upon. All of the participants took away something different. Yet what everyone came away with was the shared commitment to identifying and discussing the big problems ahead, and a spirit of bold positivity was enjoyed throughout. Better quality data, improving means for public access, interaction and experience, building upon the past by sharing, learning from failure, and empowering individuals and local endeavors might be the main things I’ve come away with, but we want to hear everyone’s after thoughts. To hear what others gained from the two days, be sure to read their blogs here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'<a href=\"https://kulturognaturreise.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/natively-speaking/\">Natively Speaking</a>' by Sarah McSeveny-Årils (Scroll down for English version).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'<a href=\"https://availableonline.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/six-themes-from-europeana-tech/\">Six themes from Europeana Tech</a>' by Alastair Dunning.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://city-insights.com/blog/tech-creative-almost-meet-at-europeanatech-2015\">'Tech + Creative (almost) meet at Europeana Tech</a>' by City Insights.\_</p>"

        title: 'Europeana represents Cultural Heritage Institutions at EU roundtable on copyright'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana Foundation were invited to join a roundtable discussion on EU copyright reform hosted by MEP Oettinger on 19th February. The roundtable discussed the online access to knowledge and heritage through libraries, education, film, museums, and archives. Executive Director, Jill Cousins attended, representing the 3,337 individual museums, libraries, archives and audio visual institutions who contribute data to Europeana and the 1700 active Europeana Network members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the intervention presented by Europeana here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our position on copyright reform is endorsed by the associations who are members of the Europeana Foundation Board: ICOM Europe, EMA, EMF, NEMO, MICHAEL, EURBICA, IASA, CENL, LIBER, CERL, NAPLE, ACE, FIAT, Euroclio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shift from analogue to digital represents a dramatic change in how Cultural Heritage Institutions are preserving and providing access to their collections. This is an irreversible process and the public increasingly expects collections to be available online on platforms they use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural Heritage Institutions across Europe are digitising their collections so they can share them online. Much of this material was never formally published, so there is no infringement of others business models. Cultural Heritage Institutions need the legal space to do their work without always having to negotiate with copyright holders who are often impossible or prohibitively costly to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current copyright rules have not been made with this situation in mind and for this reason we would like to see reforms to copyright focussing on the following points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright rules need to provide more room, and greater certainty for Europe’s Cultural Heritage Institutions to make collections available online</li>\r\n    <li>Cultural Heritage Institutions should be allowed to make available online, for non-commercial use, those works from their collections that are no longer available via commercial channels, or are not otherwise actively managed by their rights holders</li>\r\n    <li>The exceptions benefitting Cultural Heritage Institutions ought to be fully harmonised and made mandatory across Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>This requires an update of the exceptions in the InfoSoc directive benefitting libraries, archives and museums:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The existing reproduction exception should be updated to allow for all acts of reproduction of works in the collections of beneficiary institutions as long as they are not for direct commercial advantage</li>\r\n    <li>The existing private consultation exception should be expanded to allow online access to those works in the collections of Cultural Heritage Institutions not anymore available via commercial channels, or that are not actively managed by their rights holders.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We believe that by limiting the ability to provide online access to works that are no longer in commercial circulation (including available for licensing via collecting societies) the activities of cultural heritage institutions enabled by an expanded exception would be complementary to those of creators, publishers and other rights holders. There is no interference by cultural heritage institutions in the primary exploitation of new works, which remain the exclusive prerogative of rights holders. Nor would remuneration of the rights holder be precluded consequent to publication.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>If a painting has any relevance, you can probably find a digital copy of it on the internet. In fact, you can probably find multiple copies of it in different sizes, resolutions and colour schemes. A <a href=\"https://www.google.nl/search?q=The+Massacre+of+the+Innocents+by+Giotto&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RqirVNOCB8asPZWEgNgL&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1233&amp;bih=619#tbm=isch&amp;q=Auvers+Town+Hall+in+1+Vincent+van+Gogh\">simple Google Image search</a> will show just how many different versions there are on the web of a particular art work. And here comes the problem - it is impossible to know which of the digital versions best represents the original.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To demonstrate just how difficult it it, museum expert and open culture advocate Sarah Stierch has started the Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome blog where she collects and showcases the wide variety of versions of an artwork that can be found online. The results are quite shocking. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.libdobrich.bg/files/digital/images/1537f.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 356px;\" /><sub>Dora Gabe. (18676-1845).&nbsp;Public Library - Dobrich. (CC0).</sub></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why are there so many different versions of one art work online? Mainly because these were not created and uploaded by the cultural institution holding the artwork, but by users that want to share images online. Often they do not have access to the digitised copy made by the cultural institution, if one even exists, and so they copy it from the Google Art Project, scan it from a book, or find it somewhere else on the internet. Some even take a picture with a cell phone when visiting the museum and edit it afterwards. With no better alternative available, these are the digital representations used to for example illustrate Wikipedia articles, websites about art history, or Pinterest boards - websites with millions of views each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inspiration to start the Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome came from Europeanas’ 2011 Whitepaper: the “Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid”. This discusses exactly the same problem,using Vermeer’s Milkmaid, which is part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum, as an example . Before the museum started to make their own high quality and true colour version of their paintings openly available, all kinds of different digital versions of this painting could be found across the web. It was painful for the museum to see the low quality versions being used everywhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After releasing a high quality true to life digital image of the Milkmaid, they found that people quickly started using this version for all kinds of purposes. As a result searching for Vermeer’s Milkmaid now will give you the version from the museum as a first hit. Because the museum itself publishes digital copies of their objects, it greatly helps the user to find and choose for the authenticated version. A pilot carried out by the National Archive (UK) for example established that users trusted the National Archive data over similar anonymous data 10 to 1. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome makes quite clear that where a cultural institution does not publish their digital collection, it can probably be found online anyway. In this scenario the institution has absolutely no control what the image looks like, the quality of the images shared, or which versions are being used. Stierch argues that the best way to counter this is not by hiding the collection, but for cultural heritage institutions to take control and publish open access high quality images of their collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a daily basis new entries are being added to the site and everybody is invited to submit examples of their own. Have fun!</p>"

        body: "<p>From 12 to 13 February 2015, the <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">Bibliothèque national de France</a> (BnF) turned into a lively space, a venue uniting people interested in all of the technical aspects of Europeana. The <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/events/europeana-tech-conference-2015/\">EuropeanaTech Conference</a>, organised by the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-foundation/introduction\">Europeana Foundation</a>, the BnF and many other helping hands, not only featured inspiring keynotes, but also provided an open space for fruitful and stimulating discussions. This was possible as the participants came from not only Europe, but from all over the world – even Australia, the US and Japan!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Master of Ceremonies – Bill Thompson at his best – opened the Tech Conference by introducing the first keynote speaker, Ruth Nicholls. She told the audience about the ‘97ers, a generation that does not differentiate between life online and offline. Afterwards, five ignite talks showcased various applications that make European Cultural heritage accessible online. The following two sessions highlighted the importance of data quality and open access. Participants then had the opportunity to visit many inspiring parallel sessions with Ruben Verborgh, Ted Fons, Paul Clough and Akihiko Takano (just to mention a few).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/dsc_0490.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max Kaiser moderates the session \"Open Data, Open Source\"; (CC-BY-SA eCreative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living in Europe means being surrounded by an enormous variety of languages. How does one deal with this blessing and not turn it into a curse? This was debated in the lively session on “Multilingualism”. In a parallel conference track there was a deep discussion about re-use: How to go about it and which tools are available to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first conference day ended with an inspiring Keynote from Dan Cohen, Andy Neale and Tim Sherratt in which re-use and online heritage platforms from all over the world were presented. This inspiring talk pointed out that sometimes working with digital heritage is not about perfection, but about the passion with which you engage your profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/dsc_0473.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Morley on Europeana Labs, outcome of the project Europeana Creative; (CC-BY-SA eCreative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter turned out to be a platform for parallel stimulating discussions during the day, with participants going into fascinating detail about certain aspects of the presentations online. Have a look for yourself at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/eurtech15\">#eurtech15</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day started with a presentation by <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> entitled “a playground for remixing and using cultural and scientific heritage”. One of the highlights of the day followed: Chris Welty’s talk on “Cognitive Computing”, which was peppered with pop art and enlightening quotes, gave us a glimpse into the future. Welty showed us where we are now, what will be possible in the future, and the next steps that have to be taken in order to get where we want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seb Chan knew that there is “No End in Sight” and proved that a digital pen is the only thing a visitor to a museum needs in order to explore an exhibition, showing us innovation and user-friendliness at its best. The last keynote to round up this year’s EuropeanaTech Conference was held by George Oates, a lively woman brimming with ideas about how to efficiently utilise what the digitised world has to offer. This was an excellent talk to end the day with and to send one highly motivated back to work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two days of EuropeanaTech offered the chance for creative industries, cultural heritage institutions and developers to discuss the needs and challenges they are facing, to align with each other and find common ground. Each of the parties involved was given the floor to show what they have already achieved and what their next steps will be. Showcases from Europeana and other related projects proved how past visions have become present reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who were not privileged to attend the meeting in Paris, the <a href=\"http://www.europeanatech2015.eu/\">conference website</a> will soon provide videos of all sessions. Stay tuned to see everything you might have missed!</p>"

        title: 'Making an historic discovery on Europeana 1914-1918'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>The following blog has been contributed by Jeff Nichols, doctoral candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Jeff Nichols, a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was browsing through\_<a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana1914-1918</a>,\_researching his dissertation. While watching Dutch news reels from the <a href=\"https://www.eyefilm.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">EYE Film Institute</a>, which came to Europeana via the <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">European Film Gateway</a>, he made an historic discovery. Amidst news of the ongoing conflict in Europe, he chanced upon previously unseen footage of the Eastland Disaster in Chicago, a seemingly unrelated event.\_He knew at once what an important find he had made, and shared it immediately with the <a href=\"http://www.eastlanddisaster.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Eastland Disaster Historical Society</a>. Here, Jeff tells us about the footage's significance for historians of the period, and why\_Europeana as a research tool was intrumental to the discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eastland-film-fragment-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 375px;\"><br>\r\nA still from<a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36913#prettyPhoto\" target=\"_blank\"> 'Latest World Cinema Posts'</a>, EYE Film Institute. Free access - rights reserved.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nI had first gone looking on Europeana1914-1918 for correspondence sent from Chicago to relatives in Europe. \_ I am in the process of writing a doctoral dissertation on war mobilization in Chicago. \_ \_Stuck on a particular chapter, I went through search results for films, as I am always on the lookout for footage of the city. \_ \_While I was sitting on the couch with my dog, I discovered lost footage of the aftermath of the deadliest disaster in the history of Chicago. \_\_<br><br>\r\nOn July 24, 1915, the SS Eastland had been chartered by the Western Electric Company to take employees and their families on an annual picnic across Lake Michigan. A set of design flaws had made the Eastland a top-heavy ship. In reaction to the Titanic disaster, recent federal laws had required passenger vessels to carry a complete set of lifeboats. The retrofitting of lifesaving devices, in all likelihood, put its passengers in grave danger. Still tied to the dock in the Chicago River, the packed ship full of happy families suddenly rolled over into water six meters deep. The current of the Chicago River is very slow, but hundreds of passengers were trapped in the submerged hull. \_ \_Despite the quick heroism of rescuers, a total of 844 passengers lost their lives that day. \_ \_<br><br>\r\nPerhaps unique among maritime disasters of such a large scale, the capsizing in the Eastland occurred in a crowded city center. Cameramen were on the banks of the river shooting recovery efforts within a relatively short space of time.\_Because a large number of still photographs taken by photojournalists and amateurs have survived, the sight of the Eastland was instantly recognizable. \_ \_I suspected that I might have stumbled on two lost films, as I had never seen footage of the Eastland before.\_I did not realize that there had been an extensive but futile search for footage of the disaster.\_One very promising lead in Indiana, as I have been told, turned out to be a reel whose frames had fused together as solidly as a block of cement. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Eastland-film-fragment-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 437px;\"><br>\r\nA still from '<a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36915#prettyPhoto\" target=\"_blank\">Latest World Cinema Posts</a>', EYE Film Institute. Free access - rights reserved.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>In hindsight, there is little mystery as to how footage of a ship disaster in Chicago ended up in a Dutch archive.\_Despite the endless suffering in Europe in the summer of 1915, the Eastland still made international news.\_ We know that films showing the Eastland were widely distributed—and periodically suppressed by movie censors—around the United States.\_Yet as the useless reel from Indiana demonstrates, it is remarkably easy for film stock from the period to degrade.\_The storage of large amounts of nitrate film was, due to its flammability, a liability. The large majority of reels showing the Eastland were probably purposefully destroyed not long after the summer of 1915. \_<br><br>\r\nThe footage found on Europeana1914-1918 came from the Jean Desmet Collection, held by EYE Institute Netherlands. \_ Desmet, an early film distributer and an inveterate packrat, saved over 900 reels of nitrate film. \_ As a large number of these films are unique copies, UNESCO has included the collection as part of its Memory of the World Register.\_Of course, I knew nothing about Desmet until after my find. Those looking for footage of the Eastland could not have been faulted for not sending enquiries to Dutch archives asking if they have film of a capsized ship in Chicago. Likewise, a film archive in Amsterdam cannot be blamed for not realizing that the descendants of the disaster and Chicago historians alike had been searching for this footage for years.<br><br>\r\nEuropeana1914-1918 made this find possible. EYE Institute Netherlands obviously put a great deal of painstaking work and resources into preserving, digitizing, and cataloguing the newsreels. But like the lion’s share of material on Europeana1914-1918, I seriously doubt that anyone would have found the films of the Eastland using Google. Europeana1914-1918 brings together an enormous collection of archival material from the war, whereas search engines like Google deposit anything and everything related to the search terms you use, possibly to the exclusion of thousands of artifacts that have been recently digitized. These letters, these photos, and these films should not be buried in archival vaults or submerged under thousands of web hits. They should be made available to all looking to understand the nature of a great tragedy. \_ \_\_ \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeff’s discovery understandably captured the attention of the world’s media, and was picked up by numerous news outlets \_such as <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-ship-footage-discovered-1915-disaster-killed-844/story?id=28918610\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/12/rare-footage-from-century-old-chicago-shipwreck-unearthed/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post</a>\_and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2947748/Footage-1915-Chicago-ship-disaster-killed-844-found.html\">Daily Mail</a> in the United Kingdom. In the video below, Jeff talks to CBS about the “Holy Cow” moment when he discovered the footage on the Europeana 1914-1918 website. \_\_ \_ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://screen.yahoo.com/film-reels-surface-chicagos-eastland-043900284.html?format=embed\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original footage of the disaster is available on Europeana 1914-1918\_<a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36915#prettyPhoto\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>and <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08614/cat36913#prettyPhoto\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\_</p>"

        title: 'Making a museum part of the internet: an interview with Seb Chan'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>From 11-13 February, the EuropeanaTech conference was held at the National Library of France in Paris. During the two days, Joris Pekel, Community Coordinator for Cultural Heritage, interviewed a number of speakers attending the conference to learn more about their work and their vision for the future of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>First in this series is keynote speaker Seb Chan, Director of Digital &amp; Emerging Technologies at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum. Seb led the team responsible for the digital transformation of the institution while it was closed for renovation and rebuilding. The Cooper Hewitt closed for a complete renovation in 2011, reopening to the public in December 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>Hi Seb, thanks for joining us. My first question: how are you doing and what is keeping you busy these days?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Hi, thanks for having me. So, we have just opened the Cooper Hewitt again which has taken up a large chunk of my last three years. My team and I have basically been working and thinking hard about how to make the museum a part of the internet. For this task, we were forced to ask ourselves the question, ‘What could a museum be, both online and offline, and how can the offline space be cognisant of the online space?’ So when I am a visitor in the museum, rather than denying the existence of the internet, actively encouraging a blending of both. Our challenge was to create a platform that facilitates this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/SebChanEurTech15.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><em>Seb Chan at EuropeanaTech. By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. (CC BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So the museum gave you a free pass to research and work on this idea of making it a part of the internet?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had a timeline of course. We had to open the museum in three years and we needed to come up with an idea of what the museum should be like and what is actually achievable. We worked with an amazing set of teams on this huge task. What we ended up doing is building an API for everything in the museum and then forcing other design firms to work with that. It has allowed them to focus on the interfaces while we were focussing on the structure. This has opened up a lot of doors and it is interesting to see how both they and the public have been using that API to do other things, in particular after they have seen what other people did with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, right now, everybody has access to everything in the collection?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, and not just the collection, but also everything that is on exhibition. So if we do an exhibition with material from outside of the Cooper Hewitt, those works also need to be made accessible through our API as well. This shifts the conversation from ‘having the stuff’, to ‘what can we actually do with it’; the same goes for the metadata. Institutions tend to put a lot of attention on what will happen to their data when they give it away, but the metadata by itself is only meaningful in a very limited way. What are you going to do with it is what is important. The metadata is the raw material, the unprocessed iron ore. This is not going to make the sword. It can be used to make the sword but it is not, in itself, valuable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that this is the challenge for aggregators, and also the challenge for museums that put their collections online and share their metadata. Metadata by themselves are not equivalent to ‘stories’, they are just raw stuff, and they are generally minimalistic and very boring. Therefore the interfaces we designed at Cooper Hewitt, online and in the galleries, are purposely playful and start from a position of: ‘okay, this is all the documentation we have, how much can we get from it?’ What can we do with it to make it more than just a database? Because, honestly, I don’t go to a museum to read a database. I think today there is still too much talk within institutions about getting their metadata right and I think, ‘well yes, but that is not the end goal. It is not the purpose of this.’ Just ‘a database’ is meaningless for visitors and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Would you argue that a cultural institution should publish everything they have and allow others to find a use for the data, or first think about its use case and prepare the data accordingly before publishing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think you do both. My view is you give it all away and you make your value as an institution in creating a space, both online and offline, that tells stories with a curated selection of that material. Those stories are for particular audiences and should be crafted to resonate with them in particular ways. Cultural heritage institutions are also there for preservation. So we need to say to the public that we have [their heritage kept safely] by giving the data [that we have about it] away. Institutions need to realise that they are more than just a warehouse. More and more museums, including ours, have effectively started giving away their warehouse inventory list. But what’s next? Let’s make the comparison with retail. When you ‘go shopping’, it is a social event. It is not just to ‘go and get the thing’, otherwise these days I would order it online. And even the online buying experience is slightly different now. If it is purely transactional, I’m going to be looking for just the lowest cost. But if you are a retailer that tries to do something more than [just offer] the lowest cost you make it into an ‘experience’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To continue on that theme, what do you think the core mission of a museum is, and do you think that the internet is changing that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, the core is keeping and presenting things that matter to a particular community for that community. These communities can be anything: national, regional, or a particular sub-interest group. And the internet is changing all of that. It gives you the ability to change what you collect. It gives you better insight into what you should collect and preserve, and it gives you new ways to present things. Museums are both preservation and presentation spaces and that applies both online and offline. The exhibition halls and buildings we have, they are there for a purpose. They are social spaces. Museums are not just a bunch of things on shelves, but, unfortunately I still feel that many museums think about presenting their data as putting things on shelves, and it should not be like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We haven’t come up with a better general interface than search for presenting vast collections, but we know that search is not the best way of doing things. It might be the best way if you know what you are looking for, but it is terrible for everything else. We need to find new ways to humanise those interfaces and that is what a lot of us in the sector are trying to figure out. The next phase is that these interfaces are now becoming present in our building and not just online, and that is a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/CooperHewittBuilding.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: ;\"><em>Cooper-Hewitt Museum. By <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ACooper-Hewitt-MattFlynnAHHP.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Flynn</a>\_via Wikimedia Commons. (Public Domain)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you feel cultural institutions should make their digital collection available?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, it is about them understanding what their role is, and that their role is not to be a warehouse. What you are basically asking for is their ‘warehouse data’. They should share that and get on working on running their shop front and channelling more people to that shop front.<br>\r\nThe first thing I did when I started a Cooper Hewitt was to give away the entire collection. The reason I did that was to quickly shift the conversation away from ‘this has to be perfect’ to ‘this does not matter’. Because once we gave it away everybody had to accept that it would never be perfect and what actually mattered is what you did with it. When you ask curators what the use of a catalogue is they will often say it is for research and for them to find out where things are to put things on exhibit. So what really matters is your research and what you put on exhibition. So let’s just you focus on that and aggregators will take and make the most of the other bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People need examples, people need to see it hasn’t hurt them, that it did not hurt other institutions and they need to see it from institutions that they respect and that are in their field. I think we currently see a massive paradigm shift, and more institutions see that opening up their data actually frees up the space to work on what they are all about and what they do best. Holding on to your warehouse data is not part of your role. It is to help people to preserve the past and make people understand their past and the future. What Europeana basically says to the institutions is, ‘hey we can help you make you get more out of your warehouse data, you just keep doing what you are good at.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So last question, how did you find EuropeanaTech?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been really good! I have heard of many interesting projects I wasn’t aware of, and spoken with a lot of great people. It is good to hear about how Europeana has changed over the years. I have been following Europeana since it started and it is interesting to see the different waves it went through and the different ways it has tried out different things. It feels like it has learned a lot from those experiences. I also think that there is still a long way to go. This work is never actually done. I think the climate has quite radically changed over the years. The consumer discussions have moved on from some of the objectives Europeana might have had in the past and that is a challenging thing, for everybody. Just as much for the content providers as it is for the aggregators. So this work will remain important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alright, I guess you need to go and give your keynote now. Good luck!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>At this year’s <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FutureEverything festival</a>, held on 26-27 February\_in Manchester, United Kingdom, 13 finalists for the annual Apps for Europe (Apps4EU) best open data startup award gathered together to make their final pitches at the second international business lounge. The finalists were drawn from the local business lounges which took place across Europe in 2014,\_and the annual\_Apps4EU\_online open data app competition.\_<br><br>\r\nThe shortlisted projects provided an international mix of applications using open data in transport, finance, environment protection, (open) data management, tourism and cultural heritage. One finalist was<a href=\"http://www.oimmei.com/europeana/europeana-beacon.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Europeana Beacon</a>, the winner of the Hack4Pisa event in October 2014. The app combines Europeana collections with the cutting edge technology of iBeacons, and\_helps tourists on their travels by letting them know\_when they pass an interesting landmark. It also offers comprehensive guides using\_pictures and videos. You can find out\_more about each of finalists <a href=\"http://apps4europe.eu/blog/finalists-100-words\" target=\"_blank\">on the Apps4EU site</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The international business lounge kicked off with a crowdfunding workshop organised by <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Nesta</a>, one of the Apps4EU project partners. The workshop explored how different crowdfunding models work, and how to successfully crowdfund a project or business. It shared insights from Nesta research and practical work on crowdfunding, from tips on selecting the right model and platform, to advice on how to set\_up a campaign and reach potential backers.\_<br><br>\r\nThe workshop also looked at <a href=\"http://www.bikecityguide.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike City Guide</a>, the winner of the Apps4EU\_Competition at FutureEverything 2014, as a case study. Bike City Guide crowdfunded an impressive €136,550 from 160 investors. After this success story, the workshop participants then split into groups to plan how they might crowdfund their business or app idea.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The business lounge programme continued with networking and presentation sessions on both days,\_during which each finalist could show festival-goers\_their app, website or presentation using the FutureEverything\_presentation stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/Apps4EU_Exploring_FutureEverything.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em>Exploring Apps4EU finalist\_apps. Image by FutureEverything\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/futureverything\" target=\"_blank\">@FuturEverything</a>\_and published with permission.</em><br><br>\r\nOn the second day, each of the finalists pitched their projects to an audience of international investors and experts, including Frank Kresin, Research Director at the <a href=\"http://waag.org/nl\" target=\"_blank\">Waag Society</a>; Sarah Thirtle, Head of Business Lending Programmes at <a href=\"http://www.creativeunited.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative United</a>; Julia Kloiber, Project Manager at the <a href=\"https://okfn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge Foundation</a>; Lee Tarrant, Chief Development Officer at <a href=\"http://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Catapult</a>, and Daniel Kofler, founder of last year’s Apps4EU winner, Bike City Guide.<br><br>\r\nThings drew to a close with an evening awards ceremony, held in conjunction\_with the Europeana Creative Design Challenge awards, at the Royal Northern College of Music. This marked the end of the business lounge,\_and was a chance to celebrate the hard work and achievements of both project partners and finalists.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.go-ov.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">GoOV</a>, an iOS app which enables people with mental disabilities or dementia to travel safely by public transport, was announced as the IBL winner 2015 and awarded a prize of 5,000 euros for further app development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations to the GoOV team, and good luck with all future developments!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Looking to the future with the DPLA: an interview with Dan Cohen'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>From 11-13 February, the EuropeanaTech conference was held at the National Library of France in Paris. During these two days, Joris Pekel, Europeana’s Community Coordinator for Cultural Heritage, interviewed a number of speakers attending the conference to learn more about their work and their vision for the future of digital cultural heritage. For the first in this series, he spoke to Seb Chan, Director of Digital &amp; Emerging Technologies at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, he talks to Dan Cohen, executive director of the\_<a href=\"http://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA), about the work that the organisation is doing, and the challenges and goals it shares with Europeana.\_<br><br><strong>Hi Dan, thanks for taking the time to sit down with me.</strong><br><br>\r\nHi, it’s my pleasure.<br><br><strong>So, my first question: how are things going with you and the DPLA?</strong><br><br>\r\nThings are going great. We are preparing for the second anniversary of the DPLA, which was launched in April 2013. It has been a very quick two years where a lot has happened. We have greatly expanded our network, we have greatly expanded the content that we have because of that network, and we have just published our strategic plan for the next three years. Here we talk about what we are going to do between now and 2017 to complete our national network in the United States and also to fill in some gaps that we have in the kinds of content that we offer. So, that way, we really do have a complete record of humanity that exists in collections in the US. So I think it is going extremely well, but we still have a lot of work to do.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/DanCohen2%5D.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>Dan Cohen at EuropeanaTech. By\_<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. (CC BY SA)</em><br><br><strong>What are the top priorities in this strategic plan?</strong><br><br>\r\nOur number one priority is to make sure that we have what we call a ‘service hub’ in every state. Service hubs are really our mini DPLAs and go out and bring online, and make available, content from the small and mid-size institutions that the DPLA headquarters cannot have a direct relationship with. It is really important for us that we have a way for every institution in the US to become part of the DPLA. Until we have a service hub up in every state, we can’t really achieve that. So that is really our top priority: expand our network.\_<br><br>\r\nBeyond that, we feel like we have some fields of interest that we think we can make a difference in. We are looking very hard, for example, at what more we can do with our newspapers and e-books. We have two million e-books in our collection right now. Most of them are public domain works but we also have a few hundred thousand books that are from the last century. We want to make the maximum amount of content available to the maximum amount of people so we are looking now into how we can open up more books.\_<br><br>\r\nThere are other areas as well that require some extra attention such as audiovisual content. Only half a percent of all our content is audio or video so we want to make a big push in that area. That might require us to alter our model a bit. We, for example, talked about setting up some hubs that specialise in video as this kind of content is, in general, more difficult to digitise and make available.\_<br><br>\r\nWe also have topical gaps. We really want to make sure we have a diverse collection and that means doing special outreach to collection holders that are currently underrepresented.\_<br><br>\r\nThe final priority that I should mention is obviously the sustainability of the DPLA. We want to be sustainable not only at the headquarters but also as a national network, so we are researching how that might come about. We are currently preparing the talks that we will have with different stakeholders about what might be involved to achieve this.\_<br><br><strong>Great! I would like to talk a bit more about the service hub model. It looks very much like the Europeana Aggregator model, but I guess there are differences as well.\_</strong><br><br>\r\nIt is a bit broader than just aggregation and I think the word service is a really big part of it. If you look at the application processes, we really do require our service hubs to provide a number of things. Aggregation is part of that but we are also talking about improving the metadata, helping out with the actual digitisation and passing along the information and expertise that we have all acquired while bringing together collections online in a robust fashion. There is a lot of professional networking that takes place as part of that.\_<br><br>\r\nFor example, DPLA’s headquarters is based in the Boston Public Library and they are also the home to the Massachusetts service hub which is called Digital Commonwealth. They literally go out in a car across the state and go to historic societies, or a small public library. They bring stuff back from that place and scan it in their scanning centre at the library. They then provide hosting and metadata enhancement services so there is a lot that is going on at the service hub’s level. For that reason, and this is where it might differ a bit from the Europeana aggregation model, we often have multiple institutions functioning together as one service hub. There might be the case that in a state there is an institution that has very strong technical expertise but may not have the social connection with the museums. Together, they are much stronger than if they would do it all alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/Boston_Public_Library_Reading_Room.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 431px;\"><br><em>Boston Public Library, where DPLA are based. By Brian Johnson via <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boston_Public_Library_Reading_Room.jpg#mediaviewer/File:Boston_Public_Library_Reading_Room.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. (Public Domain)</em><br><br><strong>This ties in with my next question. We have a wide variety of aggregators and we are currently exploring how we can improve the aggregation landscape. One of the things we are talking about is getting rid of the name ‘aggregator’ because, very often, they do much more than just that. Moving towards a similar model like the DPLA, where we work with a network of expert hubs, seems sensible as different hubs can have different roles. The DPLA model sounds like different institutions can go to different parts of the hub for different kinds of skills which is quite interesting. Can you tell a bit more about that?\_</strong><br><br>\r\nI think, in a very interesting way, we are meeting in the middle looking at our structure. I think what you are saying, about the need for different services and how different institutions can play different roles, is very important. On our end we are also thinking about setting up domain specific service hubs, for example to work on the audiovisual gap, like you have in Europe.\_<br><br>\r\nI think what is happening, for example, in New York state is great. Besides a large city, it is also a big state with many smaller cities. For that hub, we actually have nine different institutions all playing different roles. We have the Museum of Modern Art which is part of it and connects with dozens of other museums. Also, a library network is a part of it and connect hundreds of different libraries, and those are the institutions that we, as DPLA, could never have reached out to by ourselves. I think a lot what we do, what we both do, is to think about what the best matches are for different situations and feel out what those models might look like. We are so young still, that, in a sense, we are working on these models but we have now accumulated some expertise to take this further.\_<br><br>\r\nAnd what I love about working with Europeana is that we can trade stories, we can trade models, we can trade technologies etc. in order to get this done. Inevitably I think it is going to be a very heterogeneous environment that we end up with and I think we can learn a lot from each other.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>What is the incentive for an institution to become a service hub?\_</strong><br><br>\r\nThis is a big challenge. We have had some service hubs that were started with specific grants from funders. So we will continue going out and look for both public and private money that can support or launch the service hubs in specific states or regions. On the incentive side - I think we have been very lucky to have had such a successful launch and first phase so we now have people coming to us that want to become a service hub.\_<br><br>\r\nHaving said that, to actually complete the entire network across all states we will need to have some incentives, like for example small sub grants we can hand out. But we have to articulate better, and I think this will become really key for us in the long run: why it is useful for organisation to be a part of the DPLA and what they can get out of it?\_<br><br>\r\nOne of the big things we see is that we drive traffic to these places. When institutions have gone through a great expense of putting their collections online they want to see this material being used and accessed. So, being part of the DPLA has the basic incentive of the collection becoming more discoverable and more visible to more people. But there is much more to it than just that. It won’t just be about visibility, but also about gaining technical knowledge and being part of a network. So I think there will be a lot of components to that and we are in a sense setting that up right now.\_<br><br>\r\nAnother thing that institutions can benefit from is metadata normalisation and improvement with the use of Linked Open Data. When I go around in the United States there are a lot of institutions that want to be involved with linked data but do not really know how to start. So if we can provide that service or connection behind the scenes that means that it becomes easier for them to make that step.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/DanCohen1.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 533px;\"><br><em>Dan Cohen at EuropeanaTech. By\_<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. (CC BY SA)</em>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>We are nearly at the end of the conference. What is the main thing you picked up during the\_two days?\_</strong><br><br>\r\nI think what is great about this conference is that it brings together lots of different people with different backgrounds. We are trying to do that as well with our own <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/get-involved/dplafest/april-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">DPLAfest</a> that we are organising in April. I think having people from different domains is really valuable. For instance in the US I don’t think that museum folks often talk to library folks. We have separate conferences for both groups. Same goes for academic and public libraries. These things tend to be in separate areas but what I think is amazing about the digital realm is that it presents the opportunity to seamlessly bring together these kinds of content, users, and also software developers. I think that there are really interesting things going on in technology. We just heard, for example, someone from Google who is working on cognitive search. I think we can learn a lot from them. We tend to think we are from different domains and backgrounds, but really, we are all working towards a similar goal to get the material out there to the public in the best way possible. And that, at the end of the day, is what is really important.<br><br><strong>Right, and we keep doing that. Thanks a lot for taking the time to see us, and good luck with all your work.\_</strong><br><br>\r\nThanks, and stay in touch.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Extending the Europeana Data Model for richer descriptions of sounds materials'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>How can we best represent the particularities of sounds metadata using the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM)? How do we preserve the semantic of the metadata when they are mapped to EDM? These are two of the questions that members of the Europeana Sounds project and EuropeanaTech tried to solve in the report <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-task-forces/edm-profile-for-sound\" target=\"_blank\">EDM Profile for Sounds</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main task was to identify the characteristics of sounds objects and the metadata describing them, and translate these into specifications for EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/Maagdenhuisliederen%20Amsterdam%20Museum%20CC%20BY.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 422px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021608/dispatcher_aspx_action_search_database_ChoiceCollect_search_priref_68383.html\" target=\"_blank\">Maagdenhuis songs (EP)</a>. Amsterdam Museum (CC BY).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Describing Sounds objects using EDM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When using EDM, data providers are asked to describe two main types of resource: a Cultural Heritage Object (CHO), which is what results from a search in the portal <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana.eu</a>,\_and digital representations (or 'WebResources' in EDM terminology) of these CHOs.\_<br><br>\r\nThe first challenge for the Task Force was to identify what would classify as a\_CHO or a WebResource in the context of sounds materials.\_To do this, we began by distinguishing analogue objects from born-digital objects. In the context of EDM, both can be considered as potential CHOs, and\_associated with one or many digital representations or WebResources.\_We established the following distinction:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>An analogue object can be digitised and then represented by many WebResources varying in terms of formats, quality, etc.,\_</li>\r\n    <li>A born-digital object can also give rise be to many WebResources with individual characteristics.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We then differentiated the description of an analogue object from its digital representation(s). This included:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The distinction between a “bare” carrier (a disc, vinyl, shellac with physical characteristics like size) and the sound recording (a carrier with sound recorded on its tracks, with attributes like duration) itself,\_</li>\r\n    <li>The distinction between a musical work,\_the multiple performances of this work (an event, with attributes like a date or a place) and the recordings (physical),\_</li>\r\n    <li>The distinction between a specific recording and the sound itself (abstract, conceptual).\_</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/36827140&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe><br><em>Laughing Kookaburras. The British Library (CC BY SA).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further distinctions could be made if we then considered all the related resources feasibly associated with the objects mentioned above, such as images, music scores, programme notes and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making these distinctions is key from a semantic point of view as it will determine which EDM classes need to be chosen and where the metadata needs to be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/EDMDiagrams-5.2.2-4-page-001.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 187px;\"><br><em>EDM core classes for data providers. Valentine Charles, Europeana (CC BY SA)​.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Identify Sounds objects characteristics and their equivalent in EDM</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step was to identify the specificities of sounds objects metadata and to see if the needs could be met using EDM in its current definition.\_<br>\r\nEDM has been designed to be extensible, which means that, when declared EDM classes and properties do not sufficiently\_represent the knowledge in the metadata, the model allows specialisations.\_<br>\r\nIn most cases identified by the Task Force, extensions of EDM were needed to support more granular metadata. The extensions have been taken from existing open data models, namely EBUCore,the Music Ontology and Dublin Core. These new properties have been declared as specialisations of the existing ones. The main additions are listed below.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Distinction of the master version among the digital representations available for a CHO</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since EDM allows the description of several WebResources (or digital representations) per Cultural Heritage Object [http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-case-studies/mimo-edm], the Task Force identified the need todistinguish the master version from the others. We defined the master version as not necessarily the best quality version but the version that has a significance in the life of the object. For instance, the first recording of a concert might have more historical importance than the different mixes of the same recording made later. The properties needed to represent the described situation have been added to EDM.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Duration in sounds CHOs and WebResources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Duration is an important feature of sounds objects. EDM currently uses the general Dublin Core dcterms:extent property to qualify either the size or the duration of a resource. The Task Force defined the new property ebucore:duration as a subproperty of dcterms:extent to specifically capture duration information.\_\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Track information for sound CHOs and WebResources \_ \_ \_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Metadata descriptions for audio recordings and audio-related materials often contain information related to tracks that compose them. The Task Force recommended \_the use of more detailed properties in addition to the generic dcterms:extent or dc:description that would be used according to the current EDM schema. The new properties allow to capture the number of track, the track side and the track number.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other technical metadata \_ \_ \_ \_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force also selected a list of additional technical metadata which could be either provided by data providers in the data or fetched automatically by Europeana. These properties are very important when it comes to the re-use of media files by third parties. They capture information such as the MIME type, bit rate, file size, the audio encoding format. All the properties have been re-used from the EBUcore model.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Different types of dates for sound CHOs or WebResources;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The diversity of sounds objects identified by the Task Force raised the need of managing different types of dates in EDM. A lot of time can pass between the creation of a musical work, its recording, the digitisation of this recording and its publication. It is therefore important to capture all these different dates.\_<br>\r\nBy capturing different dates, different situations - during which access rights for an object have changed - could be represented. The Task Force has identified the following dates as relevant for the EDM profile:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Date of creation: It can be used to describe a date of composition (for a given work), or a date of recording (for a performance of a given work)\_</li>\r\n    <li>Date of publication</li>\r\n    <li>Date of digitisation</li>\r\n    <li>Date of copyright</li>\r\n    <li>Date of modification</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Hierarchical relationships and collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One characteristic of Sounds objects is also their complexity in terms of structure: a musical work is described in many movements, a recording distributed over many tracks. It is therefore important to be able to represent the hierarchical relationships between the different levels which make an object. This section of the discussion was entirely based on the work done by the Task Force on hierarchical objects[http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-task-forces/hierarchical-objects]. The group also spent time defining the notion of collection and how to represent it in EDM. This type of modelling is particularly relevant for the ethnographical recordings that will be provided to Europeana as lot of contextual information is described at the level of the collection and not on the recordings.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/Anges%20Public%20Domain%20BnF.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 445px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_2000081593733.html\" target=\"_blank\">Anges musiciens</a>.

National Library of France (Public Domain).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana gathers, in addition to Sounds objects, a great deal of related materials such a music scores, videos of performances, manuscripts, engravings, musical instruments, all of which have an important role in the contextualisation of the other objects. By bringing together and connecting these diverse objects, EDM now offers the chance to make Europeana a world of music.\_</p>"

        intro: "<p>From 11-13 February, the EuropeanaTech conference was held at the National Library of France in Paris. During these two days, Joris Pekel, Europeana’s Community Coordinator for Cultural Heritage, interviewed a number of speakers attending the conference to learn more about their work and their vision for the future of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>For the first in this series, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/making-a-museum-part-of-the-internet-an-interview-with-seb-chan\" target=\"_blank\">he spoke to Seb Chan</a>, Director of Digital &amp; Emerging Technologies at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/looking-to-the-future-with-the-dpla-an-interview-with-dan-cohen\" target=\"_blank\">and Dan Cohen</a>, executive director of the <a href=\"http://dp.la\">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA).\_<br><br>\r\nHere, he talks to George Oates who recently set up her own company <a href=\"http://goodformandspectacle.com\" target=\"_blank\">Good, Form &amp; Spectacle</a>. Previously, she worked at the <a href=\"http://archive.org\">Internet Archive</a> and was\_the founder\_of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/commons\">Flickr Commons</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hi George, thanks for joining us here in Paris.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How are you and what are you currently up to?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m well! I just moved to London a couple of months ago and started a new company. It is called Good, Form &amp; Spectacle and it is a tiny, tiny design studio. I am trying to take a bit of time to work on projects that I really want to work on instead of just leaping into the client zone. We have done a couple of experimental projects already and we’re starting to find some direction. What is important to mention is that I have put a flag in the sand saying I am super keen on cultural heritage and I’d like to bring my knowledge of design and software to the sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GeorgeOates.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>George Oates at Europeana Tech.\_By <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. (CC BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cool. So I guess most people, or at least I do, know you from the work you have done at Flickr and Flickr Commons. What was your role there, and what will you be doing at your new company?\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started at Flickr before it was Flickr and worked there as the lead designer from 2004-2008. In 2008, I created The Commons program, and had a fabulous year developing the program and nurturing the involvement of about 35 international institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, for the last 10 years, I have worked on trying to design user interfaces for giant globs of content, massive content repositories. Coming here to Paris and EuropeanaTech it feels like there is a lot of focus on moving data around the internet. This is very useful foundational work but I want to focus on how normal humans see content. And that is not only the people out there in the world, but also the staff of an institution. Everybody has to sort of suffer through these terrible search interfaces that are sort of illegible in some ways. When you think about an amazing cultural heritage collection and your first entry point is a search box that is just a tragedy. So I want to explore what kinds of interfaces, that we haven’t even thought of yet, that we can start using when we understand the content we are dealing with. Things like Google are good when you need to search everywhere for anything, but in our world, we know what sort of content we are looking at, so let’s pay a bit of attention to that content and design around it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Right, so for example, at Europeana we hit 40 million records last month which is a great achievement by our Network. At the same time, this is a massive number and it is very difficult for a normal user to navigate such an amount via a search box. How do you deal with that balance of saying ‘we want to make all of it available’ without running into problems where you overwhelm users.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I started Flickr Commons in 2008 the advice that I gave to the first participants was to keep their initial offerings really small. We worked with the Library of Congress in the first instance and Helena Zinkham, the chief of prints and photographs, chose two amazing collections to begin with which she knew were appealing to the public. The first upload was something like 500 images, which is easily consumable. You could literally sit down for an hour and look at all of them, which I think is great. More recently with the releases of the British Library and the Internet Archive, which made a splash of one million images each, that content is now dominating the view. If you do a search on Commons now, you see all of these illustrations and stuff from books. As much as I love that the content is being shared it also generates this issue that you mention.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/europeana-tech-2015-closing-plenary-38-1024.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>A slide from George Oates' <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/george08/europeana-tech-2015-closing-plenary?ref=https://goodformandspectacle.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/europeana-tech-2015-closing-plenary/\">Closing Plenary at EuropeanaTech 2015</a> showing <a href=\"http://va.goodformandspectacle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">V&amp;A Spelunker</a>. By George Oates.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So you have to come up with new ways to surface certain bits of content depending on who your user is, I guess?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I think it is dependent on the content. There is an opportunity to return to thinking about your own collection and how to see it online, in a different way to a list of ordered search results. We are getting fairly good at passing data around by now. You have accumulated 40 million records in how many years?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five years, but the majority in the last two.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right, that is great, but I would love to see the information and tech folks pause for a moment and try to make their information better and more accurate, and just think about it a bit. Look at the content again and think about how people are actually using it. Can you see that? And how do you see that? Meanwhile these giant aggregators are still being used and are useful for all kinds of things, but maybe it is time to come back to your own content again and really start helping people find stuff that they like. It’s done so, so well in the physical realm, but we’re not there yet online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I guess it comes back to the discussion I have had a lot this week. And that is the balance between the question of whether you publish whatever you can publish and let other people come up with ways of how to make the most out of that, or, do you publish more curated batches that suit your user needs? And, if so, who decides who your users are and what they need?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, right. So for example I have heard a few people talking about their projects saying that the thing that they are making is either for some researchers, or the general public. These are not user groups. That is a clear message to me that these people have no idea who uses their stuff. You have got to cross that bridge. You got to say ok, maybe I should actually talk to some of my researchers that use my content and sit with them as they use my search tool. Listen to them. Maybe internally we could also start working on figuring out ways to draw pictures of our catalogue that help us inform ourselves about it. I love it when, in a physical collection for example, an archivist makes a discovery in her own collection because she doesn’t know what’s in there. I wonder if we can sort of replicate that kind of feeling with software tools internally, so that people understand what content they actually have, and then can frame it better - and not rely on search so much.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I think this is very much in line with the direction Europeana is currently heading. By offering the data via the API, you can pull out the data that you want for your use case. But in order for a user or programmer to do this the data needs to be of a certain quality. Simply copying your internal database to the web is not going to do the trick. What kind of steps do you think an institution should make in order to do this in the right way?\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t know how to say this politely, but it is pretty rare that a cultural institution is on the cutting edge of tech things. The work that Seb Chan and his team have managed to do at the Cooper Hewitt is one of the first instances in the world where I think they have done it right. They have actually created an institution that has got digital feet on the ground.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of this work is about precedent. It is about finding somebody who is doing great work and emulating them. For me it all comes back to use, like we were talking about before. If you don’t know how your stuff is being used, or who is using it, or when it is used, you will remain in a black hole. Even if you put your stuff online. That is maybe where the front-end element and understanding the use of things can be handy. You could simply try to apply some of the techniques that designers use in order to understand the crowd that they are working with. So talking to people, finding out stuff, and of course measuring things.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So yes, precedent, and attempting to learn about design might be useful, but I am saying that because I am a designer! Engineers on the web today have huge communities of practice and Europeana is obviously trying to foster that so it is up to you, in your position, to speak about best practices, and share tools that you think are good. And again, it is not just about sharing all the tools, but rather pointing out that this particular one is the one I should use for my purpose. Also overviews like that need to be designed and edited. You need to give direction rather than just present a giant buffet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GeorgeOatesSebChan.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>George Oates with Seb Chan at Europeana Tech.</em><em>\_By\_<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. (CC BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think that institutions are becoming more open to this kind of direction? Because it is quite a mind-shift to make to be comfortable with the fact that you no longer control everything in your collection or how it will be used. \_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, absolutely. And certainly the rest of the world is far more open, though perhaps interestingly, some big companies like Netflix are actually closing down their public APIs apparently due to resourcing issues. I think it is important to keep reminding the institutions that they own the canonical copy while their records and content are in the wild. It’s not a read/write situation. It is not that you are opening up your actual vaults. You can treat it very lightly and experiment. Make an export of a selection of your database, which you know is interesting and has no copyright restrictions, and shove it on the internet. After that it is a matter of shouting really loud that that material is available to people, perhaps have an event at the institution, and see what happens.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think a lot of these fears can be treated in the way we treat normal human fears. You keep supporting and encouraging what they are doing. And I think that there is a lot you can do in your role as Europeana by saying ‘that is really awesome’ and sharing their efforts with the rest of the world.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Great. So you have attended EuropeanaTech... What is the main thing you will take home with you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was really excited to find out that the thoughts of some people outside of my field like researchers very much resonate with what I am currently thinking about. For example Aki [Akihiko Takano, National Institute of Informatics in Japan], who is working on associative search. I like the tone that is being set: a search box is not the best way to navigate this kind of content. And I am going to expand on that during my talk this afternoon. Search boxes are illegible. It doesn’t present you with any scale or direction of any kind. And that is what cultural heritage institutions are so good at. What they are best at is making people realise which painting or book or whatever they should look at. I am excited to hear that there is serious doubt in the power of search, or at least, its appropriateness as our default interface into cultural collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excellent. With that I would like conclude. Thanks for taking the time to talk to me and keep up the good work.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks, you too.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi! I am Max Kaiser (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxkaiser\" target=\"_blank\">@maxkaiser</a>) and I’m delighted to start this series of blog posts by members of the\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Members Council</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give a brief introduction to the Members Council, we are a group of 25 Councillors who were elected by the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network</a> at the end of 2014. The idea behind the creation of the Council was to give the Network a formal role and a strong voice in the newly created Europeana governance structure. In early 2015, we nominated a Management Board of six to oversee the work that we do and I am currently the Chair of this board. In this role, I represent the Network in any decisions made by the Europeana Foundation <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/executive-committee\" target=\"_blank\">Executive Committee</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/Members-Council-2015.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 383px;\"><br>\r\n<em>The Members\_Council meet in The Hague. Europeana. CC BY SA.</em><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me start with a few words about myself and what I do. I’m currently Head of Research and Development at the\_<a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian National Library</a> in Vienna. The Austrian National Library has one of the world’s most important historical collections of books, maps, images, manuscripts, papyri and other heritage material. During the last decade or so, we have been investing huge resources in digitising these fantastic collections and building hooks for everyone to access and work with this material. I am responsible for Austrian Books Online, a public-private partnership with Google where we are digitising 600,000 public domain books to make them available for everyone. You can find them in Europeana as well.\_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Austrian National Library has been involved with Europeana from the very beginning and we believe in it as a powerhouse for innovation in the cultural heritage sector in Europe. Currently, I am coordinating the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a> project, working with the creative industries on developing great new things by re-using the cultural resources available in Europeana. Re-use of cultural heritage is an important part <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s strategy</a> for the coming years and Europeana Creative offers an end-to-end process for cultural heritage institutions and creatives, from developing ideas together to crowdfunding and financial investment. This has been carried out, for example, with the development of <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a>, a highly engaging and playful app which encourages you to interact with cultural heritage by recreating paintings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of this work, I am excited about Europeana’s move towards becoming a platform where people can build on, and create with, the collections they find. With its network of more than 2,000 institutions that have heritage to share, Europeana is in a unique position, and by moving towards becoming a platform, this unique position will be strengthened even further.\_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of this move will need a shift in how we provide access to Europe’s cultural heritage. We’d like to complement the protected gardens we already enjoy with a greater number of open playgrounds fertile for re-use. Several leading institutions like the Rijksmuseum, with its <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksstudio</a>, or the British Library with <a href=\"http://labs.bl.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">British Library Labs</a>, have paved the way and demonstrated what can be achieved by opening up collections, and we hope many more institutions will choose to follow. Here, the Europeana Network can play a crucial role by highlighting possible benefits, and leading by example. Advocating opening up Europe’s cultural heritage collections as much as we can will be an important priority in my personal agenda for 2015.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/VanGoYourself.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 387px;\"><br>\r\n<em>A recent\_<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/the-lute-player-frans-hals-1582-1666-vangod-by-nick-grimshaw-2/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself by Nick Grimshaw</a>. VanGoYourself. CC BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nI’d also like to let you know about our activities in the Members Council so far and our plans for the immediate future. In February, we had our first Council meeting in the Europeana offices in The Hague. As the Council is new, and we all are new to our roles, we had a number of things to plan, namely how we should work together with the Network and what our next steps should be.\_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Europeana Network is established as an Association under Dutch Law. Currently, we are defining the Bylaws to our statutes which will govern our work. They involve, for example, creating criteria for membership to the Network or the rules for our elections. Our guiding principle as we establish these Bylaws is to ensure decision-making is always transparent and effective, and that the diversity of the Network is represented at every opportunity. We expect to finish work on these in early spring and will keep you posted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are also busily planning our next Annual General Meeting which will take place in Amsterdam in autumn. The AGM is the key event for Europeana and the Network and provides everyone with an opportunity to share experiences, discuss and develop ideas and make recommendations for the future of Europeana. We will announce both the date and location very soon, so watch this space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have probably already seen that the Europeana Professional Website has been given a major makeover. We will use Europeana Pro as the main communication tool for the Network. Here you find our blog and our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\">newsletters</a>; we will soon add information about each councillor, our new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/task-forces\" target=\"_blank\">Network Task Forces</a> and our Working Groups. The new Europeana Pro is still an initial version that we want to improve, so please <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-professional-gets-a-makeover\" target=\"_blank\">let us know what you think</a>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year will be of huge importance for Europeana. It will be the first year of the implementation of Europeana’s <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2015-2020</a>. It will see the transition from the previous Europeana funding structure, and Europena will now be funded as a Digital Service Infrastructure under a new financial instrument of the EU, the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility\" target=\"_blank\">Connecting Europe Facility</a>.\_<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most important role for the Europeana Network is to act as a catalyst. On the one hand, it provides Europeana with buy-in by its constituencies: Europe’s cultural heritage institutions and the creative sector. On the other hand, the Network can deliver strong returns to its members for their valued investments. Together we can make a difference and realise Europeana’s dynamic vision to ‘transform the world with culture’.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me know your thoughts!<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxkaiser\" target=\"_blank\">@maxkaiser</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>In celebration of\_World Theatre Day, which takes place every year in March, the National Audiovisual Institute of Poland (NInA) has launched with a new storytelling platform dedicated to the Academy of Movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/NiNA%20Screenshot%201.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 301px;\"><br><em>A screenshot of the <a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl/\">Akademia Ruchu</a>. By <a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">NInA</a>.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Back then, the word ‘movement’ was used in reference to the alternative culture that was born and blossomed as part of the cultural movements on university campuses. And the theater that grew out of that student movement was a voice of its generation. It was a strong determining factor for everyone who entered that space, because that theater had to express very important, relevant truths: the truths of its social circles and the truths of that generation”. (W. Krukowski, “The Academy of Movement”)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making a documentary countless hours of B-roll footage, images, and narrations hit the cutting room floor. However, over the last half decade, with advancements in online interactive storytelling software, documentaries have been given newfound life. Producers can now enhance final cuts in unique ways so that viewers can dive deeper into source content or explore secondary material which makes the viewing experience that much richer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For anyone looking to give previously produced documentaries a second life, or enrich the ones they are currently creating, Europeana provides a valuable resource of digitised archival material. We are proud to present a sparkling example of such re-use: Akademia Ruchu.\_<br><br>\r\nThe starting points for the storytelling platform dedicated to the <a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl\" target=\"_blank\">Academy of Movement</a> were a documentary film by Andrew Sapija, sharing the same title, and <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/vidlinks-second-layer-your-archives-showcase\" target=\"_blank\">VidLink</a>, an interactive storytelling platform developed by <a href=\"http://videodock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Videodock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>. Curatorial work, translations and content sourcing was carried out by the<a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/nina\" target=\"_blank\"> National Audiovisual Institute of Poland</a> as part of the Europeana Awareness project. The entire collaboration was overseen by Sound and Vision.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Michal Merczyński, the director of NInA, reflects on the project, “The digital narrative around the Academy of Movement combines both NInA’s competencies and interests. The online world is our natural environment, and documentary film, recording and disseminating the most important events in Polish culture - and this includes the actions of the Academy of Movement - have been included in the programme of the Institute for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am glad that this is once again a project with a European dimension, which we realised jointly with the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision - a recognised leader in innovation and research with regard to web projects. I hope that the result of our collaboration will reach a wide range of culture and digital storytelling fans.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/NiNA%20Screenshot2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 332px;\"><br><em>A screenshot of the <a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">Akademia Ruchu</a>. By\_<a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">NInA</a>.\_</em><br><br><br>\r\nFilmed in 2006, the documentary was an attempt to capture the Academy of Movement’s thirty years of creative work. The film features archival footage, shots of performances, and commentary from members of the group. Wojciech Krukowski leads us through each stage of the Academy’s work and presents key historical events in Poland inextricably tied to the story of the group. Krukowski was an artist, a founding father of the academy, and a mentor to several generations of artists, while also serving as the director of the Centre for Contemporary Art in Warsaw.<br><br>\r\nWojciech Krukowski died in 2011 and though The Academy of Movement still exists today, and continues to rehearse and perform, a chapter of their work has permanently finished. Yet by leaving behind remnants of their ideas, sketches, and scripts, Krukowski left an archive of knowledge that would live on and provide a wealth of inspiration for new performers, encouraging them to explore art themselves.\_<br><br>\r\nAs an art group that reaches beyond the boundaries of alternative theater by combining theater, performance, and visual arts, viewers are unable to remain indifferent to the world presented to them. Startled out of neutrality, they are\_forced to assume an intellectually active role. The screening of Andrzej Sapija’s film <em>Academy of Movement</em> on the storytelling platform is intended to provoke and spark a similar reaction in viewers, forcing them to become involved,\_if only by moving their cursor from object to object. It encourages the audience to continue their exploration, and to uncover the world of the Academy of Movement through excerpts from performances.<br><br>\r\nThe call to action the supplementary material provides complements Krukowski’s own ideas about audience participation. “Immobility”, he once said, considering an audience entranced by a performance of the play, <em>Bus</em>, “leads to a certain physiological crisis”.<br><br>\r\nEnhancing the film with these archival materials serves, finally,\_as an attempt to respond to a real need felt by every viewer: the desire to expand their knowledge. When we watch a documentary, we feel the urge to learn more, to satisfy our curiosity about a performance mentioned, or to catch a glimpse of what the particular artists who appear do in their wider professional lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, the film includes a compilation of twenty additional\_pieces of archival footage, recordings and excerpts of performances\_and photographs, each of which\_provide that context for the virtual viewer. Not only does this\_encourage and enable\_individual exploration but,\_more importantly, it ensures\_an audiovisual experience entirely\_enriched by the use of these valuable archival materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>You can watch the final documentary <a href=\"http://akademiaruchu.nina.gov.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></p>"

        title: 'Discussion about copyright reform kicks off in the European Parliament'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On the 19 January Pirate Party MEP Julia Reda presented her <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+COMPARL+PE-546.580+02+DOC+PDF+V0//EN\" target=\"_blank\">draft of an European Parliament initiative report on the evaluation of the EU copyright directive</a>. The copyright directive, which dates from 2001, provides the fundamental rules for the copyright laws of all EU member states. It is at the heart of the discussion about a modernisation of the European Copyright rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This blog updates you on the latest areas of the discussion that affect cultural heritage institutions, both in Reda’s report and the proposed amendments to it.<br><br>\r\nWhile the European Commission has been discussing a review of the EU copyright rules since 2013, the EU parliament has been relatively silent on this issue until this year. MEP Reda's draft report contains 24 suggestions for updating elements of the copyright framework. The publication of the draft report has generated a fair amount of discussion (helpfully documented by Julia Reda on <a href=\"https://juliareda.eu/2015/01/reactions-to-my-copyright-report/\" target=\"_blank\">her own website</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the draft report will be handled in the Legal Affairs (JURI) committee of the European Parliament, other relevant committees (such as Culture and Education (CULT) and Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO)) have been asked for their input through so called opinions. The draft opinions were published in February (CULT opinion by MEP Adolphine <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;reference=PE-544.403&amp;format=PDF&amp;language=EN&amp;secondRef=01\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, IMCO opinion by MEP Stihler <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;reference=PE-549.108&amp;format=PDF&amp;language=EN&amp;secondRef=01\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). As part of the parliamentary proceedings other Members of Parliament can propose amendments to these drafts which will then be considered by the respective committees and finally adopted or rejected through a majority vote system. The final opinions will be sent to the lead committee (JURI) who in their turn will decide whether to adopt or reject these amendments in their final report, also via a majority vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last weeks the lists of amendments to<a href=\"http://page42.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/copyright_evaluation_report-amendments.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> the original report</a> as well as to the opinions by the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;reference=PE-549.431&amp;format=PDF&amp;language=EN&amp;secondRef=02\" target=\"_blank\">CULT </a>and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europarl.europa.eu%2Fsides%2FgetDoc.do%3Ftype%3DCOMPARL%26reference%3DPE-549.401%26format%3DPDF%26language%3DEN%26secondRef%3D01&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7YCicamqGPbC3EEULWkJlUPotbw\" target=\"_blank\">IMCO</a> committees have become available on the website of the European Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lists of proposed amendments allow us to get a first idea on where different Members of Parliament stand when it comes to modernising the copyright rules that affect cultural heritage Institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia Reda's draft report contained one point that is directly relevant for cultural heritage institutions. In point 20 she called for:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>… the adoption of a mandatory exception allowing libraries to lend books to the public in digital formats, irrespective of the place of access;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand the issue of providing online access to out of commerce works in the collection of heritage institutions (which is central to Europeana's position on copyright reform) was notably absent from Reda's draft report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Online access</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the (more than 650!) amendments that have been proposed in all three committees we are happy to report that this absence has been noted by various MEPs who have submitted amendments that aim to put this issue on the agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In JURI, <a href=\"http://www.marietjeschaake.eu\" target=\"_blank\">MEP Schaake</a> is suggesting 2 amendments that would introduce a consideration and a new call to action to MEP Reda's report. Schaake proposes to make an explicit reference to the fact that both the Commission and the many Member states have policies aimed at increasing online access to cultural heritage that are hampered by the existing copyright rules:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>[AM 69]</strong> Whereas the European Commission and the Member States are making considerable investments in the digitization and online accessibility of the rich collections of Europe's cultural heritage institutions, so that citizens can enjoy access from everywhere on any device;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This consideration is followed up with a call for expanding the existing exceptions that apply to cultural heritage institutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>[AM 348]</strong> Calls for expanding mandatory exceptions beneficial for public interest institutions, such as libraries, museums and archives, which play a central role in facilitating online access to cultural heritage, and access to information that allows them to make protected works in their collections, that are not in commercial circulation anymore, or otherwise actively managed by their rights holders, available for online access by the public;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last point is echoed by amendments to the IMCO and CULT draft opinions in which MEPs <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/4545/CATHERINE_STIHLER_home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Stihler</a> (IMCO AM 68) and <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28240/HELGA_TRUPEL_home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trüpel</a> (CULT AM 72) urge the Commission and Member States to ...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>... provide for an updated exception that allows libraries, archives and museums to make protected works in their collections, that are no more in commercial circulation or otherwise actively managed by their right holders, available for online access by the public;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having this issue added to the report via the above amendments would be an important first step in ensuring that they stay on the table in the upcoming discussions about the copyright reform proposal. A copyright reform proposal that does not address the problems faced by cultural heritage institutions that attempt to provide online access to their collections would be a huge missed opportunity and would constitute a considerable setback for Europe's ambition to allow citizens to access their culture heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hello! I am happy to take this opportunity to share my activities for the Association over the last few months and my ambitions for the period to come.<br><br>\r\nAt the moment, my main activity relates to the fact that I have a job to finish. Some two years ago I asked some general questions about the governance structure of Europeana during a Board Meeting of the Foundation. By chance, the new Europeana business plan required revisiting the governance structure, and sometimes you get exactly what you deserve: the Board promptly made me the chair of a Taskforce to review the Governance structure.\_<br><br>\r\nThe new Association, as it is regarded under Dutch law, and its legal foundation were the results of this Taskforce. Statutes under Dutch law are a rather commonplace, but expanding them to be fit for purpose for a large and international audience is quite an exercise. \_As Max mentioned, in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-max-kaiser\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s blog</a>, this is exactly what several Members Councillors\_are currently working on.<br><br>\r\nThree workshops, led by Management Board Members, are currently working on these bylaws. One deals with issues related to Membership, a second considers voting and election procedures and the last one, which is led by me, addresses all the other elements which need finely-tuned explanations and procedures.\_<br><br>\r\nThe work is very collaborative, and we hope that by the end of March the workshop leaders can present the finished draft versions to the Management Board. \_After approval of these draft bylaws, the other Member Council Members will then have the opportunity to provide feedback, before they go out to the full Europeana Network. \_Only once everybody feels satisfied that we have developed a good working document, these By-laws will become the basis for the future operation of the Associations. And my job is done!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/schoolroom.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 674px;\"><br><em>Schoolmaster with three students at a table.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_OB_12_672.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana for Education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what next? Well, after that I can than pursue my real passion: education! My professional life revolves around my position as founder and special Advisor to <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">EUROCLIO</a>, the European Association of History Educators. I believe in high quality education and consider that digitalisation and internationalisation are key elements for educational innovation. More and more I become convinced that Europeana is vital in this process as the European digital platform for rich and diverse culture and heritage.\_<br><br>\r\nI would like to use my position as Management Board Member to participate in discussions with the European Education Community about the opportunities and challenges of Europeana collection for stimulating educational innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent months I have helped design Europeana for Education policy recommendations, which will be finalised and published soon. I also participated as table leader for Education during ‘Europeana for Education and Creative Industry’ strategy meeting in Riga last week, on 17 and 18 March, where we were able to draw up the Recommendations for Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/JokeandJill_1000x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>Joke (right)\_in Riga with Europeana's Jill Cousins. By Europeana,\_CC BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have already met with representatives of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Science and Culture about the position of Europeana in their policy focus on Digital Heritage during the Dutch European Union Presidency in 2016. \_Wherever I can, I will advocate for the need for reliable, accessible, cross-border and quality resources, reflecting Europe's diversity in all aspects of education. It is one of my major goals to make Europeana’s collections better known among a wide range of education stakeholders.<br><br>\r\nThat's all for now, but if you have any thoughts about the above, I’d be delighted to hear them! Please don’t hesitate to get in touch.\_<br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joke_leeuw\" target=\"_blank\">@joke_leeuw</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        body: "<p>It’s been 24 months since Europeana Creative kicked off in Vienna in January 2013. Time for an update to inform you about what we have already achieved. We are now in the final stretch of the project, the part where it all comes to a conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beautifully designed Public Annual Report can be found <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Creative/Deliverables/eCreative_Public_Report_Y2_v1.0.pdf\">here</a>, and here achievements of year 2 shall be highlighted:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>The online laboratory space <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> was launched in April 2014 as beta release and counts already more than 16,000 unique users and 2,000 registered API keys. Have a look at this website full of information and exciting tools <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">here</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>Our technical Work Package which has ended with year 2, implemented the Media File Checker successfully into Europeana. Services were especially developed supporting e.g. Design Pilot with the Image Similarity Service, the Tourism Pilot with an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-twinning/\">Image Twinning WordPress plugin</a> and the Social Networks Pilot with services for geo-referencing. Thanks for all your effort!</li>\r\n    <li>Our project partners developed great ideas – how to use them successfully? Facilitated business models were documented in four White Papers, covering the themes off the Pilots developed so far (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Creative/WP3%20-%20Business%20Model%20Frameworks/eCreative_WP3_White_Paper_Business_Models_Education_v1.0.pdf\">education</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Creative/WP3%20-%20Business%20Model%20Frameworks/eCreative_WP3_White_Paper_Business_Models_Social_Networks_v1.0.pdf\">social networks</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Creative/WP3%20-%20Business%20Model%20Frameworks/eCreative_WP3_White_Paper_Business_Models_Tourism_v1.0.pdf\">tourism</a>). Additional, an Image Embedding Service is currently developed, which will allow users to embed high quality pictures from Europeana on the web.</li>\r\n    <li>Within the second year of Europeana Creative, four Pilots have been delivered:<br />\r\n    1) The History Education Pilot, led by Euroclio, was finalised in September 2014. History educators now can create their own <a href=\"http://la.historiana.eu/la/\">learning activities</a> online via the Historiana platform and by using content from Europeana. <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">Click here</a> to make a trip back in time.<br />\r\n    2) The Natural History Education Pilot, led by NMP, was finalised in August 2014. Not only one prototype, but two were delivered: The museum game “<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/secretlegacy/\">Secret Legacy</a>” is a serious adventure game, taking users on a treasure hunt. And the memory game “<a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/memory-match/\">Memory Match</a>” allows children and young adults to create memory sets of objects using content from Europeana.<br />\r\n    3) The Tourism Pilot “<a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a>” led by PLURIO.NET is already a BBC darling! The concept is easy and playful: Re-enact a painting or image, upload it on the website and share the new image with the twinned original via social media. Try it out here, it’s great fun!<br />\r\n    4) Did you every wonder, how a sparrow sounds like? The Social Networks Pilot “<a href=\"http://www.historypin.org/en/explore/sound-connections\">Sound Connections</a>” led by NISV is a flexible tool for communities of interest to enrich specific sets of sounds in different ways on the themes of aviation, city soundscapes (London and Amsterdam) and birdlife. Find out how to geo-tag these sound files.<br />\r\n    5) The Design Pilot prototype is called “<a href=\"http://www.culturecam.eu/\">Culture Cam</a>”. AALTO leads this collaboration between AALTO, SAT, AIT and Europeana. Take a picture of a shape or pattern and this application shows you objects in Europeana similar in shape, colour or pattern. You don’t believe it? See for yourself!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog Posts/vgy.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<p><em>Europeana Creative Team testing ‘VanGoYourself’ in Barcelona, September 2014 (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>What a Challenge we had to face within year 2….. To be precise, we even organised two of them! For each of the five Pilot themes of the project, an Open Innovation Challenge was organised and promoted. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-creative/europeana-creative-blog/and-the-challenges-winners-are\">first Challenge Event</a> for the Natural History Education and History Education domain was held on April 29 in Brussels. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-creative/europeana-creative-blog/and-the-2nd-challenge-winners-are-timepatch-and-buitenplaats-mob\">second Challenge Event</a> for the Social Networks and Tourism domain took place in Barcelona on September 23, 2014. The incubation support offer pack was delivered to all winners of the Challenges, covering assistance with business modelling, business planning, business strategy, user piloting and technical implementation.</li>\r\n    <li>Europeana Creative does not only work, we also evaluate. UX testing on the Pilots had taken place as well as evaluation of the first and second Challenge. Lessons learned are fed back to improve all development processes in the project.</li>\r\n    <li>In terms of dissemination a detailed promotion plan was elaborated to cover all aspects of the project to be promoted. Dissemination activities have been accompanied by five videos produced by labkultur.tv for each Pilot theme: <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/87498223\">Natural History Education</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/87498222\">History Education</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/101601795\">Tourism</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/103115798\">Social Networks</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/115183559\">Design</a>. If you are interested in being updated constantly, join our more than 1850 Twitter Followers or +750 facebook likes.</li>\r\n    <li>Since February 2015, we officially have a new partner: Ramululs Ltd. is now official member of Europeana Creative. Memoranda of Understanding have been signed with the Project <a href=\"http://www.preforma-project.eu/\">PREFORMA</a> and <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\">Europeana Food and Drink</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, much work has already been done, our remaining tasks will be fulfilled by the end of the project. One of the big and exciting challenges to come is the Final Conference of Europeana Creative. More information will follow soon!</p>"

        title: 'Reach cultural tourists through Europeana in Google’s Field Trip app'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Now, tourists from around the world can use Field Trip to view and learn about archaeological sites, historical buildings and monuments in Poland, Estonia and Sweden.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana, Google's Niantic Labs and selected memory institutions have successfully completed a pilot project to integrate curated cultural content in <a href=\"http://www.fieldtripper.com\">Google’s Field Trip app</a>. Now, tourists from around the world can use Field Trip to view and learn about archaeological sites, historical buildings and monuments in Poland, Estonia and Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GFT_New_1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 416px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google’s Field Trip app (GFT) is a mobile app developed by Google’s Niantic Labs for iPhone, Android mobile devices and Google Glass. It has registered over 1 million downloads so far and is available in more than 30 languages. The app recognises where people are and allows them to explore and discover more about their surroundings, from local history to the best places to shop, eat and have fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When installing the app, people select the feeds they want, such as history, architecture, lifestyle, etc. and can explore all publishers and their content within a feed. In real life, when people walk next to an object or place of interest that matches\_their feed preference, a card with more information pops up automatically on their device. For the best experience, the users can choose the frequency of the app notifications and share their discoveries with their friends via e-mail and social networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GFT_New_2.png\" style=\"width: 290px; height: 500px;\">\_<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GFT_New_4.png\" style=\"width: 281px; height: 500px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Field Trip app has a tightly curated list of more than 200 publishers, ranging from Mimoa to Open Buildings showcasing architecture, Spotted by Locals for the best kept secrets, TimeOut and Thrillist for best places to eat and drink, and, now, Europeana partners for local historical gems.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot project kicked off last year in line with Europeana’s strategy to enable and promote the creative re-use of cultural content in the tourism sector. Europeana identified potential project content partners, worked closely with them on the curation and enrichment of their collections and facilitated the data integration in Google’s Field Trip by supplying a Europeana API-enabled content feed. The participating providers are extensively branded on the individual object card though their logo, a short profile and links to their website.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content sourcing project phase highlighted the strong need for open and fit for purpose data. A dataset is suitable for publishing in the GFT app via Europeana\_if it meets the following requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Tourism-relevant theme: objects related to architecture (historical buildings, monuments), unique urban and nature landscapes, archaeological sites\_</li>\r\n    <li>High-quality image(s) – \_a minimum of 0.5-1 megapixel when 1 megapixel = 1.048.576 pixels (image width x height)</li>\r\n    <li>Narrative object description –interesting facts about the place or object should be presented in a story-telling style. This description can be in either the local language or in English.</li>\r\n    <li>Exact geo-coordinates (longitude + latitude)</li>\r\n    <li>Freely Reusable content \_(Public Domain or CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The project prioritises quality over quantity; hence, the metadata quality (and not the collection size) has been the main criteria in the project partner selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/GFT-screenshots.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 329px;\"><br><em>Taster\_of partners'\_datasets in Google's Field Trip</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three Europeana partners - the Swedish National Heritage Board, the National Heritage Board of Estonia and the National Heritage Board of Poland - joined the pilot to share their curated and enriched collections. Their datasets are now available in the app history feed and guide tourists to beautiful and prominent historical buildings and monuments in Estonia, Poland and Sweden.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot project with Google’s Niantic Labs marks a successful entry in the tourism market and is the first step in building solid and productive relationships between cultural institutions and the digital tourism industry. Having their collections available on the Google’s Field Trip app will allow memory institutions to have greater visibility, wider outreach and deeper engagement with their audiences.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This pilot has set up the legal and technical framework to support a long-term re-use partnership. If you are a data provider and have a collection which meets some or all of the listed requirements and are willing to work with us on its curation and enrichment, reach out to Europeana to join this project. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

How about finding out what we’re doing to improve our data enrichment strategy? If so, read on to find out about the Task Forces we’re running on these topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/beach.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055617033.html\">A Deauville : danseuses sur la plage. French National Library, Public Domain</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Task Forces are an important part of the way the Europeana Network operates and will become ever more so as the new Network Association develops. In a Task Force, experts get together to address issues that affect Europeana and its strategy. Task Force recommendations can be incorporated into the following year’s business plan, giving the Network a direct say in Europeana’s future direction. We also hope that they contribute to the broader digital heritage sector as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to get involved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>‘Creating local Europeana networks for collaboration and sharing information’ </strong>Task Force has just been launched. Please <a href=\"mailto:hans.vanderlinden@cjsm.vlaanderen.be\">email Hans van der Linden</a>\_(Flemish Government. Cultural Department / Europeana Vlaanderen Overlegplatform) if you would like to participate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The<strong> ‘Europeana Network Communicators’ Group Task Force’</strong>, led by Kerstin Herlt (ACE) and Eleanor Kenny (Europeana), will make recommendations to develop a sustainable Communicators’ Group which aims to support awareness of Europeana across the Network and to help address the issue of multilingualism. <a href=\"mailto:eleanor.kenny@europeana.eu\">Send Eleanor</a>\_a message to find out more about the work of this TF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘Enrichments and Evaluation’</strong> - this Task Force is collecting and evaluating data enrichment processes, including crowdsourcing, with the aim of helping projects to enhance their enrichment services. Find out more by <a href=\"mailto:Antoine.Isaac@europeana.eu\">emailing Antoine</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have Task Forces running that look at<strong> creating business opportunities within the world of fashion archives, using Europeana in education and exploring licensing</strong> and <strong>technical standards for content re-use</strong>.</p>"

        title: 'Flexibility for the future: Europeana software now hosted by cloud infrastructure'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Imagine a software engineer spending all his time writing software code. Sounds natural, right? Well, over the last few years, this has become pretty far from the reality of the software industry for most engineers. Particularly in small and medium software companies, they routinely do a whole load of tasks not mentioned in their job descriptions: installing and upgrading software, managing pieces of IT infrastructure, increasing and decreasing storage space and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This state of affairs is the result of deeply-rooted trends in the technology world. Large-scale monolithic software systems developed by organic teams continuously move towards mash-ups, built up out of reusable components. In-house development of new products and features often gives way to integration of third\_party services and tools. Businesses engage more in outsourcing, subcontracting and other forms of work carried out with remote teams and service providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluctuating demand is another source for this operational flexibility: a marketing campaign leading to a thousand-fold increase in web traffic can require a substantial overhaul of the system. A piece of software perfectly capable of serving thousands users a day can crash under the load of millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The notorious ‘<em>devops’</em> euphemism conceals a grim new reality: software developers (<em>dev</em>) are increasingly expected to work as software operators (<em>ops</em>). Their attitudes differ: some fret, with good reason, that they were hired to write code and not format disks. Effectiveness suffers because specialisation, the hallmark of knowledge economy, is compromised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/BallonRedSky.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 380px;\"><br><em>A hot-air balloon flies over a park. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006129176.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Wellcome Library</a> CC BY.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is hope. Along with many other promises, cloud computing has one which aims to address the growing <em>ops</em> part the <em>devops</em> package. It is called Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and it intends to reverse the trend by farming out the operations part of the developer work. PaaS systems are sophisticated software hosting solutions which provide software operation as a service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a PaaS system can automatically scale up an application \_in heavy demand, sparing manual intervention. Or, it can provide a ready-made managed service for a database, so its installs and upgrades are done as part of the service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has first-hand experience of the woes of <em>ops</em>. For starters, we must, as many other service providers on Internet, adjust to fluctuations in demand. For example, a prime-time feature on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana1914-1918</a> on German television resulted in a huge surge in traffic to Europeana websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Flexibility for our Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are strategic reasons to address operations seriously. As a network organization, we work extensively with many technical partners across Europe. We and our partners are often involved in integration projects, perform large-scale experiments with our data, try out new technologies or carry out provisionary installations to be used by a project or a partner. Such tasks fall mainly into the <em>ops \_</em>part of <em>devops</em>. Performing them with efficiency and flexibility is key to our long-term success as a network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address the growing need for efficiency in operations we decided to take advantage of the PaaS approach. Last year we ran a full-scale European Tender to choose a new infrastructure provider. In this tender a big part of the requirements related to providing operations of the infrastructure as a service. After a scrupulous evaluation and scoring process we had a winner – <a href=\"http://www.anynines.com/\">Anynines</a>, powered by <a href=\"http://www.avarteq.com/\">Avarteq</a> hosting company from Saarbrücken, Germany. Anynines are using <a href=\"http://cloudfoundry.org/index.html\">CloudFoundry</a>, a popular open-source PaaS solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comfort of PaaS systems does not come for free as they only support software compatible with <a href=\"http://12factor.net/\">certain technological principles</a>, designed to increase its interoperability. After the tender, as part of the migration process, we spent a considerable amount of time making Europeana software compatible with CloudFoundry. By the end of February we were happy to make the final switch and raise a toast to Europeana’s success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still far from fully realizing the potential of the PaaS approach. We still need to make some components fully compatible with it, to get know the system better, and, most importantly, to start exploring how our technical partners can fully take advantage of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure, our vision is to have a flexible hosting solution for cultural applications working with Europeana and developed by our network partners. No less important than the ease and comfort of our joint <em>ops, </em>we also envisage an infrastructure services bill lower than the sum of bills we pay today. Stay tuned for future updates, and let us know your thoughts.</p>"

        title: 'Introducing REPOX: a tool to manage metadata spaces'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Here we introduce how REPOX, a software tool we have been developing, makes it easier for our partners to share their data.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, data synchronisation is a 'must have'\_functionality for metadata repositories. With huge amounts of data moving around networks, changes happen often, and end users expect up-to-date information.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something that helps with improving\_data synchronisation are incremental updates. Incremental updates allow an existing repository to be updated by requesting only data added, changed or deleted\_from a particular time period. This reduces the synchronisation time by reducing the data that must move through the network, as well as the amount of data that needs to be processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One functionality of the <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/\">OAI-PMH protocol</a> is incremental updates. OAI-PMH is a Protocol for Metadata Harvesting that gives a simple technical option for data providers to make their metadata available to other services, based on the open standards HTTP and XML. Version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001. OAI-PMH is very popular with institutions that need to share distributed resources. Galleries, libraries, archives, and museums are\_very familiar with the OAI-PMH protocol\_as they have lots of data that needs to be shared. One of the reasons the Open Archives Initiative was funded was to introduce the OAI-PMH protocol.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/wordle.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 383px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing data was one part of the equation, while\_the other was working out\_how to handle such a large amount of data. When providers have hundreds of metadata records everything is fine, but once the data scales to hundreds of thousands of metadata records then problems transferring them arise.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OAI-PMH was built to support harvesting a big amount of data by using so-called “Resumption tokens”. <a href=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#FlowControl\" target=\"_blank\">Resumption tokens</a> are, essentially, the values used to paginate the number of metadata records retrieved. The harvester therefore gets\_chunks of data, which means that\_not only is the\_flow of the data controlled, but also,\_in the case of a network failure, the state of harvesting stays alive and the next harvest continues from the state the unfinished\_harvest was in. A collection of data is called a dataset and OAI-PMH can hold multiple datasets as well as multiple XML formats for each one of them. It is important to mention that the link between the metadata and the digital object that the metadata is describing is not defined by the OAI-PMH protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Repox</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>REPOX is a software tool to manage metadata spaces. It was originally implemented by I<em>nstituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Investigação e Desenvolvimento em Lisboa</em> (<a href=\"http://www.inesc-id.pt/\">INESC-ID</a>). Europeana and <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a>, as well as their partners, have used REPOX extensively for sharing their data between each other. After INESC-ID stopped supporting REPOX, the ownership was handed over, some years ago, to Europeana so that customisations needed in the software could be handled internally.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>REPOX comes with an integrated OAI-PMH server for hosting your data where others can find it, and a harvester for retrieving data that other institutions are sharing. REPOX has a comfortable graphical interface to manage all of its functionality. It comprises several channels (OAI-PMH, HTTP, FTP, File System, Z39.50) to import data from data providers, services to transform data between schemas according to user specified rules, and services to share your data. Scheduled tasks are a functionality that REPOX provides so that harvested operations can be planned and incremental updates automatised.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been using REPOX to manage all its harvest operations, schedule thousands of datasets, and handle its datasets in one place. Europeana is currently developing\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Cloud</a>, a project that will provide a cloud-based environment for easier storing and sharing data from data providers. REPOX will become a part of Europeana Cloud. Internally, REPOX uses databases to store its data and with the newest version of REPOX there will be the possibility to store data in Europeana Cloud as well. Europeana took the opportunity to re-architect the REPOX project in a more modularised way several months ago, as well choosing to provide new features. One of the features already implemented is the new <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EC31_4pL7QMzv5f-63LH5pBvJPyREgvUUken4aT5UFM/edit\" target=\"_blank\">REST API implementation</a> using the latest standards, which will help developers have better control over REPOX from a programming perspective.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about REPOX can be found on its <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/REPOX\" target=\"_blank\">Github page</a>, and the available <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/REPOX/wiki\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a> pages have more detailed information about the installation process. The older version of REPOX and its owner documentation, before its handover to Europeana can be found <a href=\"http://repox.sysresearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        body: "<p>I often get asked the question, “when will your work be finished?”<br>\r\nIn this question lies the assumption that digitising cultural heritage is about converting collections and holdings from A to Z.  I don't believe, however, that digitisation is about that at all. I see it as more like riding the wave of the digital shift; to stay relevant and to ensure that heritage information enhanced by digital tools can be used for knowledge building, cultural experiences and sheer joy. So my answer to that question is never.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2011, I’ve lead <a href=\"http://www.digisam.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Digisam</a>, a secretariat assigned by the Swedish government to coordinate the work of digitisation, preservation and the use of digital heritage information at Swedish state funded archives, libraries and museums. The task is clearly cross-domain and comes with the ultimate goal that digital heritage information will be made accessible for citizens to engage with, use and re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, that’s also very much what Europeana is about. Europeana makes it possible to have close encounters with cultural and historical objects without having to know which institution or country I must search to find them. It enables us to fit bits and pieces of information together in the way they used to, before we divided and stored them in separate silos. Most of all, it allows us to encounter things in completely new and unexpected ways. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-03/JarvsoHalsingland.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 411px;\"><br><em>On the way to Norway. Gustaf, Carin, Lilly and a Volvo PV, Swedish National Heritage Board, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/swedish_heritage_board/6058886036/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr Commons</a>, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Europeana is also the most inspiring and strong network of which I ever been a part.  And within the shape of an Association, as a part of a new governance structure, it has the potential to become even stronger. To be able to take part in, use and share our common cultural heritage is a true democratic right, and one with which the democratisation of Europeana is well aligned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Foundation and Association built on democratic principles can also effectively address fundamental structural questions that need to be tackled in order to carry out our shared task. The need to modernise copyright laws is, in many ways, perhaps the most important issue we face. But it is not the only one, and shared, cost-effective technical solutions and the common management of best practices and guidelines are also high on my wishlist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a councillor, I will strive for meaningful engagement among members of the Association and, together with its members, work for it to be an established platform for influence, transparency and dialogue as Europeana continues to progress. The Association provides a base from which we can reach our common goals and I believe that, together, we could make it even stronger and ensure that it plays a significant role at European as well as national level. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to this, one of my main focuses will be to open up and make connections with other Networks for an even more widespread use of heritage information in other sectors. A sustainable Europeana is built upon active members and developed supporting networks in each of the individual Member states. Therefore I hope that I, together with my colleagues in the Members Council, will soon find ourselves engaged in an open, constructive and responsive dialogue with you all about how we can make Europeana an even better-known and widely used platform for our common cultural heritage. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with digital heritage is like finding a thread and winding it up to see where it leads. You can be sure that it will lead you out of your own institution, out of your domain and, even, out of your country. After all, digital information is a truly international language that's best spoken and managed in a rich cross-domain and cross-boarder context. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let’s follow the thread and see where it takes us! </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/rolfkallman\" target=\"_blank\">@rolfkallman</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em> </em></p>"

        title: 'Promoting Poland in Google’s Field Trip: a guest blog by Poland’s National Heritage Board'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Arkadiusz Kołodziej, National Heritage Board of Poland</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week, we announced the launch of the pilot project between Europeana, Google’s Niantic Labs and memory institutions in Poland, Estonia and Sweden. For the first time, our pilot partners – the National Heritage Board of Poland, Swedish National Heritage Board, and National Heritage Board of Estonia - are able to reach cultural tourists using the Field Trip app, helping travellers find out about interesting historical gems around them in these respective countries. In the coming weeks, each participating institution will highlight their collection, as well as their involvement in the project.\_<br><br>\r\nHere, our Polish partner, the National Heritage Board of Poland, discusses why they decided to join\_and the benefits of doing so.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_PolishDataset1.jpg\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 545px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_PolishDataset2.jpg\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 542px;\"><br><em>A taster of the Polish dataset in Google's Field Trip.\_</em><br><br>\r\nThe National Heritage Board of Poland is a state agency that aims to make the public more aware of the value of Polish cultural heritage, and the need to preserve it. Modern technology can play a huge role to help attain this objective, and we always try to make skillful use of it in our wider work.\_<br><br>\r\nIn particular, we recognise the increasing importance of location-based services and spatial data for the best discovery experiences, both on and offline. As one of 12 central institutions in Poland, we support the implementation of the European INSPIRE Directive (Infrastructure of Spatial Information in Europe) with respect to immovable monuments and archeological sites. We want to provide faithful digital representations of historical monuments, but also encourage users to actively seek them out, and to pay attention to their context and environment.\_<br><br>\r\nHere, <a href=\"http://www.fieldtripper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Field Trip</a> is an invaluable tool, helping us to reach both Polish and foreign cultural and historical enthusiasts looking to find out more about Polish heritage. Hence, we decided to join the project, and worked with Europeana to share the most precious monuments of historical, scientific and artistic value to present in Poland to thousands of app users across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/zabytek.gov.pl.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 441px;\"><br><em>A screenshot of the <a href=\"http://www.zabytek.gov.pl\" target=\"_blank\">National Heritage Board of Poland's portal</a></em><br><br>\r\n\_For this pilot, we have used some of the descriptive data, photographs and 3D models of historical monuments and their geolocation on our portal <a href=\"http://www.zabytek.gov.pl\" target=\"_blank\">www.zabytek.gov.pl</a>. This carefully curated collection has then been made available on the Europeana portal and, eventually, shown in Google’s Field Trip. App users will not only be able to learn about the specific attraction they are passing by, but also click through to our site and find out about our institutions. This further boosts interest and provides another pathway to our reliable and comprehensive information about Poland’s monuments.\_<br><br>\r\nAs the collections on <a href=\"http://www.zabytek.gov.pl\" target=\"_blank\">www.zabytek.gov.pl</a> are of public value, we also chose to make our data available under the CC-BY SA license. This is in line with the Institute’s existing policies, and creates a favourable environment \_for reaching new audiences in innovative ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/01.KAZIMIERZ%20DOLNY.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 441px;\"><br><em>A highlight from the Polish dataset,\_Kazimierz Dolny. National Heritage Board of Poland, CC-BY SA.</em><br><br>\r\nIn short, we consider this pilot project a great opportunity to promote Poland. Thanks to the app, we can show our attractive architecture and fascinating national history in a truly modern way, putting it at the fingertips of a wide range of sightseers. We plan to keep expanding our collections, and expect to add 8000 objects by the end of the year. We also hope that the project completed together with the Europeana Foundation and Google’s Niantic Labs marks the beginning of long lasting and fruitful cooperation and that the resources made available by our institution on both these platforms will contribute to the greater visibility of the Polish national heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana says it’s a ‘trusted source of cultural heritage’ that allows you ‘to explore Europe's history from ancient times to the modern day’ (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus.html\">Europeana - About Us)</a>. But what does that actually mean? And, heck, what a responsibility!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any museum, Europeana has a very small proportion of its collection of 40 million items on show. Less than 1% can be shown on the website’s homepage, exhibitions or on social media. Can that 1% really demonstrate the breadth of Europe’s history and heritage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By choosing which photo to post on Facebook or which celebrated inventor to blog about, we are not shining a light on Europe’s history, we are <em>writing </em>it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have so much to choose from. From Ancient Greece to the modern day. From within Europe. From outside of it. Texts. Ceramics. Clothing. Art. Video. Photography. Sounds...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is still only a subset. It has already been whittled down by ancient collectors, by modern curators, by digitisers, by policy-makers who may or may not push for digitisation in their country.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do we make our choice?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GerardusMercatorSocialMEdia.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 611px;\"><br><em>Europeana Facebook post from 5 March. Cartographer from 'The Temple... with engravings after Albert Dürer'\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1ALHUQT\" target=\"_blank\">The British Library</a>. Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s not a free choice. We often start by looking at anniversaries - birthdays of the famous, international days of commemoration. So, given a few years, themes occur. Christmas. World Peace Day. History takes on a cyclical nature.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we have the influences and limitations of our own busy lives. A blogger probably doesn’t have the time or inclination to spend hours researching some obscure figure from history they’re not interested in, but can quickly put together something about a favourite famous writer. The search on Europeana is easier. The search on Wikipedia or Google is easier. Obscure is do-able, just not as often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this isn’t just a philanthropic task. It’s about getting clicks. On the blog. On the Facebook post. On the Europeana listing we’re highlighting. So we have to pick something people will like quickly (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/deciding-what-to-share-on-facebook-and-selecting-your-best\" target=\"_blank\">see this blog on the ‘SPEED’ method of selection</a>). Faces are good. Famous faces are even better. So, Mozart’s in. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealthhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian_Commonwealth\" target=\"_blank\">Stanisław Studziński isn’t</a>. (Who? Exactly!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So although we might love to present a full picture of our shared history and heritage, we do not. Instead, we give you headlines, nice pictures to catch your eye.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/Renoir.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 647px;\"><br><em>A typical Europeana Facebook post celebrating a significant anniversary. This one - Renoir’s birthday.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is nothing new. Writings of history have never been neutral, objective or all-encompassing, however hard we try. Take our Facebook activity as an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine you’re an alien and the only information you have about European history and culture comes from Europeana’s Facebook page. What would it look like?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I looked at Europeana’s Facebook posts for a month (Feb 6 - March 5). Here’s how the world looks…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see people. Only two posts show me landscape or animals. So, history is human.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And history is dark. I see the world in black and white, little colour.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see scientists and inventors, a few painters and the odd writer or musician.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see men everywhere. The only women are unnamed, in group portraits. They have no place amongst men like Vivaldi, Klimt, Darwin and Galileo.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And everyone (bar two Indian lovers in one painting) is white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If my knowledge of European history comes from Facebook then I think time began in the 15th century, but really got going in the 19th. And the 20th, wow, what a time!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe is made up of the UK, the Netherlands, Italy and France. There are less important places too - Poland, Norway, Germany, Lithuania, India and the USA.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/ToothBrush.jpg\" style=\"width: 467px; height: 339px;\"><br><em>Children pose with tooth-brushes in their mouth in a school building as part of a tooth-brush drill in ca. 1920.\_<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1B0ZTce\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome Library</a>, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m being obtuse, of course. I looked at just one month of posts. But as the saying goes, one month is a lifetime on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook coverage gives us a fairly traditional view of history. It’s history as told to us through mainstream education and media - it’s male, it’s white, it’s about western Europe, it’s recent.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what’s wrong with that? Does history need to be representative of everyone that lived it and every time they lived through? Shouldn’t we remember just the highlights, the main characters - the things that actually made a difference? And if we make an effort to represent everyone equally, are we actually then misrepresenting history? After all, people have never been each other’s equals.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve focused on Europeana here but the same principle applies more widely. By selecting some items, themes and personalities instead of others, you create a story, a representation of the world. History isn’t something that’s set in stone. It’s being written and re-written all the time. By all of us.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which history do you choose?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beth Daley (@cakesandcopy) is a freelance creative and professional writer and editor and former PR &amp; Editorial Officer for Europeana.

        title: 'Promoting Sweden in Google''s Field Trip: a guest blog by the Swedish National Heritage Board'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Maria Logothetis, Swedish National Heritage Board.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/promoting-poland-in-googles-field-trip-a-guest-blog-by-polands-n\" target=\"_blank\">last week’s blog</a> by Poland’s National Heritage Board, here is a guest blog by the Swedish National Heritage board explaining why they joined Europeana's\_pilot project with Google’s Niantic Labs to add cultural heritage data to <a href=\"http://www.fieldtripper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Field Trip app</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through our national aggregator, <a href=\"http://www.ksamsok.se/in-english/\" target=\"_blank\">SOCH</a>, the Swedish National Heritage Board is one of the largest suppliers of free cultural heritage data to the Europeana platform. Our mission is to play a proactive and coordinating role in promoting heritage and ensure that the historic environment is preserved as effectively as possible. We also take part in Europeana’s best practice network through several strategic development projects. We are helping, for instance, to work towards the long\_term development of Europeana's infrastructure, and are collaborating on the creation of frameworks and standards for increased data quality for easy access and use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/03.%20Kina%20Slott,%20Chinese%20Pavilion,%20Stockholm.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>A highlight from the Swedish dataset:\_Kina Slott, Chinese Pavilion, Stockholm. Swedish National Heritage Board CC-BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also looking for ways to connect cultural heritage data to tourism, and\_exploring criteria for content to be ‘fit for purpose’, and have the potential to support the tourism sector. For Google’s Field trip pilot project with Europeana and Google’s Niantic Labs, we continued this exploration of ways to give people access to cultural heritage that is as usable as possible, contains good quality data\_and is enriched with context.\_<br><br>\r\nWhat is considered good quality data, ‘fit for purpose’? Well, that could be summarised as the following: it includes geo-coordinates, openly licensed high resolution photos and rich metadata (i.e. using stories or narrative texts, not just facts).<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nWith Europeana, we handpicked a selection of historic places and buildings for Google’s Field Trip app that not only met the criteria for good quality data, but are also easily accessible for visitors and\_have obvious appeal for tourists. The pilot highlights the importance of providing both high resolution images with open licenses and good metadata. While our databases contain millions of objects, improving the quality of the data and making it ‘fit for purpose’ is still very much a work in progress - something that applies to cultural institutions as a group more generally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_SwedishDataset1.jpg\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 543px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_SwedishDataset2.jpg\" style=\"width: 280px; height: 543px;\"><br><em>A taster of the Swedish dataset in Google's Field Trip.</em><br><br>\r\nWe think Google’s Field trip app is a fun and effective way to share and engage people with cultural heritage,\_with the app reaching over a million users globally to date. While several apps and web services already use cultural heritage data from SwNHB’s databases, we are delighted that we are now contributors to an app focused on tourists for the first time.\_<br><br>\r\nWhat’s more, it’s also a beneficial partnership: networks help\_us find partners in other sectors\_such as commercial and creative businesses and offer\_the potential for future collaborative projects in the cultural sector. For us, the bottom line is to try to support and stimulate the widest possible use and re-use of digitised cultural heritage. Joining Google’s Field Trip provides an important step forward in that journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see our dataset on <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_collectionName%3A91697*&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana's portal here</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.fieldtripper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">download Field Trip</a> and explore our content on your next visit to Sweden!</p>"

        title: 'A carrot and a stick: a look at the Wikipedia community from the GLAM perspective'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This weekend, the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague will host <a href=\"http://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM-WIKI_2015\" target=\"_blank\">GLAM-WIKI 2015</a>, a conference about projects by Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) either in collaboration with Wikimedia or with a strong open knowledge aspect. Both professionals and volunteers are welcomed and can still <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/glam-wiki-2015-tickets-15301916444.\" target=\"_blank\">book tickets here</a>\_– book soon to avoid disappointment!\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The conference has three, complementary aims: to share both lessons learned and best practices; to inspire and motivate people to join existing or start new projects supporting the Wikimedia movement’s mission; and to increase awareness about the importance of freely accessible cultural heritage. This year’s keynote is Paul Keller, director of Kennisland, as well as a member of the Europeana Members Council. Here, he introduces the main ideas behind his keynote this weekend, and the discussions he hopes to ignite.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I am <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Paulkeller\" target=\"_blank\">not much of a Wikipedian myself</a> (I have a grand total of two\_Wikipedia articles that I can remember authoring), I have always greatly admired what the Wikimedia community manages to achieve when it comes to providing access to knowledge and culture. Given this, I am honoured that I have been asked to provide <a href=\"https://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM-WIKI_2015/Programme/Keynote/Paul_Keller\" target=\"_blank\">a keynote for the 2015 GLAM-WIKI event</a> which kicks off later this week in The Hague.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/Koninklijke_Bibliotheek_7985207450_1_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 428px;\"><em>Koninklijke Bibliotheek.\_From Koninklijke Bibliotheek Flickr stream\_via\_<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Koninklijke_Bibliotheek#/media/File:Koninklijke_Bibliotheek_(7985207450).jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia</a>\_(CC-BY SA)</em><br><br>\r\nThroughout <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/themas/cultural-heritage/\" target=\"_blank\">my work in the digital cultural heritage sector</a>, I have followed the development of Wikipedia with great interest. In this work, the Wikimedia community has served me both as a carrot and a stick: the work of the Wikimedia community aimed at growing a commons of freely reusable cultural resources has been a huge inspiration for me as well as many GLAMs\_struggling with defining their role in the digital environment. At the same time Wikipedia also acts as a credible doomsday scenario for GLAMs: What if future generations do not see a need to consult the collections of our institutions anymore because everything is available via Wikipedia?<br><br>\r\nIn my keynote, I will explore how such tensions between the Wikimedia community and the GLAM sector can be made productive and how both of them can contribute to realising the common ideals of the Wikimedia community and of public cultural heritage institutions. As part of this, I will also highlight a set of common challenges that both communities face in the current discussion about a reform of the (European) copyright rules and how we can tackle these together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Along with Paul's keynote, there will be a broad range of different events, demonstrations and tutorials taking place all weekend. We hope to see you there!</em></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Imagine you are a designer interested in re-using the cultural heritage of Europe. You are inspired by patterns, stimulated by ancient artwork and generally fascinated by the multitude of material that is accessible in images found on Europeana. But how do you find what you are actually looking for, especially if it is image based? And once you find that perfect pattern or shape for your creative endeavour, how do you know if you are allowed to re-use it without breaking any copyright laws?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Europeana Creative’s goals has been to develop a new advanced search mechanism that helps users search content according to colours, shapes and patterns in images of cultural heritage objects. Starting from the designer’s point of view, the main aim was to create a simple, intuitive interface. The findings of previous EU-Projects have shown that it is not easy to find content that is both relevant and licensed under Creative Commons license or marked as Public Domain. For this reason, the Culture Cam tool was also developed to meet these requirements and as a result make it possible for users to walk with open eyes through the world of cultural heritage objects:\_ a quick search provides inspiration and then you can let your imagination run wild!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is this CultureCam?\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_ </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prototype developed within the Design theme is called Culture Cam and is based on a twofold concept consisting of an <a href=\"http://culturecam.eu/\">online search tool</a> and an interactive installation exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture Cam is a webcam-based similarity search tool offering designers, artists and all creative people the possibility of exploring cultural heritage images on <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> in a fun, playful and intuitive way. Try it, it’s really fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/finding_the_beauty01.png\" style=\"width: 567px; height: 321px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Design Pilot: Culture Cam (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And how does it work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a photo of any object with your webcam, and Culture Cam will provide you with a set of images that are similar or related in colour, shape and pattern. You may very likely retrieve unexpected search results leading to further exploration of Europeana content. This tool makes it easier for everybody to find suitable, re-usable content within the sometimes overwhelming offering of Europeana. All items in Culture Cam are under public domain, or there is no known copyright. It is not just any old word search tool, but a special way to intuitively and playfully explore and access the Europeana platform. One can say that Culture Cam is the beginning of re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heart of culture cam is the image similarity tool, specially developed by the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT). It uses hand-picked and pre-selected content to make sure the results provided are fit for re-use. For those who are interested in the technical side, the source code (algorithm) is available under open source, accessible through <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Creative/tree/master/image-similarity\">Github</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about feedback?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the <a href=\"http://2014.mozillafestival.org/\">Mozilla Festival</a> the online tool was firstly presented to the public. The great thing about Culture Cam is that people of all ages can be introduced to it easily because of its intuitive design. Children enjoy it as well as adults. It is useful for professional designers and people generally attracted by shapes and colours. Have a look at twitter and use the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23culturecam&amp;src=typd\">#culturecam</a> to learn about the experience of the online community<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/finding_the_beauty02.png\" style=\"width: 626px; height: 382px;\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile Version of Culture Cam (CC BY-SA Europeana Creative)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who are the creative heads behind?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture Cam has been developed within the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> project by the Danish design company <a href=\"http://spildaftid.dk\">Spild af Tid</a> in collaboration with Aalto University <a href=\"https://medialab.aalto.fi/\">Media Lab</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ait.ac.at/\">AIT</a>. The interactive installation is being designed by SAT. This part of the pilot is dedicated to\_ highlighting the value of this tool outside of the digital context. If you want to find out more about this part of the Europeana Creative Design Prototype, stay tuned, there is another blogpost to come. The installation will be presented at the <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/calendar/begivenhed/aktivitet/smk-fridays-22/\">SMK Friday</a> at the end of May. While waiting for news you can have a look at <a href=\"http://redesignyourculturalheritage.eu\">redesignyourculturalheritage.eu</a>, a CultureCam related blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have fun playing!</strong></p>"

        title: 'Staying persistent: EuropeanaTech community help to pave the way for new Europeana URIs'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>What happens when you ask a community of over 350 technical experts in digital cultural heritage how they feel about URIs? Well, you get a lot of feedback! Europeana is in the process of creating persistent identifiers (URIs) for the platform and we asked the EuropeanaTech Community to help us decide what that best option is for these.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why create new URIs?</strong><br><br>\r\nTo start, Europeana gathers information about entities that constitute a 'semantic layer' of concepts, persons and places around its core of cultural objects. For instance, the addition of names, titles, or time periods in different languages i.e. the 4th quarter of the 19th century, [4e quart 19e siècle] (fr); [4-я четверть 19-го века] (ru). Enrichments and extensions like this come in droves and the data is always in flux meaning that concepts, persons, places etc. are always susceptible to change. This can result in broken or inconsistent links which is not very user-friendly. That’s why there is a high demand for secure and persistent URIs. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Europeana gathers more and more data about these entities, they percolate through the entire ecosystem benefitting services like search, display, and enrichment. But, as always, you can have too much of a good thing; as Europeana grows, information management issues appear.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By gathering this information Europeana is building an internal database of knowledge. These resources can be seen as new entities, or bundles thereof, and are worth sharing with our data re-users, especially through data services such as the API or our linked data at <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">data.europeana.eu</a>.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/PersistentURIs2.png\" style=\"width: 573px; height: 405px;\"><br>\r\nImage from Phil Archer, <a href=\"http://philarcher.org/diary/2013/uripersistence/\" target=\"_blank\">Dos and Don'ts for Persistent URIs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the challenges we face is how to give these entities identifiers that are both easy to assign and relatively future-proof. There are a number of best practices, but a couple of options still seemed worth investigating. Europeana is in a unique situation because all the data is second hand, meaning that standard best practices used by the data providers, for instance, may not be most suitable for Europeana. Specifically, we wanted to find out whether it is worth trying to make identifiers that are human-readable, vs. purely numerical ids.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A human-readable label could look like this:<br>\r\nhttp://data.europeana.eu/agent/johannes_sebastian_bach</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bare numerical identifier could look like this:<br>\r\nhttp://data.europeana.eu/agent/12345</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both have their pros and cons. So before making such a big decision, we felt it best to consult the EuropeanaTech Community, due to the wealth of expert advice held within, to help us come to a decision which we will then implement in the coming months. The feedback we received was astounding.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s see what the experts had to say, shall we?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"If you are going to work with identifiers in a linked (open) data situation then you need to be certain that the URIs don't change. Although human readable URIs sound like a good idea because we can read them, in my experience will also be an invitation to debate and change... Johannes Sebastian Bach may become Johann Sebastiaan Bach etc. Words change, names change and people have a tendency to change human readable stuff…\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"As a compromise, you could follow the approach of VIAF, where Bach has a numerical identifier (<a href=\"http://viaf.org/viaf/12304462/\" target=\"_blank\">http://viaf.org/viaf/12304462/</a>), but is presented also as <a href=\"http://viaf.org/viaf/12304462/#Bach,_Johann_Sebastian,_1685-1750\">http://viaf.org/viaf/12304462/#Bach,_Johann_Sebastian,_1685-1750</a>.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"From a technical perspective, option 1 or 2 make no difference, so its a social engineering thing. If you want to avoid human confusion in the case of changing names, [numerical identifiers are] safer.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GroupDiscussion_800x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 391px;\"><br>\r\nA group of men conducting a serious conversation. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006128401.html?start=1&amp;query=A+group+of+men+are+conducting+a+serious+conversation&amp;startPage=1&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">The Wellcome Library</a>, CC BY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"Section 2.3.1 of the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-aliases\" target=\"_blank\">Architecture of the WWW</a>\_suggests that [minting both forms of URL] is not good practice because of the additional load it places on consumers of the linked data.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"[Human readable URIs] have the advantage of giving the human user a clue about what is hidden behind the url (this might save developers a lot of time)...\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"Any URI may have to become human-readable at some point, even if it is not meant to, unfortunately. So, I would say that one either should implement dual URIs (numeric and 'meaningful').\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"There is a famous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danbri/status/508981586738814976\" target=\"_blank\">statement by Dan Brickley</a>: 'First rule of namespace URI design:\_you're more likely to\_regret things you included, than things you omitted'.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above are just a small portion of the numerous contributions we received in less than 24 hours, and you can <a href=\"http://list.ecompass.nl/listserv/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1503&amp;L=EUROPEANA-TECH#10\" target=\"_blank\">read some more here</a>. Since numbers are sometimes easier to read than graphemes we also held a doodle poll for everyone to vote for either human readable URIs or just numerical URIs. The final tally came to:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Numerical URI</strong>: 24<br><strong>Human readable URI</strong>: 5<br><strong>I don’t know</strong>: 2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have still not chosen a final design for our URIs. However, we now know which option is most favoured, which is most widely used, and some tricks to harness some of the benefits from both options. Perhaps one of the most valuable lessons we learned is that, whenever a question like this appears, the EuropeanaTech Community is on hand to provide the highest quality expert advice available in Europe.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge thank you to everyone for your input and stay tuned to see the new Europeana URIs!\_</p>"

        title: 'Making a big impact on a small budget - How the LSH Museums shared their collection with the world'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>This weekend the <a href=\"https://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM-WIKI_2015\">GLAM-WIKI\_conference</a> was organised in the Royal Library of the Netherlands. More than 150\_Wikimedians, open data enthusiasts and heritage professionals came together for three days to talk, discuss and learn about how the cultural heritage sector is evolving in the digital age. On Saturday Joris Pekel from the Europeana Foundation<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jorispekel/gla-mwiki-2015\"> presented</a>, together with Karin Nilsson from the <a href=\"http://lsh.se/en\">LSH museums in Sweden</a>, a paper describing how LSH, as a small institution, has made a big impact with their digital collection by opening it up and working with the community. The case study is now available for everyone <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">to download and share</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 2014 the paper ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/democratising-the-rijksmuseum\">Democratising the Rijksmuseum</a>’ was published on Europeana Pro. This paper described how the museum opened up their entire digital collection to the public and the results of that. The paper was received with great interest, but also raised questions about how the model of the Rijksmuseum could be applied to smaller museums.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rijksmuseum was largely closed for ten years, which gave them a lot of room to work on their online presence. It is also one of the most visited museums in the world and has a considerable amount of resources for digitisation, marketing and copyright clearance. These are all things that are lacking for most institutions around Europe.\_<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nFor this reason, we have worked on another case study. This time, with an institution with a far smaller budget: the LSH museums. The paper investigates how they have worked with their digital collection using limited resources. The paper explores the preparation, the decisions taken, the process and the results.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LSH stands for the Livrustkammaren och Skoklosters slott med Stiftelsen Hallwylska museet. This is a state administrative authority in Sweden that consists of three museums. It has about 50 people on its staff and a limited budget. About 300,000 people visit the three museums combined each year. At the same time, their collection is shared all over the world and receives millions of views.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was achieved when, in 2013, the museums started the <a href=\"http://lsh.se/sv/openimagearchive\">Open Image Archive project.</a> The goal of the project was to make sure that their digital collection could be seen and used by as many people as possible. In order to achieve this, they cleaned up their database, improved the metadata, and published their digital content with as few restrictions as possible. Everybody is now able to see, download, share, edit and remix their out of copyright and openly licensed images.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has resulted in a tremendous uptake of their collection and, in the words of Karin Nilsson, ‘a great sense of pride for doing the right thing within the institution’. The paper describes the different steps that the institution had to take in order to achieve this success, and how opening up became an essential part of their digital strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to describing this process, the paper will also take a closer look at some of the copyright issues that had to be dealt with. The Rijksmuseum paper discusses situations where digitisation generates new copyright and the issue of how to deal with the digitisation of public domain material. This paper will continue from there and look at the difference between the generation of copyright between two- and three-dimensional objects. Other topics, such as the influence of the PSI Directive and the effects on image sale, are also discussed. Finally it also includes the full transcript of the interview we had with Karin Nilsson which is well worth a read.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">this paper</a> can be an inspiration and a useful example for smaller and mid-size institutions. It can be <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">found\_here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any comments or questions, get in touch!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>By\_Sejul Malde</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in connecting your audiences with more of your content online? If you are, Culture24 is looking for arts and cultural organisations to participate in Phase 4 of its collaborative action research project: Let’s Get Real.</strong><br><br>\r\nThis phase entitled ‘What’s the Story?’ looks at how arts and cultural organisations can better connect with their audiences through online content publishing. The project aims to break down boundaries in the way we create, shape and deliver content for our audiences <u>and </u>in the way we work to achieve this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let’s Get Real Phase 4 adopts many of the core principles of the Europeana Creative project</strong>: reusing existing content, experimenting with content in an agile way and fostering collaborative working. It explores these in connection to individual arts and cultural organisations, helping them to apply these principles to their content, their audiences and within their own organisational structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the project including how you can sign up please <a href=\"http://weareculture24.org.uk/projects/action-research/phase-4-whats-the-story/.\">see this page</a>.\_\_If you have any questions or would like to know more please contact Jane Finnis (<a href=\"mailto:jane@culture24.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">jane@culture24.org.uk</a>) or Sejul Malde (<a href=\"mailto:Sejul@culture24.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Sejul@culture24.org.uk</a>)</p>"

        body: "<p><em>Europeana is beginning to aggregate content, via the Europeana Cloud project.<br>\r\nThis article is by Ingeborg Versprille, Project Officer at <a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CERL</a>, focuses on the new processes for doing this work.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The content ingestion plan for the Europeana Cloud [1] project shows how content and its accompanying metadata will be prepared and ingested into the Europeana Cloud, using three different ingestion workflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/BalloonClouds_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 406px;\"><br><em>A hot-air balloon is flying high above the clouds, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006129265.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Wellcome Library</a>, CC BY.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now the Europeana Foundation was primarily focused on the aggregation of large quantities of metadata of digital heritage of European origin. The Europeana Cloud project offers the Europeana Foundation the opportunity to engage with actual content. Content in this context means the actual digital object – whether they be full text, images or other formats. Content is generally accompanied by metadata: the textual information and hyperlinks that serve to identify, discover, interpret and/or manage content.<br><br>\r\nPartners in the Europeana Cloud project were invited to contribute actual content, and several partners, including OAPEN, University College London, the National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Technology in Prague, were keen to explore this new approach with Europeana.<br><br>\r\nIn addition, the project builds upon the Europeana Newspapers project, which provided for the funding of the aggregation of metadata and content from 12 full partners and the aggregation of metadata of 11 associate partners. Associate partners in the Newspapers project such as the National Libraries of Wales, Spain and Belgium will deliver full text content for the Cloud project. Partly due to rights issues, the focus will be on public domain newspapers from the nineteenth century.<br><br>\r\nFor the ingestion of the Newspaper content into Europeana Cloud, the existing workflow established for the Europeana Newspapers project can be reused. For the ingestion and automatic upload of content other than newspapers, the current metadata ingestion process of The European Library is being modified. An additional UIM plugin was created to directly download the content embedded in the metadata into Europeana Cloud. Only data with direct links to images or files in pdf format can be treated in this manner.<br><br>\r\nFor data with indirect links to content, or data sets with their own data model, a targeted workflow has had to be established, which allows for direct uploading into the Europeana Cloud. For this purpose an Europeana Cloud API is being finalised. The actual ingestion of the content is scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 2015 and will continue throughout the year. The project aims to test a number of ingestion paths with a number of different institutions in Europeana’s network to be able to develop a scalable and efficient workflow for adding further content (plus metadata) to the Europeana Cloud infrastructure, after the project has ended.<br><br><br>\r\n[1] Marian Lefferts, Adina Ciocoiu, Markus Muhr, Anastasia Gasia, Alastair Dunning (ed.), D4.2 Content Ingestion Plan<br><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D4.2%20Content%20Ingestion%20Plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D4.2%20Content%20Ingestion%20Plan.pdf</a> (8 April 2015)</p>"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Moving from a portal to a platform: this is one of Europeana’s <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">major\_objectives for 2015-2020</a>\_to allow “people to re-use and play with the material, to interact with others and participate in creating something new”. Europeana can’t achieve this vision on its own and it needs the support of its Network and other valuable related projects. <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">The Digital Manuscripts to Europeana</a> project (DM2E) is one of these projects.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in February 2012 and ending last January, the DM2E project focused on the development of Linked Data based solutions and tools that enable libraries and archives to provide digital manuscripts to Europeana. Along the way, the project developed a new data model for manuscripts, and technical solutions to allow the description, the manipulation and enrichment of the data. The results were promoted within and validated by the Digital Humanities community.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what makes the results of the DM2E project beneficial to Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s broad vision is supported by activities running on three different levels: \_\_ \_\_ \_ \_ \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A <strong>Core </strong>where we collect the data, content and technology.</li>\r\n    <li>An <strong>Access </strong>level where we standardise and enrich the core, define the rules of engagement and provide the interfaces for access.</li>\r\n    <li>And a <strong>Service</strong> level, where we develop tailored experiences for our three user groups: Professionals, End-Users and Creatives.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>DM2E makes a positive contribution to all three of these levels.<br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/CoreGraphic.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 451px;\"><br><em>From the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Strategy%202020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a>.By <a href=\"http://www.denkschets.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Elco van Staveneren</a>\_ (CC-BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improving Europeana’s core</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DM2E brings additional 20.08 million manuscripts pages from national libraries, archives and research institutions across Europe. These manuscripts come from important corpora for Digital Humanities researchers. Until this project, modern manuscripts were underrepresented in Europeana. Furthermore, this content enriches Europeana in multilingual data. Content and data cover a variety of languages: German, Latin, French, Italian, English, Czech but also Arabic,\_Turkish, Hebrew and Yiddish, less represented in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata couldn’t be integrated into Europeana without defining a proper interoperability framework. The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/DM2E_Model_V1.2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">DM2E model</a> is developed using the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) and specialises it to support the requirements of the project. The DM2E model allows the description of rich metadata for manuscripts, answering the needs of scholars without hindering the interoperability with Europeana as the DM2E model is built on top of the Europeana one.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussions during the project enabled the creation of mapping recommendations that have been useful to Europeana for improving its model. The model also demonstrates how EDM can be extended so as to support different grains of data. The discussions around the development of the DM2E model and EDM application profiles in general were also opened out to the wider community in a <a href=\"http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/RDF_Application_Profiles\" target=\"_blank\">task group</a> at the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. The issues are currently being discussed with Europeana as well as \_other partners such as the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\">German Digital Library</a> or <a href=\"http://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">DPLA</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DM2E model is only one building block within a larger <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D2.3_1.0_WP2_Final_Version_of_the_Interoperability_Infrastructure_140214_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">interoperability infrastructure</a> allowing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The description of metadata transformation, provenance, versioning workflows.\_</li>\r\n    <li>The mapping of the original metadata (in various formats) to the DM2E model and then to the Europeana EDM.\_</li>\r\n    <li>The contextualisation of resources by the generation of links to external sources (performed with <a href=\"http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/silk/\" target=\"_blank\">Silk</a>)</li>\r\n    <li>The dissemination of RDF data via a Linked Data API</li>\r\n    <li>The access of the transformed EDM data via an OAI-PMH service</li>\r\n    <li>The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D2.3_1.0_WP2_Final_Version_of_the_Interoperability_Infrastructure_140214_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">OmNom</a> engine independently integrates and orchestrates the tools supporting these different workflows.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All the DM2E tools are the outcome of a great deal of innovation work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This flexibility of the aggregation services built by DM2E is what Europeana hopes to achieve for its own aggregation services but also for its network of providers and aggregators. This impressive infrastructure could benefit Europeana own services, but also other organisations within the Network who share the same needs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/ManuscriptONB_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 304px;\"><br><em>Befestigungen in Südtirol und Friaul,\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048602/data_item_onb_codices__2BZ9672730X.html?start=88&amp;query=manuscript&amp;startPage=73&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3ADM2E&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Federacja+Bibliotek+Cyfrowych%22&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Austrian+National+Library%22&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian National Library</a>, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Providing access to data, content and technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing new data to the Europeana core and improving the overall data quality is a great achievement, but becomes even more valuable if Europeana can provide access to it. The DM2E project has developed ways to allow the content, the data and technology to be re-used after the project ends.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The publication of the data under the Creative Commons CC0 licence enables the data to be openly accessed. The Linked Data API developed by DM2E facilitates the distribution<br>\r\nof the data while the enrichments performed on the data enables a better access to resources by the Digital Humanities community. All these tools have been made available as open source software.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Offering new services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By encouraging humanists to work with Linked Data, the DM2E project has nurtured a thriving relationship with a community that was, until this point, not well-represented in the Europeana Network.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis of the research processes in the humanities supported the development of a series of digital tools included in the Scholarly Research Platform.\_The created <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/files/D3.4_2.0_Research_Report_on_DH_Scholarly_Primitives_150402.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">model</a> defines new types of scholarly activities involving collaborative commenting, annotating, collecting, and the sharing data. The results of the DM2E project were tested and validated by scholars in experiments.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scholarly Research Platform is based on the open source tool <a href=\"http://thepund.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Pundit</a> which\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>allows users to create structured data while annotating pages and text on the Web.</li>\r\n    <li>supports the semantic linking of text and images to the DM2E data but also to controlled vocabularies and taxonomies.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This approach completes Europeana’s recent work around <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-aat/\" target=\"_blank\">data enrichment</a> and the development of its “semantic layer”.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scholarly Research Platform also provides a framework for developers to build on the data, re-use it and develop tools for exploring and visualising the data further, which an aspect Europeana develops through its service <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Labs</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/Pundit.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 331px;\"><br><em>Scholarly Research Platform “Pundit”: The software ecosystem overview</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is now in the position to re-use the efforts made by the DM2E project to elaborate the new <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a> and the developments of the services it will offers. Projects such as DM2E indicate areas that Europeana should be exploring to deepen that relationship and provide more meaningful links between the GLAM sector and the digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the DM2E project participated in bringing new communities into the Europeana Network around topics such as open data, and data trust. <a href=\"http://openhumanitiesawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Open Humanities Awards</a>, for instance, demonstrate how the research community can foster innovation around cultural heritage data, while the <a href=\"http://openglam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenGLAM community</a> initiated by Open Knowledge in the DM2E project works on promoting and furthering free and open access to digital cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these results shows how R&amp;D developments can support the Europeana platform and its future services. The work of the DM2E affects all the levels of the platform: it improves its core, provides new ways to access and re-use materials and brings promise of great services in the future.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the DM2E outputs, publication and results can be found at <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/outputs/\" target=\"_blank\">http://dm2e.eu/outputs/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Images for the Future: Lessons learned from 7 years of digitisation'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>At the end of 2014, the biggest digitisation project\_ever seen in the Netherlands came to a close. <a href=\"http://www.beeldenvoordetoekomst.nl/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Images for the Future</a> was a 7 year project to digitise hours of audiovisual material and millions of photographs. In March, the closing event was held at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Results and successes were celebrated, but the lessons learned along the way were also discussed. Here we present the main outcomes.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea for Beelden voor de Toekomst, as the project was called in Dutch, started more than 8 years ago. The project proposal was a direct response to a call for digitisation from a number of cultural institutions. It aimed to save audiovisual material that was particularly old, such as early movies and newsreels, and which were being damaged by the ravages of time. The nitrate films that were once used were slowly disintegrating; waiting much longer would mean that these fragments of Dutch cultural history would be lost forever. In 2007 the project started with a total budget of 154 million euros, and a schedule to run for 7 years.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the allotted time, the desired results are there for all to see. An amazing amount of material has been digitised and restored, made safe for future generations. The rescue operation saved:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>90,000 hours of video</li>\r\n    <li>20,000 hours of film</li>\r\n    <li>100,000 hours of audio</li>\r\n    <li>2.5 million photos</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Besides the digitisation work and all the related challenges it entails, such as the storage and metadata, a major part of Images for the Future was to generate economic revenue out of the digitised material. In the proposal, it was agreed that the project would generate at least 64 million euros from the exploitation of the audiovisual material, leaving total costs at 90 million.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/AnefoPhoto.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 595px;\"><em>Kaalgeschoren moffenmeiden by Nationaal Archief, on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/2949043508\">Flickr</a>. No known copyright restrictions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This target, however, turned out to be a lot more difficult than expected. Various efforts were made to sell the digitised material to various user groups. A Netflix-like platform where users could watch Dutch films for a monthly fee was built to give just one example. Numerous discussions were held with educational publishers to see if the material could be used in classrooms, where schools would pay a fee. Though many people researched and worked on these platforms, none turned out to be economically sustainable, and would cost more to maintain than they would generate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, therefore, the conclusion was made that it was not realistic to earn back 64 million euros with the digitised material. The public were simply reluctant to pay for online content as most if it is already free. The project was therefore renegotiated and the payback obligation was dropped. This meant that the total budget also reduced to 115 million euros. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the long term goals, Images for the Future also ran a number of small pilots with open content. These so called ‘Pearl projects’ took a small set of the collections not restricted by copyright, and pushed them out to a wider audience. One example was the upload of black and white news photos from the National Archives to Flickr Commons. This resulted in thousands of views, with many users commenting on the pictures and thereby enriching what the archives knew about the images. Another example was Celluloid Remix where users were invited to remix public domain movie clips into new works of art. You can see an example below, by Victor Ponten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYdr9OCYabI\" width=\"420\"></iframe><br><em>How the world changed - <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdr9OCYabI\" target=\"_blank\">a Celluloid remix by Victor Ponten</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though the full report is only available in Dutch, some great lessons can be learned from the Images for Future project. Never before there has been a digitisation project of this scale. It shows the difficulties of making a direct financial profit out of a digital collection. More and more institutions come to realise this and instead use their digital collection for other purposes such as exposure or because they simply believe that giving the public access is part of their mission as a public institution.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nThis is what the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision has shown with their Open Images platform where videos can be found under open licenses or without any copyright restrictions. Although the 5000 videos that can be found there are a very small part of their collection (about 0.007%) it has generated millions of pageviews because they can allbe used in other places such as Wikipedia and Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, a lot of material has been saved for future generations, but most of it cannot be accessed by this generation. Copyright regulations mean that the majority of the material is not \_made available online. The panel therefore concluded that it would be good to look again at copyright laws and make an exception for educational use of the material at the very least. Besides that, it should also be made easier for cultural institutions to publish works where the rights holders are unknown: so called ‘orphan works’.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, here are the lessons learned from 7 years digitising and making available content:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>It can be difficult to generate a direct income out of digital content. While there is some material which still has a commercial value in every collection, most of it will not be paid for.\_</li>\r\n    <li>While there is often no direct economic value, there is a great deal of social and educational value in digital content, but to achieve this, people need to be able to find, access and use it effortlessly.\_</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright turned out to be a far bigger obstacle than expected. Audiovisual material is especially problematic as it is not usually as old, and there are often multiple people who can claim copyright.</li>\r\n    <li>Small and quick projects can have great impact. There is not always the need to wait for everything to be absolutely perfect before you can start sharing material.</li>\r\n    <li>Even though large parts of a collection might not be suitable to publish openly, less is sometimes more: great results can be achieved with small, well-curated and open sets of content.\_</li>\r\n</ul>"

After years of GLAMs creating Linked Open Data and authority-controlled metadata that they wish to share, many GLAM-Wiki collaborations are now looking to Wikidata as the most viable way to connect to others’ work.

        body: "<p>While I’m a fairly regular contributor to this blog, I’m also a bit of an outsider when it comes to the cultural heritage world. This is because <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Kennisland</a>, the organisation I run, together with my colleague <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/people/chris-sigaloff/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Sigaloff</a>, is not a heritage institution, and work in the cultural heritage sector only makes up one\_aspect of our work.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennisland is a Dutch non-profit think tank that was founded in 1999 in order to promote the concept of the knowledge society in the Netherlands. We are working on social innovation for a smart society and as part of that mission we have been working with cultural heritage institutions on opening up their digital collections. This all started\_over eight years ago when we became one of the partners in the Images for the Future project, the biggest digitisation project even carried out in\_The Netherlands\_(you can find out more about this project, and the lessons learned from Joris Pekel's blog\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/images-for-the-future-lessons-learned-from-7-years-of-digitisati\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/AmsterdamMapRijks_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 515px;\"><br><em>Hand-coloured map of Amsterdam,\_</em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_AO_20_45_A.html?start=93&amp;query=title%3Amap+amsterdam&amp;startPage=73&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, Public Domain.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From our perspective free and open access to culture and knowledge is an important element of smart and inclusive societies. The internet provides an exciting platform for cultural heritage institutions to contribute to this goal; we see it as our role to help them realise this potential.\_<br>\r\nOur work in this area is driven by our mission. We believe that cultural heritage collections should be be as open as possible and that it is the role of publicly funded heritage institutions to contribute to and preserve the Public Domain. Based on this mission we have mainly been working on problems related to copyright, business models and new ways of providing access to collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I became involved with Europeana in 2009 when Kennisland became a partner in the Europeana Connect project. Together with the <a href=\"http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bibliotheque National de Luxembourg</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Information Law at the University of Amsterdam</a> we had signed up for the task of developing a licensing framework for Europeana (back in those days Europeana operated without formal agreements related to the copyright status of the metadata supplied by the data providers).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of this work we authored the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publications/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Public Domain Charter</a> (which I still consider my most important contribution to Europeana over the past years). We also developed the Europeana Licensing Framework which provides a clear legal framework for how Europeana deals with both metadata and content.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spent a good deal of time implementing the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/europeana-licensing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a> by ensuring that all 40 million plus objects in Europeana have a rights label that allows visitors of the site to quickly determine if they can re-use an object or not. As part of this, I have established a close working relationship with the aggregation/ingestion team at Europeana (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcdangerfield/status/492219282630410240\">I even interned with them for a day</a>!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the work on the Europeana Licensing Framework firmly established my current focus for Europeana has two strands:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>First of all, I am working with the Europeana Foundation on ensuring that the voice of Europe’s cultural heritage institutions is heard in the discussions about a modernisation of the European Copyright rules. If cultural heritage institutions are expected to bring their collections online,<a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/europes-cultural-heritage-institutions-deserve-better/\" target=\"_blank\"> they need copyright rules that help and not hinder them with this</a>. In this role you can find me in Brussels a lot, speaking to members of parliament, commission officials and member state representatives. Ensuring that cultural heritage institutions get what they deserve will be a long process and we are counting on the network to help with this.<br>\r\n    \_</li>\r\n    <li>Secondly, we are working on increasing the quality of the content that is available via Europeana. If we want to enable re-use of the content that can be found via Europeana we will need to ensure that the quality of the content that can be found meets the expectations of visitors and developers. As part of this we are currently developing a content re-use framework for Europeana that will provide technical tools to better filter content that is available via Europeana, and provide clearer guidelines for data providers who want to ensure that their content is available for re-use. We plan to present the content reuse framework in July as part of the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\">final conference of the Europeana Creative project in Vienna</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>I am looking forward to working with all of you on these important issues.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paul_keller\" target=\"_blank\">@paul_keller</a></p>"

        body: "<p>Have you heard of <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/\">Retronaut</a>? It’s a highly successful online distributor of fascinating 20th century photography. By revealing strange yet enlightening photographs from the past, Retronaut.com and its social media channels evolved into a platform attracting hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world every day. Since the end of 2014, Retronaut has been part of Mashable, one of the biggest websites in the world, engaging even bigger audiences with historic content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/Pig%20rider%20Retronaut.jpg\" style=\"width: 436px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><br><em>An image used on Retronaut from Europeana: Animaux apprivoisés de Mr Wingfield à Ampthill, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055682270.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of France</a>, Public Domain. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what are the secrets of Retronaut’s success? Is it possible to apply founder  of Retronaut Chris Wild’s methods and lessons learned to other cultural organisations? What are the benefits of ‘giving away’ your best content on the internet anyway? What is the logic behind ‘Frans Hals for breakfast, Victor Hugo for lunch and rat-catchers for dinner’ as a social media strategy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the autumn of 2013, Europeana’s marketing team began a collaboration with Retronaut. The aim was to discover the secrets of Retronaut’s success, to emulate it and to work together to multiply it for the benefit of both parties. Our average number of impressions on Facebook pre-Retronaut was around 1.25 million per quarter. During the collaboration, this went up to 4.5 million. And eventually, some images started to have a life of their own, outside of our own portal and social media channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/disrupting-history\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/disrupting_history_cover.jpg\" style=\"width: 425px; height: 600px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/disrupting-history\">‘Disrupting History’ by Neil Bates and Chris Wild</a> describes the mechanisms of a successful social media strategy which begins with deciding what to share in the first place. This is followed by some examples of material that we shared during the collaboration and the results we got from doing so. Then the paper describes the SPEED model which helps to identify the kind of content with the biggest viral potential. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever your current strategy, we believe that the SPEED model is a great tool to help increase your following and reach, and therefore your relationship with your audiences. By identifying and surfacing your most striking images, you are likely to reach more people and encourage them in through your doors, at which point you can share the rest of your collections in the best ways you know how.</p>"

We wanted to continue the move from portal to platform; to keep on improving the quality of the records in Europeana; to build on the value our contributing partners get back from Europeana; and to become a fully networked organisation, where every member can play an active role.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the report, we look more closely at how we set about achieving these four goals. We \_are proud to present you both with some happy endings as well as some exciting new beginnings.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During 2014, among other activities, we ran successful campaigns around the centenary of World War One and 25 years from the fall of the Iron Curtain, launched our GLAM-Wiki toolset, uploading 300,000 images to Wikimedia Commons, and reached a total of 40 million records in Europeana. Alongside these achievements, we were proud to create the Europeana Network Association, with 25 candidates elected to the new Members Council Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Departures\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though it is a pleasure to reflect on our shared achievements, and to take the opportunity to thank the people and partners who have played an invaluable part, we want to keep pressing forward too.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can keep an eye out for our business plan for 2015 which will be published soon and outlines our aims and ambitions for the coming year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we share our journey so far, and our plans for the next steps, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/New%20Frontiers%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf\">we hope you will join us</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>As you know, <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>\_is the largest online resource of First World War material, bringing together different kinds of content so\_national collections from\_libraries sit alongside important film archives and personal stories and treasures. Together, these\_create\_a unique perspective of the War, showing it from both\_sides of the battle lines and from different points of view.\_<br><br>\r\nThanks to the <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\">European Film Gateway</a>\_1914 project, one of three major projects which provided content to Europeana 1914-1918,\_you can view over 600 hours of film\_from the First World War including newsreels, documentaries, fiction films, propaganda and anti-war films. This material is particularly important as only about 20% of the total silent film production of the era has survived.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/corporate/projects-partnerships/make-film-make-history\" target=\"_blank\">Make Film, Make History</a> is a project led by the <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/\">Imperial War Museum</a>, nominated last week for UK Museum of the Year, as part of the First World War Centenary, and its 2016 Year of Film programme.\_It encourages young people in UK, Germany and Denmark to explore the relationship between film, propaganda and identity using digital cultural heritage. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Here, Halima Khanom, who is coordinating the project talks about the aims of the project, and the importance of using digital resources to engage young people with their past.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Film has always played powerful role in creating a sense of identity. You relate to the person next to you at the cinema, who laughs at the same moment as you. You might strike up a conversation with a stranger on the bus about the latest blockbuster. You feel you almost intuitively know what happened in a Second World War bunker, even though you were born sixty years later.\_<br><br><em>Make Film, Make History</em> is a project led by the Imperial War Museum as part of the First World War Centenary and supported by <a href=\"http://www.goethe.de/ins/gb/lon/enindex.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Goethe Institut</a>, <a href=\"http://www.danmark1914-18.dk/English.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Mosede Fort Denmark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.inflandersfields.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">In Flanders Fields Museum</a>. It examines\_the relationship between film, propaganda and identity, and works with young people (aged 18-24) from UK, Germany and Denmark to explore what it means to be young in Europe today, looking to the past to reflect on European identity today.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/IWM%20Somme%201.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 460px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/2022360/Imperial_War_Museums_http___www_iwm_org_uk_collections_item_object_205316069\" target=\"_blank\">Frame from the 'Battle of the Somme'\_film</a> - troops going over the top to attack the enemy, 1916. IWM, Free Access - Rights Reserved.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nHeading into Battle</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Battle of Somme</em> (1916) film works as the starting point for these young people.\_Now, although I wasn’t at the Battle of Somme, a key battle fought during the First World War, I can appreciate its significance in <em>The Battle of Somme</em> film released in 1916, <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/europeana/record/08622/IWM_191\" target=\"_blank\">scenes from which are available through Europeana 1914-1918</a>. If you get the opportunity to watch the 77 minute film, you are struck by the fact that it is about more than just the battle itself, but about film production at the time, about First World War Propaganda, and about the first ever ‘blockbuster’, attracting a 20 million cinema audience.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Battle of Somme</em> (1916) film prompts the young participants to think about what it might have been like to be young and heading into battle. Some historians argue that the Battle of Somme was a deeply\_controversial campaign, drawing on voluntary troops, many of whom were very young and inexperienced in frontline combat. For anyone who wants to understand the First World War, the film is a unique insight of what it was like for these young troops. Others reflect on the diversity of the troops, with regiments from all across the globe, fighting a ‘World’ war -\_the first of its kind -\_and helping us understand the diversity of Europe, and pushing our understanding of what it means to be ‘European.’<br><br>\r\nThe interculturalism is integral to the project. At the end of April 2015, the project will physically bring together UK, Danish and German young people in Ypres, Belgium. Here they will meet each other for the first time, and take part in workshops together. Working with London-based film company Chocolate Films, the group will unpack the impact film has had on their identity. Using Europeana 1914-1918 and the European Film Gateway to access clips and information on the Battle of Somme, they will also bring in films that they feel have shaped the way they see themselves as European, and the shared values as well as the tensions that exist within this identity.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nDigital Encounters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When there isn’t the opportunity for physical encounter between the three nations, the Make Film, Make History project capitalises on the contemporary technologies available to us that allow us to work across borders digitally. The digital realm becomes the primary space in which young people from the UK, Germany and Denmark share, discuss and reflect on European identity. Participants will be using Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and the <a href=\"https://medium.com/make-film-make-history\" target=\"_blank\">project blog</a> to explore their interactions with the subject matter, but also with each other. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/IWM%20Somme%202.jpg\" style=\"width: 443px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Official cinematographer is shielded from splinters by an armoured plate. Salonika Front, 1916. IWM, Free Access - Rights Reserved.</em>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe <em>Make Film Make Histor</em>y project starts with a film archive, explores film and identity in its process, and will end with a new film co-produced by young people and the various collections involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, which will express what it is to be European, is due to be screened in July 2016 across partner countries. Whether it will enter our historical memory in the same way Battle of Somme (1916) requires investigation in another hundred years’ time.\_<br><br><strong>By Halima Khanom</strong><br>\r\nNational and International Learning and Engagement Coordinator<br>\r\nImperial War Museum, London<br><br><em>All images used within this article are <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/collection/search?page=2&amp;q=Battle+of+the+Somme&amp;qf%5Bdata_provider%5D%5B%5D=Imperial+War+Museums&amp;qf%5Bindex%5D=e&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93\" target=\"_blank\">available to access via Europeana 1914-1918</a> but are subject to Imperial War Museum's share and re-use policy, which allows non-commercial use\_only.

This\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight/insight-issue2-datamodelingdataquality\" target=\"_blank\">special issue</a>\_focuses on data quality, in particular, the work of members who presented at the conference.\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight\" target=\"_blank\">Read EuropeanaTech Insight</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/PostIt_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 576px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we invite you to read our publication\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-quality-etech15-roundtables\" target=\"_blank\">‘We want better data quality now’</a>. It is an honest account of the roundtable discussion on data quality held at EuropeanaTech 2015. Several dozen bright and enthusiastic EuropeanaTech members talked in a very open way, bringing their experience, insights and questions to the table. The write-up covers the issues that might lead to bad data quality and proposes solutions to tackle them. It also aims to help people understand what we mean by good quality data and why it’s so difficult to achieve.

We’ll keep talking to our aggregators and the EuropeanaTech community to make sure we’re all working together, creating solutions that benefit everyone. And we’ll also extend our discussions internationally, working hand-in-hand with the likes of the Digital Public Library of America who have also identified data quality as an area of improvement.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get involved in our data quality work, please follow the links above and contact the person or people named in the article or report you’re interested in.</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana’s GLAM-Wiki toolset, which helps heritage institutions mass upload content to Wikimedia Commons, won the gold award in the ‘Open’ category of the <a href=\"http://aam-us.org/about-us/grants-awards-and-competitions/muse-awards\" target=\"_blank\">2015 Media and Technology Muse Awards</a>, an initiative run by the American Alliance of Museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the good news doesn’t end here! The other winners in the ‘Open’ category were Europeana Fashion, <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/2015/04/28/muse-award-for-europeana-fashions-edit-a-thons-2/\" target=\"_blank\">winning bronze</a> for their twelve Fashion editathons\_held in nine different countries, and the British Library together with Wikimedia UK, who won silver for their <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/maps/georefabout.html\" target=\"_blank\">georeferenced maps upload</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/MUSEawards.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 660px;\"><br><em>Our awards were collected (and photographed!) by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpedson/status/592473626605178882\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Peter Edson</a>\_at the ceremony in Atlanta (CC BY)</em>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nPresented to institutions or independent producers who use digital media to enhance the GLAM experience and engage audiences, the awards are designed to recognise outstanding examples of scholarship, community, innovation, creativity, education and inclusiveness.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nThe ‘Open’ category features projects created by or for GLAMs and celebrates the growing range of innovative projects developed in the open environment. Projects in this category include both front-end and back-end innovations, but all submitted projects must demonstrate how open data/content was used to\_make\_the final product.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nFor this years’ Muse Awards, Europeana decided to submit the <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMwiki_Toolset\" target=\"_blank\">GLAM-Wiki Toolset</a>, a groundbreaking tool that allows GLAM institutions to add their\_collections to Wikimedia Commons. The tool is the result of a collaboration between Wikimedia Nederland, Wikimedia UK, Wikimedia France, Wikimedia CH (Switzerland) and Europeana.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nUp until now, the GLAM-Wiki Toolset has been used to upload<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:GWToolset_Batch_Upload\" target=\"_blank\"> over 400,000 openly licensed images to Wikimedia Commons</a>. Uploads can be done by anyone with some experience with metadata and knowledge of Wikimedia Commons. Already many ‘Wikipedians in residence’ have using the GLAMWiki Toolset in their plans, and training sessions at the recent <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/wikidata-emerges-as-central-element-of-glam-wiki-2015\">GLAM-WIKI conference</a> were fully subscribed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks and congratulations to everyone involved!<br>\r\n\_</p>"

        body: "<p>Today we published <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/make-the-beautiful-thing-business-plan-2015\">our Business Plan for 2015</a>, which sets out how we will begin to work to our new <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2015-2020</a>, and get started on making the beautiful thing.\_<br><br>\r\nSo what will the beautiful thing look like? In the coming year, we will be working hard to turn Europeana into a multi-sided platform, continuing to build a truly networked organisation, working together to create the largest repository of trusted, accessible and re-usable digital heritage in the world.\_<br><br>\r\nIt is a vision you helped us shape; the business plan in front of you is the result of close collaboration and strategic workshops with hundreds of partners across the Network. By consulting the projects and people that are so important to the future of our work, we have become stronger and better equipped to deliver real value to our wider network.\_<br><br>\r\nTogether, we defined a new set of priorities for the year ahead, and a market-facing approach that will help us achieve them. With so many exciting developments on the way, we couldn’t wait to get started!<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"pro.europeana.eu/publication/make-the-beautiful-thing-business-plan-2015\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/CoverImage.jpg\" style=\"width: 441px; height: 600px;\"></a>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So what can you expect to see this year?\_</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The business plan will introduce you to the main aims we have for the year ahead, and each of our teams will be working together to make them a reality.<br><br>\r\nMost visibly, perhaps, our portal will undergo a dramatic makeover before the end of the year, and will re-launch with fascinating exhibitions and new content. Stay tuned for the introduction of our new thematic channels in the fields of Art History and Music, which will transform user experience and engagement, making it easier than ever to navigate our collections.<br><br>\r\nSharing your data will become simpler too – this year, we will establish our new aggregation model, making it more straightforward for institutions that want to contribute to us. \_We are developing our Statistics Dashboard to add another incentive for doing so, offering direct feedback to partners on their collections in Europeana.<br><br>\r\nOur entrepreneurial capacity will also grow; by developing more tools and services, we can create new and innovative ways to re-use content, while ensuring we operate sustainably too.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Have your say!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be a number of ways you can get involved as we make all of this happen, and we really hope you do so. Look out for different events during the year, not least our Annual General Meeting in November, and keep supporting your elected Members Council, here to make your voice heard.\_<br><br>\r\nThanks again to everyone for their invaluable guidance and feedback that helped shape and inform this plan – we look forward to another busy, successful year!\_</p>"

        title: 'Latvian Ministry of Culture and Europeana sign Memorandum of Understanding'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>This week, the <a href=\"http://rigasummit2015.eu/\">Summit on the Multilingual Digital Single Market</a>\_took place in Riga. Over 350 participants from across the continent gathered together to highlight the need to address the issues facing a multilingual Europe, and to discuss the solutions and initiatives emerging from the language technology sector which could help to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Europeana, multilingualism is a major challenge and priority, and one that our community is coming together to tackle in different ways, as we explore further in the first issue of our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight/insight-issue1-multilinguality\" target=\"_blank\">new EuropeanaTech journal</a>. The Riga Summit offered a timely opportunity to make new contacts in this area, as well as strengthen existing relationships with our collaborators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also an important occasion as we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Latvian Minister of Culture, Dace Melbārde. The Memorandum looks to using Latvia’s public sector machine translation service, <a href=\"http://www.tilde.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo.lv</a>, to expand multilingual access to Latvia’s cultural heritage data through Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/DM_Memorandum_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>From left: Dr.\_Márta Nagy-Rothengass, European\_Commission, Europeana’s R&amp;D Manager, Antoine Isaac,\_Minister for Culture Ms Dace Melbārde and Tilde CEO Dr. Andrejs Vasiļjevs. Image: <a href=\"http://www.lnb.lv/en/europeana-and-ministry-culture-sign-memorandum-understanding\" target=\"_blank\">Dagnija Grīnfelde</a>, CC BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hugo.lv provides instant translation of texts, documents and websites from Latvian to English (and vice versa), and from Latvian to Russian. It is administered by the <a href=\"http://www.km.gov.lv/en/cross_sector/information.html\" target=\"_blank\">Culture Information Systems Centre</a>, and, at the moment, is tailored to general and legislative domains where it achieves excellent results, as an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight/insight-issue1-multilinguality#Article5\">article in our new journal explores</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Culture Information Systems Centre will now further adapt it for cultural heritage metadata from museums, libraries and archives. Once Hugo.lv has been successfully tuned to the cultural domain, Europeana will then integrate its results. To complement this work, the Latvian Ministry of Culture will substantially increase the number of cultural items contributed to Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By translating Latvian data provided to Europeana, there is a valuable opportunity to enhance access to the country’s digitised cultural heritage through Europeana’s <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">portal</a>, and more widely through the apps developed by re-users of Europeana data.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hugo.lv makes the most of state-of-the-art language technology developed by a Latvian company, <a href=\"http://tilde.lv\" target=\"_blank\">Tilde</a>, and we hope that the agreement shows how such technology can benefit the cultural sector more widely. As Dace Melbārde remarked, \"I am glad to sign this Memorandum which will bring new opportunities to both sides. Quality translation of Latvian cultural heritage data in the future will expand and improve multilingual access to this information and its international movement significantly. At the same time, it will enrich the content of Europeana by strengthening the diversity and availability of European cultural heritage.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope the Latvian Ministry of Culture’s approach will come to act as an example of best practice, and could be reproduced by other EU member states in the near future. As the Riga Summit on the Multilingual Digital Single Market has shown, Europe has a vibrant and growing language technology industry, with huge potential to reduce or resolve the barriers language can cause. National partners in our Network have specific needs for language and data. Their expertise puts them in an ideal position to employ the options offered by the available software, and effectively complement the generic data enrichment and translation already offered by the core of the Europeana platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more, you can <a href=\"http://www.km.gov.lv/lv/jaunumi/?news_id=6443\" target=\"_blank\">read the press release</a> from the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Latvia, and the <a href=\"http://www.km.gov.lv/jaunumi/EuropeanaMemorandum_29_04_2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">full text of the memorandum</a> too.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Promoting Estonia in Google''s Field Trip: a guest blog by the Estonian National Heritage Board'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Urve Russow, National Heritage Board of Estonia</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the last in a three part series of guest blogs about Europeana’s pilot project with Google’s Niantic Labs to add cultural heritage data to <a href=\"http://fieldtripper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Field Trip app</a>. Here, the National Heritage Board of Estonia talk about why they joined the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Heritage Board of Estonia, which looks after conservation of Estonia’s cultural heritage, also runs the only database of the nation’s monuments, <a href=\"http://C:%5CUsers%5Cigreenhal%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CMicrosoft%5CWindows%5CTemporary%20Internet%20Files%5CContent.Outlook%5C8KVMOIF6%5Cregister.muinas.ee\" target=\"_blank\">The National Register of Cultural Monuments</a>. This database contains diverse information about all national monuments in the country cared for by the state, and its data – relating to over 10,000 monuments across Estonia - can be found via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got involved with the pilot project with Google’s Field Trip as we were looking for new initiatives which support our strategy to promote Estonian cultural heritage as widely as possible, both nationally and internationally.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to use modern technology to reach fresh audiences in new and exciting ways. By having our content in Google’s Field Trip, we can use Google’s geolocation technology to provide interesting historical information to travellers exploring Estonia. We can reach tourists on the go, on their preferred device (Android/iPhone) and in their preferred language too.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/Kopu_lighthouse_x600.jpg\" style=\"width: 452px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><br><em>A highlight from the Estonian dataset, the Kõpu lighthouse</em><em>. The National Heritage Board of Estonia, CC-BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is our first project showcasing Estonian cultural content on mobile devices with such extensive outreach (the app has over one million downloads). It offered a unique opportunity to drive innovation in the region, setting an example in our own country and at EU-level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Europeana, we chose a curated selection of monuments for the app, ensuring there was rich contextual information for each. Though it was not a requirement of the project, we also worked hard to translate the rich narratives for each object into English, to make them even more easily re-usable in other international projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_Estonia_1.png\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 338px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_Estonia_2.png\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 338px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-04/GFT_Estonia_3.png\" style=\"width: 190px; height: 338px;\"><br><em>Examples of the Estonian dataset in Google's Field Trip app.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has been very interesting to work with, and we plan to continue to submit new content, and improve metadata for existing content in Europeana to make it eligible for inclusion in the project.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish to invite as many people as possible to enjoy Estonia’s fascinating cultural heritage – we are delighted that it is there, waiting for you, in Google’s Field Trip app!</p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Kerstin Herlt'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi everybody! I am Kerstin and I’m one of the 25 Council Members representing the Europeana Network. As a member of this council, we work to represent you, and to make decisions on your behalf. Representing the interests of 1,700 Network Members is no small\_task, but we will do our best to make your voice heard.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now shifting from a network to an association, and this move is not only a formality. The idea behind this shift is to become an organisation that fully builds on its members, creating a forum where you can take an active role in the development of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Promoting a sense of community</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Max, Joke, Rolf (each of whom you have already met on this blog) and Francesca from the Council as well as Aubéry from the Europeana Foundation team, I am part of the Members Council (MC) Communication Work Group. We want to make the new governance structure and decision-making processes as transparent as possible and keep you updated on the procedures and next steps. We will also coordinate upcoming campaigns regarding membership in the new Association, the next elections - we are looking for 25 more Council members! - and the AGM as well as other topics relevant to the Europeana Network.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from this group, there is another Communication group, which I am chairing together with Eleanor Kenny from Europeana: the Task Force Europeana Communicator’s Group. The aim of this Task Force is to provide recommendations for a workable and sustainable communication strategy, and one which goes beyond the exisiting network.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our guiding question is how Europeana can promote a sense of community and inclusiveness when liaising with this wider network. The Task Force can rely on the expertise of its members who are or have been responsible for communication and \_dissemination in projects such as Europeana Awareness, EUScreen XL, Europeana1914-1918 and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now, a few words about me and the sector I am representing in the Council. Since 2005, I’ve run the office of the\_<a href=\"http://www.ace-film.eu/\">Association of European Cinematheques</a>\_(ACE), which is based in Brussels and Frankfurt. ACE is a network of national and regional film heritage institutions who share the same tasks: to collect, preserve and promote Europe’s cinematographic memory.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/FAA_Feldkino1916.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 434px;\"><br><em>Still from 'Feldkino'\_(AT 1916), Source:\_<a href=\"https://filmarchiv.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Filmarchiv Austria</a>, Vienna.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We represent the interests of our community towards the European Commission, policymakers and other stakeholders. We aim to improve the economic and legal conditions for film heritage institutions so that they can fulfil their public mission in a digital environment. Our key topics are copyright and (funding for) digitisation. A big part of our work is similar to what Paul (Keller) described in his blog: we talk and write to the Commission’s officials and MEPs, respond to consultations, and try to follow the AV and film heritage policy in Brussels as closely as possible.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACE has been a member of the Europeana Foundationfrom the beginning, and I became more closely involved in 2008, when ACE partnered in the\_<a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\">European Film Gateway</a>\_(EFG) and WWI project, EFG 1914.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both projects wouldn’t have been possible without Europeana. With the European Film Gateway European film archives have built an infrastructure to make their collections accessible via a single access point. In EFG1914 ca. 3,000 films related to the First World War have been digitsed and made available on\_<a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/content/efg1914-project\" target=\"_blank\">EFG</a>\_and\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=efg1914&amp;rows=24&amp;qt=false&amp;qf=TYPE%3AVIDEO&amp;qf=-UGC%3Atrue\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>. Considering that according to estimates, only about 20% of the film production in Europe between 1914 and 1918 has survived, the body of films made available through EFG1914 is a considerable share of what has been preserved by European film archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Framestill%20from%20%20Maudite%20soit%20la%20guerre,%20Belgium%201914,%20director%20Alfred%20Machin.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 393px;\"><br><em>Still from 'Maudite soit la guerre'\_(BE 1914), D: Alfred Machin, Source:\_<a href=\"https://www.eyefilm.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">EYE Film Institute</a>\_Netherlands, Amsterdam</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A European perspective</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We share some of the same ideas as Europeana: we want copyright rules that are fit for the digital age and allow cultural institutions to make part of their collections available for education, research and other non-commercial purposes. We had some success with the Orphan Works Directive, and now we are trying to achieve a regulation for those film works that are no longer commercially exploited. If you follow the discussion about EU copyright reform, you might feel there is still a rather long way to go.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I completely agree with the declaration of the Comité des Sages\_that “digitisation is more than a technical option, it is a moral obligation” ('<a href=\"http://www.ace-film.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/CdS_Final_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The New Renaissance</a>', 2011). People have a right to access these films, as they capture our shared history and culture.\_<br><br>\r\nPublic sector cuts mean this now falls to individual member states, and I feel strongly we need EU funding for cross-border digitisation projects in order to strengthen a European perspective rather than just a national view of\_our joint history. In times where support for the concept of Europe seems to decrease, these projects are more important than ever. Hopefully by continuing to demonstrate the value of \_cross-border digitisation efforts, we can change that in the future.</p>"

That’s a vision we’ve developed over two years by working with policymakers, cultural heritage institutions, education experts and the Europeana Creative project.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/2015-03-04-MemoryMatch.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\"><br><em>Memory Game screencatch by Semantika.

The process was facilitated by the Europeana Foundation, European Schoolnet and EUROCLIO - European Association of History Educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/europeana_big_picture_1000x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 324px;\"><br><em>The group of experts and policymakers involved in creating the recommendations, at a meeting in the National Library of Latvia, Riga.

        title: 'The principles for establishing international and interoperable rights statements'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>In this post  Paul Keller &amp; Emily Gore, Co-Chairs of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/tools-resources/ipr-working-groups/international-rights-statement-working-group\" target=\"_blank\">International Rights Statement Working Group</a>, describe the progress made by the group and share the first two white papers published by the group.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>**Update** You now have until 10th July to share your comments on the White Papers</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past twelve months representatives from Europeana, <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">the DPLA</a> and <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> have been exploring the possibilities for a collaborative approach to rights statements that can be used to communicate the copyright status of cultural objects published via our platforms. This work is close to the heart of both Europeana and the DPLA as we both seek to share clear and accurate information about copyright status with users.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we operate under different copyright laws on either side of the Atlantic, we share many common issues.  For some cultural organisations there are restrictions placed by the donor on the re-use of an object, for some, national or state laws create legislative restrictions and for some, organisations may only have permission to allow educational uses of objects in their collections.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/DPLA%20image.jpg\" style=\"text-align: -webkit-center; width: 470px; height: 600px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><a href=\"http://dp.la/item/901a613284ef77a0812236f30fdd1465\">Cameramen mount ladders at tournament in Rhode Island</a>, 1931. Copyright Jones, Leslie, 1886-1967, CC BY-NC-ND.</em><span style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"> </span>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just some of the copyright issues faced  by organisations that contribute data to Europeana and the DPLA. In this cooperative effort, we have set out to build a flexible system of rights statements that allows our contributing partners to clearly communicate what users can or cannot do with the objects that are published via our platforms. This system further develops the approach taken by Europeana with the Europeana Licensing Framework making it more flexible and adapting it to the needs of institutions outside of the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On behalf of the Working Group we are pleased to share with you today two White Papers that describe our recommendations for establishing a group of rights statements, and the enabling technical infrastructure.  These recommendations include a proposal for a list of shared rights statement that both the DPLA and Europeana can use depending on the needs of our respective organisations.  </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendations for standardized international rights statements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This paper describes the need for a common standardised approach. Based on the experience of both of our organisations, we have described the principles we think any international approach to providing standardized  rights statements needs to meet. Together with this whitepaper we propose a list of twelve new rights statements that reflect the year long discussions of the Working Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming weeks Europeana and the DPLA will reach out to our core stakeholders and ask for feedback directly. In the meantime, all interested parties are encouraged to please<strong> <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1F9Zw1M\">follow this link</a> to share your thoughts and leave comments in the Rights Statement White Paper</strong>. After the end of this public feedback period on <em><strong>Friday 10th July</strong></em> (previously 26th June)  2015 we will incorporate the feedback and publish the results as a green paper that will be proposed for adoption by the DPLA, Europeana and other interested parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A proposal for a technical infrastructure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The existing Europeana Licensing Framework offers rights statements provided by third parties (the Creative Commons licenses and Public Domain Tools) and rights statements that are hosted on the Europeana portal. In order to ensure that the new rights statements can be used by institutions around the world we are proposing to host the new rights statements in their own namespace: rightsstatements.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming weeks Mark Matienzo &amp; Antoine Isaac, our leads for the technical work, will write more about the approach described in this paper.  In the meantime <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1QtmmmT\">you can <strong>follow this link</strong></a><strong> to share your thoughts and leave comments in the Technical Infrastructure White Paper</strong>. After the end of this public feedback period on <em><strong>Friday 10th July</strong></em> (previously 26th June) 2015 we will incorporate the feedback and publish the results as a green paper that will be proposed for adoption by the DPLA, Europeana and other interested parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Still to come: a proposal for governance </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer we will share our final white paper which proposes an approach to managing these statements so that they are sustainable and managed by all stakeholders.  As with the other two papers, we will incorporate the feedback that we receive into a green paper. Based on all three green papers, we will begin implementation of the new rights statements after the summer.  </p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>In this weekly series of blogs, we meet a member from your elected Members Council, finding out more about the work that they do, and the aims they have for the year ahead. This week, we hear from Johan Oomen, the head of Research and\_Development at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello! For over 15 years now, I’ve worked for the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision\" target=\"_blank\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, one of Europe’s largest audiovisual archives. During this period, the institute has successfully made the transition to the digital domain. Currently, I head up the <a href=\"http://labs.beeldengeluid.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Research and Development department</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound and Vision looks after a million hours of content and its collections continually grow, gaining over sixty thousand hours of new video and audio content each year.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, we completed the digitisation programme Images for the Future. This seven-year programme was executed in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.eyefilm.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">EYE Film Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Kennisland</a>\_and the <a href=\"http://www.nationaalarchief.nl\" target=\"_blank\">National Archives of the Netherlands</a>\_and successfully digitised a considerable amount of Dutch audiovisual heritage.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Images%20for%20the%20Future%20Men%20Cart.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 607px;\"><br><em>De bevolking van Roermond keert naar huis terug, by Nationaal Archief, on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nationaalarchief/2949028980/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr</a>. No known copyright restrictions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technical infrastructure of Sound and Vision is linked to that of the Dutch public broadcasters. Programme makers have direct access to the material and continuously re-use content in new productions. A big challenge is to provide services that provide meaningful, fine-grained and contextualised\_access to this massive collection of content, while keeping it personalised and engaging too. This is where my department plays an important role, through\_executing projects that will help us achieve\_our overarching vision of <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/PaulaUdondek/towards-more-smart-connected-and-open-audiovisual-archives\">smart, connected and open</a>\_audiovisual archives. Our work is guided by the multi-annual research agenda that we define together with the other departments, notably the museum department,\_responsible for\_visitor attraction,\_and the archive department, responsible for managing our collections in all its aspects.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside\_my work at Sound and Vision, I’m also researcher at the Web and Media group of the VU University Amsterdam where I study how participatory culture is influencing policy decisions at memory organisations. I’m also a \_board member of CLICKNL, the innovation catalyst for the Dutch Creative Industries. Common to these three positions is forging connections between the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/PaulaUdondek/building-smart-connected-an-open-archives-implementing-rd-output-in-production-systems\" target=\"_blank\">research domain and working practices</a>. I feel very fortunate to be in a position that allows me to look at this challenge from different angles, and make strategic interventions that drive this forward.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Using culture for innovation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I see Europeana as an <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/archives/3949\" target=\"_blank\">innovation catalyst</a>. \_The Europeana Network connects and supports GLAMs in their quest to provide the best possible access to their collections, initiating joint\_plans to connect heterogeneous and dispersed collections. Coming from the audiovisual domain, I’ve been involved in both <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.nl\" target=\"_blank\">EUscreen</a>\_and the <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Sounds</a>\_projects from their inception, and serve as technical director for both. These initiatives will provide a huge\_amount of new content to Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through projects such as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/\">Europeana Creative</a>\_and <a href=\"http://www.europeana-space.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Space</a>\_we’re seeing various types of re-use of distributed collections, none of which would be possible without Europeana. Europeana’s vision to ‘transform the world with culture’ is bold, powerful and ambitious. With the energy and buzzing activity of the Network, this vision is being realised, step by step, every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my role as Board Member, I contribute to Europeana’s policymaking. Given my background, I specifically focus on three topics that I’m especially passionate about:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Raising awareness in the audiovisual domain; Europeana is a source of inspiration for the creative industries (including broadcasting), and this is something that should be exploited more.</li>\r\n    <li>Open by default: we need to measure the impact of open content distribution (e.g. more user participation) and influence policymaking in this area within the Europeana network.\_</li>\r\n    <li>Massive engagement within the Europeana Network, namely by establishing a joint strategy for how\_the success of Europeana adds to the success of contributing partners.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>I feel very fortunate to be part of the Members Council and look forward to contributing to the continued success of Europeana with all the talented people in our Network. Allez Culture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow me <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johanoomen\">@johanoomen</a></p>"

The presenter then takes the challenge of quickly and simply explaining and promoting her/his work. After 60 seconds, a gong signals that the floor is to be given to the next presenter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">This fast-paced session is a great way to arouse interest and get the main idea across quickly. The posters will be given an exhibition space during the whole two days of the conference. The presenter then has the opportunity to offer conference participants more information about her/his work. For the conference participants this is a great opportunity to make contacts and exchange ideas with poster creators.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">Submit your proposal!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">If you want to present your work in one of the various fields at the event, the Ignite Talks and Posters sessions gives you the perfect opportunity to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">Simply hand in your proposal via our</span><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cultjam15\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;\">EasyChair page</span></a><span style=\"font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">.

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>At this year’s European Museums Academy annual conference, two awards, the <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage in Motion</a> Awards and the <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/4/luigi_micheletti_award_406337.html\">Luigi\_</a><a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/4/luigi_micheletti_award_406337.html\" target=\"_blank\">Micheletti Award</a>, highlighted the most exciting and inventive uses of digital and multimedia technology in European museums in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At\_the awards, museums and archives are recognised for using multimedia technology to enhance the experience of visitors in all sorts of different ways, whether to educate and enlighten, or merely to entertain.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heritage in Motion Awards\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does an archeological site beneath Utrecht’s Domplein Square have in common with a knitting museum in Nottinghamshire, a Croatian monument and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam? Well, all four were winners at this year’s Heritage in Motion awards, and as they show, achievements in this broad field can take all shapes and sizes.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/HiM-winners-2015-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nJudges and winners\_of Heritage in Motion awards. Image: <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/winners-announced-of-the-heritage-in-motion-awards-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage in Motion</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year’s Best Achievement award went to <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/project/domunder-archaeological-visitor-experience-under-the-domplein-square/\" target=\"_blank\">DOMunder</a>, an archeological experience under Domplein square in Utrecht. Dreamt up by <a href=\"http://www.tinker.nl/en/home\" target=\"_blank\">Tinker Imagineers</a>, visitors descend into the darkness beneath the medieval Cathedral Square armed with an interactive torch and an earpiece. Here, their time-travelling experience begins, and the torch, which uses infrared technology, helps visitors independently explore the archeological site, and uncover hidden stories along the way.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the website and online content category, the visitor again assumes an active, participatory role. The Framework Knitters Museum, in Nottinghamshire, UK, won the award with their interactive drama, <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/project/breaking-the-frame-interactive-film-drama/\" target=\"_blank\">Breaking the Frame</a>, which follows the story of a boy Ben, a young knitter working during the Luddite Uprising in the 19th century. As Ben faces some tough choices, visitors must decide what path he will take.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rijksmuseum’s <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/project/rijksmuseum-app-multimedia-tour-and-family-quest/\" target=\"_blank\">multimedia tour and family quest</a> got the jury’s stamp of approval in the apps for mobile devices category. A game for two to four players, families must solve mysteries, learning about the collection on the way, and even receiving a call from the museum director, Wim Pijbes.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/project/gubec-teater/\" target=\"_blank\">the Gubec Theatre</a> by the Museum of Peasant Uprisings in Gornja Stubia, Croatia, won the film and video award. This project transforms the sixteenth century Peasants Revolt into a multimedia narrative projected onto the 40 metre-long monument which commemorates the historic event.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Micheletti Award</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was another Dutch winner at the Luigi Micheletti Award,<a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/4/upload/2015_micheletti_judges_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> this year given to the National Archives of the Netherlands</a> for their exhibition, The Memory Palace. With the archive’s vast collections as the basis for eleven different stories, each designed by artists, producers and game developers, visitors take a journey through Dutch history from the Middle Ages through to the 1970s. Judges praised the archives for using their collections, mainly written documents, in such surprising and engaging ways, and for showing what “an archival institution can do when the will is there and the mind is set.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s always inspiring to see the different ways museums are using their collections to create unexpected and original experiences for their visitors in the digital age. Well done to everyone involved!</p>"

        title: 'Coordination is key: Lessons from Oslo on opening up cultural data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is a guest blog written by\_<a href=\"http://www.kulturradet.no/vis-ansatt/-/person-mcseveny-aril-sarah\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah McSeveny-Åril</a>, a senior advisor at\_the Norwegian Arts Council and\_<a href=\"https://kulturognaturreise.wordpress.com/english/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage Here</a>, a cross-agency national project in Norway. Last week, the Arts Council\_held a day-long seminar in Oslo on the potential value of opening up public\_data. Here, we hear about more and the debates and discussions that took place.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine you are sitting on a train admiring the majestic landscape of the Dovre mountain range in central Norway…<br><br>\r\nWould you know\_that this is the most important area for wild reindeer in Europe? Perhaps you're\_curious about how medieval pilgrims made their way through these mountains to Nidaros Cathedral and the grave of Saint Olav? Would you realise that the very area you are travelling through was also a strategic centre for the German army during World War II? Or maybe you're\_just wondering who lived here, as you travel on a railway built over 100 years ago?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answers to these and other questions lie in numerous national and local databases in Norway. So how can we access and use this content from the comfort of our seat as we speed through the wonderful Norwegian countryside? \_That is when Heritage Here\_comes into play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, 'Heritage Here' is\_a national project started in 2012\_with two main objectives:\_first, to help increase access to and use of public information and local knowledge about culture and nature, and second, to promote the use of better quality open data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Norsk%20Kulturr%C3%A5det%20CC%20BY%20SA.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br>\r\nA talk during the seminar. Image: Norsk\_Kulturrådet, CC BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Gathering together the decision-makers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The experiences of Heritage Here\_revealed the ever-increasing demand for access to high quality open data. To raise the discussion to a management level, the project coordinators decided to hold a seminar on the 11 May for ‘decision-makers’ from the public sector, and more specifically,\_the cultural heritage sector.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nThe Directors of the Heritage Here’s partners - the Norwegian Mapping Authority, the Arts Council Norway, the Directorate of Cultural Heritage and the National Archives - all gathered, along with the head of the National Library of Norway, to contribute to the day-long discussions.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nAmong the speakers were State Secretaries from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Local Government and Modernization; the Director of Norway’s national <a href=\"http://standard.difi.no/english\" target=\"_blank\">Agency for Public Management and eGovernment</a>; and, with his valuable\_outside perspective, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-rolf-kallman\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Members Council member</a> and Head of Sweden’s Secretariat for National Coordination of Digitisation, <a href=\"http://www.digisam.se/index.php/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Digisam</a>, Rolf Källman.<br><br>\r\nThe seminar hoped to investigate the future of the public sector's work with open data and to examine what overarching role the leaders of our cultural institutions should take.\_It proved to be a stimulating day, and coordination, cooperation, user focus, a ‘sharing-is-caring’ culture and innovation emerged as the main messages to take away.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cooperation and coordination</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director of Norway’s Agency for Public Management and eGovernment’s Ingelin Killengren applauded taking a\_cross-sector approach. For Killengren, this type of coordination proves both mutually beneficial and central to successfully making the best decisions. \"Dive in and get wet – don’t wait until everything is perfect\",\_she advised to her fellow professionals.\_<br><br>\r\nRolf Källman meanwhile pointed out the benefits of having a coordinating national body to drive forward work in this field. You need to have your \"landing strip\"\_in place, he remarked, or to put it another way – don't launch into the digitising process without ensuring there a suitable infrastructure is in place.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/CC-BY%20Ingrid%20Kittelsen.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 392px;\"><br>\r\nImage: Ingrid Kittelsen, CC BY.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Know your user</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges related to two concepts -\_‘management’ and ‘dissemination’ - were also raised both on\_the podium – by researcher Ole Marius Hylland from Telemarksforsking - and by the audience on several occasions. This reflects a shift from an institution-centric focus to a user-centric one; museums and archives are no longer the bottom line.\_They have almost become, as Digisam’s Rolf Källman out it, another ‘analogue’ “application” of cultural heritage content - just one more way for us to experience ‘data’. We must therefore\_think about ‘dissemination’ throughout the process of digitising and making data available; or, in Jørn Holme, Director of the Directorate of Cultural Heritage's words, we must\_foster “two-way communication”.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Open up for innovation\_</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another takeaway message was the importance of innovation. Thomas Nortvedt, from the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation, spoke about the government’s policies on the country’s plans for open data. He underlined that rather than seeing opening up data as the final goal in itself, we should use it as a tool to reach our goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information has to exist in the digital arena in order to be relevant and usable in other contexts. As Heritage Here project manager Sidsel Hindal put it - “the ‘smartest’ people don’t necessarily work here” -\_often outside our office walls, we find the creative minds with the ideas, skills (and even finances) to use cultural heritage content in ways we could never dream of. This year’s hackathon <a href=\"http://hack4.no/hack4/\" target=\"_blank\">#Hack4no</a>, hosted by National Mapping Authority as a follow-up to Heritage Here’s last February is an exciting example of how to enable this kind of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a day of stimulating professional exchange and great opportunities to get to know each another, the seminar successfully offered up a platform for open cross-sector discussion. The overwhelming support for opening up content held by our institutions was clear.\_Hopefully, the day will prove to provide a catalyst for decision-makers to commit to a coordinated plan for the future of open data.

        body: "<p><em><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/metadata-quality-task-force-report\" target=\"_blank\">Report and Recommendations</a> of the Europeana Task Force on Metadata Quality\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana consists of a wonderful network of people, institutions and aggregation partners. The focus of many of these people, institutions and aggregation partners is improving access to cultural heritage by making their metadata available through Europeana. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/new-metadata-quality-task-force\" target=\"_blank\">As has been previously noted</a>, metadata is the lifeblood of Europeana, and without it and our network of cultural heritage institutions we would not be what we are today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This being said the Europeana Aggregation team spends a large chunk of our time looking at this metadata (but this is our job, and we quite like it), and the quality oscillates wildly between excellent and questionable. We, as a team, began to question why institutions and aggregation partners were submitting metadata which would render their collections invisible in a digital environment, why were they exporting the material, what was their reasoning for this, and how could we as an organisation could help. It turned out that many people had the same questions and thus the Europeana Task Force on Metadata Quality was established, in response to this \_in December 2013.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/MetadataTaskForce.png\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 451px;\"><br><em>Drafting the eventual recommendations from the Task Force. Image: Marie-Claire Dangerfield, CC BY SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to see if we could answer these questions and to get an even representation of the Europeana Network, a Task Force made up of 11 members representing a variety of institutions, aggregators, data providers and metadata experience was created. The group’s task was to accumulate, assess and propose solutions to some of the key issues raised by data providers and end-users during the creation, submission and display of metadata in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we gained from this process was the knowledge that the questions raised in running the Task Force were only the tip of the digital iceberg. There is no easy solution to creating uniform quality metadata for all organisations, but we did establish our own criteria for what we considered good quality metadata. These outline that high quality metadata, \_resulted from a series of trusted processes, is findable, readable, standardised, meaningful to audiences, clear on re-use and visible. As well as these criteria, we also created a number of recommendations that we believe will aid this process in the future, from both an institutional data creation perspective, and from the perspective of a large repository.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metadata quality is essential for digital discovery, and we hope that the work of the Task Force on Metadata quality will be taken on board for further investigation, and that, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/metadata-quality-task-force-report\" target=\"_blank\">by implementing some of the recommendations outlined in the report</a>, the quality of metadata created for cultural heritage will increase overall.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Developing and implementing a technical framework for interoperable rights statements'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>In this post, Mark Matienzo (DPLA) and Antoine Isaac (Europeana Foundation), members of the International Rights Statement Working Group, discuss the key requirements and implementation plan for the technical aspect of the group’s work.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>**Update** You now have until 10th July to share your comments on the White Papers</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWithin the Technical Working Group of the <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2014/03/03/promoting-interoperability-working-on-rights/\" target=\"_blank\">International Rights Statements Working Group</a>, we have been focusing our efforts on identifying a set of requirements and a technically sound and sustainable plan to implement the rights statements under development. Now that two of the Working Group’s white papers have been released, we realised it was a good time to build on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-principles-for-establishing-international-interoperable-righ\" target=\"_blank\">introductory blog post</a> by our Co-Chairs, Emily Gore and Paul Keller. Accordingly, we hope this post provides a good introduction to our technical white paper, <em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1QtmmmT\" target=\"_blank\">Recommendations for the Technical Infrastructure for Standardized International Rights Statements</a></em>, and more generally, how our thinking has changed throughout the activities of the working group.<br></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The core requirements</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Working Group realized early on that there was the need for a common namespace for rights statements in the context of national and international projects that aggregate cultural heritage objects. We saw the success of the work undertaken to develop and implement the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a>, but realised that a more general framework was necessary to be leveraged beyond the Europeana community.  In addition, we established that there was a clear need to develop <em>persistent, dereferenceable URIs to provide human- and machine-readable representations</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In non-technical terms, this identifies a number of specific requirements. First, the persistence requirement means that the URIs need to remain the same over time, so we can ensure that they can be accessed consistently over the long term. The “dereferenceability” requirement states that when we request a rights statement by its URI, we need to get a representation back for it, either human-readable or machine-readable depending on how it's requested. For example, if a person enters a rights statement’s URI in their web browser’s address bar, they should get an HTML page in response that presents the rights statement’s text and more information. By comparison, if a piece of software or a metadata ingestion process requests the rights statement by its URI, it should get a machine-readable representation (say, using the linked data-compatible <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON-LD</a> format) that it can interpret and reuse in some predictable way.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/BnF%20scroll.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 908px;\"><br><em>ACTES DES ROIS DE FRANCE ou relatifs à leurs règnes (1195-1559). Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000126215090.html\">National Library of France</a>, Public Domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond these requirements, we also identified the need for both the machine-readable representation to provide specific kinds of additional information where appropriate, such as the name of the statement, the version of the statement, and where applicable, the jurisdiction where the rights statement applies. Finally, and most importantly, we needed a consistent way to provide translations of these statements that met the above requirements for dereferenceability, since they are intended to be reused by a broad international community of implementers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data modeling and implementation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After some discussion, we decided the best implementation for these rights statements was to develop a vocabulary implemented using the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/RDF/\" target=\"_blank\">Resource Description Framework</a> (RDF) and the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SKOS\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Knowledge Organization System</a> (SKOS) standards. These standards are broadly used throughout the Web, and are both used within the Europeana Data Model and the <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/developers/map/\" target=\"_blank\">DPLA Metadata Application Profile</a>. We are also looking at the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Submission/ccREL/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Rights Expression Language</a> (ccREL) and<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/\" target=\"_blank\"> Open Digital Rights Language</a> (ODRL) models to guide our development. At this stage, we have a number of modeling issues still open, such as which properties to use for representing various kinds of human-readable documentation or providing guidance on how to apply community-specific constraints and permissions. Deciding whether (and how) rights statements can be extended in the future is also an intriguing point. We are looking for feedback on all these topics!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the process, we have been managing our draft implementation of the RightsStatements.org data model in a <a href=\"https://github.com/rightsstatements/data-model\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> to allow for ease of collaboration across the technical subgroup. As the proposed rights statements become finalized following the discussion period on the two white papers, we will be working to provide a web server to host the machine-readable and human-readable versions of the rights statements in accordance with our requirements. To guide our implementation, we are building on the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/\">Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies</a> with a slight modification to allow for better support for the multilingual requirements of the Working Group. Advice from the technical experts in our community is also highly welcome on this approach. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end of the public feedback period has been set to <em><strong>Friday 10th July</strong></em> (previously 26th June) 2015, but the Technical Working Group will try to answer comments on the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1QtmmmT\" target=\"_blank\">white paper</a> on a regular basis, in the hope of setting up a continuous, healthy stream of discussion.<br><br>\r\nAcknowledgements<br>\r\nThe technical work on implementing the rights statements has been deeply collaborative, and would not have been possible by the dedicated efforts of the members of the Technical Working Group: </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<em>Bibliothèque Nationale de Luxembourg</em>: Patrick Peiffer</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Digital Public Library of America</em>: Tom Johnson and Mark Matienzo</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Europeana Foundation</em>: Valentine Charles and Antoine Isaac</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Kennisland</em>: Maarten Zeinstra</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>University of California San Diego:</em> Esmé Cowles</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>University of Oregon</em>: Karen Estlund</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em>Florida State University</em>: Richard J.

        body: "<p><em>Today's\_blog\_has been written with Tamara Butigan Vucaj, deputy director at the National Library of Serbia.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aggregator for Serbian cultural heritage has been launched in Belgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until now, cultural heritage from Serbia has come into Europeana through aggregators like <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a>, and projects like Europeana Collections 1914-1918 and Europeana Awareness. The new aggregator will enable more of the country’s fascinating heritage to be published through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tamara Butigan Vucaj, deputy director at the National Library of Serbia, said, “The setting up of an aggregator in Serbia is important as it will provide a central, national point for contribution to Europeana.” The first results are expected at \_the end of 2015.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/BelgradePubDom.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 422px;\"><br><em>Belgrade.

The event was the result of cooperation between a Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Serbia, the Serbian Ministry of Culture and Information, the National Library of Serbia and the Serbian European Integration Office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Serbia in Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the event was dedicated to ‘Serbia in Europeana’. Organisers wanted to demonstrate the value of working with Europeana and to introduce the librarians to the Serbian heritage already available in Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bgb.rs/english/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Belgrade City Library</a> has been involved in two Europeana projects: <a href=\"http://www.locloud.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">LoCloud</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Awareness</a>. Predrag Djukic, assistant director, encouraged Serbian librarians to think about using LoCloud’s unique ‘Cloud for Culture’ to set up their digital libraries.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also talked about the family history roadshows held in three Serbian cities - Belgrade, Cacak and Novi Sad - to gather material about people’s experiences of the First World War to add to Europeana 1914-1918. This generated a great deal of interest from both Serbian librarians and the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nb.rs/index.php?change_lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">The National Library of Serbia</a> was a partner in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a> project. Nemanja Kalezic, who coordinated their activity, talked about lessons learnt from this project and also about Veliki rat, a national digital library on the Great War. Serbian content holders are invited to contribute to this digital library by emailing <a href=\"mailto:velikirat@nb.rs\">velikirat@nb.rs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Sofronijevic, head of library systems, digitisation and cultural programmes at the <a href=\"http://www.unilib.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">“Svetozar Markovic” University Library</a> talked about their participation in Europeana Libraries and Europeana Newspapers. Thanks to these projects (and library domain aggregator, <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a>) about 700,000 digital pages from the University Library are now available on Europeana, including 400,000 searchable newspaper pages.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/BelgradePortal.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam dedicated a few slides of his presentation to answer the question: Why Europeana? His convincing argument: to be a part of community, to be seen, to find out what’s going on and to socialise.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mpu.rs/english/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Museum of Applied Art</a> successfully contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Fashion project</a>. Curator Dejan Sandic talked about being the first Serbian museum to work with Europeana by digitising and putting online 500,000 museum objects. Dejan also reflected on two challenges they faced: achieving the standards set by Creative Commons licences and the Europeana Data Model.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/EurFashion.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 338px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kinoteka.org.rs/eng/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Yugoslav Cinémathèque</a>, National Film Archive of the Republic of Serbia, participated in the<a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"> EFG - European Film Gateway</a> project, as well as in its extension, <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EFG1914</a>. Through EFG1914, Yugoslav Cinémathèque provided 63 films about the Great War, all of which are now available to watch online through EFG and Europeana. \_Aleksandar Erdeljanovic, director of the Film Archive, \_showed the film “Life in the Serbian Army Camp in Banjica” explaining aspects of the restoration and digitisation process.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These presentations go to show that there is great momentum in Serbia to collect, digitise and share the nation’s cultural heritage. The development of a national aggregator will make sure that more of that heritage is shared with Europeana and the people of Europe.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        body: "<p>Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by two things: history and gadgets. It started with playing Commodore64 games and tinkering with all sorts of computer equipment. In between games, I watched \_every single National Geographic documentary I could get my hands on. Fast-forward to 2007 and I got the chance to combine both of my passions by founding <a href=\"http://www.semantika.si/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantika</a> – an IT company specialising in cultural heritage.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nOur first product was a standards-compliant Collection Management System, which is now used in a lot of museums in central Europe. After years of hard, but certainly rewarding work, Semantika is widely known as a reliable partner, thinking strategically and successfully. We \_mostly work in the field of cultural heritage, but have taken on some very interesting projects throughout the years. We broadened our horizons with online banking solutions and airline systems. Our clients are spread around the world.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nStill, our focus and our passion remains cultural heritage in all of its forms. I am officially working as a research and development lead, which means that, amongst other things, I develop new products and services, manage our clients and projects, and grow our company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Museumsoftheworld.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 363px;\"><br><em>Museums of the World homepage:\_<a href=\"http://museu.ms\">http://museu.ms</a></em><br><br>\r\nI’m very proud of our online platform, which includes <a href=\"http://museu.ms/\" target=\"_blank\">Museums of the World</a> and the award-winning <a href=\"http://museums.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Museums.EU</a>. Both are intended for the digital presentation and promotion of museums and galleries in Europe and across the world. Because of overwhelmingly positive feedback from museums and a steady increase in visitors, we’re now adding the ability for museums to get additional revenue and monetise their content by creating “<a href=\"http://museu.ms/services\" target=\"_blank\">Museums Services</a>”, which range from collection management services, mobile apps and custom museum websites, to enabling visitors to buy art prints from museum collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Museumsoftheworld2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 369px;\"><br><em>Museums of the World museum listing</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got involved with Europeana because I strongly believe that it represents one of Europe’s key assets. Over the last four years, Semantika has been a partner in four Europeana projects, so we’ve been able to work with Europeana in different ways. From making publishing collections easier with Europeana Inside to creative re-use of content with Europeana Creative and Europeana Food &amp; Drink.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why is this important to me?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve been working for and with the cultural heritage sector for more than 10 years, gaining extensive knowledge and understanding of the field. As a Councillor, I can share my insights on strategic and technical perspectives with the Network, helping Europeana to shift from being a huge content repository to a truly invaluable resource for everyone interested in cultural history.<br>\r\nEurope’s cultural heritage is priceless and I feel it’s our duty to preserve it, to make it easier for people to discover, explore and enjoy, to use and re-use. We have all the means necessary: great people and organisations; amazing technology; we can even find the money to do it. It seems we just need one last thing: to successfully join our forces and do something amazing.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m excited about Europeana’s move towards becoming a platform.\_<br>\r\nA lot has already been done, but there’s still so much to improve! I would like us to focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>making publishing content to Europeana a painless, “one click” process</li>\r\n    <li>increasing the quality of content in Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>improving searching functionalities to enable people to find relevant content</li>\r\n    <li>enabling and encouraging re-use \_of the cultural resources available in Europeana\_</li>\r\n    <li>connecting with other institutions and networks</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>I look forward to working with all of you on the new successes of Europeana!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The Europeana Newspapers project recently passed its final review with flying colours, with all work packages ‘exceeding expectations and surpassing targets’. Huge congratulations to everyone involved!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Newspapers is the largest project aggregating material for Europeana. That means over its three-year lifespan it has provided more items of cultural and historical interest than any other project - in this case, 3.6 million digitised newspapers (double its target) of nearly 1,000 newspaper titles from over 20 European libraries.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of using the Europeana Data Model to structure the metadata describing the newspapers, it is possible to show that each issue is part of a collection. This means if you happen across, say, an issue of Polish newspaper ‘Dziennik śląskie’ from 29 May 1915, you can easily find the issue from the day before or the day after, or indeed from any other date. Europeana Newspapers is one of the first projects to use this hierarchical representation for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/Slaski.jpg\" style=\"width: 364px; height: 500px;\"><br><em>Dziennik Śląski​,\_<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/Dziennik_%C5%9Al%C4%85ski/1915/5/29\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a>, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project is a ground-breaker in another way too - it’s the first time a large-scale project has delivered both images and full texts to Europeana. So, as well as a high quality image of a newspaper page, the text from that page is shown separately in a ‘Content’ box, so you can search, highlight and copy it. That’s useful for researchers, or anyone wanting to copy and paste the text elsewhere, like into a translation engine. There are now over 11.5 million newspaper pages presented in this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browsing these old newspapers is addictive, as shown by the phenomenal length of time that people spend on the dedicated interface built for the project and hosted by The European Library - nearly 15 minutes per session on average. That compares to less than 5 minutes for The European Library site in general.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/EurNewspapers.JPG\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 460px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The project also enhanced a <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/public-materials/tools/\">set of impressive tools</a> for libraries to use in their newspaper digitisation work for things like improving the quality of automated text recognition. This has helped stimulate new work at many of the libraries involved in the project, such as the <a href=\"http://digital.tessmann.it/tessmannDigital/archivioGiornali/giornali\">Frederich Tessman Library in Italy</a>, which has used the tools to enhance its own interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the project has now officially ended, its work continues. Newspapers are still to be added from another five countries, and the whole corpus will be migrated to the new Europeana Cloud data storage system. The newspaper content is already available on the Europeana portal but to encourage greater exploration of it, the bespoke interface will be migrated from The European Library to Europeana. Look out for that in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s clear that Europeana Newspapers has met a real need from the public and research communities to enable full and searchable access to historic newspaper archives online. No more microfiche, no more gently turning yellow fragile pages that were never meant to last. Newspapers live on! So it’s congratulations again to all involved with Europeana Newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Some days ago at the <a href=\"http://conventagusti.com/maker/\">Maker Convent Barcelona</a> we had the opportunity of gathering 25 creative minds from different backgrounds, interested in the co-creation of new applications and 3D printing related projects based on Europeana content. It was the first of four “pre-events” before the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/?page_id=36#\">Europeana Creative Culture Jam</a> that will take place the 9th and 10th of July in Vienna at the Austrian National Library, as the final showcase event of the <a href=\"http://europeanacreative.eu\"> Europeana Creative</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day was very intense, as it had the goal to co-create and foster the development of prototypes (such as mobile/web application mockups, ready-made physical products, 3D printed objects or new services) that promote and reuse digital heritage content from Europeana. The workshop, facilitated by <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a>, brought together different participants sharing ideas and designs, inspiring one another and testing new ways of integrating digital heritage into new concepts. As we began, a lot of ideas came up and were sketched throughout the session, and scenarios were brainstormed and framed in specific areas of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7071/6900078194_1926ccc98b.jpg\" width=\"477\"><br><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/scanner-fm/6900078194\">Convent Sant Agustí by Scanner FM</a> at Flickr, Creative Commons by-nc/2.0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the group of participants in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CultJam15\">#CultJam15</a> there were different kinds of profiles that focused on specific areas, such as heritage related to jewellery and fashion, education processes, architecture (from geolocating content to structural-constructive elements) and 3D print-enthusiasts. We focused the Workshop on separating the co-creation into clear, step-by-step phases, which were very enriching as the day advanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction helped to give an overall view of the type of content that participants could find, so they knew about the material that is freely available for re-use via <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a>, exploring with tools like <a href=\"http://www.culturecam.eu/\">Culture Cam</a> or other data collections available via <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/#\">Europeana Labs</a>. We commented on projects such as our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/#tag=pilot\">eCreative Pilots</a> or the awesome concepts behind our Challenge winners in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-creative/europeana-creative-blog/and-the-challenges-winners-are\"> Education </a> , <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-creative/europeana-creative-blog/and-the-2nd-challenge-winners-are-timepatch-and-buitenplaats-mob\"> Social Networks and Tourism </a> , and <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/blogs/research-amp-development-en/201503/awards-best-reuse-ideas\">Design</a>. Also, thanks to a previous informal meeting held the day before, we were able to bring specific projects and inputs shared by the participants that had a direct relationship with digital heritage, in multiple media formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"264\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/93/fb/32/93fb325939c5bd57b25e30d51fef36e4.jpg\" width=\"471\"><br><em>Cards with Europeana content for the session. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this first introduction to eCreative’s context, we focused on the “hands-on mode” in which to bring the makers “vibe”, so we could open up the creativity process for our potential users of Europeana. The participants classified themselves as “Institution / Provider of Content”, “Designer / Artist”, “Content Diffuser / Enthusiast” or “Programmer / Developer”, and the teams organized freely yet overall they ended up multidisciplinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5c/a9/51/5ca9514167786abd74671ba63de15db1.jpg\" width=\"282\"><br><em>Presenting the Culture Cam prototype. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the exploration of the first ideas, the groups organized diverse scenarios in which content and user needs assembled and adapted to summarized areas around 3D, apps and others that could emerge. We knew that getting something meaningful done within such a short amount of time could be stressful, but we encouraged everyone to take a break every now and then to relax and enjoy the event.<br><br><img alt=\"\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/95/68/7a/95687a7d0d9ef9594e263d22570d8c73.jpg\" width=\"482\"><br><em>Different clusters for scenarios. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the first proposals started to flow...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Tanques de joieria (Jewellery clasp)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/94/a0/b0/94a0b088fe99279a9f45d3801d8bce79.jpg\" width=\"471\"><br><em>Tanques de joieria diagram. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concept, based on the needs of the professional sector of jewellers as well as on the idea of recovering old and simple techniques from heritage collections, pointed to the opportunity of having different sets of images of a given old clasp (open, closed, detail, etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea reflects the need to have some dimension, category or section around Europeana for functional objects, caring about specific needs in terms of metadata and quality, resolution, and level of detail of objects and its corresponding images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The co-design developed in this case covers the animations and even 3D models which would help to inspire works as a reinterpretation of new technical solutions for creating bracelets and similar pieces according to curated collections, and also a refined search for this type of specific content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Turismo Universal (Universal Tourism)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b5/04/40/b50440dd5a452a587229ac33c9fcdd43.jpg\" width=\"471\"><br><em>Turismo universal diagram. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea comes as an app that may tackle the inclusion of new techniques of cultural-heritage interpretation through city monuments. These new techniques are focused on groups of users, tourists that visit a city, who are blind or deaf (as hearing-impaired) as giving an extensive, accessible context to Europeana’s content. It has two type of materials on site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the one hand, digital files geolocated at the actual monuments throughout the city that can be accessed from mobile devices. The proposal is to use sound-guides or narrated explanations for a blind person, and as visual videos for a deaf or hearing-impaired. On the other hand, tactile models of the most remarkable elements of the site. This 3D modeled objects are from the architecture or specific details (decoration or objects related) and also provide a short explanation in Braille.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add an extra layer of participation, the project involves educators to develop extra content, as to the actual user, in which they can record their experience and share it with other participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Europeana Glocal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ed/ab/40/edab401ac5ee4e865e58b492d883f871.jpg\" width=\"473\"><br><em>Europeana Glocal. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concept brings in a new way of understanding digital content, which can work on a shared global context but has a focused, local impact. The intention is to create an app which sets the profile of users as Content-editor and Visitor. The tools given by the app try to help to geolocalize existing content at Europeana (Content-Editor), allowing visitors to search/browse through GPS locations where they can check heritage material available by ‘radius’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The functionalities from one type of user to another is set as the user enters the app and chooses the profile they want. From the Content-Editor profile, the app could give access to edit tools connected to the Europeana database in which they can fill the geo-tagging into different materials. They can also prepare guidelines for future tours around specific elements (say, Roman Barcelona can relate to Roman objects, architecture, plans, text, etc).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Visitors profile gives the user access to enhanced material and adds a search tool based on their location, and they can actually filter by their own preferences. Parameters as areas of interest, group of providers, subjects, the type of content (audio, 3D, text, images…) or even the language could be the empowering criteria for the possible tourist on-the-spot. This project has a direct match with the universal tourism proposal, and could be a perfect match but has a more general approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Portal Capitell-3D (3D-Capitels Portal)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"266\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/34/3e/8d/343e8dda6e6390cf18b953eaeb0d5ee5.jpg\" width=\"473\"><br><em>Working on the Capitell-3D concept. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This concept intends to be a website in which you can find 3D models of digitalized architectural elements as capitels and a database on architecture heritage. The portal would have an in-depth approach to specific content, create a link with Europeana content to enrich architectural heritage research. The capitels can be visualized as they are, giving information on the materials, the date of creation, location (quantitative data), and the portal would focus on adding more information on the iconographic, artistic interpretation and finding the connectors with similar art-works and 3D models. There are two types of “personas” or end users for this concept: the Experts (research &amp; heritage) and the Educators (teachers &amp; students) who would navigate the site by different content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Experts version can give access to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>3D models (print/editable)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Extended information on how the capitels were originally made</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>A simulation of a missing part of a capitels</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Indexed relationship of material in Europeana (comparative taxonomy)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Visualization tools (like a transparency tool to compare various spires overlayed)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Precise volumetric properties which can also be compared or searched through the actual portal</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Extra content such as articles, meta-data or other related links</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The Educators version would have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Artistic-cultural heritage Interpretation index cards on spires</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Possible educational materials on artistic movements (for example, Catalan Romanesque)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>3D models (print version)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Videos or other content related to the open educational programs</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>There’s a direct relationship between the needs of specific professionals and museums or institutions, as a Conservator and Restorer role could make certain types of content accessible to a more general public or to educational communities, something that was seen extremely positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) City Craft</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d1/09/3d/d1093d28f79cc6574c823e6afaaebce4.jpg\" width=\"331\"><br><em>Working on the City Craft concept. By <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/search/?q=%23CultJam15\">Platoniq on Pinterest</a> CC-by-nc-sa</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This proposal would engage with young users such as teenagers (age 15) through a gaming experience based on the Mindcraft success. The City Craft would be structured on an open access digital archive (images or plans from Europeana), organized in different levels (gamification), where families could participate by sharing knowledge on specific locations or buildings to create digital reproductions of city heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typology of the buildings could vary from historical sites, social centers, old shops or any other location that could be interesting for the community. The game has a double function: connect individual (inter-generational) testimonies on city heritage to create a fun and engaging way to experience heritage for teenagers, by building it. The digital files created could then be reproduced in lego models, piece by piece.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Hi! My name is Uldis and I am a librarian. I enjoy making sense of things, and I like when things make sense. I like to understand why things are the way they are, how they interconnect, and how they can be changed to work better. This is probably why I am now the head of strategic development at the National Library of Latvia and vice president of Latvian Library Association.<br><br>\r\nAt the National Library, my main duty is to develop the library's strategy, to define our priorities, to keep track of how they are implemented and, if necessary, to revisit the way things are done. I’m also involved in development of external planning when there’s any impact on libraries – national library strategy, national digitisation strategy, library law, copyright law, legal deposit law. In short – I have to make sure the interests of National Library, and Latvian libraries in general, are looked after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/National_Library_of_Latvia_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"><br><em>The National Library of Latvia. Image: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Library_of_Latvia.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, CC BY SA.</em><br><br>\r\nThis led to me working with Europeana. The National Library of Latvia has been involved with Europeana since the EDLnet project and has taken part in many Europeana related projects – Europeana Travel, Europeana Local, Europeana Newspapers, Europeana Sounds, Europeana Awareness. As my unit is responsible both for international projects and the digital library services of National Library, which includes aggregation of Latvian content into Europeana, I have been closely involved in collaboration with Europeana for the last six years, which has led to my participation in the development of Europeana strategies and business plans, and now – to the Europeana Association Members Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Achieving our shared potential</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that Europeana is an incredible service with lots of untapped potential. I think the previous years could probably be thought of as the formative childhood years – a time of rapid development, when some things have been brilliant, and some, a learning curve. It’s okay. That’s why they are called growing pains! Now, it’s the time for Europeana to mature and to realise its full potential – and all the signs that this is happening are there.<br><br>\r\nOne of the most important changes is the revised governance structure of Europeana. Europeana has always excelled at involving its stakeholders. The rebirth, however, of the informal Europeana Network as a Europeana Association, a formal structure with strictly defined responsibilities both towards the stakeholders and the Europeana Foundation, is a great step forward in making sure there is strong bond between the Foundation and the wide Network of content providers and other stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/RigaEventEuropeana.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 210px;\"><br><em>A recent event, 'Europeana for Education and Creative Industries' at The National Library of Latvia. Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/16790443638/in/album-72157651193869167/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>, CC BY SA.</em><br><br>\r\nThe content providers are the lifeblood of Europeana – without them it would not exist. It is vitally important that there is a strong feedback, that the stakeholders can identify with the goals of Europeana and can directly steer the way it develops, as well as fully enjoy the benefits from being involved in Europeana. There are many benefits, both direct – for example, an increased flow of visitors to their web resources (and I welcome the development of the dashboard!) and indirect – such as opportunities to share best practices and borrow from experiences of other Network members. I believe the Network is something bigger than the sum of its parts and with establishment of the Europeana Association, it will only grow stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A platform, an infrastructure, an enabler</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This multiplier effect applies more widely, to society in general, too. The fact that Europeana makes centuries of European heritage and knowledge available has an enormous impact, and no single institution could achieve this. The true potential of the content can be realised fully once we stop thinking of Europeana as a go-to destination and reimagine it as a platform, an infrastructure, and an enabler. Europeana should not be a single well; it should be a whole irrigation system.<br><br>\r\nAs such, I am truly excited about the current focus on Europeana as a platform. I think it benefits us – content providers – enormously. It allows us to benefit from Europeana’s collaboration with third-party content re-users and distribution channels – from Wikimedia and Pinterest to the users of Europeana API. This lets our content reach audiences we could never have dreamed of reaching – provided we let our content go to the places people expect to find it.<br><br>\r\nWe – both content providers and Europeana – have to be ready for unexpected and previously unthinkable synergies with different partners. We have to realise that alone, numbers – of digital objects or visitors – do not really mean anything. It’s all about impact we achieve, and to have an impact we have to have a sound strategy; we have to make sure our content and services are of the highest quality, relevant to user needs and easy to use. I am happy that these are all priorities in Europeana’s strategy and I am honoured to have the chance to help implement and refine this strategy through my work with the Members Council. #AllezCulture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Placing culture at the heart of Europe''s Digital Single Market'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In recent weeks, there’s been a great deal of discussion about Europe’s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Single Market</a> (DSM) - one of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s top three priorities for his five year term. On May 6th, the Commission set out 16 initiatives ‘<a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-4919_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">to make it happen</a>’, the first step in a <a href=\"http://webershandwick.be/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-EU-Digital-Single-Market-Roadmap-A-Weber-Shandwick-brief-May-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> working towards legislative change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the European Commission, there’s no time to waste. EU Digital Commissioner Günther Oettinger has stressed the need to act decisively so Europe can start to play catch up, particularly with the US, and fulfil its potential as “<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/docs/dsm-swd_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">world leader in the digital economy</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So where do we as a community with a strong digital focus fit in?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Network has long supported Europe’s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Agenda</a>. And it’s clear that, as part of that agenda, digital cultural heritage has a distinct role to play in the future of a harmonised market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DSM Strategy is divided into three pillars; importantly the second, which aims to boost development of innovative networks and online services, and third, aimed at maximising growth potential of the digital economy, sit in fruitful dialogue with our own priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Network we have been spreading the message for some time now that access to cultural content drives innovation, nurtures cultural diversity and enriches learning. Importantly, by offering a shared resource available across borders to the citizens and businesses that need it, we make sure that these benefits are not limited to a single region or nation - which is fundamental to the vision the Digital Single Market Strategy sets out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/EuropeanaInfographic.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that our shared culture resonates across borders and we have worked hard to ensure that we make cultural content available to all by creating Europe-wide standards and promoting interoperability. In fact, Europeana is a global leader in the field and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/data-guidelines/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> has been adopted by institutions in the US and South Korea among other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture can bridge divisions between sectors too. The work that we perform together offers wide-ranging benefits to key sectors; it can boost tourism - Europeana’s content reaches travellers through apps like <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/reach-cultural-tourists-through-europeana-in-googles-field-trip\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Field Trip</a> - strengthen <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20for%20Research.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> and enhance <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\" target=\"_blank\">education</a> (just read the recommendations Europeana has published for each if you want to know how!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Labs</a> and my work with <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a>, I have seen just how much potential there is for us to act as an all-important bridge between heritage institutions and Europe’s creative industries, giving them the tools and content they need to create services and apps. Exciting pilot projects like <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a> and <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> are just two innovative examples of this, showing the kinds of things that can be done when our collections are combined with the imagination of creative entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making our value known</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission’s Digital Agenda has talked about creating ‘digital highways’, and it’s a useful way to think about what we, as a Network and community, all do and the contribution that we already make to the Digital Single Market. By working together on issues such as cross-border interoperability, multilingualism and towards a cloud-based infrastructure to share data, as highlighted in <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2020</a>, we are building these important highways through Europe’s heritage, opening them up to everyone today, and ensuring they endure for generations to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harnessing this economic and social potential of culture is where we must continue to make our voices heard. It’s vital that we keep on working together to provide good quality, standardised data available in all EU languages. It is also <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/europes-cultural-heritage-institutions-deserve-better/\" target=\"_blank\">essential that the EU copyright rules applying to cultural heritage institutions</a> provide them more room to make their collections available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is just as important that we continue to make policymakers and politicians aware of our valuable contribution to the Digital Single Market and to the broader Digital Agenda. The current conversations at EU level throw up as many issues as they answer. We need to make sure we are part of that conversation, highlighting our sector’s vision of high quality cultural content available to all and the solutions we are driving to make that possible.</p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Gill Hamilton'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi! I’m Gill Hamilton - I’m a librarian, and I work at the <a href=\"http://www.nls.uk\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Scotland</a> in Edinburgh, Scotland. I’ve been working with computers, library systems and all things digital for more years than I care to remember, but I’m not a tech-head or an uber-geek! I’m just interested in technology as a means to an end, and that end is providing people with open access to information. I have the perfect role for doing this at the National Library, where I am the Digital Access Manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Preserving Scotland’s past</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>National Library of Scotland preserves the memory of the Scottish nation with collections that span the centuries, from earliest times to the digital age. The 24 million items in our collections document the influence of Scots at home and abroad, while also reflecting the ideas and cultures of the world. The Library supports education, research, business and innovation and its work enhances the reputation of Scotland as a country with a rich cultural heritage and a vibrant future. Our mission is to develop and improve the global understanding of Scotland’s cultural life by making a significant and lasting contribution to global knowledge, and by pursuing opportunities to work in collaboration to develop learning, research and enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/NatLibScotlandCCBYNCSA.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 405px;\"><br><em>An image from National Library of Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200316/BibliographicResource_3000092750387.html\" target=\"_blank\">'Washing day on the banks of the Ypres-Comines Cana</a>', CC BY-NC-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Opening up knowledge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As Digital Access Manager, I lead on the delivery of and access to our extensive digitised, licensed, born digital and legal deposit non-print collections. I also oversee the Library’s integrated library and resource discovery systems and the website (so you see there is some “tech” in my job!). I relish this role - I love working to help people find information. I particularly enjoy the challenges of managing the tidal wave that is the tens of thousands of digital resources that we process every month. I’m also excited about working on the Library’s project to open a <a href=\"http://www.nls.uk/news/press/2013/10/kelvin-hall-project-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">new centre in Glasgow</a> which will focus on our digital and moving image collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the office I am a Board member and Trustee of the registered charity <a href=\"https://wikimedia.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia UK</a> (WMUK). WMUK is the UK Wikimedia Chapter and is dedicated to the promotion of distributed and open knowledge and also supports Wikipedia editors and contributors. I became involved with Wikimedia UK because the Library worked in partnership with them while we employed our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/National_Library_of_Scotland\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedian-in-Residence</a>. I regularly participate and host local <a href=\"http://scot.okfn.org\" target=\"_blank\">Open Knowledge Foundation Chapter</a> meetings, and of course I am also a Member of the Europeana Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I initially got involved with Europeana because I wanted to ensure that the Library’s collections were made available via such a fantastic resource. I helped influence, along with many others, the requirement for partners to submit their metadata for inclusion in Europeana under Creative Common CC.0 public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/NatLibScotlandCCBYNCSA2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 465px;\"><br><em>Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200316/BibliographicResource_3000092750708.html\" target=\"_blank\">The National Library of Scotland</a>, CC BY-NC-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>My ambitions for Council</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I have two goals whilst a Member of Council: to help small organisations become a part of Europeana, and to promote open access to cultural heritage organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years I have seen how small organisations, such as community libraries, small museums and local historical groups, are sometimes left behind or forgotten when there are large scale initiatives like Europeana. Many of these organisations have fantastic and often unique collections that contribute to our rich European culture and history. They might lack, however, the resources and / or skills to make these collections available. I will work in Council to such organisations take part in Europeana, either with assistance from a data aggregating partner or by proposing the development of tools to enable them to submit data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that too many digital cultural heritage objects are “closed” - not available for open use and re-use. I understand and appreciate the many challenges in making resources truly open as I have had to, and am continuing to, address these issues at National Library of Scotland. I will work earnestly within Council to promote open access. I will share all my knowledge and expertise in this area to encourage open licensing of our rich European cultural heritage.<br><br>\r\nI look forward to working on your behalf.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>This is a guest blog by Bruno Racine, Chair of the Europeana Foundation, and President of <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bibliothèque national de France</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The culture of Europe is vast and varied. Europeana 280, a Europe-wide campaign to celebrate our shared art history and promote Europeana’s brand new Art History Channel, will reflect one area of this rich heritage.<br><br>\r\nTo take part in this campaign, each of Europe’s 28 countries is invited to choose ten artworks they feel represent their nation’s contribution to Europe’s artistic and cultural heritage. The works will then be digitised and added to Europeana’s platform, featuring as a special collection in the new channel when it launches in early 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Europeana Foundation we will be working with galleries, museums and national Cultural Ministries from across Europe, with support from the European Commission. We need the involvement of the Europeana Network and all our memory institutions to support and promote the campaign in your own country and in your networks across Europe. In doing so, you can help us reach new audiences, and engage them with the importance of art, and its role in our shared past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Art%20History%20landing%20page.jpeg\" style=\"width: 439px; height: 750px;\"><br><em>A mock-up of the Art History Channel</em>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe 280 campaign not only supports the Europeana Art History channel launch by promoting it, but by drawing in new content too, making sure all 28 countries are represented. By highlighting different paintings and artists from each of Europe’s member states, and showing prominent works with their lesser-known but often seminal counterparts, it introduces the unique perspective on art history the channel will provide. We hope that this approach will also get people excited about their shared cultural heritage.<br><br>\r\nEuropeana Channels are an innovative way to show off the best content in Europeana, giving users a more curated journey through our collections. The artworks will be displayed alongside other relevant materials, such as manuscripts and letters, allowing people to explore the pieces of art in their wider context.<br><br>\r\nBy promoting the 280 pieces widely through social media, the public will also be invited to have their say, as well as having the chance to vote, using <a href=\"https://theartstack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Artstack</a>, for the works they find most inspiring. We are scheduling a couple of other events to support Europeana 280: a curated virtual exhibition and, at a Ministerial supported launch during the Dutch Presidency in early 2016, we will show an interactive installation of the digital art pieces we have collated.<br><br>\r\nThe campaign promises to provide a fresh and engaging perspective of European art history, allowing people to enjoy publicly owned works never shown together before and in a new way. We are delighted at the support we have received so far, and hope you will join us on this exciting journey exploring Europe’s rich and varied artistic heritage. Over the summer we will bring you more news.<br><br>\r\nWith so many artistic treasures to choose from, which ten will you and your country’s cultural institutions nominate?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Guest post by Merete Sanderhoff, Statens Museum for Kunst<br>\r\nWith special thanks to Sanna Marttila for <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-creative-at-smk-fridays-in-copenhagen\" target=\"_blank\">the title</a>!*<br><br>\r\nEverybody is talking about it. Some are doing it. But what’s the value of open collections? Statens Museum for Kunst (SMK) in Copenhagen set out to demonstrate what freely re-usable digitised collections can be used for at a big remix event on 29 May.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than 5 years, SMK has been working towards releasing our digitised collections in the Public Domain. This has been a long and winding process, and we’re far from done yet. But we do have <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/use-of-images-and-text/free-download-of-artworks/\" target=\"_blank\">25,000 images available for free download</a>, and that’s worth celebrating!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the value of open?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Open collections are a hot topic these days. We’ve seen some amazing and inspiring examples of cultural institutions taking bold steps to release their images to support learning and creativity within broader and more diverse audiences. But still, it’s not self-evident to everyone – both heritage professionals and users – what open collections are all about, and what kind of value they offer. At SMK, we’ve been looking for an opportunity to demonstrate to the world why we’ve been working so hard to release our Public Domain collections for free re-use. So when we got a chance to partner with Europeana Creative to host an event about creative re-use of cultural heritage, we said yes!<br><br>\r\nWe teamed up with SMK Fridays, a monthly evening event at our museum that caters for a young urban audience. It offered the perfect platform to get the word out to people who intuitively understand the remix concept and feel comfortable about playing around with digitised cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Remixing the originals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The result was <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/setartfree\" target=\"_blank\">SMK Friday Set art free!</a> – an event focused on showing how open collections can inspire creativity and new, playful ways of interacting with cultural heritage. At the core of the event was a design challenge – one of the pilots of the Europeana Creative project. We challenged 13 artists and designers to remix artworks from the SMK Public Domain collections, to be shown at the pop-up exhibition <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/exhibition-mix-it-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Mix it up!</a> The remixes were exhibited in the galleries next to the originals on the SMK Friday and over the weekend. It was amazing to witness the diversity and high quality of work that the artists and designers submitted as response to the challenge. The work ranged from a digital rendering by <a href=\"http://www.filipvest.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Filip Vest</a> of <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/exhibition-mix-it-up/filip-vest/\" target=\"_blank\">22 skies</a> from Danish Golden Age paintings mashed up into a huge frieze projected onto the ceiling of the museum, to sportswear featuring prints of a 19th century landscape painting, created by Product of Public Domain to show how everyday clothing can be a canvas to display great works of art to the wider population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/22_Skies_ill_01_450x.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 599px;\"><br><em>Admiring the digital projection 22 Skies by Filip Vest. Photo by Ida Tietgen Høyrup, CC BY-SA 4.0</em>\r\n\r\n<p>The remixes turned out to be excellent ‘tin-openers’ to the museum’s old masters, shedding new light on the original paintings and sculptures, and opening up their motifs and meanings in new ways. One example was a work by Finnish designer <a href=\"https://neealaakso.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neea Laakso</a> which merged two Danish paintings from the 19th century featuring birds – one caged, the other flying freely in nature. In her <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/exhibition-mix-it-up/neea-laakso/\" target=\"_blank\">laser cut installation</a>, the bird is set free from the cage, offering a poignant comment on the topic of freedom.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/exhibitions/exhibition-mix-it-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Mix it up!</a> attested to the inspiration as well as practical building blocks which contemporary artists can mine from the quarry of Public Domain art. It also inspired SMK and our audience to look at art with keen eyes, and discover fresh ideas and perspectives in our historical collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Playing with the archives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/setartfree\" target=\"_blank\">SMK Friday Set art free!</a> was all about showing the manifold possibilities of open collections. Another great success was the animated GIF workshop where people could bring SMK’s paintings to life*. It resulted in a range of <a href=\"http://publicdomaingifs.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fun and surprising GIF’s</a>, including an animation where the clouds of a Golden Age painting are set in motion across the blue sky. A Wikipedia edit-a-thon was also organised in collaboration with our friends at <a href=\"http://www.hirschsprung.dk/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">The Hirschsprung Collection</a>, where art amateurs, museum staff and wikipedians were summoned to hack the interpretation of art history and contribute their own knowledge and perspectives using Public Domain images to illustrate their articles. Lots of articles were initiated and improved, and we museum people learned a great deal about the potential of our open collections for global learning and collaborative enrichment of knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/VanGoYourself_ill_02_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>A VanGoYourself re-creation of a popular painting from SMK’s collection: From a Roman Osteria (1866) by Danish painter Carl Bloch. Photo by Ida Tietgen Høyrup, CC BY-SA 4.0</em><br><br>\r\nOn the more playful side, the duo behind the award-winning website <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/category/vango/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a> – Jane Finnis and Frank Thinnes of <a href=\"http://www.weareculture24.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Culture24</a> – helped visitors get dressed up to re-enact historical artworks. While this might at first seem like a lightweight parlor game, during the evening we discovered that people really studied the artworks closely in order to re-create them, often sliding in critical comments or new interpretations of the old subject matter in their re-enactments. The game led to great conversations about the artworks’ compositions, the stories they told, and what they mean to us today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/CultureCam_ill_03_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>Playing with Europeana’s vast collections in CultureCam. Photo by Ida Tietgen Høyrup, CC BY-SA 4.0</em><br><br>\r\nFinally, the Danish design company <a href=\"http://www.spildaftid.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Spild Af Tid</a> presented their innovative <a href=\"http://culturecam.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Culture Cam</a>, projecting the collections of Europeana onto the walls and ceilings of SMK in awe-inspiring patterns. The Culture Cam reads the colours and patterns in your clothes, and returns search results from Europeana.eu that match them. It was amazing to watch people do intuitive search into cultural heritage using their own bodies! For the occasion, Spild Af Tid had created a special version of the Culture Cam, with cut-outs from different SMK paintings of faces, hands, torsos, and feet. With your body, you could activate and play with these body mashups that mirrored your own movements – a game that appealed to kids and grown ups alike. Nobody held back, everybody moved to the beat of free art!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Join the discussion about Open Culture!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 6,000 people attended <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/setartfree\" target=\"_blank\">SMK Friday Set art free!</a> If you weren’t one of them, make sure to come to Vienna for the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative Culture Jam</a> on 9-10 July. It promises to be the event this summer to share inspiration on re-using cultural collections in creative and innovative ways. You will also be able to Van-Go yourself into a unique masterpiece, discover and play with Europeana’s collections through Culture Cam, and meet all kinds of great people working in the cultural sector and creative industries eager to discuss the potential and challenges of Remix and Open Culture. I will be there to tell you all about our experiences with going open at SMK. I really hope to see you there!<br><br>\r\n*The title of this post “Set art free, and the rest will follow” was used as a battle cry for the animated GIF workshop, which was organised by <a href=\"http://people.aalto.fi/index.html?profilepage=isfor#!sanna_marttila\" target=\"_blank\">Sanna Marttila</a> from Aalto University, School of Arts, Design and Architecture.</p>"

        body: "<p>We challenged a group of creative designers and artists to join us in exploring and jamming with open digital cultural heritage. The aim of the one day workshop was to experiment what kind of new designs, art artefacts and objects could be made using Europeana content and the digital fabrication facilities of Aalto Fablab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we were talking about digital cultural heritage and it’s art and design applications, a number of examples were shown to the participants. Such as some works from the recent Mix it Up exhibition organized at the National Gallery of Denmark SMK, Rijksmuseum’s Rijksstudio award competition applicants and more simple examples from this blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants of the day were an interesting mix from a wide variety of backgrounds, such as new media, furniture design and environmental art. Some had previous knowledge of open cultural heritage, while others came across it for the very first time. Getting to know about the material available always creates enthusiasm, making no exception either this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After introductions we discussed all together about derivative works such as mash-ups, as well as ‘getting inspired’ by other designs or works of art, or new materials available. Examples like mixing of different brands into new ones, mash-up music videos, Ikea designs and LARP (live action role play) costumes that get their inspiration from medieval fantasy literature were mentioned, among other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People divided into pairs to advance their initial ideas and to talk about interesting content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The visual search tool Culture Cam was the main method for searching content to use, but for more specific searches we used the Europeana portal. We also had Europeana content cards made by Platonig at hand to browse through and use with Culture Cam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some brainstorming the pairs presented their ideas to others and started to work with the vector files needed for the Fablab equipment. Some participants were only learning to use vector graphics software, and CultJam offered a great opportunity to do that. The event was also for peer learning. Many tests and experiments were executed during the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One pair got inspired by images of paleolithic objects, such as shells and bones. They were thinking of fabricating tribal style jewelry with a 21st century twist. Also the mathematical perfection of the seashells gave ideas to the participants; how would a 3D printed seashell sound like? A more ambitious idea was to make 3D printed loudspeakers in the form of seashells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another pair developed ideas how to do traditional style wood carvings, but with the help of laser cutter or milling machine. Reinterpreted traditional graphics or for example smaller, typographic prints would look great!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One idea was to make a small Moleskine-like diary with printed interleafs using graphic patterns found via Culture Cam. By using painted 0.4 mm piece plywood the images could be engraved with the laser cutter on the material. A prototype was made during the day, but there is still need for more work to make it durable and useable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore two readymade 3D models of statues were found from Europeana and they were 3D printed. Vinyl stickers were cut by using ornaments from the British Library collection. Laser cutter was, as always, a popular machine; plywood coasters with engraved images, beautiful, detailed jewelry made from acrylic…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This blogpost was first published on <a href=\"http://redesignyourculturalheritage.eu/cultjam-helsinki-at-aalto-fablab/\" target=\"_blank\">http://redesignyourculturalheritage.eu/cultjam-helsinki-at-aalto-fablab/</a> by Neea Lasko</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2015-06/lasercutting2.jpg\" style=\"width: 660px; height: 494,5px;\"></p>\r\n"

        title: 'The Europeana Data Model: A living model 5 years on'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Today we’re <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/enhancing-the-europeana-data-model-edm\" target=\"_blank\">publishing a new White Paper</a> on the enhanced Europeana Data Model (EDM). In this blog, we look back at how the EDM first became a reality, and the progress we have made with it as a living model since then.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, the <a href=\"http://www.www2015.it/\" target=\"_blank\">World Wide Web conference</a> took place in Florence. During the conference, speakers and attendees placed great emphasis on \"knowledge graphs\". Beyond the academic hype, knowledge is now a core element in web technology and businesses. So what’s the connection with Europeana and the cultural sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years ago, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20White%20Paper%201.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana's very first White Paper</a>, by Prof. Stefan Gradmann, discussed the idea of Europeana as a knowledge graph, formed with metadata on cultural objects augmented with a so-called \"semantic layer\". The aim then was to position Europeana and its data partners as a source of contextual knowledge that everyone could exploit to access digitised European heritage. To achieve this, the white paper advocated the design of an advanced data model, re-using existing pieces of web technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Putting an idea into practice</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has since grown to a collection of over 40 million objects. The richness of its data can still be improved, as raised in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/we-want-good-quality-data-and-we-want-it-now\" target=\"_blank\">recent discussions</a>. However, these reports also show that our Network is increasingly capable of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/metadata-quality-task-force-report\" target=\"_blank\">identifying and tackling these issues</a>. Over the last five years we have progressed considerably, and Europeana is already reaping <a href=\"http://lodlam.net/2013/06/18/what-is-europeana-doing-with-sw-and-lod/\" target=\"_blank\">some of the promised benefits of semantic web and linked data technologies</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) has become a reality we can work with, together with our data partners and data re-users. <strong>Today, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/enhancing-the-europeana-data-model-edm\" target=\"_blank\">we’re publishing a new White Paper</a></strong> that outlines the recent progress we have made with our model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its original release, EDM has permeated the entire portfolio of Europeana products: we ingest, store, enrich and exchange data following a richer, more semantic (and more multilingual!) approach. This work continues, for example, as Europeana prepares to handle more data enrichment, including user annotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDM has also been extended to meet the data needs of specific domain aggregators, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/extending-edm-for-richer-descriptions-sounds\" target=\"_blank\">like Europeana Sounds</a>, and address the requirements of new data services and enrichment in Europeana's main platform. EDM is now used by Europeana and several other cultural aggregators, such as <a href=\"http://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">DPLA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\" target=\"_blank\">DDB</a>. In true linked data fashion, EDM \"profiles\" can be developed without Europeana having to update the core model anymore. Exploiting the data expressed with these profiles across different systems still requires work. But it is no longer impossible to realise the vision where the design of data models is decentralised and tailored to specific applications, while the data created and exchanged with them still forms together a vast, semantically interoperable knowledge environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/EDMbubble.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 345px;\"><br><em>Re-use of different vocabularies in EDM from <a href=\"http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/vocabs/edm\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Open Vocabularies</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A collaborative approach</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a \"one leader, many followers\" movement. Several months ago we released a blog post illustrating how data partners <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-enriches-its-data-with-the-art-and-architecture-thesau\" target=\"_blank\">can better represent their existing metadata</a> using links to established thesauri, which makes it more amenable to semantic and multilingual services. This greatly complements Europeana's own centralised semantic enrichment efforts. The same approach benefits our data modelling effort. EDM would not exist without the contributions of our data and academic partners!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To succeed in all this, Europeana must do a lot of what we call \"R&amp;D coordination\". We shared good news on technological advances and encouraged their use. We have created a Linked Data pilot at <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">data.europeana.eu</a> (soon to be updated!), which was the very first application of EDM. We have gathered <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-case-studies\" target=\"_blank\">case studies</a>. We even have released a fairly popular <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36752317\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> that explains what Linked Data technology is and how it can benefit cultural organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also participate in academic and practitioners' conferences, often having an active role, presenting and/or participating in their organisation or review committees: <a href=\"http://lodlam.net/\" target=\"_blank\">LODLAM</a>, <a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info/\" target=\"_blank\">TPDL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dublincore.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DC</a>, <a href=\"http://swib.org\" target=\"_blank\">SWIB</a>, ESWC, etc. This ensures that we can feed our community's work with the freshest R&amp;D results. It also provides a great opportunity to disseminate innovations and share the requirements from the Europeana Network within the wider community of researchers and practitioners. We also engage in collaborative, international prospective workshops, like those organized by the <a href=\"https://mellon.org/news-publications/articles/linked-open-data/\" target=\"_blank\">Mellon foundation</a>, the <a href=\"https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ld4l/LD4L+Workshop+Overview\" target=\"_blank\">LD4L project</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/BibliographicRoadmap/\" target=\"_blank\">NISO</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However these venues form a fairly scattered landscape. To share and discuss relevant developments more easily in the Europeana Network, we have created a technology-focused community: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-tech\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech</a>. We've backed it up with a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-2015\" target=\"_blank\">conference</a>, the two first editions of which have been great successes with over 200 participants. We're also exploring <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight\">EuropeanaTech Insight</a>, a medium to showcase our partners' work and various publications as progress for the entire Europeana community. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-insight/insight-issue2-datamodelingdataquality\" target=\"_blank\">second issue</a> of this publication focused precisely on data modelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this is required to make the Europeana Network deliver on its promise to be a key cultural innovator, in line with the <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a>. The EDM White Paper we've just published shows that for data modelling, we're making clear progress towards this goal. Concrete work has been done which not only realises our vision, but builds upon it too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate this, we are looking into organising a <strong>special workshop on EDM</strong> just before or during the next <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015\">Europeana General Assembly</a> in Amsterdam. If you are interested, please contact us. We're looking forward to getting together with all the data experts in our network to celebrate and discuss further directions for the data work in our community!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hello, I am Jef Malliet. For many years, I have worked in an international environment (at <a href=\"http://www.iccrom.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ICCROM</a>, The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) but I’m now working on a very different scale for the development of a cultural heritage database for a province in Belgium, <a href=\"http://www.erfgoedplus.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Erfgoedplus.be</a>. Since 2008 I have been involved with, and closely followed the development of, Europeana - especially through participation in projects that emphasise the contribution of local heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Erfgoed%20CCBYSA.jpg\" style=\"width: 390px; height: 500px;\"><br><em>A Folk art representation of a local legend, with a detailed historic representation of a church, now part of a World Heritage site. Image: <span style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\">from <a href=\"http://www.erfgoedplus.be/details/KF.objecten.1239009064738911624971\" target=\"_blank\">Erfgoedplus.be</a>, CC BY SA.</span></em>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nThe platform beyond the portal</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>‘From portal to platform’ – this is one of the key priorities in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Strategy%202020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a>. These words require interpretation. Their potential is expressed in the Strategy’s title: ‘We transform the world with culture’, a statement that forms the core mission of Europeana. This ambition clearly lies beyond the functionality of the portal alone, and the Strategy makes a start towards envisaging what realising such an ambition might entail. However, as with any starting point, there’s still plenty more untapped potential for us to uncover and explore.<br><br>\r\nSo what can we do to reach the broader goal of transforming the world with culture? What kind of interpretations can we give to this platform beyond the portal? Here are some facets of the platform that I would like to focus on as a Councillor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The new governance is bottom-up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The new governance structure shifts the decision-making power in Europeana from the large, visionary institutions that started it all to those who have become the real stakeholders by contributing to, aggregating, developing, exchanging, lobbying, and creating the portal. Such empowerment requires work and careful attention to communication and transparency. The new Council is the main instrument to implement this empowerment. Its first task is to engage all Network members into the new governance and to create truly democratic participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The power of local heritage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For a number of reasons Europeana is often associated with the masterpieces of each Member State, providing access to seminal works. This was a clear message in<em> ‘<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/final_report_cds_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The New Renaissance</a>’</em>, the 2011 report of a Comité des Sages appointed by the European Commission.<br><br>\r\nOf course, the masterpieces and significant treasures of a country will always be important, and will attract political and economic attention too. They certainly can't be omitted, and projects like the new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/hidden-treasures-and-iconic-masterpieces-the-europeana-280-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art 280</a> campaign will help place them alongside their lesser-known, but still important counterparts.<br><br>\r\nHowever, to fulfill the role and potential of Europeana, I believe it should aim for the participation of an even broader base of stakeholders, and the long-tail power of local cultural heritage is fundamental here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local history relates to the places where people live, and to the people they know. The collections held by small local libraries, volunteer associations, and other local communities make local history come to life. It is essential for the identity of local communities and can be connected to broader regional or national histories, helping local communities understand their place and role in ‘history’ and society. It can contribute to better mutual understanding and more respect between communities, and subsequently, create a better, more sustainable intercultural society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Marta_och_Maria_i_Nikolai_kyrka.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 392px;\"><br><em>A church window from the Nikolai Church in Örebro​. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2058701/File_Marta_och_Maria_i_Nikolai_kyrka_jpg.html\" target=\"_blank\">User contributed content, Wikimedia Commons</a>, CC0.</em><br><br>\r\nAccess to local history most often remains hidden. It takes special effort to enable these communities to contribute their data and knowledge to an aggregation portal. Participation usually requires technical and other professional skills that are not readily available to those involved. Such an inclusive portal needs to be supplemented with appropriate support services. This is the core business of our own Erfgoedplus.be platform and these were also the ideas behind the projects EuropeanaLocal, WP3 of Europeana Awareness, Europeana Inside, LoCloud. ( See, for example,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/local-history-in-europeana\" target=\"_blank\"> this blog to learn more</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From technology to processes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The infrastructure, the technology, the data models – these are all necessary tools, but they must be used by people in order to make the platform work. They must be supported by processes and services that make them accessible to collection holders that do not speak the technical language. The platform should allow scalability, not only upwards to a broader scale, but downwards to narrower, local, less expert players too. As these processes are usually developed by the larger institutions, they must be translated and offered at a low-threshold level. I believe this will be a task for aggregators.<br><br>\r\nFor me, this is a priority as the importance of Europeana is wider than just the product itself. As a process, building Europeana has increased the attention to digitisation of heritage in most European countries, and in a spirit of collaboration among domains and disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From quantity to quality</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, an initial emphasis in Europeana and affiliated projects has been on numbers. A critical mass had to be created in order to gain credibility and appeal. Having reached this critical mass, it now becomes possible to spend more attention on other, less measurable aspects such as quality. Improving data quality is indicated as priority #1 in the Strategy 2020. Data quality needs to be improved in order to make the data richer and to increase re-usability (see this previous <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/crosswalk-with-me-adventures-in-metadata-quality\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Metadata%20Quality%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Task Force report</a> on the subject).<br><br>\r\nData quality has many facets, and can be defined usually only in relation to a particular purpose. There are many reasons for making data about cultural heritage objects available, including archiving it for the future, and re-use by other parties, and rarely do we create information for a single purpose. The overall aim is to ensure it serves all desired purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Going beyond Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, the focus is on the data that reaches Europeana, but the platform opens up more possibilities for improving quality of the source data for other purposes as well. I believe we must try to use the platform of Europeana to influence developments in digital heritage in general. Thinking about quality is an excellent opportunity to do this. It can help promoting proper use of standards, working towards true interoperability across the borders of domains or languages as well as improve the durability of information beyond the parameters of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you're interested in this last issue, I've written further articles on the topic, '<a href=\"http://www.cidoc2014.de/images/sampledata/cidoc/papers/E-1_Malliet_paper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Quality for Linked Data. What is it and how can it be made?</a>' and '<a href=\"http://www.porphyre.org/workshop-toth/files/Jef_Malliet_AthenaPlus-TOTH2014_Quality.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Open and Linked Data.

        title: 'VanGoYourself, one year on: an interview with Jane Finnis'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>A year ago, we <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/hacking-cultural-tourism-with-selfie-reenactments-of-digital-her\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> the team behind <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a>, a playful site that lets you recreate your favourite paintings. The brainchild of <a href=\"http://WeAreCulture24.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Culture24</a> in the UK and Plurio.net in Luxembourg, it is part of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-creative\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative project</a> promoting greater re-use of of cultural heritage in Europeana by creative industries. As momentum behind their <a href=\"http://www.goteo.cc/vgy\" target=\"_blank\">new crowdfunding campaign grows</a>, we catch up with one of the two founders, Jane Finnis from Culture24.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The project is now over a year old. Taking a moment to look back, what have been the main highlights of the last year?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest buzz has actually been seeing the recreations coming in from all over the world and realising that people have been inspired enough by the idea to actually take action and be creative. Sometimes people go to a lot of trouble, you can see that they have really thought about it and that makes me happy as it’s what the project is all about – connecting emotionally to art in a personal way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/VGYBBC.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 405px;\"><br>\r\nImage: <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/two-women-from-naples-guillaume-bodinier-1795-1872-vangod-by-charlie-and-sally/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a>, CC BY-SA.<br><br>\r\nBeing invited onto the BBC’s Breakfast TV is also one of the high points. I was interviewed at the start of the show and we asked people to send in their recreations – and they did – dinner ladies, students, couples, all ages and all sorts. I also managed to get the two presenters to have a go with a rather good result.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Can you tell us about some of the influential supporters you’ve attracted since you started out? How have different organisations and individuals reacted to the idea?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We now have <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/participating-venues/\" target=\"_blank\">29 different museums from 13 different countries</a> and more joining all the time - from big nationals like the Rijksmuseum, National Gallery of Denmark and National Gallery of Ireland to smaller ones such as Royal Pavilion Museums, Villa Vauban and Stadtmuseum Simeonstrift Trier.<br><br>\r\nThe key thing is that all the paintings from these different collections must be open licenced so we are restricted in what we can take and it is a slow process to convince the museum and gallery community that taking a more open approach to their content is the right one. But I do think we are helping to shift people's thinking in this area and people are realising how the possibilities for the re-use of collections can be really exciting and engaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m really proud that in our own way we are helping to make the case for this kind of open approach and my belief is that this is only a temporary problem. In five to ten years the benefits of openness will be well understood and there will be more institutions allowing people to get creative with their content than not.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What advice would you give to a creative or other similar kind of project starting out? What do you know now that you wish you’d known in May 2014? What might you do differently, if anything?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s hard work trying to build something new from scratch, grab people’s attention online and convince them to go and do something (in our case recreate a painting). Having an idea that you genuinely love, that you enjoy working on as the producer and that you have a connection to is really important. If you are going to pour your soul into something it has to be something that really moves you or going the extra mile just won’t happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What were the biggest technical challenges to overcome when building the tools and website?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest challenge was not to over-complicate it. There is always a tendency to think we could add this and that and link to this information etc. But all of this just complicates the core idea and often confuses the user. The need to add more is often about meeting the needs of the organisation making the thing, and not the needs of the audience. I am really pleased that we managed to fight off this urge and keep the ideas really simple and focussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/VGYman.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 412px;\"><br>\r\nImage: <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/portrait-of-marie-fargues-in-a-turkish-dress-jean-etienne-liotard-1702-1789-vangod-by-adam-gonzalez/\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a>, CC BY-SA</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You've released the twinning software as a free Wordpress plugin. Can you tell us a bit about why did you do this and who you think might use it?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The twinning software is the only really clever bit of code on the site, the rest is simply Wordpress pages and posts so it was the only bit of tech that we could share. It was also a really compelling idea, twinning one thing with something else and we thought it would be great to not just give something back to the developer community but also suggest a way of creating comparisons or juxtapositions that might inspire other ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>There are all sorts of people on VanGoYourself, from the very young to the more distinguished. Do you gather any statistics about who is using it, where and when?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the great things about the project is that you can literally see your audience in the recreations they submit and there really is a broad range of ages and types of people - teenagers, kids, hipsters, groups of friends, business colleagues, couples and of course the many selfies!<br><br>\r\nEach month the site gets around four thousand visits and other than those that just come in from somewhere to view one page and leave, the rest on average stay for five minutes and look at four to five pages each. The percentage of people who then go on to VanGoThemselves is about 2%, which is kind of average percentage for this high level of engagement required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What does the future hold for VanGoYourself? What’s in store for it next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our ambition is to get 100 more paintings onto the site from across Europe and to champion the value of releasing cultural content on open licenses. We want to create a shift in how museums and galleries think about their digital collections and show them that they can have more value if they are open to re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most of all we want to get more people VanGoing themselves and would love to see the project become synonymous with having fun with art. I’d like to see museums all over the world holding their own VanGoYourself events and inviting the public to recreate their art in any way they want to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Can you tell us a bit about making a project of this nature sustainable? How important is crowdfunding as a way for entrepreneurs to operate without funding? What benefits, outside obvious financial ones, might it offer?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustainability is tough and I’m not sure I believe it is even possible financially without some kind of commercial partnership which at the moment we don’t have. I also believe the value of the project is how it can help people to engage with art in personal ways. Our challenge is to see if we are able to translate that into some kind of income stream, which will take time. Meanwhile, we want to build a community of art lovers who share our belief in open data and ask them for their support.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Last of all, there are almost too many brilliant recreations to choose just one, but if you had to pick, which is your all-time favourite?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the ones that I have been a part of, either helping to direct a big group into a complicated scene (I’ve done quite a few of these a different events) or being in a recreation myself, in particular the one I did in Rome of the Sarcophagus of the Spouses. It really is a lot of fun to recreate a painting, play around with the meaning and put yourself into the picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/VGYCouple.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 440px;\"><br>\r\nImage: <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/sarcophagus-of-the-spouses-unkown-vangod-by-jane-and-frank/\">VanGoYourself</a>, CC BY-SA\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nBut if I had to pick one out of the others that I haven’t been part of it would be the Dying Adonis VanGo'd by Jordan Assi.

        title: '14 young people, 40 new prototypes - #CultJam15 comes to Bristol!'

        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/eccj-bristol-0.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CC-BY-SA Knowle West Media Centre</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friday, June 12, 2015 was a lucky day. It saw an amazing group of young people aged 13 to 18 from across Bristol coming together at Knowle West Media Centre. The group spent six hours exploring content from<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\"> Europeana’s</a> digital cultural heritage archive collection and re-using it to create innovative and inspiring prototypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the beginning the group was introduced to the cultural heritage archive, discovering what archives look like and how their content can be re-used. They were told all about prototypes and the formats they come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants worked in small groups taking part in five workshops facilitated by different creatives: a laser cutter design artist, a playground engineer, a games designer, a clothes designer and a creative arts practitioner. Within each workshop, the young people were given the task of “creating a product that reuses archives and/or enables people to view archives in an interesting way.” From this briefing the young people had 45 minutes to explore the genre, research the archives, come up with an idea, create a prototype and finally present it to the wider team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the day, young people created over 40 different prototypes including wireframes, computer aided designs, junk modeling, shoes and clothing adaptions, and laser cut designs, which were then sent down to KWMC's Furniture Factory and cut throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you want to know what creative ideas those young brains amazed us with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A chessboard, with 3D printed figures using archive character designs. The chessboard itself was made of simple light and dark archive photographs as the board squares (Louis, 13)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/eccj-bristol-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nCC-BY-SA Knowle West Media Centre</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2D computer game called “Time Jump”, targeted at young people aged 10-16. Time Jump takes the gamer through different time periods in different countries, from cave person to robot. As the character goes through the levels, they are placed in front of scenery is made from archive images (e.g. Barcelona streets from 1960s). Challenges and objects within each scene will incorporate archive materials (e.g. the character will wear First World War uniforms taken from a historic photo if jumping through Germany during this time). (Kieran, Casey, Weronike &amp; Nishan, all 13)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/eccj-bristol-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nCC-BY-SA Knowle West Media Centre</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A playground designed using images of archive chocolate wrappers! (Mohamadshakur, 14)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/eccj-bristol-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 605px; height: 340px;\"><br>\r\nCC-BY-SA Knowle West Media Centre</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We gathered some reactions how the young generation liked this Culture Jam Pre-Event:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>I liked the engineering part because it’s cool how you can re-design things out of old scrap</li>\r\n    <li>I liked working at all the workshops as it was fun and interesting trying new things from looking at the archive. Also the food!</li>\r\n    <li>I have learned that you can create amazing things with a laser cutter</li>\r\n    <li>I learnt the meaning of archive and I learnt how to make many different prototype things</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Our facilitators praised the fun and highly enthusiastic team. It was a great opportunity to interact and work with the youth and a really good learning experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KWMC Programme Manager (Young People) enjoyed the event as well: “The Jam was great: there was really a positive energy in the room. Most young people had never heard of archives or prototypes before the event, and by the end of the day most of them had given presentations on their re-use of archive to the whole room. I was astounded by some of the prototypes. The young people brought some really innovative, new and exciting ides to the table, and they did it in such a short time. If only we could now make them all!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pupils attended the Bristol Jam from the following Schools &amp; Colleges: Bridge Learning Campus, City Academy, Ashton Park, City of Bristol College and Bristol Steiner School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/eccj-bristol-4.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nCC-BY-SA Knowle West Media Centre</p>"

        body: "<p>We have set up the Europeana Network Association; you have voted for your Councillors, and, on your behalf, they have elected a new Chair of the Network. Now, it’s your turn to make it official and become a Member of the Europeana Network Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do you become a Member of the Europeana Network Association?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To become a member of the Network Association there is are a few short steps to follow. If you are already registered as a member of the Network, you will receive an email with instructions on how to complete this process. For new members registering for the first time, we will ask you to fill in a short form telling us a bit about yourself. Every Member is asked to agree to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/europeana-network-association-statutes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">rules of the Association</a>. Once your Membership is confirmed you will then receive a unique Membership ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/K056439.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 410px;\"><br><em>Detail from Roman de la Rose, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126269736.html\" target=\"_blank\">British Library</a>, Public Domain. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why should you make this change?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, the Europeana Network has undergone a significant transformation to become a representative, democratic and transparent affiliated Network Association. We chose to change the way we are governed to better foster a feeling of mutuality - that the Network works for the benefit of every member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By becoming a Member you will continue to receive Network updates and invites to participate in the development of the annual business plan and to join working groups and task forces. You will be represented by the Members Council, and the Management Board of the Association will form part of the Board of Europeana Foundation, ensuring your views and interests are well represented. In return you will be asked to vote on important decisions, such as electing your representatives on the Members Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What else do you need to know?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Our goal is to encourage every existing member of the Network to officially join the Europeana Network Association before <strong>30 September 2015</strong>. By doing so, you will be able to take part in our Members Council elections, as well as run as a candidate to represent your peers yourself. We will also invite you to start helping us shape next year’s business plan too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have not registered as a member of the Association and received your Network Membership ID before <strong>30 September</strong>, you will not be able to take part in key decisions such as voting in this year’s Members Council elections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working to become an Association has been a rewarding and collaborative process, and we are excited about what the future holds. We look forward to welcoming you to the Europeana Association.</p>"

        title: 'European Parliament demands copyright rules that allow cultural heritage institutions to share collections online'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Last week the Legal Affairs committee (JURI) of the European Parliament held a much anticipated vote on the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europarl.europa.eu%2Fsides%2FgetDoc.do%3FpubRef%3D-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FNONSGML%2BREPORT%2BA8-2015-0209%2B0%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0%2F%2FEN&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4l5FhTLbKts0I06m2IXPbzDRVhg\">European Parliament's own initiative report on the implementation of the 2001 EU copyright directive</a>. This was an important vote as it dealt with the more than 500 amendments proposed by various MEPs (each amendment is a proposal to change a part of a report). From here, a final report will be issued following the concluding vote of the European Parliament Plenum to be held on the 9th July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/ParliamentRijksPubDom_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 436px;\"><br><em>Zitting van het Engelse Hogerhuis, 1689. Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_OB_52_876.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/discussion-about-copyright-reform-kicks-off-in-the-european-parl\" target=\"_blank\">Back in March</a>, we highlighted some of the amendments that had the potential to improve the draft report so that it would better reflect <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/europes-cultural-heritage-institutions-deserve-better/\" target=\"_blank\">the issues that cultural heritage institutions have with the current EU copyright framework</a>. At the time our main concern was that the report neither explicitly addressed the question of mass digitisation nor the question of rights clearance for making digitised collections available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on this analysis we developed <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/IPR/150217europeana-position-paper-publication.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">an approach for working with MEPs</a> that was based on three main requests. The report should include language that would:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>allow cultural heritage institutions to digitise the works that they have in their collections;</li>\r\n    <li>allow cultural heritage institutions to make available online on their own websites those works in their collections that are not in commercial circulation or otherwise actively managed anymore;</li>\r\n    <li>allow libraries to electronically lend all works contained in their collections (commercially available or not) as long as they pay compensation to the rights holders.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Three out of three</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last few months we have worked with MEPs to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/discussion-about-copyright-reform-kicks-off-in-the-european-parl\" target=\"_blank\">table amendments to the original report that would include these demands in the final report</a> and get them to understand the importance of these issues (and as a result to vote for them). As a result of this work, which was supported by individual Network members and coordinated with other groups like <a href=\"http://www.eblida.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EBLIDA</a>, <a href=\"http://libereurope.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">LIBER</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IFLA</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europarl.europa.eu%2Fsides%2FgetDoc.do%3FpubRef%3D-%2F%2FEP%2F%2FNONSGML%2BREPORT%2BA8-2015-0209%2B0%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0%2F%2FEN&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4l5FhTLbKts0I06m2IXPbzDRVhg\">final report as adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee</a> on Tuesday 16th June now contains sections that deal with the three issues we had raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paragraph 55 addresses the issue of digitisation of collections:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>55. Calls upon the Commission to assess the adoption of an exception allowing libraries to digitalise (sic!) content for the purposes of consultation, cataloguing and archiving;</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Paragraph 39, while not directly reflecting our proposal, clearly makes the point that cultural heritage institutions need the right to provide access to their collections online:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>39. Considers it necessary to strengthen exceptions for institutions of public interest, such as libraries, museums and archives, in order to promote wide-ranging access to cultural heritage, including through online platforms;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>And paragraph 54 proposes the introduction of an exception to copyright that would allow libraries to electronically lend books that they have in their collections:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>54. Recognizes the importance of libraries for access to knowledge and calls upon the Commission to assess the adoption of an exception allowing public and research libraries to legally lend works to the public in digital formats for personal use, for a limited duration through the internet or libraries' networks, so that their public interest duty of disseminating knowledge can be fulfilled effectively and in an up-to-date manner; recommends that authors should be fairly compensated for e-lending to the same extent as this is the case for the lending of physical books according to national territorial restrictions;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition the Legal Affairs committee also adopted with a large majority an amendment to protect the public domain that <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\" target=\"_blank\">supports Europeana's position that what is in the public domain in analogue form is also in the public domain after having been digitised</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>31. Calls on the Commission to effectively safeguard public domain works, which are by definition not subject to copyright protection; therefore urges the Commission to clarify that once a work is in the public domain, any digitisation of the work which does not constitute a new, transformative work, stays in the public domain;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all we feel that we have done a very good job at ensuring that the concerns of cultural heritage institutions are well reflected in the report. Whilst there were amendments with stronger wording and more precise language with regards to the issue of providing online access to collections, the current form of the report is an important milestone on the way towards new EU copyright rules that allow cultural heritage institutions to properly function in the digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The report will now be voted in the plenary meeting of the European Parliament on 9th July and, given that it was adopted with a 23 - 2 majority, it is almost certain that it will be approved there as well. As an ‘own initiative’ report it will not result in any direct legislative changes - but it does provide some guidelines to the European Commission which is <a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/2015/05/06/eu-digital-single-market-strategy-a-starting-point-for-copyright-reform/\" target=\"_blank\">currently working on a proposal for new EU copyright rules</a>. By adopting the the Reda report with such a clear majority the EP has given the commission a clear indication of what it expects to see and that includes copyright rules that allow cultural heritage institutions make more of their collections available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to get the upcoming proposal signed into law the Commission needs the support of both the European Parliament and the member states. Ensuring that this happens requires our continued attention. Our focus is to keep an open dialogue with the Commision to ensure that these issues are understood and taken into account in upcoming legislative proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also be important to raise these issues with member state governments as no change in European law is possible without their approval. This task of informing member states is something that requires the support of as many members of the Europeana Network as possible.

        body: "<p>Even digital tourists like me are now aware that digitization is no gala dinner. Or that if it is, we forget that as well as feasting on its riches, we must also clear up its rubbish. Angels of information fight a never-ending battle with the devils of disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The wild side of digital</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it positively, the wild side of the digital world is a plus for us humans - it makes us less obsolete. Even badly recorded information stored in your grandparents’ brains matters if you’ve lost the floppy disc labelled ‘Grandparents memories’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My one-year-old child is a great example of something that can very easily create digital disorder. Even at his young age, his eyes light up when my laptop does. And just a minute later, he’s doing everything he shouldn’t with his developing fine motor skills - opening programmes, changing settings, hopefully not buying anything! Since the dawn of Apple 0.0 (if not before), freedom is first of all freedom to do the wrong thing. Freedom native - yes; digital native - not yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The least one can say is that the digital world is a very complex and multi-layered reality. Europeana (at seven-years-old) is in transition, changing from portal to platform. That implies some changes to the Europeana family as well as the need for new educational models such changes necessitate. I consider Europeana a crucial project for at least three reasons: its truly European scope; its emphasis on the value of curated content; its Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I work for a network of European museums, <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EMA</a>, and we would like to continue collaborating with Europeana on the European cultural scene. One example: Heritage in Motion, a multimedia competition for creators and users of films, games, apps and websites on themes related to Europe’s heritage - cultural and natural, tangible and intangible. Promoted by EMA and Europa Nostra in 2014, in 2015 the contest has been empowered by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/HiM-winners-2015-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em>Heritage in Motion Awards. Image: <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/winners-announced-of-the-heritage-in-motion-awards-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage in Motion</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I would like to help Europeana with its bid to become a platform - focusing on new forms of content curation and distribution. Thematic routes (WWI, fashion etc.) and the collaboration with some ’national’ Wikimedia chapters are points of reference in imagining the future role of Europeana as provider of curated cultural contents through innovative formats. It is difficult, but it is crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, Europeana is built by hundreds of European institutions, as the composition of the Council clearly shows. How can this Network be strengthened and enlarged? An experiment is underway in Brescia (Italy), where I work: we are using content from Europeana in a project that aims to communicate <a href=\"http://www.musilbrescia.it/home/\" target=\"_blank\">local cultures in spaces of urban mobility</a>, for instance the subway. Institutions involved in the project share with Europeana the need to be more rooted in people’s everyday lives - I hope that united we will stand.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>This post was written by Max Kaiser, Susanne Tremml, Elisabeth Stricker, Kristin Dill</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been nearly 30 months since the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/projects/project-list/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> kicked-off in January 2013 at the <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/\">Austrian National Library</a> in Vienna. What an exciting time filled with many achievements, a number of challenges, a few setbacks but even more steps forward. It is difficult not to get a little melancholic knowing the final weeks of this great collaboration are approaching, but our pride in the accomplishments outweigh any sadness we might feel. Let’s have a closer look at this fantastic project and its journey from a great idea to even better reality, and with so much to celebrate in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/ec-final-b-01.jpg\" style=\"width: 663px; height: 442px;\"><br>\r\nGroup photo at first All Staff meeting CC-BY-SA Europeana Creative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/project-partners\">26 partners</a> from 13 European countries aiming to bring together Creative Industries with the Cultural Heritage Institutions in order to demonstrate what can be achieved by reusing digital content from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana</a> for realising creative ideas. We started with implementing the project structures - There was a great deal of work ahead of us, ranging from identifying suitable content in Europeana, setting up a <a href=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Creative/WP1%20-%20Europeana%20Open%20Laboratory/eCreative_CoCreation_Whitepaper_Platoniq_1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">co-creation methodology</a> to defining the requirements for an online lab for experimentation with digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already in the first project year we built three pilot applications, <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a>, the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/memory-match/\">Memory Match Game</a>, the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/secretlegacy/\">Secret Legacy Game</a><u>,</u> which demonstrate what can be done with Europeana content in (natural) history education. As usual, the first year sped by far too fast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/ec-final-b-02.jpg\" style=\"width: 442px; height: 294px;\"><br>\r\nFirst recreation for VanGoYourself CC-BY-SA Europeana Creative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second year we focused on the <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a> Pilot which created a lot of buzz and with our social networks pilot, <a href=\"https://www.historypin.org/en/explore/sound-connections/\">Sound Connections</a>. Based on the Pilots we carried out at our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/challenges\">Open Innovation Challenges</a>, where we invited creatives to submit their ideas for creative use of cultural heritage, we selected a number of great projects from events in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/and-the-challenges-winners-are\">Brussels</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/and-the-2nd-challenge-winners-are-timepatch-and-buitenplaats-mob\">Barcelona</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/and-the-winners-are\">Manchester</a>. These received incubation support from Europeana Creative in order to transform their ideas into sustainable products. In parallel, our Pilots continued to make great progress. A mesmerizing example of an application for designers is the <a href=\"http://culturecam.eu/\">Culture Cam</a>, finding similar shapes and patterns within pre-selected content from Europeana. The platform <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">, an environment for experimentation with </a><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">content</a><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">, tools and business services,</a> was released in April 2014. It steadily grew and was constantly improved. We took some significant steps to solve some of the policy and technical challenges faced when making available suitable content to creative industries. We delivered the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/task-forces/content-re-use\">Europeana Content Re-use Framework (the Europeana Publishing Framework)</a> which allows the user to determine the value of content for re-use, e.g. by filtering just those images in Europeana which are available in high resolution. Also the planning of the <a href=\"http://embedr.eu/\">Image Embedding Service (Embedr.eu)</a> took shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/ec-final-b-03.jpg\" style=\"width: 663px; height: 442px;\"><br>\r\nTrying to recreate “<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Kongress\">Wiener Kongress</a>” CC-BY-SA Europeana Creative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 29 months of hard work and continuous effort, it is now time to celebrate! At the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\">Europeana Creative Culture Jam</a> we will start off by sharing what we have learned about Co-Creation by presenting our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/pilots\">Pilots,</a> and celebrating our Challenge winners. As well as getting special demonstrations of services created in the project, you will also get to look past the borders of our project and present what is going on in the wider world of creativity and cultural heritage. There will be great keynotes by <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#levmanovich\">Lev Manovich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#michaeledson\">Mike Edson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#chriswild\">Chris Wild</a><u>.</u> You will learn about <a href=\"http://labs.bl.uk/\">British Library Labs</a> and how the Statens Museum in Copenhagen <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/calendar/begivenhed/aktivitet/smk-fridays-20/\">sets art free</a>. We will discuss the business of culture, where digital heritage is going, and the future of heritage and creativity. You will also have the opportunity to meet with the experts by taking part in lively discussions at Chef’s Tables. To show the possible magic of re-using Cultural Heritage, explore the Culture Cam installation and watch a 3D movie from the team of “<a href=\"http://www.onenightinhell.com/\">One Night in Hell</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Creative Culture Jam will be the perfect final event to celebrate the achievements of Europeana Creative, and the legacy it leaves. We hope you will join us. See you soon in Vienna! #CultJam15</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/ec-final-b-04.jpg\" style=\"width: 962px; height: 120px;\"></p>"

        title: 'WW1 photos and memorabilia from the public now on Wikimedia Commons'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Since <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> began, thousands of objects from contributors all over Europe have been collected, ranging from scans of historic photos, documents and diaries, to photos of trench art and other physical remains from the First World War. A <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Europeana/Europeana_1914-1918_batch_upload\">highly curated set</a> of these materials has now been made available via <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. We hope that volunteer Wikimedians will now use this material to enhance articles with this previously unseen material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/verloren-vlag-vos-membruggen..jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 530px;\"><br><em>Verloren vlag VOS Membruggen. CC BY-SA Europeana 1914-1918</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The user-generated content (UGC) collected via the Europeana 1914-1918 project shines a unique and often very personal light on the war that involved so many countries and took millions of lives. The material is of great importance to researchers and history enthusiasts, especially because most institutional collections around WW1 offer a less personal view of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gathered at ‘collection days’ organised by Europeana and partners such as the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the British Library, the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, the material is all accessible online via the 1914-18 website as well as the Europeana portal. Up until now, however, it has not been used in wider resources like Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the enormous reach and breadth of Wikipedia, with millions of articles in every language, having material appear in Wikipedia articles offers an excellent way of to communicate the stories connected to the items. It means their significance reaches people beyond those specifically searching WW1 material too. It also perfectly fits Europeana’s ‘<a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu\">portal to platform</a>’ strategy of making cultural heritage material available via platforms of the user’s choosing. Instead of asking people to visit the Europeana 1914-1918 website to browse through the WWI material, we aim to make the material available via other relevant places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making the content available to Wikipedia users</strong><br>\r\nIn order to promote wider re-use of the collected WWI material, Europeana set out to do a \"batch upload\" of the content with the Europeana-developed <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMwiki_Toolset\">GLAMWiki Toolset</a>. In order to meet the stringent <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing\">licensing policies</a> observed by Wikimedia Commons, and ensure the most visually interesting images would be shared, we hand picked a collection of several hundred high quality and historically significant user digital objects from the vast collection. We spent time carefully processing and uploading the objects, making sure that the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Europeana/Europeana_1914-1918_batch_upload\">resulting collection</a> has the greatest possible chance of re-use as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already some of the content is finding its way into articles, not only about the First World War itself, but also more general articles. Look at this image, for instance, of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_document#/media/File:Memorabilia_relating_to_H.G._Bagster,_item_2.jpg\">1917 travel document</a>: the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/3635\">item</a> was contributed at the Europeana 1914-1918 collection day in Dublin and is now used in the Wikipedia article ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_document\">Travel document</a>’, where it adds valuable historical context. It also appears in the article on the French village of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulogne-sur-Mer\">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> because the document applied to that specific town. You start to see how the possibilities multiply. Another great example is <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doose,_Hans_(1872-1933)_-_Portrait_und_Postkarte,_item_3.jpg\">this image of a ferry</a> in the German article ‘<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_den_Nieder-_und_Mittelrhein\">Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft für den Nieder- und Mittelrhein</a>’ - again, the article is only loosely related to WWI but there is a meaningful connection between the image and the article it enriches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/ww1-item-travel-document.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 208px;\"><br><em>The 1917 travel document on Europeana1914-1918.eu (left). The document has been used to illustrate the Wikipedia article 'Passport' (right)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What you can do with the content</strong><br>\r\nIf you’re a Wikipedian or WWI historian - either an individual or a representative from a heritage organisation - we invite you to use the Europeana 1914-1918 material in articles you feel connected with or are an expert in. Anyone and everyone can edit Wikipedia; there is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started\">excellent tutorial</a> that guides you through the process if you want to get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also welcome more experienced Wikipedians or chapter organisations to get in touch with us to learn more about running editathons or other community activities around the set of WW1 content. If you’re interested in co-organising such an activity, please get in touch with <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/liam-wyatt\">Liam Wyatt</a>, our GLAM-Wiki Community Manager.</p>"

        title: 'Cultivating a Commons approach: Europeana Governance'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This blog is the first in a series exploring the connection between the Europeana Foundation’s Governing Board and the Europeana Network Association. Here, we hear from <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-max-kaiser\" target=\"_blank\">Max Kaiser, Chair of the Members Council</a>, and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff, Vice Chair of the Members Council</a>, both of whom sit on the Europeana Association’s Management Board and the Foundation Governing Board. They update us on April’s Foundation Board Meeting, and the developments that have happened since then.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December last year, we were both elected to sit on the Management Board of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/members-council-getting-to-work\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Members Council</a>. This means we, along with four others (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-paul-keller\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Keller</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-johan-oomen\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Oomen</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\" target=\"_blank\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-rolf-kallman\" target=\"_blank\">Rolf Kä</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-rolf-kallman\" target=\"_blank\">llman</a>), represent the Council and through this, the Europeana Network Association, on the Board of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><em>The values of the commons</em></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a representative group of six, we aim to ensure the Network Association effectively shapes the way Europeana is managed. This forms part of a broader belief in Europeana’s future as a cultural commons, as touched upon in Europeana’s <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2020</a>, upholding principles like mutuality and engagement. To make this belief a reality, we want to build in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/cultural_commons_papers/european-cultural-commons-summary.pdf\">values of the commons</a> to every aspect of the work Europeana does, and this includes its governance. It is not enough to simply emphasise principles like trust, reciprocity and collectivity; we must find practical ways to embed them at every level too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might be aware, a major move in this direction is the transformation of Europeana’s Network into an Association, formalising its role in decision making. You’ve probably seen some <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/calling-all-network-members-it-s-time-to-make-it-official\" target=\"_blank\">previous blogs about this</a>, as well as an email inviting you to become an official member. If you’d like your voice to be heard, we encourage you to reply and convert your membership if you haven’t already - <strong>the deadline to do so is 30 September</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of this transformation to an Association required us to finalise a set of bylaws that complement the Association’s Statutes. The bylaws relate to aspects of the way the Association operates, for instance regulating how the annual Members Council elections are run, and the terms of becoming a Network member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/councilmeeting.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 379px;\"><br><em>View of Smyrna <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_4085.html\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work on the Europeana Foundation Governing Board of course reflects these important changes. At the Board meeting in April, further steps to finalise the renewed Europeana governance structure were confirmed.<br><br>\r\nIt was agreed that two of Europeana’s founding members should be appointed for 12 months; Bruno Racine, President of the Bibliothèque nationale de France, was re-appointed Chair of the Europeana Foundation, while Hans Jansen, Deputy Director General of the National Library of the Netherlands, agreed to remain as Treasurer.<br><br>\r\nImportantly, Joke van der Leeuw-Roord, Executive Director of EUROCLIO, became Vice Chair, a position she will hold for 24 months, giving the Association a decisive role in the Foundation Governing Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next Europeana Members Council meeting takes place at the Austrian National Library in Vienna on 8 July. There, we will begin work on the Europeana Business Plan for 2016. We will also address some of the objectives in this year’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/make-the-beautiful-thing-business-plan-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Business Plan</a>, particularly those about the enhancement of Europeana’s sustainability structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of this, as we are still in a transition year, it will provide a valuable chance to reflect on the first six months of the Association. It also means we can kickstart preparations for the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Annual General Meeting</a>, set for 3-4 November in Amsterdam. A key event for all members of the Network, we look forward to seeing you there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ever, we welcome any feedback or ideas in the meantime, and stay tuned for an update from our next meeting with the rest of the Members Council. #AllezCulture!</p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Francesca Di Donato'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi, I’m Francesca Di Donato and I work at <a href=\"http://www.netseven.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Net7</a>, a software company based in Pisa, Italy. Before joining Net7, I worked as a researcher in Political Philosophy at the University of Pisa. My research focused on the transition in <a href=\"http://www.fupress.com/catalogo/la-scienza-e-la-rete/1998\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">Scientific Communication from the Printing Age to the Digital Age</a>. While looking at the history of Science Communication, I quickly realised how (artificial) restrictions in the free dissemination of scholarly results have become one of today’s most significant barriers to the evolution of human knowledge. So I became a fervent advocate of Open Access and Open Data and I’ve supported Europeana - and its vision to make Europe's cultural heritage accessible for all - from the very beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/first-image.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\"><br><em>Net7's headquarters, in Pisa. Image: Francesca Di Donato CC BY </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working at Net7 gave me the opportunity to realise the ideas I had been researching in the past, and that was very exciting! In particular, my work focuses on exploiting the potential of Semantic Web technologies in the Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage domains. In recent years I’ve had the opportunity to participate in more than twenty international R&amp;D projects and to collaborate with SMEs and research institutions from all around the world. In some of these projects, such as in <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">DM2E</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Sounds</a>, we partnered with Europeana and I had the pleasure to become part of its community and to contribute to its growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dense network of relationships with leading thinkers and innovators and the amazing experiences we have had over recent years allowed us to develop an extensive know-how in applying Semantic Web technologies to Digital Libraries, particularly in the area related to document annotation. Annotating documents is something that has always been done by researchers, since the very invention of writing. However, today, thanks to the Semantic Web, we have the fascinating opportunity to connect all annotations made by all researchers worldwide into a unique, shared knowledge space, and to make these annotations accessible for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why, since 2010, we have been developing <a href=\"http://thepund.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Pundit</a>, an Open Source semantic annotation tool, awarded the LODLAM Challenge Prize in 2013. It is now further being developed within the Europeana Sounds project and, since 2014, the <a href=\"http://www.stom-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">StoM project</a>. Pundit allows users to add semantically-structured annotations to any document published on the web. Annotations can be used to enrich the semantics of existing documents and to link them into a global graph of interconnected knowledge, which facilitates their creative re-use and opens up new opportunities for studying and analyzing them in a collaborative fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I joined the Network Council hoping to help spread Europeana’s vision to an even larger community. In particular, I’m convinced of the need to increase the quantity and quality of data in Europeana through ad-hoc initiatives both top-down and bottom-up, arising from “creative” communities of practice. To this end, I will do my best to contribute in facilitating the development of new tools and services dedicated to a wide array of different audiences. If you have ideas that you would like to discuss, please feel free to contact me! #AllezCulture</p>"

        title: '‘Europeana helps us tell a better story’: an interview with Koehorst in ‘t Veld'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>“In the old days we had to contact lots of small institutions. But often, we didn’t even know where to <em>start</em> looking for content for our books and exhibitions. Europeana has changed that for us: the service has already helped us to discover many lesser known museum pieces and obscure images that we would have missed otherwise. That means we’re able to tell a better story.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jannetje in ‘t Veld and Toon Koehorst are graphic designers based in Rotterdam. Together, they founded <a href=\"http://www.koehorstintveld.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Koehorst in 't Veld</a>, an editorial graphic design practice. The agency produces compelling and richly illustrated narratives for public and cultural institutions. Europeana has proven to be a great source of inspiration, content and contacts for them. Here, we meet with them and find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Koehorst_in_t_VeldWineke_van_Muiswinkel_600x.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em>Jannetje in ‘t Veld and Toon Koehorst. Wineke van Muiswinkel, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana as a springboard</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The duo first heard about Europeana when it launched in 2008, but only started using it about 18 months ago. “We often create exhibitions where we display objects from well known museums such as the Rijksmuseum and the Teylers Museum. But we want to complement this material with objects from smaller museums and archives so as to tell a more diverse and complete story. In the past, it used to be quite difficult to find exactly the objects we wanted. Now we turn to Europeana, and in many cases we discover references to small institutions that are able to provide us with the kind of material we’re looking for”, Toon Koehorst explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of those exhibitions is ‘<a href=\"http://www.koehorstintveld.nl/browse/z.php?oom=118100773413\" target=\"_blank\">GLASS, The Engine of Progress</a>’, a physical exhibition at Het Nieuwe Instituut, in which modern glass sculptures are displayed together with old glass instruments from scientists and other early glass objects. For the images in the exhibition, the designers delved into a diverse group of international archives. “Europeana played a pivotal role in even identifying some of these archives in the first place. Our research process is far easier now, and much less time consuming as a result.”</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/Glas_02_x600.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>GLASS, The Engine of Progress. Koehorst in 't Veld, CC BY-SA</em>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>A treasure trove for print publications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But Europeana is not only a reference point for finding archives, but a direct source of imagery too. A great example of this is their book ‘<a href=\"http://www.koehorstintveld.nl/browse/z.php?oom=108633223623\" target=\"_blank\">Dijken van Nederland</a>’ (‘Dikes of the Netherlands’), a best-selling hardback about the history of dike construction in the Netherlands. The book contains a staggering amount of research on dikes including the first definitive map showing all the dikes in the country, and a detailed taxonomy of every type of dike. Time and again, Europeana offered a rich resource of historic photos and stories relating to the topic, allowing the authors to tell the story in a compelling way without having to physically travel to and trawl through disparate archival collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-06/DutchDikes-0_x600.jpg\" style=\"width: 401px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Dijken van Nederland. Koehorst in 't Veld, CC BY-SA</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Of course we would love all the material to be available in the highest possible resolution, with clear licensing information and of course no watermarks. The higher the quality of the images, the more we can do with it, especially in the context of physical exhibitions. Still, even a reference to a small heritage institution’s website is helpful for us, as long as they can help us to get an object on loan for the exhibition or provide us with a image for printing”, says Jannetje in ‘t Veld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that you can find objects from both big and small institutions via Europeana is an important advantage for the designers. “We especially like the fact that we can show objects out of their normal context. Take our Glass exhibition for example; we can show historic objects next to contemporary pieces of glass art. This is exactly how the internet - and Europeana - works best; by ‘freeing’ objects from their collections, you create interesting new collections, something that was unthinkable in the past. Sometimes we are even jokingly called the ‘Archives Liberation Front’! But of course we always make sure we prominently mention all the institutions; we give credit where credit is due.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bringing Europeana offline</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s exciting to learn about work by creators like Jannetje and Toon, and to hear how Europeana has become a crucial part of their research rituals. Working in a digital-only organisation, it’s easy to focus on measuring impressions, and clicks on our website and social media profiles. This is a reminder that we shouldn’t forget there is a physical world out there where Europeana is being used by and shown to people without us necessarily knowing about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also something that institutions and other providers should keep in mind when thinking about the potential value of making your collections available via Europeana. Of course we can generate increased website traffic, and provide extra visibility for our partners on social media. But when the collections start to appear offline, in exhibitions or books, it proves just how much value there is in making your collections openly accessible and available to as broad an audience as you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jannetje and Toon are excited about upcoming features on Europeana, such as the introduction of thematic channels and filters, which allows the designers to filter their search results on image size, aspect ratio and colour(s). “We would probably still search the whole collections, though” they add, “you never know what unexpectedly relevant results there might be.”</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana strives to offer multilingual access to digital cultural heritage in Europe. This is a big technical challenge as it’s not just the content which is multilingual but the users who speak Europe’s 25+ different languages too. Making sure users can find relevant objects even in languages that they are not familiar with requires sophisticated algorithms and user interactions that bridge the linguistic gap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, Europeana has worked on lots of solutions geared towards providing a truly multilingual cultural heritage portal. Among these solutions is the <a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10285\" target=\"_blank\">query translation</a> process, the multilingual enrichment of content metadata with semantic resources (including thesauri) and the automatic detection of the user's’ preferred language based on the browser locale and cookie settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/enrichment_vermeer.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 392px;\"><em>Enrichment of the dc:creator field with language variants for “Johannes Vermeer” from <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DBpedia</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the EU-funded project <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-v30\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana v3.0</a>, a whole task was dedicated to researching multilingual best practices in the cultural heritage domain. A White Paper summarizes the main findings and state-of-the-art practices we found. This will instruct Europeana’s future work to tackle language issues. Now, we are looking for your input and experience with multilingual data and multilingual users. Help us turn this White Paper into a community effort by contributing your expert knowledge!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We invite you to leave your thoughts and comments on the White Paper until September 11 <em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pxp3JS72odvUc2PYn3-0gwXY-8WrmJhzbcKm9wnNueM/edit\">here</a></em>.</strong></p>"

        body: "<h2>Europeana - Putting the Crowd in the Picture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Can creative re-use and co-creation open up locked forms of cultural heritage to the crowd? I’m quite sure they can, and that’s why I am involved in Europeana’s Network.<br><br>\r\nHola, my name is Olivier Schulbaum and I’m from <a href=\"http://youcoop.org/\">Platoniq</a>, a non-profit organisation based in Spain. Our members have more than 10 years’ experience in the design and development of open source work methodologies, ICT and tools for social innovation and the creative industries.<br>\r\nAs a councillor, I'd like to put \"the crowd\" in the middle of the growing flow of people and values aligned with the Europeana 2020 vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/cocreation-booklet.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 174px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/incubation/\" target=\"_blank\">Platoniq's co-creation methodologies</a> developed as part of Europeana Creative</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Locked out of cultural heritage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While people in general might appreciate and value culture, society doesn’t feel a powerful sense of ownership with culture anymore. Culture can appear remote, precious and untouchable, even when we talk about digital cultural heritage. Ironically, digitalization of culture is only part of the solution. We need to be sure that these new forms of culture are accessible and attractive for people to engage with. Now that so much of life happens on-screen if not online, we know we can’t rest with only having done the work of digitalizing cultural heritage if people don’t believe they have the means, or the reason, to use it. We need to create tools to help ourselves reclaim our cultural heritage - and we need to do it together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With my team at Platoniq Lab, we facilitate cooperation and distributed social innovation processes. By using carefully developed methodologies, workshops and dynamics, we can introduce cultural shifts within organizations like NGOs, institutions, cooperatives or social businesses.<br><br>\r\nSince 2013, we’ve had the great opportunity to shake Europeana’s foundations, first as part of Europeana Creative and currently as part of Europeana DSI where we’re focusing on the re-users community, helping to bring our cultural heritage out into the air, out of the closed, protected, controlled spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Disruption: cracking the protective glass</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the disruptive benefits for creative communities and the Europeana Community itself, let’s ask ourselves some interesting questions. How could crowdsourcing tools - like co-creation, crowd development, crowdfunding - serve to raise awareness and facilitate deeper democratic engagement with the digital public domain? How can that crowd engagement help open standards for collaboration, in order to design a comprehensive, educative lab context, gathering together the entire process of conception, design, prototyping and financing into something integrated for the development of new projects?<br><br>\r\nThe doors of the galleries, libraries, archives and museums have now opened wider, and the keys to the glass cases are increasingly in reach of anyone with an interest in participating. Will the crowd begin to bring more social innovation to the long-term planning required to determine the future of our cultural heritage? It’s best not to think of this trend as “crowdsourcing”, but rather as citizen participation, even “citizen curation”. Ultimately, the question becomes: will future heritage be financed and co-curated by the crowd? I’d be happy to open up this debate within the Europeana Community.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/nachtwacht-twinned-no-credi.jpg\" style=\"width: 442px; height: 650px;\"><br><em><a href=\"https://museumsatnight.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/vangoyourself-recreate-artworks-with-your-friends-for-museums-at-night/\" target=\"_blank\">A VanGoYourself recreation of The Nightwatch</a> by Kennisland CC BY 2.0</em>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>It all starts with a Van Gogh and a selfie</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a lively example, a project called <a href=\"http://VanGoYourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a>, one of the Pilots developed as part of the Europeana Creative project, offers people several levels of engagement with digital cultural heritage, from the simple re-creation of a painting, posting on their website and sharing on social media, up to sponsoring additional artworks through their crowdfund, in turn making them available for more people to re-create. Cultural innovation projects like this one, emerging from larger efforts such as Europeana, have been born in co-creation laboratories and designed as experimental efforts in order to see what comes of all this; what’s practical, what’s desirable, what’s sustainable in the use of digitalized cultural heritage. Now, the next step is ours. Won’t you please join us in welcoming the crowd into the picture?</p>"

        body: "<p><em>On 9-10 July, the Austrian National Library in Vienna hosted <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative's Culture Jam</a>, bringing together cultural innovators from across Europe to share ideas, knowledge and inspiration. Here, Elisabeth Stricker and Kristin Dill from the Austrian National Library update us on a busy and exciting two days. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiring presentations and talks, colourful posters in the exhibition space, animated chatting during lunch breaks, delighted faces experimenting with the interactive exhibition Culture Cam - the final showcase of the Europeana Creative project proved that it was much more than just another conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>‘The Crypto Cosmic Culture Jam’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Creative%20blog%20images/cultjam15-01-kl.jpg\"><br><em>CC-BY-SA Ingrid Oentrich (Austrian National Library)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breandán Knowlton, the charming Master of Ceremonies of “#CultJam15”, elegantly conducted proceedings, with over 60 speakers and keynotes taking to the stage over the two days of the conference in Vienna. The first day kicked off with an engaging keynote from<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#michaeledson\"> Michael Edson</a>, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cultjam15_20150709_0950_Edson_LAPTOP.pdf\">The Crypto Cosmic Culture Jam</a>’, who told us that the Internet is mostly dark matter and that cultural heritage organisations actually have no idea what is out there and what our users want. But is this true? With this question in mind we threw ourselves into colourful worlds of creative re-use conjured up by<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/pilots\"> Europeana Creative’s Pilots</a> and<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-creative/challenges\"> Challenge Winners</a> and of course the<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/132797541\"> super-talented Pre-Jam Ambassadors</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The projects and ideas on display showed us the beauty that can be created out of European(a) content. Presentations in the session on the Business of Culture explored how crowdfunding can unlock the business potential of cultural heritage collections and presented successful strategies to get investors involved. It made us think, too, about how labs are like playgrounds, inviting people to use their imagination. We glimpsed into the wonderful world of<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#ingridmariameijer\"> Etsy</a>, where the customer is the curator, and we discussed<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#jensbley\"> eCulture in Smart Cities</a> with the need to engage in new business models, and reach new audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Interactivity and hands-on experience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Creative%20blog%20images/cultjam15-02-kl.jpg\"><br><em>CC-BY-SA Ingrid Oentrich (Austrian National Library)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who wanted to get actively involved, the workshops and Chef’s table discussions in the parallel sessions provided the perfect real-life playground. An intrigued crowd joined thought-provoking discussions and found opportunities to share their thoughts and ideas on lawful re-use of high quality data, using external platforms like YouTube, Flickr and Wikipedia to increase cultural and social impact. Partners<a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/en/\"> platoniq</a> and<a href=\"http://goteo.org/\"> goteo</a>, shared their<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers/#enricsenabrehidalgo\"> co-creation</a> experience and taught us what<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#olivierschulbaum\"> crowdfunding</a> is all about. And if you wanted to personally experience the excitement of the Europeana Creative Pilots, it was possible to interact with the Culture Cam exhibit or reenact a painting in a ‘VanGo Yourself’ session.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HHB9kvZ-LE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Diableries Brought to life</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first day ended with a Rock n’ Roll re-use: we donned our 3D glasses and sat back to watch the short film<a href=\"http://www.onenightinhell.com/\"> One Night in Hell</a>, which brought Brian May’s<a href=\"http://www.londonstereo.com/diableries/index.html\"> Diableries</a> (stereoscopic photographs from the 1860s) collection to life, sending shivers down our spine. Afterwards, everyone was invited to the famous Vienna<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/social-event-and-awards-ceremony/\"> Ottakringer Brewery</a>, awarding those with the best feedback on the pitches during day one, as well as giving people the chance to carry out some serious networking accompanied by the beats of the local DJ collective ‘<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Graetzlsound\">Grätzlsound</a>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Creative%20blog%20images/cultjam15-03-kl.jpg\"><br><em>CC-BY-SA Max Kaiser (Austrian National Library)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>‘Museums without Walls’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day started off as energetically as the previous one ended: keynote<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#levmanovich\"> Lev Manovich</a> let us discover<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cultjam15_20150710_0935_Manovich_MAC.pdf\"> patterns in human society with intriguing animations and compilations of cultural heritage material but also through the selfies we share online</a>. Get your API ready, because people are waiting!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other ideas that got people talking revolved around the future of heritage and creativity, and defining what we mean by niche communities; they aren’t necessarily small or rare, sometimes just specialised. We were told not to forget that commerce and heritage are two hemispheres of the same brain; but which half do we use? We ended this session with a heated Oxford Debate on whether public budget cuts are good for heritage. As with all good debates, the opposing sides agreed only to disagree!<br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Creative%20blog%20images/cultjam15-04-kl.jpg\"><br><em>CC-BY-SA Ingrid Oentrich (Austrian National Library)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>‘Disrupting History’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After two days of intense, open discussion, encouraged by a creativity-fuelled atmosphere, it was time to enjoy the last keynote and follow Retronaut<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/speakers#chriswild\"> Chris Wild</a> into the past<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cultjam15_20150710_1600_Wild.pdf\"> you wouldn’t believe</a>. He introduced us to the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/disrupting-history\"> S.P.E.E.D</a> methodology and how content can go viral. You want to know how S.P.E.E.D can make your user base grow exponentially? Then check our website! We already uploaded all<a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/programme/\"> presentations</a> and video footage and the pictures of the conference will be available soon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does the future of heritage and creativity look like? Europeana Creative Culture Jam proved to be an excellent platform for tackling hard questions about the creative re-use of cultural heritage, and for finding some inspiring answers too - the interactive process definitely got the community thinking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Creative Culture Jam was more than a celebration of all that Europeana Creative has achieved - it was a peek into the future of things to come! It brought together new talent and experienced hands, as well as technical and creative minds, to collaboratively prepare and develop new paths for the future. It was a chance to make sure we build on the lessons we have learned and share this knowledge for others for (re)-use. The project Europeana Creative has ended, but the Pilots and incubated projects, as well as ideas and inspiration, will carry on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find all the presentations on the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/programme/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative Culture Jam website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Contributors: Susanne Tremml, Imogen Greenhalgh, Milena Popova, Lizzy Komen, Max Kaiser</em></p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Jana Hoffmann'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hallo! My name is Jana Hoffmann. I have a background in biology (Taxonomy and Systematics) and am currently engaged in research on a diverse array of topics under the umbrella of the science programme “Digital World and Information Sciences” at the <a href=\"http://www.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum für Naturkunde</a> (MfN). As a result of this focus, I have become very aware of the new societal and technological challenges that Europeana is facing and feel well situated to help navigate future challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Museum für Naturkunde is one of the most significant research museums in the world. Facilitating a strong focus on biodiversity, evolution and geosciences, the collections of the MfN comprise more than 30 million items relating to Zoology, Palaeontology, Geology and Mineralogy, including an <a href=\"http://www.naturkundemuseum-berlin.de/en/sammlungen/tierstimmenarchiv/\" target=\"_blank\">Animal Sound Archive</a> containing approximately 120 000 animal sound recordings. Furthermore, the MfN houses its own historical archive and reference library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/name-folder-stephanoceros-taxon-folder-stephanosceros-eichhornii.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 564px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_EHRENBERG_D_MFN_GERMANY_MB_ED_2638.html?start=106&amp;query=ehrenberg+&amp;startPage=97&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3AOpenUp!&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Museum+f%C3%BCr+Naturkunde+Berlin%22&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">Ehrenberg Drawings</a> provided by Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Perspectives on Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I had my first contact with Europeana about 6 years ago through the EU-funded project <a href=\"http://www.bhl-europe.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) for Europe</a>, which I supported as project assistant and business analyst. BHL-Europe aimed at making digital European biodiversity literature available through its own portal while at the same time providing the content to Europeana. Building on my experience in BHL-Europe, I then shifted my focus to another project, <a href=\"http://open-up.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">Opening Up the Natural History Heritage for Europeana</a> (OpenUp!), which focused on content provision and data harmonization, but was aimed at natural history collection objects. Today OpenUp! is among the Top 10 content providers for Europeana and occupies an important niche by providing natural history related digital content including images of specimens of zoological, botanical, paleontological, mineralogical and anthropological collections, but also animal sounds and scientific drawings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through my work on these projects, I have learned a lot about content provision to Europeana and am familiar with the perspectives of the content providers as well as aggregators, including some of the technical aspects like metadata mapping, schemas and harmonization. Furthermore, I was strongly engaged in negotiation over copyrights and supported an effort to make the metadata of Natural History content available under the CC0 as well as the content available through the Creative Commons Licensing Framework. These efforts were much more on the cutting edge than one would think given that Europeana was, and to some extent still is, fairly unknown in the Natural Sciences Sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/eurycorypha-adicra-karsch-1892.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 635px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/11622/_MFN_MINERALOGY_MFN_GERMANY_MFN_MIN_1999_2668.html?start=16&amp;query=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Museum+f%C3%BCr+Naturkunde+Berlin%22&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3AOpenUp!&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Fpublicdomain%2Fzero%2F1.0%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-sa%2F*&amp;qf=minerals&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\" target=\"_blank\">Spessartin</a> provided by Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, public domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I later changed “sides” when I became involved in another innovative project, Europeana Creative, dealing with the creative re-use of Europeana’s data and its potential. In this project I supported the initial phase of the development of the Natural History Pilot for Europeana’s data re-use. The outcome is the first chapter of the adventure game “The Secret Legacy”, which teaches about the aims of a Natural History Museum and work as a taxonomist. The challenge in this effort was to work with a new set of partners from the creative gaming industry and to create a product that would be appealing for a completely new user group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Promoting, Sharing, Linking</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Being an elected councillor gives me the opportunity to continue my work in <strong>promoting </strong>Europeana and to strengthen its position in the Natural History Domain. Despite the fact that Natural History Content is now much better represented in Europeana, the general knowledge about Europeana among my colleagues is still lacking. Thus, one of my main targets moving forward will be to make Europeana better known and connected also within the “Non-Cultural” Heritage Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also support the <strong>sharing</strong> of content (metadata and media) as freely and for as many interest groups as possible. I see Europeana being the chance to make our Cultural Heritage visible and usable for all kinds of users – worldwide. Through Europeana we can overcome the known barriers in knowledge transfer to countries with less developed infrastructure and - of course - the younger generations. In addition, I see a great potential for building new partnerships with the Creative Industry in allowing the re-use of the Cultural Heritage content under well-defined rules that are beneficial for both sides: providers and users. In this effort, Europeana should act as a mediating platform and provide directions for best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enthusiastically support the technological progress and innovation in <strong>linking</strong> data across domains and content types and exploring new technological partnerships for a better user experience. I see Linked Data as being the future. It will create new impulses for innovative, inter- and transdisciplinary projects, initiatives and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m looking forward to support Europeana’s future development in a democratic way driven in dialog with and by the needs of the community. Did I hit on anything that is of high interest to you and you would like to see much more represented in the development of Europeana? Don’t hesite to contact me!</p>"

        title: 'Hallo aus Wien! The Members Council meet in Vienna'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Last week, the Europeana Network Association’s Members Council met at the Austrian National Library in Vienna. It was a chance to come together to discuss the year so far, as well as plan for the next six months ahead. Here, Max Kaiser, Chair of the Members Council, and Merete Sanderhoff, Vice Chair of the Members Council, fill us in on the day’s events.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We were both elected to sit on the Management Board of the Members Council last December - and what a busy six months it’s been since then! With the sun shining over Vienna, the Austrian National Library provided the perfect place to catch up with our fellow Council members, as well as look ahead to the next six months to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/800px-Balthasar_Wigand_Josephsplatz_1835.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 326px;\"><br><em>The Austrian National Library, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Balthasar_Wigand_Josephsplatz_1835.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With lots of ground to cover, the day was broken down into three parts. The first part looked at the different issues which arose while setting up the Network Association’s formal governance structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part addressed the Network’s engagement in recent months, and the tremendous progress we have collectively made since the start of the year. We looked at the considerable contributions of Working Groups and Task Forces, and their progress so far. We also addressed the future topical campaigns we want people to get behind - on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/eu-parliament-in-favour-of-copyright-rules-better-fit-for-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\">copyright reform</a>, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/placing-culture-at-the-heart-of-europe-s-digital-single-market\" target=\"_blank\">role culture plays in driving the Digital Single Market</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/hidden-treasures-and-iconic-masterpieces-the-europeana-280-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 280 art campaign</a>. These campaigns tie the work of the Network Association into the broader aims of the cultural heritage sector in Europe, and allow members to act as both representatives of their own institutions as well as Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the third part focused firmly on the next chapter - what can the Network contribute to Europeana’s annual working plan, its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/make-the-beautiful-thing-business-plan-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Business Plan</a>, for 2016?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/MC-meet-1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>Image: Europeana CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Governance and the Network Association</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the hard work of our fellow Members Council member <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meet-the-members-council-joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\" target=\"_blank\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a> and the Working Groups dealing with Association bylaws, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/calling-all-network-members-it-s-time-to-make-it-official\" target=\"_blank\">new governance structure</a> of Europeana is nearly finalised. Paving the way for a more democratic future for Europeana, it’s an exciting milestone to finally reach. Decisions are still needed on certain bylaws and statutes, and all Councillors present were unanimous that these were now ready to go to the General Assembly for approval, with just two slight changes to be made before they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, we came to the conclusion that it would be premature to increase the number of Members Council seats to 50 just yet. Given that we are still finalising our transition into an Association, we are instead looking into the possibility of an incremental increase, with 20% seats added at each annual election. At the moment, there are 25 seats, which means at the next election we expect an extra five seats will be added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/MC-meet-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>Image: Europeana CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Engagement with the Network Association</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might be aware, Europeana uses <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/task-forces\" target=\"_blank\">Task Forces</a> to tackle challenges facing the digital heritage field. At the moment, there are eight different Task Forces running, and each has a Members Council representative participating. They are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Brokerage and Business Opportunities - Olivier Schulbaum</li>\r\n    <li>Education - Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</li>\r\n    <li>Content Re-use - Merete Sanderhoff</li>\r\n    <li>Connecting networks for collaborating and sharing information - Rolf Kallman</li>\r\n    <li>Communicators Group - Kerstin Herlt</li>\r\n    <li>Enrichments and Evaluations - Johan Oomen</li>\r\n    <li>FLOSS inventory - Johan Oomen</li>\r\n    <li>Local Libraries - Sorina Stanca</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, they address all sorts of different issues, and you can <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/task-forces\" target=\"_blank\">read more about them</a> and how they relate to your fields of interest. Keep an eye out, too, for other communications from us and the rest of the Members Council - together, we’re championing all the activities of the Network!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting down to business in 2016</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up came business planning! The Europeana Foundation’s Harry Verwayen presented a summary of a survey which asked Councillors to identify three different areas of work Europeana should move our focus away from. When time is precious, it’s key to prioritise, so we hope this will prove a really valuable exercise!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also invited us to take note of the feedback from the Task Forces that could be usefully incorporated into the Business Plan, and to agree on priorities and project milestones until the AGM and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, we broke out into three different working groups and shared our thoughts and weighed up different ideas. The feedback will be collected into a document to share with the Members Council before the AGM. We will then have a business plan to present in Amsterdam in November - we hope you will join us to hear the results!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/AGM2014.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>Europeana's 2014 Annual General Meeting in Madrid. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/15677758426/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Europeana Annual General Meeting</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we turned to think about the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015\" target=\"_blank\">AGM - which will take place in Amsterdam this November</a> - in more detail. A working group has been putting their heads together to come up with a brief for the day, making sure all the Network’s activities are properly represented. The group brings together a number of Councillors - Francesca di Donato, Jana Hoffmann, Jiří Frank, Johan Oomen, Lizzy Jongma, Max Kaiser, Olivier Schulbaum and Uldis Zarins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information about the day will follow, but in the meantime, don’t forget to save the date in your diaries - 3-4 November in Amsterdam! That’s where you’ll vote for your new Members Council members, so it’s an opportunity not to be missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the day, we all felt satisfied we’d addressed our priorities and fulfilled our aims for the meeting. It was great to see everyone face to face and and celebrate their engagement so far, as well as share our excitement for what’s still to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ready and raring to get back to work, and with clear objectives for the next six months, we look forward to continuing promoting the issues that most matter to you. <strong>#AllezCulture!</strong></p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>On 9-10 July, <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative's Culture Jam</a> was held at the Austrian National Library. During the two days, Joris Pekel, Community Coordinator for Cultural Heritage, interviewed a number of speakers attending the conference to learn more about their work and their vision for the future of digital cultural heritage.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>First in this series is <a href=\"http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2015/07/analyzing-big-visual-data-new-slides.html\" target=\"_blank\">keynote speaker Lev Manovich</a>, author of books on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media\" target=\"_blank\">new media theory</a>, Professor at the <a href=\"http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home\" target=\"_blank\">Graduate Center</a>, CUNY, and Director of the <a href=\"http://lab.softwarestudies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Software Studies Initiative</a>, which works on the analysis and visualization of big visual cultural data. Their projects like <a href=\"http://selfiecity.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Selfiecity</a>, which visualises millions of selfies from all around the world, have gained a lot of attention, not only within the academic field, but within popular culture too.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/LevManovich.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>Lev Manovich on stage at #CultJam15. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134773869@N08/19664801320/in/album-72157656164598105/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a> CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hi Lev, thanks for taking the time to chat to me. My first question: how are you doing and what is keeping you busy these days?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hi. At the moment we are using our tools to analyse two different topics. One is the analysis of historical digitised material that largely comes from cultural institutions around the world. The second focus is more on visual culture that you see on social media such as Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then there is a third thing actually that combines visual culture and art history. We have been working with a dataset of around one million images of artworks from the largest, or at least it used to be, gallery of user generated art. We got their images from 2001 to 2010. The images are sorted by author and over 2000 different categories were used. We can use this set to look at the evolution over time and ask questions like ‘what is art?’ and analyse what trends in art we can see in the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look for example at the type of scene: is it outdoor or indoor? Are there objects displayed? And so on... I am really happy that we are now able to combine our existing visualisation techniques with content analysis to study these large and heterogeneous datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do you think that these kinds of techniques can be useful for art historians too?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes I do. Let me first of all say that I think that art historians or people who study visual culture should not throw away everything they know. All these 20th century techniques and theories remain useful. I do think, however, that these new techniques that are coming from the data visualisation and computer research field should be adopted and people have to get training in this. This is because there are lots of new questions that you can ask using these techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for example, you want to find out what people paint today around the world. Not just the 300 famous people in the art world, but everybody else. This means you have to look at thousands or millions of images and you can do that using these techniques. I think these kinds of visualisations can be seen as a new language for the humanities which can supplement the discourses which were created in natural languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When I look at your projects such as Selfiecity I see that it is mostly the object which is analysed. How important is metadata for you?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is possible to explore and study sets of images without metadata. But let me give you the example of the project where we took all of Van Gogh’s paintings and visualised them. Here, we already know that all the objects are from one artist. If we simply want to look at the patterns and colours being used to see what is typical and not typical for his style, then we don’t need other information like time or genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you see here that if you want to do more, for example a scatterplot over time, then you do need this information. Usually with visualisation you have two, or sometimes three dimensions. Here we can combine metadata, time, geo-location etc, with visual characteristics, colours used, how symmetrical something is etc. You look for example at the evolution of colour or composition over time. So metadata is important, but at the same time it is just one dimension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/LevManovichslide.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 417px;\"><br><em>A slide from Lev Manovich's <a href=\"http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2015/07/analyzing-big-visual-data-new-slides.html\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cultural datasets are getting bigger and bigger. How much work does it take you to prepare a dataset? Do you just start, see what comes out of it and improve from there, or do you make sure you have a really comprehensive dataset first?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In every data project whether it is data design or data science it is well known that you spend 70-80% on downloading, analysing and cleaning the data. This is also definitely the case for all the projects we have done. In my experience the only place where you get really clean data is from social media companies as they are commercial companies. When the data comes from a cultural source there is usually a lot of data missing or not consistent, images don’t load etc. So that is one thing. But it of course very much depends on what you want to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take Europeana for example you have 45 million records, and let’s say around a million of the images in your database are of high enough quality. When you are looking for pretty pictures for your application or to put on your t-shirt you don’t need anything coherent as you can just select separate images. However, if you want to understand patterns of historical evolution and look for example at the difference between different cities you actually need to have enough samples.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What would you most like to get from cultural institutions to make your life and research easier?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What I would like to say to cultural institutions is that they not only have to think about publishing their metadata and content, preferably through an API or some other means to make it really easy to download, but they also need to think about how users can get insight into their collection - for example, to see if it covers a certain historical period well enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I want to work with Europeana, for example, I am not going to download all those millions of images. What I want to do is to be able to get all of the metadata as a set of csv files and load them to see characteristics like how many records do we have, records per country, per medium etc. After that I can say ‘ok for my research I want to download all the images from France between 1750 till 1780.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the new generation of digital humanities people could be the big users of a database like Europeana, but to work with collections you not only need to make the metadata accessible, you must also make it easy to figure out what’s inside and how to get it. Give people a flat file saying ‘ok this is what we have’. It can be just a few fields such as artist name, time and country. You basically give people a map how to explore your collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thanks a lot. Looking forward to your future work and publications!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks, it was a pleasure to meet you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Writing the past: transcribing handwritten documents from World War One'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Over the past three years, thousands of handwritten documents have been contributed to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> website. These range from hurriedly scribbled messages from exhausted soldiers at the front to their loved ones at home, to long, detailed letters about daily life from worried wives and desperate parents; from quickly penned notes full of cryptic abbreviations made by officers about battle movements, to personal dairies kept by nurses to make sense of the horrors before them. These firsthand accounts from all over Europe tell us, in different languages, the story of the Great War from a whole range of perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/Transcription1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 383px;\"><br><em>A letter contributed to Europeana 1914-1918 by <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/1313\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Strauss</a> (CC BY-SA)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many of these precious accounts are very difficult to read. Creases and folds, rips and tears, mud and even blood stains can all make these century-old papers almost impossible to decipher. Even if the documents are in good condition, and have been properly scanned, the script can be difficult to interpret, particularly when old fashioned calligraphy is used, or a document has been penned by an inexperienced writer with illegible handwriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be truly useful to readers, they need to be fully transcribed so that they can be read easily. Europeana’s partner <a href=\"http://www.factsandfiles.com/en/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Facts &amp; Files</a>, a private historical research institute from Berlin, has developed a tool precisely for that purpose: <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu/\">Transcribe e1914-1918</a> - the prototype of an online transcription tool funded by the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/Transcription2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 403px;\"><br><em>Image: Facts and Files, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transcription tool will be used in a crowdsourcing project which aims to gradually improve the quality of transcriptions by several people consecutively working online. The idea is to raise awareness not only about the great importance of handling original historical sources, but about the difficulties of doing so too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workshops will be organized to help nurture teamwork and improve the participants’ media skills. At the end of each workshop, the participants will discuss the results and reflect on their personal experiences while transcribing sources. They will also be encouraged to explore the Europeana 1914‑1918 site and to participate in a transcription competition (transcribathon) planned to take place in 2015 or 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/Transcription3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 378px;\"><br><em>Image: Facts and Files, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 2 July 2015, the first workshop was organized for 20 interested students from the “Primo Levi Gymnasium” in Berlin as part of a Day of Social Sciences. Throughout the workshop, the 15 to 16 year old students learned a variety of media skills combining use of modern technology with expertise on working with original historical documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an introduction into different old scripts such as Kurrent (an old form of German language handwriting based on late medieval cursive writing) and Sütterlin (the last widely used form of Kurrent) as well as different transcription techniques, the students could start transcribing the documents online in small groups working alternately on different texts. Each group was also introduced to the technical side of digitising historical documents. The students were able to experience working with primary historical documents as a process from start to finish, and in an interactive way - carrying out research, digitizing and transcribing sources and evaluating them too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/Transcription4.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 422px;\"><br><em>Image: Facts and Files, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original documents digitized at Europeana 1914-1918 collection days were used as source material. The budding historians were also encouraged to ask their own families about material from the First World War which could be incorporated in the workshop. This brought home the sometimes abstract history of the War for the students so they could experience it through the individual testimonies and private material they had brought in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students thoroughly enjoyed the workshop, and even wished they had had more time.<br>\r\nQuite a few, now they’ve got the hang of things, plan to continue working on the documents at home, and are keen to take part in a future transcribathon competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re interested, you can look at <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu/collections/show/103\" target=\"_blank\">results from the workshop</a>, and you can also <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana/review/134819176/eeca2cf72f\" target=\"_blank\">watch a short video report</a> too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to know more about the transcription tool or be involved in a transcribathon then please contact Mr Frank Drauschke from Facts &amp; Files, via <a href=\"mailto:drauschke@factsandfiles.com\">drauschke@factsandfiles.com</a> (German or English).</p>"

        title: 'Details make the design: an interview with Chris Wild'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>On 9-10 July, Europeana Creative's Culture Jam was held at the Austrian National Library. During the two days, we spoke to some of the speakers attending the conference to learn more about their work and their vision for the future of digital cultural heritage. Here, Milena Popova, Business Development Manager, speaks to Chris Wild, creator of <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/\">Retronaut</a>, and author of Retronaut: The Photographic Time Machine published by National Geographic.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nWhat do you think are the biggest challenges in connecting heritage to the creative industries?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I think of two challenges. One is that the term “the creative industries” is very broad and we use it to encompass anything that includes some degree of creativity and that can range from dance to record labels and everything in between. So, if we are a cultural heritage institution and we have materials or assets which we think are of value for these industries, then we need to start by saying for which industries and in what way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So we need more segmentation, more specifics?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes… Retronaut is kind of a start-up and one of the things I’ve learned about start-ups is that it is very easy to answer the question “Who will use your product?” with “Everyone” i.e. everyone will use our product, will use our website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be true and it certainly makes everything sound very exciting and simple but it usually means that we end up with a product that nobody actually loves and, especially, nobody wants to use. One of the great questions for a new start-up product is not “Who will use it?” but “Who would be highly disappointed if our product no longer existed?” As cultural institutions, we should look for people who will miss our “product”, our cultural heritage assets, people who will be significantly disappointed if they didn’t get to see or read or interact with our product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/ChrisWild1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><i>Chris Wild presenting at #CultJam15. Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134773869@N08/sets/72157656165946775\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a> CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>But what about the case when people just don’t know about the existence of this product? They can’t be disappointed about something they don’t know about.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s why we need to start not with what we’ve got but with what people actually want. Because if we don’t do that, we are acting as though our collection is of more significance than our audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we take that view, we believe people should want to engage with our resources. However, if we reverse that perspective and start by asking what is it that people actually want that may connect to what we have to offer, then we can start to tailor what we show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s say we have a million digitised objects which the world has not seen. We could argue that if only the world could see our objects, it would engage with them. The implication of that approach is that we need to show the world all the objects until one accidentally triggers the audience into engaging. Whereas if we start with the question “what is it people actually want to see or do already?” and select objects that fulfil those needs, then we have much faster and more efficient engagement between our objects and the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in summary, the first challenge is not to think of the creative industries as a whole but as specific sectors, companies and individuals, and question in detail what those groups are seeking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second challenge relates to how we connect the creative industries to cultural heritage. Most probably, the creative industries don’t frame the question this way. They don’t walk around wondering how they can connect to cultural heritage; they are walking around thinking about whatever creative challenge they are working on or doing. So, our challenge is how we find out what, in our collections, might be important to what the creative industries are already doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are you most excited about in that area right now?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Two main points. It is not that I am excited about budget cuts in the cultural heritage sector; neither that there isn’t enough money for cultural heritage; however, in my own experience, the best opportunities, the most important, life changing moments have come when things collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very often this is related to economics. Let’s give you a personal example: when Retronaut all but ran out of money because I wasn’t thinking in the right way, or because I wasn’t able to raise the investment I wanted - that forced me to think very precisely about not only what I was doing but also who I am. And it is through figuring out who I am and who I want to be in a very specific way that now I am in a very different place, in a very positive place. Nobody likes to be in a situation when money is scarce; however, I know personally that from this come the best opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/ChrisWild2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><i>Chris Wild presenting at #CultJam15. Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/134773869@N08/sets/72157656165946775\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a> CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second one is that I am devoted to the Rijksmuseum. The Rijksmuseum is, in the words of Simon Sharma, “a curatorial revolution” and I agree with this [statement]. All the things I’ve looked for in a museum are there, to the extent that I, slightly radically, now say that it is only possible to either be like or be unlike the Rijksmuseum - there isn’t another paradigm.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are you most excited about the Europeana Creative project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, Europeana Creative has been about trying out what’s possible to do with cultural heritage and all of these experiments have worked out as all of them are about learning. The other thing that excites me is the quality of some of the experiments. All of the experiments are good but some of them are especially good. One of my favourites is <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/vangoyourself-one-year-on\" target=\"_blank\">VanGoYourself</a>. Everything about that is right to me – its focus is very small and specific, and its branding &amp; presentation are beautifully executed. I agree with designer Charles Eames who said ‘the details are not the details. They make the design.’ In VanGoYourself, all the details are right, which is both rare and special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do you hope to see in the next few years that shows a meaningful connection between creative industries and heritage?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The core thing I’d like to see happening (and, again, I see it already happening in some places like the Rijksmuseum), is that GLAMs, particularly museums, are aware of what they have that no other place has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is often a spectacular building but, more importantly, unique and special objects. I want the museum to be a physical place and I want to have three-dimensional objects. So, if the focus shifts back on to museums as physical places with physical objects, it will become really clear what their value to almost any of the creative industries. Once you have segmented the creative industries, you can see really easy connections between each of them and an amazing physical place and – especially – the objects inside. So, tightening the focus on that will make the value offering of museums and other institutions to creative industries much easier to articulate. As a result, we will see many more collaborations with the creative practitioners who want to express what they are doing in a special place or with a special object, and with particular audience, all three combined. That’s what I’d like to see happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And digitally, I would love to see, and I do see this, especially in <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu\">Europeana Labs</a>, a shift from a focus on quantity to quality. As an example, I would like to see more online projects that show big and beautiful images, and only big and beautiful images. I would also like to see less focus on metadata, and more focus on data - and by data, I mean images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images are so often used as illustrations for textural information, rather than as information in their own right. So, digital projects that are both smaller and better - smaller scope, better result.</p>"

        body: "<p>When I was 12, my parents took us to Paris to visit the Louvre. They had taken us to many museums before, but we were never very interested. It was one of those boring things we had to do on holidays. But then, in the Louvre, I was overwhelmed, astounded. Beautiful art, amazing sculptures, fascinating histories… It was then I knew I wanted to work with art, with history, and in a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/LouvreRijks_1_x550.jpg\" style=\"width: 410px; height: 550px;\"><br><em>Mary Cassatt at the Louvre in the Etruscan gallery, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_1950_690.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nHello! My name is Lizzy Jongma. I was able to fulfil my dreams and I currently work at the Rijksmuseum as their Data Manager. The Rijksmuseum is the Netherlands’ national museum of art and history. It holds a vast collection of over 1 million objects and works of art. Recently, the museum closed for renovations which took more than ten years. We realised that digital media and the Internet would help us keep our collections accessible for our curators, and for our audiences too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put a lot of effort into digitizing our collections and working on their metadata. Currently more than 600,000 works of art are described in detail (beyond basic registration) and 300,000 works of arts are digitally photographed. We are experimenting with 3-D photography, digital conservation documentation, colour true digital photography and so on. Over the last decade the Rijksmuseum turned into a center for digital innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn’t just want to digitize our collections to make them more accessible for our curators, or even the visitors on our website. It is our ultimate goal to share our works of art with everyone, everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/HetBrood_1_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 441px;\"><br><em>Bread of the future... <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search/objecten?q=toekomst&amp;s=objecttype&amp;p=1&amp;ps=12&amp;ii=5#/RP-T-1930-86,3\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nOpen data and Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012 we came into contact with Europeana. We wanted to share our collections with large portal sites and Europeana was one of them. At this time we were developing our API, and started working on open data. We wanted to open up our digital collections as a source for programmers, other developers, techies and artists.<br><br>\r\nOur collaboration with Europeana came at a great time. Europeana had just switched to its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">CC0/Public Domain licensing scheme</a> and we needed help to open up our collections as freely as possible. Europeana taught us a lot about Creative Commons, Creative Commons Licenses and open sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2012 we have worked closely with Europeana in our experiments with Open Data. We moved from CC-BY-SA licenses to CC0 Public Domain. We allow users to commercially re-use our collections.<br><br>\r\nWe are experimenting with new techniques and new strategies to become more open. With the help of Europeana we uploaded parts of our collection to Wikimedia, we are experimenting with EDM as metadata format for sharing information, and we are implementing Linked Open Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found out that Open Data doesn't harm us. It actually helps us promote our collections and organisation. As a member of the Europeana Members Council I want to be an Open Data Advocate and help others to open up their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/RP-T-1980-182_x550.jpg\" style=\"width: 402px; height: 550px;\"><br><em>Design for the cover of the leaflet The future of Europe, Mathieu Lauweriks, <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/search/objecten?q=toekomst&amp;s=objecttype&amp;p=1&amp;ps=12&amp;ii=5#/RP-T-1980-182,4\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nA new digital era</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I am very excited about the future. We are only at the beginning of a new digital era for arts and history. I dream of a future where I will have all information at the tip of my finger. Or even at the tip of my toe. I dream of a time when I can touch, smell or even taste heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few organisations that can help us realise our dreams and for me Europeana is one of them. As a Councillor I am happy to help with, learn about and promote the innovative activities of Europeana and help advance our entire heritage in a new digital world. I love getting to know everyone in Europeana’s Network, and learning about your dreams. Thank you for putting your trust in me.</p>"

        body: "<p>I started working in the library field 20 years ago, in a public library in the city of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. From the very beginning, I was interested in helping people find the information they needed easily. With this goal in mind, I started thinking about how to make library collections more accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007, we started a new project to enhance our local history collections. Local history collections housed in public libraries reflect the community in all its diversity. They also help educate people by encouraging them to actively participate in order to safeguard and promote a community identity. The result of our project was a ‘Local memory and knowledge’ portal. It offers information from trustworthy sources about our town and the Cluj County region. Many of our colleagues from public libraries liked this idea and started creating similar portals for their own collections.</p>\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-08/1438872200_local-history-06.08.jpg\" style=\"width: 773px; height: 631px;\"><br><em>Main page of 'Local memory and knowledge' portal, <a href=\"http://www.bjc.ro/new/\" target=\"_blank\">Cluj County Library</a>, Public Domain</em><p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThis was the starting point of a long-term collaboration between local cultural institutions in Romania. Later that year, our library became an aggregator for Europeana in a great project - Europeana Local. Types of material now available from Romanian cultural institutions through Europeana include items and collections of high cultural value held at local or regional level and specific local collections held by libraries, museums and archives. Our contribution greatly expanded and enriched the freely available and accessible content people can find through Europeana. This was possible because all content providers met the standards and specifications used by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work has continued with the LoCloud project, which helps small and medium size cultural institutions to make their content and metadata available through Europeana, with an easy-to-use cloud-based solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, Romanian cultural institutions have started to see digitization as a very good solution for enhancing their collections.

        body: "<p>Choosing a country’s top 10 artworks is no mean feat. But that’s precisely what we’ve asked every European member state to do, as part of our Europeana 280 competition. Every country chooses 10 paintings that influenced Europe’s art movements - it could be masterpieces we all know and love, or lesser-known treasures that played just as crucial a role. Once all the nominations are in (there's still time to submit them!), we’ll ask the public to vote for their favourites, and we’ll create a special virtual exhibition to help celebrate the launch of the Europeana Art History channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-07/NationaalMuseum.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 412px;\"><br><em>Crayfish parties take place across Sweden throughout August. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048005/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_24219.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kräftfångst</a>, Carl Larsson, National Museum of Sweden. CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do you go about whittling down hundreds of years worth of art to just a small shortlist? We’ve been talking to <strong>Karin Glaseman and Carl-Johan Olsson from the National Museum of Sweden</strong> about how they’re doing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Are you excited to be involved in Europeana 280? What do you like most about the idea of promoting Europe’s well-known masterpieces alongside its hidden treasures?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Karin: We like the idea of works of art becoming accessible independently from a physical visit to a museum. A digital exhibition always provides a lot of curatorial freedom, as we do not have to think about physical conditions of the works. The Europeana 280 initiative asking for works of art that contributed to European art movements also spurs some rethinking of what we consider to be important pieces of art in this context and makes us want to show pieces that the audience might not be expecting. We are very curious about what hidden treasures Europeana 280 will reveal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You’ve decided to hold a workshop with other museums to help create the shortlist of Swedish works, why?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl-Johan: We have some great art collections all over the country and we are trying to ensure that we are not only highlighting one collection. We want to show the whole richness of Sweden’s art collections and we don’t want to limit ourselves by imposing rules such as only one work from each collection. We’d like to achieve a consensus in what pieces we think should be promoted in the Europeana 280 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How will you structure the day? Can you talk a bit about what it might entail, and what discussions you hope it will provoke?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Karin: We will start with a general presentation of the Europeana 280 project, the idea behind it and the effect we hope and think it can have. We have collected some 30 nominations from participating museums that we will present anonymously, without information about their origin or the collection they belong to today. We’ll complete the list with the 10 most-viewed works of Swedish art on Wikipedia. Then we’ll make an initial intuitive choice, and then go through the institutions’ reasoning about why a certain work should be part of the contribution. We hope to conclude the day with a list of artworks that everybody can relate to and we will give the museums that couldn’t come to the workshop a chance to react the following week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that the workshop will help us to see our art history as a common treasure and not as dispatched, closed collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also expecting some discussion around open licensing and will try to prove that the potential benefit of giving these works an open licence will outbalance the potential risks. We hope to conclude the day by giving the world some freely accessible pieces of art!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What aspects of Swedish culture are you most excited to share with the rest of Europe and the world? What do you hope people will learn about Sweden’s art history?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Carl-Johan: We hope to open people’s eyes to the different aspects of our collections. First and foremost, the inherent qualities of the artworks themselves such as aesthetic dimensions and their significance within sociocultural and historical contexts. A desirable result would be for this selection to stimulate and encourage explorations deeper into our digitized collections. The potential is endless, obviously!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>If you have questions about Europeana 280, please contact Marie-Claire Dangerfield by emailing <a href=\"mailto:europeana280@europeana.eu\">europeana280@europeana.eu</a></strong></em></p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Jiří Frank'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hello! My name is Jiří Frank. I’m from a scientific background (specifically palaeontology - cretaceous nautilids), but alongside this scientific work, I also lead the digital asset management and new media department in the <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum in Prague</a>. To understand the museum infrastructure in both a modern and traditional way, it’s good to know a bit about various disciplines, and to combine these sometimes very different points of view. In my case, it was helpful to blend a scientific approach with an understanding of IT, databases, digitization, museum collection curation and the presentation of physical and, of course, digital content. Working in a large museum like the National Museum, and contributing to projects with organisations like Europeana, helps evolve all these different skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2015-08/17.08-hemimorfit-national-museum-mineral-collection-cc-by.jpg\" style=\"text-align: -webkit-center; width: 650px; height: 400px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048014/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_eSb_rky_P1N_83293.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hemimorfit</a>, National Museum Mineral Collection, CC BY</em><br><br>\r\nThe National Museum is a unique memory institution in terms of its structure which is divided into five large units: the Czech Republic’s second largest library, the Natural History museum, the History museum, the Náprstek Museum of Asian, African and American Cultures and the Czech Museum of Music. Every unit is divided into specific departments and smaller museums with their own buildings, exhibitions and collections. With collections including over 25 million objects (and this doesn’t include paleontological and entomological specimen drawers and boxes!), it’s a very special institution covering almost all domains – from natural history to art, video and sound, literature and history. Bringing together botanical specimens, sculptures, oral history, numismatics, maps, music scores and so much more, all under \"one roof\", reflects the amazing treasures of cultural heritage. This richness is actually presented with an even broader scope on the Europeana platform. It’s what makes this platform so unique, giving free access to these treasures to the public, and allowing them to see them in contexts we could never have even imagined before.<br><br>\r\nTo make this happen, it is important to put huge effort into cataloguing content, data and metadata curation and preparation, digitization and presentation. Even when the positive impact for the provider and audience is clear, it can still be complicated to create this access and context in the virtual world. The National Museum faced these challenges, but with Europeana and other similar efforts, we are working hard to open up our collections online with our portal <a href=\"http://www.esbirky.cz/\" target=\"_blank\">eSbírky</a> (www.esbirky.cz) and via Europeana. We hope this inspires other memory institutions in the Czech Republic to choose a similar path with or without our help. I believe the Czech Republic will open up its digitized cultural heritage collections more widely in the future, and this is one of my main aims as a member of Europeana’s Members Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2015-08/17.08-home-page-esb-rky-public-domain-eng.png\" style=\"text-align: -webkit-center; width: 637px; height: 450px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\">Home Page <a href=\"http://www.esbirky.cz\" target=\"_blank\">eSbírky</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The benefits and possibilities of digitizing collections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The trend of digitization has already spread worldwide in just a couple of years. Memory institutions are applying for funding to digitize collections both nationally and internationally. Consortia of memory institutions and technical partners have been built for greater coverage and project funding, for example from the EU. This is followed by the development of standards, protocols, cloud computing, portals with different search engines and IPR discussions. Big portals that aggregate collections are one outcome, and new partners are always needed for future development and the creation of big data hubs.<br><br>\r\nWhat sometimes still remain unclear to memory institutions providing data – particularly those just partially involved in bigger projects – is what benefits there are for them. What possibilities and new connections are made available to them when their content gets published online? It’s important to realise that digitization is not just for archiving, documenting and protecting original physical specimens, but that it creates potential for re-use - not just in research and education, but in ways we can’t even predict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two brilliant case studies that demonstrate this are <a href=\"http://open-up.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\">OpenUp!</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-creative\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative</a>. Providing data online through these projects opened up all sorts of possibilities and Europeana is in a great position to be the entrepreneur, promoter and ambassador to motivate institutions. My mission as your Councillor is to support this, and help increase the visibility of the many benefits and possibilities that are offered, including those opened up by the Europeana platform as a step in the process of digitising collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2015-08/17.08-selling-flowers-national-museum-etnographic-collection-coloured-photography-cc-by.jpg\" style=\"text-align: -webkit-center; width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><a href=\"http://en.esbirky.cz/subject/233843?searchParams=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%22keywords%22%3A%5B%22fish%22%2C%22seller%22%5D%7D%2C%22order%22%3A%22name%22%2C%22itemsPerPage%22%3A28%2C%22path%22%3A%22eJyLrlbKS8xNVbJSCizNTM5WKE5NLErOUChKLS7NKSlW0lHKyczLBsrG6ENkYvQLQepi9KEq7LNTK8vzi1KKbdMyizO0i1NzclKLlGpjAWW%5C%2FIAs%3D%22%7D&amp;sequencePointer=1#googtrans(en)\" target=\"_blank\">Selling Flowers</a>, National Museum, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Natural history collections as important part of cultural heritage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Often, natural history collections are only considered relevant to science, research and education. This is obviously true when you think about sampling specimens and activities like that. But natural history carries a long cultural tradition with it too – how and where specimens were collected and stored, for instance, has great historical and cultural value. It has inspired artists and architects as an encounter with living nature and biodiversity. The techniques used to treat, prepare and arrange collections have unique traditions too, and include collaboration with painters, sculptors and even glassmakers – just think of animals eyes or collections like The Glass Flowers made by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka in the 19th century! Exhibition halls for natural history collections were often adapted and built by famous architects, particularly in European cities like Paris, Prague and London. Natural history collections are great declarations of biodiversity and our shared history, and tell stories about great people like Charles Darwin or Carl Linnaeus.<br><br>\r\nThough definitions of cultural heritage do not explicitly cover natural history collections, I believe this will change in the future - largely because of its inclusion in places like Europeana. I will do my best to help it happen.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>By Lizzy Jongma, Europeana Network Association Members Council</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the summer fades, our thoughts turn to winter, and that can only mean one thing - the Europeana Network Association AGM!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, hunt out your woolly jumpers and get to Amsterdam on 3-4 November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Amusement on the Ice, Hendrick Avercamp, Rijksmuseum, public domain\" src=\"/files/2015-08/amusement.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>Join us at the AGM to experience Amsterdam in winter! <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_3247.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amusement on the Ice</a>, Hendrick Avercamp, Rijksmuseum, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pakhuis De Zwijger and the Rijksmuseum will host this two-day event and this year we will celebrate that ‘We are Europeana!’ What does that mean? It means we have the most open and reusable resource for digital artefacts and the largest cultural heritage digital platform in the world, as well as the biggest community of digital heritage professionals in Europe and an important innovation hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, we’re working on securing fascinating speakers and setting up productive and enjoyable workshops, as well as finalising the details of a very special dinner in a very special location. Night-watch out for more details!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-day event will be packed with talks and activities around four themes: New Governance; Shared Economy; Business Plan 2016; and Technology. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-europeana-network-association-annual-general-meeting-agm-2015-tickets-16427759872\">the agenda</a> as it stands so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why not treat us and your fellow digital heritage professionals to a short and sweet ‘Ignite Talk’? We’re looking for inspiring and varied ideas to make up our Ignite programme. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015#Ignite\">Let us know</a> what you’d talk about by 30 September, and we’ll select 12 to present at the AGM.<br><br>\r\nKnow you want to come? Then get your early bird ticket before 7 October. Early birds cost EUR 50. After that, the cost goes up to EUR 75. So <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-europeana-network-association-annual-general-meeting-agm-2015-tickets-16427759872\">register now</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need somewhere to stay, we’ve put together a list of some of our favourite<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015#hotel\"> hotels in Amsterdam</a>. Alternatively, visit <a href=\"http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/\">i Amsterdam</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana can reimburse your travel and accommodation, but only if you meet our criteria. First of all, you must have become a full member of the new Europeana Network Association. You can <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/sign-up\">sign up here</a> if you haven’t already. Secondly, you must not be attending on behalf of a project or as a DSI partner - this is because travel and accommodation can be reimbursed through the project rather than through Europeana directly. Please ask your project manager if you’re unsure.</p>"

        title: 'Exploring Vienna’s historic Ringstrasse in Field Trip'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>We’re excited to let you know that you can now discover Vienna’s historic Ringstrasse in <a href=\"https://www.fieldtripper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Field Trip</a>, a free app for Android and iOS, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Austrian National Library</a>’s collaboration in Europeana’s pilot project with Niantic Labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ONBGFT1.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 356px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ONBGFT2.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 356px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ONBGFT3.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 356px;\"><br><em>Screenshots of the Austrian National Library in <a href=\"https://www.fieldtripper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Field Trip</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Library and the city celebrates the Ringstrasse’s 150th anniversary, it’s the perfect time to explore this elegant road. Built in place of the defensive walls and moat which once hugged the city, it loops around its centre, dotted with grand buildings and leafy parks and squares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only an important part of Vienna’s cultural history, it’s also perfect for strolling along on a sunny day. With Field Trip, visitors can discover the story of this historic road and its distinctive architecture as they wander.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection on Google’s Field Trip has been carefully curated by the Library and contains historical photographs of the road which are part of a wider exhibition currently being held at the Library, ‘<a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/ausstellungen/wienwirdweltstadt/\" target=\"_blank\">Wien wird Weltstadt - Vienna Becomes a Metropole’</a>. In the exhibition, which runs until November 1 2015, you can see these photos alongside graphic art, plans, caricatures and newspapers from the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By highlighting some of the famous buildings you will pass on your walk, it introduces you to their historic significance or hidden past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example is the fascinating Palais Ephrussi, built in 1872/73 by Theophil Hansen for the Ephrussis, a family of wealthy financiers. Having been a home for the family for decades, in 1938, they were forced to flee from it to escape the National Socialist regime. Only later, in 1950, did the family have their inheritance restored to them. Most of their wealth had been stolen except for a collection of 264 miniature Japanese sculptures, or netsuke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These netsuke were saved by one of the family’s maids who hid the precious sculptures in her mattress and returned them to their owners after the end of the war. Her loyalty has since been honoured by the family’s descendent Edmund de Waal, who wrote about it in his bestselling novel <em>The Hare with Amber Eyes</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From pilot to project</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Austrian National Library’s publication on Field Trip is an important milestone showing how the pilot with Niantic Labs has grown into an ongoing project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Available in over 30 languages, and free to those who download it as an app for Android and iOS, Field Trip uses Google’s geolocation technology to enrich travellers’ adventures, inviting them to discover local history, fun facts about art and the architecture around them and much more. Europeana’s pilot project with the app, which you can <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/reach-cultural-tourists-through-europeana-in-googles-field-trip\" target=\"_blank\">read about here</a>, shows the huge potential for cultural institutions to secure a meaningful presence in the growing digital tourism industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ONBGFT5.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 509px;\"><br>\r\nA screenshot of the Austrian National Library's content in Field Trip</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also fits in with the Austrian National Library’s wider work promoting the re-use of cultural content in different environments, and happily follows up on the Europeana Creative conference, <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative Culture Jam</a>, which they are held at the Library. The conference provided a forum for cultural innovators to come together and share ideas and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susanne Tremml, from the Austrian National Library’s Research &amp; Development team, worked with Europeana on both these projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Through Europeana Creative, the Austrian National Library opened up access to a huge collection of high resolution public domain images, from historic portraits to World War One press photography and posters, book illustrations and historic views of cities, villages and landscapes. This is part of the Library’s strategy to enable and explore re-use of their public domain collections. Through the project with Europeana and Niantic Labs we were able to build on this mission, opening up these collections in an innovative new way through the Field Trip app.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re interested in finding out more about Europeana’s project with Niantic Labs, and how you and your institution could get involved, email <a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu\">Milena Popova</a>.</p>"

        title: 'How Europeana can help to make Europe a better place'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is a guest blog by Peter Soemers, Europeana Network Association member and <a href=\"http://openglam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenGLAM</a> advocate. Here, he introduces why Europeana, and the culture heritage community it is a part of, have a crucial role to play in the refugee crisis in Europe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/Instagram-bloggerfuerfluchtlinge.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 600px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this occasion, you’re reading a blog post without historical images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though a search for ‘refugee’ in Europeana currently returns 25, 860 hits (10, 054 of them images), actual images of refugees making the life-threatening trip to Europe, and then embarking on the inhumane journey that greets them when they get here, are what consume our interest here. Chris Wild, also known as ‘The Retronaut’, emphasised the power of pictures <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreativeculturejam.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cultjam15_20150710_1600_Wild.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">in his recent talk at the Europeana Creative Culture Jam in Vienna</a>. This was confirmed by the recent photograph of the drowned young boy, Aylan Kurdi. As Dutch newspaper <em>The Volkskrant</em> wrote in their caption beneath it, “this picture has to change Europe” (2 September).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images accompanied by words are powerful. All over the world, people are standing up, donating goods and money, wholly dissatisfied with the ‘Europe of politicians’, and demonstrating that there is – still – a Europe of common people who will not tolerate humans being treated in this way. Germany seems to be the country in Europe with the biggest draw for refugees, so I focus on one initiative from there. A group of German bloggers started ‘<a href=\"http://www.blogger-fuer-fluechtlinge.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Bloggers for Refugees</a>’ (English site in preparation), and it is the logo of the campaign that should be the dominant picture of my post. The word ‘Europe’ is cited in their blogs numerous times over. These bloggers do not want the Europe shown in the photographs of refugees and they are making it known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, initiatives like these deserve attention on Europeana’s blog too. Why? Because Europeana is not merely a technical institution aggregating data and metadata, and offering historical materials on the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is about serving people and uniting them, about representing Europe in the world, and representing nations, and the humans that live in them, within Europe. Connecting with our common history can help create insight into who we are and what we should do in times like these. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sjBvJNRFTlM\" target=\"_blank\">Watch this video</a> by one of the inspirational figures in the Europeana family, Nicholas Poole, and hear Europeana’s great goal, as well as our moral obligation to help assemble a better world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re a blogger, or contribute to one, you can add your voice to this collective demand for a better Europe. Lots of bloggers from the cultural heritage sector are already taking part. Check out <strong>#BloggersForRefugees</strong> and <strong>#BloggerFuerFluechtlinge</strong> and join us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Soemers (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PSoemers\" target=\"_blank\">@PSoemers</a>, The Hague - with thanks to German blogger Michelle van der Veen, Münster - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ma_veen\" target=\"_blank\">@ma_veen</a>)</p>"

        title: 'Introduction to the Europeana Access and Re-use Framework'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This contribution has been written by Maarten Zeinstra from our partner, Kennisland. Kennisland is a frequent contributor to the legal frameworks of Europeana projects and part of WP5 of Europeana Cloud.</em><br><br>\r\nAs Europeana Cloud nears its final stages, it’s a good time to discuss how members of Europeana Cloud and the general public can get access to material stored in this shared infrastructure of cultural heritage.<br><br>\r\nEuropeana Cloud can store data in all kinds of formats. Theoretically, you could store raw data, images, texts files, xml files, binary files, etc. Some of these files in your collection are not meant to be shared with people outside your institution. Europeana Cloud understands the heterogeneity of the stored data and provides a tailor-made approach for managing this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>You have control over who can access your data</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, you, as the cultural institution, has control over who can access your data. No other member of Europeana Cloud will have access to the data in the system unless you provide them with explicit permission. Even then, we offer a range of permissions that you can provide to other members of Europeana Cloud. For instance, you can give them permission to read your data, update it and/or remove it. We believe this is the level of granularity that the users of Europeana Cloud need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/rijksgateway.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 615px;\"><br><em>Carisbrooke Castle; the Gateway, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_F_F25412_X.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making data publicly available</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, for projects or for Europeana.eu, you’ll need to expose data in Europeana Cloud to the public. This is also necessary if you want to use Europeana Cloud for your own sites and projects. This means everyone with a URL to your data can view it. Members of Europeana Cloud can choose which data is exposed to the general public. We do not allow people who are not logged in to Europeana Cloud to make changes to the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Access permissions and re-use permissions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Access permissions like being able to read, write, update or delete data in Europeana Cloud is only one side of the coin. Next to these access permissions, the system also supports the storing and communication of re-use permissions. The legal status and the re-use permissions are communicated by the Cloud Re-use Statements. These specify whether rights are reserved, the data is in the public domain, if the work is licensed or if the work is orphaned. Europeana Cloud initially uses the statements that Europeana Licensing Frameworks provides.1<br><br>\r\nAccess permissions and sharing permissions are applied independently to one another. It is not mandatory to share material that has fallen in the public domain or share openly licensed data, although we do encourage it. You can allow other members to update data where rights are reserved, as long as you have permission of the rightsholder to do so. The re-use permissions communicate to users what they can do outside the scope of Europeana Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Limits of sharing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you share data outside of your organisation and you do communicate that the data is in the public domain or openly licensed we do impose some restrictions to protect the people who use your data with these permissions. We do not allow changing of re-use statements to less permissive statements unless they are in accordance with our take-down policy (forthcoming).<br><br>\r\nThis is due to the nature of the public domain and Creative Commons-license. Creative Commons-licenses are not retractable. You cannot decide that you give permission to re-use data under the sole condition that the re-user mentions the name of the creator and the license (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY</a>) and later decide you want to change this to a license that does not allow for commercial reuse (<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC</a>). Once data has been licensed under one of these licenses, the license remains valid for the duration of the underlying intellectual property. You can, however, always provide the data under a more permissive license / statement.<br><br>\r\nWe are currently implementing the Europeana Access and Re-use Framework. Please contact Maarten Zeinstra (<a href=\"mailto:mailto:mz@kl.nl\">mz@kl.nl</a>) if you have any questions. Please also read our deliverable on this subject <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D5.3%20Europeana%20Cloud%20Access%20and%20Reuse%20Framework.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

        title: 'Empowering innovation: Open Living Labs Days 2015'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em><a href=\"http://www.enoll.org\" target=\"_blank\">ENoLL</a>, the European Network of Living Labs, is an international federation of over 350 innovation labs from all over the world. As a part of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-creative\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Creative project</a>, ENoLL successfully devised innovation challenges on the themes of Natural History Education, History Education, Social Networks, Tourism and Design. They also coordinated Culture Jam pre-events in their member labs in Barcelona, Helsinki, Bristol and Krakow. The European Network of Living Labs is a strategic partner of Europeana and plays a crucial role in our growing collaboration with the creative industries. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of August, I attended ENoLL’s annual summit, <a href=\"http://openlivinglabdays.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Living Labs Days</a>, and spent four days (25-28 August) being inspired by all sorts of new ideas as well as discovering exciting partnership opportunities for Europeana. And all in the beautiful surroundings of cosmopolitan Istanbul!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living Labs are real life hubs for invention and experimentation. They bring together users and producers to try out ideas and test designs. Open Living Labs Days included workshops, interactive sessions, lively discussion panels as well as off-site visits designed to give people greater insight into the models, theories and technologies relevant to this innovative world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ENOLL_all.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>Open Living Labs Days 2015. Image: <a href=\"http://on.fb.me/1XFG973\" target=\"_blank\">ENoLL</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also gave people taking part the opportunity to gain hands on experience, and work with leading experts, as well as network with other members of the Living Labs community. It built a valuable sense of collaboration and community which will last long after the end of the conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Living Labs and the creative community</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The creative industries were one of the conference’s key themes, together with Smart Cities and Urban Development, Open Communities and Health &amp; Wellbeing. In the creative industries track on the second day, the participants got a teaser introduction to Europeana and Europeana Labs as a special platform for creative professionals. This prepares for the new and improved Europeana Labs - keep an eye out, it’s coming soon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, those interested in culture and the creative industries could return to find out more about how Living Labs and their creative audiences can benefit from Europeana and Europeana Labs in a workshop titled “Labs, Culture &amp; Creatives: happily ever after”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ENOLL_workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 900px;\"><br><em>Presenting Europeana Labs at a workshop. Image: </em><a href=\"http://on.fb.me/1g6YuIg%E2%80%8B\" target=\"_blank\">ENOLL Flickr</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Befitting the nature of the conference, the session brought together a diverse and international crowd: representatives from Living Labs in Spain, Tunisia, Mauritius and Brazil, a representative of the UK innovation agency Nesta, an urban development specialist from the Netherlands, and creative professionals from Turkey were among those who took part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/milensy/labs-culture-creatives-happily-ever-after\" target=\"_blank\">presentation on Europeana Labs</a>’ audiences, services and partnerships and then followed with a case study by Lorna Stokes from ENoLL on the re-use of digital cultural content by creatives and Living Labs in the context of the Europeana Creative project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterwards, we got together in groups to discuss the potential areas for collaboration between Europeana and Living Labs; in particular, how Europeana Labs can help Living Labs in serving their creative audiences and how Europeana can support future growth of the Living Labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants shared insights based on their own work with cultural heritage and creatives and bounced ideas around for possible new developments for Europeana Labs and potential joint projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These four days with the international Living Labs community were intense, full of inspiration, and, moreover, lots of fun. I came home buoyed by positive feedback about Europeana and Europeana Labs, and armed with a greater understanding of the Living Labs world. Even better, it’s given me all sorts of ideas for collaboration I can’t wait to get started on. I’m looking forward to the Open Living Labs Days 2016 in Canada!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p><em>This blog is written by Rolf Källman, head of Digisam and Europeana Members Councillor.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, Europeana’s Network has been evolving. As you might have seen in previous blogs and newsletters, it’s now an Association, a democratisation which means its members can elect the people that speak and make decisions on their behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">elected representatives make up the Members Council</a>, currently a group of 25 who sit at the heart of everything Europeana does. I’m lucky enough to be one of these 25, and I sit on the six-strong management board of the Members Council too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I’m excited to kickstart the 2015 elections! From now until October 7, we invite Network Association members to put themselves forward to join us and run for one of at least six new seats being added to the Council. We are aiming to grow the Council to comprise 50 seats by 2020. Each seat lasts for two years, after which you can run for re-election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/IwantYou.jpg\" style=\"width: 473px; height: 550px;\"><br><em>I want you for the navy... Howard Chandler Christy, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200364/BibliographicResource_3000098464627.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Portugal</a>, public domain. </em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So why should you run?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms, this might mean helping create the annual Business Plan, or representing the interests of the Network Association, and your wider professional network, in decision making. We also lead Task Forces on all sorts of different issues we feel are worthwhile. We very much hope that our work will lead to an increased dialogue between and with members. A first step towards this is the monthly Network newsletter where each of us has opportunity to speak directly to members. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do I know if I’m eligible? </h2>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and sectors relevant to Europeana so long as you’re a member of the Network Association.\r\n<p>If you’re not a registered member, there’s still time to sign up in order to run in this year’s round of elections. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/sign-up\" target=\"_blank\">You have until October 2, so don’t waste any time</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, we need you to send us a candidate profile, please do this by <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Z5HL55P\">filling in this form</a> by no later than <strong>October 7</strong>. This introduces why you’re running, what you stand for and want to work towards and why people should vote for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 7 October, campaigning will begin. We’ll invite each of the candidates to promote themselves and the issues that matter to them, and you can follow this using the hashtag #EuropeanaElects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voting will then begin on <strong>3 November </strong>during the Europeana AGM. You’ll have a week from then to vote for up to three candidates. Voting is, of course, entirely anonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ll keep guiding you through the elections right up until we announce results in the middle of November. Stay tuned for more updates, and <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a> if you have any questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do hope that you want to join us and our work. We look forward to your candidate profiles!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>This week, the<a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info\" target=\"_blank\"> International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries</a> (TPDL) takes place in Poznan, Poland. TPDL - once known as the European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL) - has been a major event in the diaries of the R&amp;D community in our field for 15 years now. Over the years, there’s been numerous presentations on the progress of Europeana projects, or the technological innovations that would go on to make Europeana what it is today. Take the Europeana Data Model, for instance - that’s a great example of something we’ve created that owes much to the discussions that have happened at this conference, and to the researchers - like Stefan Gradman and Carlo Meghini - who have helped develop its previous programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/TPDL_logo_K_.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 533px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info\" target=\"_blank\">TPDL 2015</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year’s edition is no exception. It’s been organised by Marcin Werla and Cezary Mazurek from the <a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center</a> - leading players in the development of the next generation of Europeana’s infrastructure in Europeana Cloud, and close collaborators with Europeana’s technology team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This afternoon, our very own Valentine Charles will give a <a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info/tutorials-list/tutorial-mappings-application-profiles-extensions-cross-domain-metadata-europeana-context-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial on mappings and application profiles for cross-domain metadata</a> with Francesca Schulze, from the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\" target=\"_blank\">German Digital Library</a>. On Thursday, former host of the Europeana Plenary conference Costis Dallas will give a keynote on the future of digital repositories. <a href=\"http://locloud.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">LoCloud</a>, one of the many Europeana-related projects both Costis and Marcin have been part of, will hold a <a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info/workshops-list/workshop-cloud-based-services-digital-libraries/\" target=\"_blank\">workshop on cloud based services for digital libraries</a>, also happening on Thursday. And last but not least, our partners from the <a href=\"https://sealincmedia.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SEALINCMedia project</a> (Free University Amsterdam and CWI) will give no fewer than three papers about linked data and cultural heritage. So there’s plenty to get excited about!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been helping make noise about the conference and inviting the R&amp;D and digital libraries community to get involved. Today, as the conference kicks off, there are two ways to make the most of the it if you can’t be in Poznan. First, keep an eye on the hashtag #tpdl2015 - it’s sure to be the beating heart of the conference, with plenty of stimulating discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And if that’s not enough, this year you can also check out the conference via a live stream! The streaming will start on Tuesday at 9 AM CET <a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info/live-streaming/.\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Recorded videos will be available at a later date.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So go on - check out the <a href=\"http://tpdl2015.info/program/detailed-conference-agenda/\" target=\"_blank\">programme</a> and find the parts that interest you... Then sit back, tune in and enjoy!<br><br><em>NB: To find out more about the conference, please <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/tpdl-2015\" target=\"_blank\">see our Events page</a>. </em></p>"

        title: 'Money, power and an elephant: DISH2015'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>On 7-8 December, Rotterdam will play host to the international conference <a href=\"http://www.dish2015.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">DISH2015 (Digital Strategies for Heritage)</a>. This year’s theme is ‘Money and Power’, with the intriguing subtitle, ‘We should talk about the elephant in the room’. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>To find out more, we spoke to conference organiser <strong>Marco de Niet from Digital Heritage Netherlands (DEN)</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about the conference you’re organising, DISH… What’s it all about? How is Europeana involved? How about DEN? And what's your role?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of DISH go back to 2004, when DEN organised the first Digital Heritage Conference in the Netherlands. This was a conference in Dutch for Dutch heritage professionals. After five successful conferences in a row, we teamed up with another organisation in the Netherlands in 2009 to organise an international conference on digital strategies across the entire heritage sector. There were already quite a few other good international conferences, but most of them were aimed at a specific domain (e.g. MuseumNext) or at innovation and research practices. We wanted to address the impact of the digital shift on memory organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first DISH was a smashing success with, to our amazement, over 600 participants. Obviously, we had struck the right chord. So we decided, from then on, to alternate national conferences with international conferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana was a member of the DISH Advisory Board from the beginning, and if I remember correctly, it was Jill Cousins herself who came up with the name Digital Strategies for Heritage and its acronym DISH. After our partner institution was forced to close its doors in 2012, it felt natural to invite Europeana to become the new co-organiser, together with The New Institute for Architecture, Design and E-Culture, which was based in Rotterdam, the city where DISH traditionally takes place. And fortunately, they both accepted this invitation. So here we are in 2015, with the fourth edition of DISH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/DISH2013_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>High spirits at DISH2013. Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dish2011/11291349166/\" target=\"_blank\">DEN</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is DISH designed for? What is your target group?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary target group are the heritage professionals that take decisions on the nature of and investments in digital activities. Instead of discussing the 'how', we wanted the conference participants to address the 'why'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009 we already knew that it didn't suffice to just digitise your collections to create value for your user groups. Social media had taken the world by storm, and the information landscape was changing rapidly. With the conference, we wanted the cultural heritage institutions to look beyond the process of digitisation and support them to find new answers to new questions about their role in the information society and the digital relationships with their users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides heritage professionals, we also try to make the conference attractive for policy-makers at governments and funds, and representatives from adjacent domains, such as education, science and the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one thing I am really proud of with DISH, it is this fact that we have succeeded in facilitating the exchange of knowledge and ideas at the strategic level across the entire heritage domain and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/DISH2013_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>Exchanging knowledge and ideas at DISH2013. Image: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/dish2011/11337083656/\" target=\"_blank\">DEN</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This year’s theme is 'Money and Power'. What was the inspiration behind this theme? How does it tie into the conference’s broader interest in memory institutions and their digital strategies?</strong><br><br>\r\nThe inspiration for the title came from two sources. In the past few years, I noticed that the self awareness and self confidence of memory institutions, and especially of archives, was on the up again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the global information infrastructures are getting privatised at an incredible speed, the memory institutions, who are the keepers of our cultural, scientific and social legacies, were making more and more prominent statements about their unique public role in it, by addressing issues like open data, safeguarding authenticity, long term preservation and the cultural commons. However, it is no secret that our lobby with the national and European governments is not always highly organised and effective. So we thought it would be a good idea to address the empowerment of the heritage sector at the next DISH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point in time, I was reading Robert Darnton's <em>The Case for Books</em>. There is a memorable anecdote in the book about a female colleague of his (when he was the librarian at Harvard University) who, because of her somewhat stereotypical appearance as a librarian, often was often asked condescending questions about what it’s like to be a librarian.<br>\r\nAnd her answer: it's all about money and power!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So there you have it: digital strategies for heritage are not just about improving access to digital collections for our user groups, they are also about safeguarding specific characteristics of our information society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It sounds like you really want to shake people up at DISH and make them challenge certain ideas. Do you want people to go away thinking, or shouting? </strong><br><br>\r\nA bit of both. Heritage professionals are not the kind of people to shout out loud about what they are doing, but I have serious concerns about the way we can fulfil our future roles if we don't become better advocates of what we are all about and what our work truly represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully some speakers or sessions will help them to reflect some more on questions that are at the heart of our profession in the digital age. And again hopefully this reflection will then resonate in a way that will help reinforce their cases with their governments and other funders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, what is the elephant in the room that you want to address? </strong><br><br>\r\nThat the outside world may not be as convinced as we are about our future roles in the information society, and that we need to be willing to address issues of money and power to make our case!<br><br><strong>Once the delegates are converted to an army of renegades, how do you hope they will take that momentum back to their day jobs? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DISH can only provide a 2-day platform for dialogue, discussion and inspiration. The true source of money and power for memory institutions lies in the municipalities, the regions, the countries, the European Union and other contexts in which they operate day by day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully,after DISH2015, the participants will feel motivated to actively seek public support for the work they are doing and to capitalize on their unique role in the information society, which is to connect, in an open and trustworthy way, the past - in the present - with the future. Without that role, which sets us apart from the Googles, the Facebooks and the Amazons, life will become one-dimensional. We will all be treated as information consumers in the here and the now instead of cultural citizens with a historic conscience and a responsibility for future generations.<br><br><strong><em>Registration for the conference is open - get your tickets <a href=\"http://www.dish2015.nl/register/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. </em></strong></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>We believe that the digital cultural heritage available via Europeana can make Europe an even better place to live, learn, work or visit. That’s why, under the recent Presidencies of the Council of the European Union, we worked with experts, member state and EU policy-makers to forge a path and create Recommendations for the use of our digital cultural heritage in four sectors - research, education and learning, tourism and the creative industries.<br><br>\r\nBy making it easier for people to find and share our shared European culture, we can help researchers uncover more. We can inspire learners everywhere to think more. We can encourage tourists to explore and discover more. We can help creative professionals to develop ever more sophisticated and enticing products and services.<br><br>\r\nA new White Paper outlines how policy-makers can continue this mission, using their knowledge, experience and influence to support and find funding for the cultural institutions to begin or to continue in their digitization, aggregation and enrichment efforts, and to raise awareness on the importance of improving the openness of this material for its proper use in these sectors with new technologies.<br><br>\r\nRead the full recommendations in this new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/tranforming-the-world-with-culture\">White Paper</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/ComputerWoman.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 640px;\"><br><em>22.0 IBM Diverse maskiner, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022608/TELE_TELE_IBM_2012_58019.html\">Telemuseet</a> CC BY-SA</em><br><br><strong>Why now?</strong><br><br>\r\nHaving completed the series of Presidencies meetings, it is both important and useful to bring together the themes that occurred time and again, and in particular to emphasize the main point made across all discussions that improving data quality is key to ensuring wider re-use of our digital cultural heritage.<br><br>\r\nThe publication of this paper comes at an important and exciting moment for Europe’s cultural sector. The European Parliament has recently <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A8-2015-0207&amp;language=EN\" target=\"_blank\">adopted a report</a> recognizing the importance of the cultural heritage sector as a strategic resource for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and recommending a dedicated European Cultural Heritage Year.<br><br>\r\nWhat’s more, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en\" target=\"_blank\">Horizon 2020</a>, an EU research and innovation programme, has <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/news/eu-increase-funding-cultural-heritage-research-and-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated 100m euros to research related to cultural heritage</a>. At the same time, both the European Parliament and the European Commission have announced their intentions to encourage the use of digital tools in education and tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the recommendations?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the discussions held with experts from research, education, tourism and the creative industries, there was broad agreement that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>More of the cultural heritage held in Europe’s museums, galleries and archives needs to be digitized, especially 20th and 21st century material.</li>\r\n    <li>More cultural heritage institutions should be encouraged to open up their digital collections, for re-use.</li>\r\n    <li>Quality should be seen as a priority when digitising cultural heritage objects - creating high-quality reproductions with detailed and descriptive accompanying metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>High-quality, rights-cleared cultural heritage content should be easy to access and easy to use.</li>\r\n    <li>Awareness of the existence and benefits of the cultural collections available via Europeana should be raised within the target sectors.</li>\r\n    <li>Strong ties between Europeana and the target sectors, and cultural heritage institutions and the target sectors, need to be developed and nurtured.</li>\r\n    <li>Case studies demonstrating the benefit of using high-quality rights-cleared digital cultural heritage content should be used to encourage participation by cultural heritage institutions and organisations within the target sector.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>All parties also agreed that there are two major challenges that need to be addressed, and with which we need support at the highest levels:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The digital cultural heritage made available to these sectors needs to be high-quality with good descriptive metadata and appropriate licences to allow it to be re-used.</li>\r\n    <li>More funding is needed to digitize and maintain Europe’s cultural collections to ensure that they can be re-used for many years to come and that the digital cultural heritage ecosystem is sustained long-term.</li>\r\n    <li>Read the full <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/tranforming-the-world-with-culture\">White Paper</a> for more about our recommendations, what Europeana and its Network Association are already doing to progress them, and the support we’re asking for.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We need your support to help us achieve these goals. Please read, share and act upon the recommendations in this report and help us to get Europe’s rich cultural heritage out of its boxes, cases and buildings, and into the digital world where it can be used on a large scale to make living and learning in Europe even better. Together, we can transform the world with the culture.</p>"

In this session, we’ll look more closely at what this means for our Network Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana towards 2020</strong><br />\r\nHere, we’ll dust off our crystal ball and take a look into the future. We’ll discuss Europeana’s next annual business plan for 2016 and ask for your approval, and look even further ahead, to 2020 - the year Europeana’s five year strategy reaches completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The innovations behind Europeana </strong><br />\r\nThis wide-ranging session will take you through the innovative technological ecosystem of Europeana, from the Cloud to the Channels we’ll be launching in the new year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking forward to reading your <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015#Ignite\" target=\"_blank\">Ignite proposals</a> - stay tuned for more on the 2015 AGM in October! #AllezCulture!</p>"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Aranzazu Lafuente Urién'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi, my name is Aranzazu Lafuente Urién. My friends call me Arantxa. I'm Spanish and I’m an archivist, that’s a great combination! I studied Medieval History at university and for the last 20 years, I’ve worked as a civil servant in the Spanish National Archives Administration. I specialize in family and personal archives and spend a lot of time working on describing archives. I also enjoy working with standards and technology developments related to archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/mapspain.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Spain &amp; Portugal, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022701/lod_oai_www_bibliotecavirtualmadrid_org_2491_ent1_.html\" target=\"_blank\">Biblioteca Digital de Madrid</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n18 years ago, I had the great honour of launching a new institution, the National Nobility Archive, and the good fortune to be its first director. This institution is one of the seven National Archives of Spain. It’s a public archive based in Toledo, holding documents of private origin and great antiquity.<br />\r\nIn 2012, I moved to Madrid to work on the APEx project (Archives Portal Europe network of excellence) at the Spanish Portal or Archives (PARES) in the Vice Directorate of State Archives at the Ministry of Education and Culture. I work on the part of the project focused on standards and guidelines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday, I am also part of the technical team at PARES, a small but great team working hard to make PARES more interoperable and more responsive using IT developments and new technologies and tools. I lead work on controlled vocabularies and thesauri, standards, ontologies and authority control developments, improvements and other related tasks. Our mission is to provide our archival content to the Archives Portal Europe, thus contributing to the distribution of Europe’s archival heritage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What do I expect from Europeana? How and what can I contribute to Europeana?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archives are the cultural institutions that preserve unique and unpublished material describing the history of things like people, places or institutions. The history contained in each of our documents is also an important part of the history of Europe and Europeans. However, archives currently have less visibility than our fellow museums and libraries. Integrating our archives and sharing data with Europeana will help to make our archives more visible. To achieve this objective, I firmly believe that we must, first of all, provide good quality descriptions and images for the documents kept in our archives, using all the tools or enhancements that make them more interoperable. I believe that our commitment to controlled vocabularies and ontologies, in a multilingual world, is one of the best ways to go. I also believe we should try to move towards giving archival descriptions proper context, applying one of the principles of the archives - the principle of provenance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArchival theory and practice have always recognized the importance of maintaining the context in which documents were produced. The ISAAR-CPF and EAC-CPF are standards sharing a primary aim of formalizing the name of the creator as the primary key for international exchange. This is part of what we call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority_control\" target=\"_blank\">authority control</a>. Today, we see authority control in archives beginning to mature. In future, we will probably see archivists able to share their authority files. Why not share them with Europeana too?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is our job to look after the history of Europe. That’s why, along with my Members Council colleagues, I would like to try to help Europeana to share documents and archival fonds in context, sharing archival descriptions, good quality images and the information contained therein. That’s why I participate in Europeana and urge all colleagues to work together, integrated in the network of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Over the past fifteen months, representatives from the Europeana and DPLA networks, in partnership with Creative Commons, have been developing a collaborative approach to internationally interoperable rights statements that can be used to communicate the copyright status of cultural objects published via the DPLA and Europeana platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of these rights statements is to provide end users of our platforms with easy to understand information on what they can and cannot do with digital items that they encounter via these platforms. Having standardized interoperable rights statements will also make it easier for application developers and other third parties to automatically identify items that can be re-used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also anticipate that these statements will be used by other cultural heritage aggregators across the globe, and see these statements as the initial effort towards international interoperability around standardized rights statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May of this year, we released two draft white papers on the recommendations for standardized international rights statements, one on the rights statements and one on the technical framework to support the statements. Both white papers received a tremendous amount of community response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After considering the community feedback and making significant edits to both white papers and the list of statements, we are pleased to share with you today the final versions that describe our recommendations for establishing a group of rights statements, and the enabling technical infrastructure. These recommendations include a list of shared rights statements that both the DPLA and Europeana can use depending on the needs of our respective organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-09/contract_marriageCCBY_600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 484px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The workings and signing of a marriage contract, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006133618.html\">Wellcome Library</a> CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recommendations for standardized international rights statements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This paper describes the need for a common standardized approach. Based on the experience of both of our organizations and community feedback, we have described the principles we think any international approach to providing standardized rights statements needs to meet. Together we propose a list of ten new rights statements that can be used in situations where the licenses and legal tools offered by Creative Commons cannot be applied. The statements whitepaper and recommended list of statements can be found <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/files/151002recommendations_for_standardized_international_rights_statements.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Requirements for the rights statements.org technical infrastructure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to ensure that the new rights statements can be used by institutions around the world, we are planning to host the new rights statements in their own namespace: rightsstatements.org. The whitepaper describing the technical framework can be found <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/files/151002requirements_for_the_technical_infrastructure_for_standardized_international_rights_statements.pdf\">here</a>. We have recently issued an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/help-the-international-rights-statement-working-group-develop-rightsstatements-org\">RFP</a> to assist us in building the technical infrastructure and anticipate launching the rightsstatements.org website in early 2016.</p>"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>As outlined <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/europeana-cloud/europeana-cloud-blog/changing-directions-for-europeana-cloud\">elsewhere in this blog</a>, Europeana Cloud is a technical infrastructure that offers storage and services to aggregators (and eventually data providers) within the Europeana ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that Europeana Cloud is conceived as for the common good of the cultural heritage sector, it is essential that a sound business plan and transparent governance model are in place. Within the project, a Governance Task Force, involving some 10 project partners, is examining design principles, legal structures and the administrative options of the business organisation for managing these ‘Europeana Cloud Services’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Observing the principles of the Commons created by the Network and adopted by Europeana in its values, the Task Force feels the new cloud infrastructure should derive its success (and therefore its sustainability) from its full commitment to the cultural heritage sector. To provide a distinction from large commercial services such as Amazon and Google, the outcomes of Europeana Cloud must be specifically designed for the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, the governance model of the corporation operating the new cloud services must allow for the active involvement of cultural heritage institutions across Europe, in particular organisations operating in the field of aggregating and providing cultural heritage data. Also, the new cloud services must be truly embedded in the Europeana ecosystem, linking the outcomes of related projects such as LoCloud and reinforcing other activities of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force is currently debating whether the corporation managing the new cloud services should be an independent legal entity, or a business unit within the Europeana Foundation. It is considering the pros and cons of various legal structures (e.g. association, foundation, cooperative and private limited company). Transparency is an essential design principle, since open procedures and clarity about rules, regulations and decisions are key to the public cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of November 2015, the Task Force will present recommendations for an effective governance model which will serve the needs as well as the nature of the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

It’s a testament to the broad range of expertise in our Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/2015-10-08-meet-the-candidates.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 453px;\" />\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000051900276.html\">[Charley] Paddock gagnant [la] finale [du] 100 m [des Jeux olympiques d'Anvers le 16/8/20] : [photographie de presse] / [Agence Rol]​</a><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055655874.html\" target=\"_blank\">,</a> National Library of France, public domain</em></p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>So, without further ado, the candidates looking to represent you are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/network-association-members/vladimir-alexiev\">Vladimir Alexiev -

        body: "<p>For a while now, we’ve been exploring the different ways we can unlock Europe’s cultural heritage for education and learning. Today, we’re delighted to announce the launch of our first <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/world-war-i-battle-perspectives/id1044759339\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Touch Book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048044178\" target=\"_blank\">related iTunes U course</a>, <em>World War I: A battle of perspectives</em>, introducing students and learners to the causes leading to the outbreak of the First World War. They are available in both Dutch and English on iTunes.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/multitouchbook-cover-en.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 589px;\"><p>The project, which was developed together with <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">EUROCLIO</a> and Gwen Vergouwen, an Apple Distinguished Educator (ADE) and Belgian history teacher, is an important step forward in our goal to use digital collections to bring history to life for students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was developed through Apple’s ADEs in Residence programme which places selected ADEs in some of the world’s leading museums, archives, science centers, and cultural organizations to develop innovative teaching and learning resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book and accompanying course, available from today on iTunes, allow students to explore a diverse range of different historical sources from <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> alongside learning resources from EUROCLIO. From letters exchanged between a German soldier and a British girl, to the ID card of a prisoner of war, the build up to the conflict is shown from a number of different perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using these unique historical materials, students are encouraged through a variety of interactive assignments to develop their own understanding of what lead to war in 1914. The idea, as Gwen Vergouwen suggests, is to harness the Multi-Touch technology to help students analyse and interpret sources, and hone their “historical thinking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/book-en-screenshot-3.png\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 413px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/book-en-screenshot-5.png\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 413px;\"><em>Examples of some of the interactive assignments </em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project with Gwen, EUROCLIO and technology leader Apple would not have been possible without the valuable collections in Europeana 1914-1918 contributed by heritage institutions and members of the public across Europe. Along with projects like <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Historiana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">Inventing Europe</a>, it shows the exciting possibilities for cultural collections in the classroom opened up by the digital revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re interested in more details about this project, or how you can participate in future ADE projects, please feel free to <a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>.<br>\r\nYou can also <a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu\">subscribe</a> to the dedicated educational session at the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network AGM</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Download the English <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/world-war-i-battle-perspectives/id1044759339\" target=\"_blank\">Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048044178\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U course</a><br>\r\nDownload the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/bronnen-en-interpretaties/id1045125525\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/id1048134711\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U course</a></strong></p>"

        title: 'Changing Directions for Europeana Cloud'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The Europeana Cloud project has been through a lot of changes since it commenced two and half years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first it was conceived as a shared storage infrastructure for three aggregators in the project, and especially Europeana itself. Europeana Cloud was to be a trusted place to store and back up data and content aggregated from Europeana cultural heritage providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/PathTwines.jpg\" style=\"width: 601px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>In the Trosachs, \"where twines the path\", <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_F_F01048_B.html\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the long-term aim of Europeana Cloud was not just to create something for the aggregators in the project but also to build a sustainable service that could help as many of the aggregators in the Europeana ecosystem as a whole, with a particular focus on improving metadata quality, one of the primary objectives in the Europeana strategic plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the project evolved, it became apparent that a single shared storage for Europeana cultural metadata and content was a great idea (and necessary for Europeana itself), but the national, thematic and domain aggregators charged with harvesting cultural data from across Europe had pressing need for more specifically tailored services that helped with their workflow (in addition to the storage component).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FEf6rzohE7ozPlNFYdd6yi8MUrvAAbM7abKEEaHDHv0/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\">Investigation undertaken last year</a> by the project indicated some of the key challenges for aggregators:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Tools for ingestion and mapping are not as reliable as they could be.</li>\r\n    <li>Ingestion and mapping tools have poor usability, and sometimes cannot be used without technical expertise.</li>\r\n    <li>Many see possibilities for enrichment, but do not have the tools for it.</li>\r\n    <li>Dealing with content, as opposed to metadata, is a growing challenge.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Bearing this in mind, Europeana Cloud shifted to thinking about how shared services could help the Europeana ecosystem. While these are not necessarily services that lead directly to publication within the Europeana portal, they are part of our long-term vision for services that will improve the quality of the data and make it fit for the purpose of various re-use avenues facilitated by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a new way of doing things for Europeana; such services have been built before by others in Europeana-related projects, but trying to sustain them for distributed use is a new challenge. On this front we are working closely with the LoCloud project that has already developed some <a href=\"http://locloud.eu/LoCloud-Competition/My-LoCloud-Services\" target=\"_blank\">excellent micro services</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally new for Europeana is providing services related not just to metadata but to content; this will provide capabilities for those with high-resolution images to provide much richer media experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next blog post we will look at the specific services being developed within Europeana Cloud.</p>"

        title: 'Unleashing Europe’s audio heritage: #EUSounds15'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On 2 October, over 200 sound archivists, music information retrieval experts, musicologists and musicians came together at the National Library of France for the first Europeana Sounds’ conference, <em>The Future of Historic Sounds</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time - both past and future - proved to be a motif for the day, and one well-suited to a conference about sound. As panellist Steen Kaargaard Nielsen from Aarhaus University observed, “listening to sound recordings from the past are the closest we come to time travelling… it immerses you, and creates an illusion of a still living past.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a prelude, conference-goers heard from Europeana Sounds’ coordinator Richard Ranft on the project’s ambition to “unleash”, in his words, “Europe’s audio heritage” and transform access to audio in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s soon-to-launch Music Channel, which <a href=\"http://test.europeana.eu/portal/channels/music\" target=\"_blank\">you can try out</a>, is one example of how the project has already started to do this, combining collections from all over Europe to give users a rich experience of the continent’s musical heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Europeana’s Product Development Manager David Haskiya explained, the Channel brings together sheet music, recordings, instruments and other music-related objects and by doing so, hints at the stories they have to tell together. But what kind of connections can we forge between items in the future? And what new narratives might we open up by doing so? As David suggested in his talk, there are still plenty of possibilities to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/soundsconferencecc0.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>Richard Ranft's Prelude, The Future of Historic Sounds, Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/europeana-sounds-orchestrates-its-first-public-conference\">Europeana Sounds</a> CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of discovery was one tackled by a number of speakers during the course of the day. While plenty of online services give access to sound, digitised audio heritage, as Richard pointed out, remains relatively hidden. Sometimes the challenge is greater than just making sounds findable - there are a number of other barriers that stop heritage sounds circulating or being listened to in other ways - from technical challenges to restrictive legal access. Together, however, the consortium of Sounds partners are working hard to help make these obstacles a thing of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The quest for openness</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the session on creating legal access to sound heritage, moderator Lisette Kalshoven from think tank Kennisland pointed out that the twentieth century black hole - where in-copyright works are inaccessible or absent online - affects audio heritage particularly acutely. Most archival sound recordings were created in this period so we start to understand why they are relatively scarce on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these restrictions, the session looked at some ways institutions can open up collections online - something the project is helping partners to do with Kennisland’s help. It was followed by a performance which showed the kind of creative potential openly licensed archival sounds offer artists. Electronic musician Matthew Herbert treated attendees to an explosive performance which remixed sounds - from seal cries to a German rendition of Hamlet’s famous soliloquy - contributed by partners to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What's that tune?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Through his experimental remix, Herbert cleverly reminded everyone that sometimes, we appreciate sounds purely for the sonic experience they provide and the different textures we encounter as we listen to them. It’s this elusive quality that can make it difficult to categorise sounds or navigate to them via a search engine. They pose questions metadata can’t always answer alone. What makes a song catchy? Or conventional? How can I look for songs that sound like ones I already know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/soundsconference2cc0.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>Panellists in 'From listening to interaction: sound innovations - pt. I', <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/news/europeana-sounds-orchestrates-its-first-public-conference\">Europeana Sounds</a> CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the panellists in the afternoon session on sound innovations all demonstrated, we’re making progress towards answering these puzzling questions. It’s an exciting time for music technology and the institutions looking to surface their digital sounds collections. Using his flute, Dr. Bryan Duggan gave us a taster of how the Sounds project is a part of this and introduced Tunepal, a collaboration with Europeana which offers a search-by-playing interface. By playing his flute on-stage, Duggan produced results in Tunepal - not only titles and scores, but a link to the tune in Europeana if available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day proved to be a fascinating journey through both the history of sound and the ways we can preserve and enjoy it - both today and in the years to come. It was also a brilliant introduction to the diverse and important work being done by Europeana Sounds and everyone involved in the project. To echo the speakers, the future’s definitely bright for Europe’s historic sounds!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Videos will be available in the coming weeks on Europeana Sounds’ blog, and you can see <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana_Sounds?utm_campaign=profiletracking&amp;utm_medium=sssite&amp;utm_source=ssslideview\">some of the presentations</a> from the day too. And if you haven't already, why not <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/recording-and-playing-machines\" target=\"_blank\">check out the exhibition</a> made with the help of the project partners, <em>Recording and Playing Machines</em>?</p>"

        title: 'An Apple for the teacher: interview with Gwen Vergouwen'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>With our friends at Apple and EUROCLIO – the European Association of History Educators - we’ve just launched our first Multi-Touch book and iTunesU course. These resources take material contributed to Europeana about the First World War and transform it into teaching resources for the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we ask Apple Distinguished Educator Gwen Vergouwen, whose hard work and ideas were central to this achievement, to tell us all about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Can you tell us about the Apple Distinguished Educator Residency programme?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Every teacher who uses Apple technology in the classroom can apply to become an Apple Distinguished Educator, making them part of a global community of teachers. The Residency programme gives ADEs like me the opportunity to work for a week behind-the-scenes with great cultural institutions like museums, archives and libraries, learning from experts and helping them to develop great learning materials with Apple technology. I was really happy to be one of the lucky few selected to do this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/book-en-screenshot-4.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>A screenshot from the new Multi-Touch book</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nWhy did you decide to apply for the Europeana WW1 project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve always been interested in World War One. It is a war that has an effect on people’s daily lives, even today. Ten years ago, I organized field trips for my students to the region of Ypres in Belgium, where nearly 500,000 people lost their lives in Flanders Fields. So when I heard about the opportunity to develop learning materials about the First World War with Europeana, I immediately applied. It was also a nice opportunity to get to know Europeana better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nWhat did you get up to during week in residence with Europeana and EUROCLIO?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>First we spent two days discussing and agreeing on the concept of the Multi-Touch Book and iTunes U course. We combined our educational expertise to create activities to sharpen the critical thinking skills of students in secondary education using primary sources from the Europeana 1914-1918 collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts at Europeana dug deep in their collections to select suitable, original and sometimes unusual resources like letters, children’s drawings, movies, postcards etc. These items had been contributed to Europeana by members of the public across Europe during Family History Roadshows. As such, they are items of precious personal memorabilia and give learners a unique perspective on real people’s experience of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last two days were used to design the first drafts of a Multi-Touch Book and the corresponding iTunes U course. This gave me the opportunity to discuss and clarify the learning potential of Apple technology and finally to demonstrate the entire project to both Europeana and EUROCLIO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/classpic-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>Gwen's students all get to grips with the new materials. Image: Gwen Vergouwen</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<br>\r\nHow do you think digital resources can encourage students to hone their critical thinking skills in a way that supports, or even surpasses, traditional learning materials?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology makes historical sources accessible in a way no book, no museum, no archive can! The primary source lies in the hand of the learner. It makes the past touchable! Thanks to technology and digital resources you can zoom in to explore details, you can watch movies at any time you want to, original books, objects and documents don’t get damaged and they can be widely shared. Learners can even add new data like notes, drawings and sounds. Digital resources make it possible to experience cultural heritage in a way that wasn’t possible before. And I’m sure we are only at the beginning of technological innovation in learning. Maybe one day, I’ll invite a virtual Napoleon to assist my classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do Europeana’s digital collections offer to educators?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The accessibility and diversity of the collection is very appealing to educators. Teachers too often have to rely on documents, sources, worksheets and textbooks provided to them by publishers. Digital versions of collections kept in archives, museums, libraries have to be as accessible as possible. They are the origin of our identity! We should give every citizen the chance to use the sources to study, to interpret, to question, to create, to enjoy and to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The internet can be unreliable – sources can be only partially attributed or not attributed at all, and facts can be incorrect. Is there anything heritage institutions can do to help solve this issue?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage institutions have a duty to stimulate critical thinking skills. Europeana and EUROCLIO are two excellent examples of good practice. But I’m quite realistic. Heritage institutions around the globe are funded in all kinds of different ways and so what they can achieve varies. It is up to the user to do a little research. Asking some essential questions can be quite helpful– if you know, for example, who created a resource, for whom and why, you’ll be more able to decide if it is a reliable resource for teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/franz1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 425px;\"><br><em>Franz Przybyla's drawings, contributed to Europeana 1914-18 by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020601/attachments_149863_12838_149863_original_149863_jpg.html?start=13&amp;query=Franz+Przybyla+&amp;startPage=1&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Heinrich Przybyla</a>, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Finally, you sourced lots of the material from Europeana 1914-1918. Do you have any favourites?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=Franz+Przybyla+&amp;rows=24\">children’s drawings of Franz Przybyla</a> – no doubt about it. As a child, he drew many key moments of World War One. It makes you aware of the fact that the war had an enormous impact on the lives and perspectives of children. This is something we often forget, but we can see today in the public reaction about refugees – particularly children - fleeing war in the Middle East.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>Europeana's brand identity was built five years ago around the concept 'think culture'. Our strategy for 2015-2020 outlines a shift from 'thinking' to 'transforming' - making much greater use of our cultural assets and creating new things with them. We now have a new visual styling that reflects this shift. To find out more about this new styling and how to use it, download our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Resources_and_PR_tools/Brand%20Guidelines/europeana_brand_guidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new brand guidelines</a> and discover the accompanying range of templates on our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/how-we-work/resources-pr-tools\" target=\"_blank\">Resources &amp; PR Tools</a> page.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the new styling, the Europeana Foundation and Network Association has a new strapline that you’ve probably seen or heard already - we transform the world with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what does that mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We - who? Transform - how? The world - it’s a big place! With culture - what’s that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, these words have quite a variety of meanings. ‘We’ could be the Europeana Foundation, the Network Association or humankind. To ‘transform’ something, you change something from one state to another. So what is the process here and how do ‘we’ do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there’s the million dollar question - what exactly is culture? Is it ‘the arts’ - music, film, paintings, opera, ballet? Or does it also include traditions, food, religion, family life, languages? Can we even really separate ‘culture’ from ‘the world’?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I asked members of the Europeana Foundation, Members Council and Network Association what all these things meant to them.<br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/m0005507-600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 445px;\"><br><em>A Sea Dayak feast, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006070221.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wellcome Collection</a>, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Angelaki, who, at the time of asking was Communications Specialist at the Greek National Documentation Center and is currently Europeana's policy advisor, says ‘Culture for me is everything that makes us human after we’ve covered our basic subsistence needs. It’s the traditions, dances, rituals and symbols that we use to represent and interpret the world.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Culture to me is contextual patterns and expressions from the way we live, work and think,’ says Rolf Källman, Europeana Network Association Members Council representative and Head of Digisam, National Archives of Sweden. ‘It takes unlimited forms and is something we inherit, interpret, share and bring forward.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana Foundation Executive Director, says that ‘Culture in the context of Europeana is everything we hold in our museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual institutions that tells us about our past histories and defines part of the way countries and societies relate to the world we now live in.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/circusmuseumccbysa.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 421px;\"><em>Olympia-Théâtre. Le plus grand ballet du monde, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021603/teylers_col28_dat7066_TEY0010002073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Circus Museum</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so culture isn’t just paintings and operas. It’s about expressing what it is to be human and what it is to exist. As Descartes meant to say, ‘I think, therefore I have culture’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, how about that tiny word, ‘we’?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny, Head of Communications at Europeana, says, ‘'We' is everyone in Europeana’s network across the cultural heritage and creative communities. You might be part of our formal Network Association or you might not – yet! But if you are proactively working with us or our content then you are part of the Europeana family.’<br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/europeanafamily.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"><br><em>Just some of the members of the Europeana family at the DSI kick-off, May 2015. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/17745637219/in/photostream/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For others, it’s more global, encompassing everyone who does work for or with Europeana as well as all those who are part of the culture we make available. Breandán Knowlton, Executive Director of, Historypin and Europeana Network Association Members Council representative says, ‘I think of ‘we’ as being “we humans”’.<br><br>\r\nAnd Sarah McSeveny-Åril, Senior advisor at the Heritage Here project, Arts Council Norway, sees it as an inclusive term too. ‘The idea of the 'We' spans time, connecting us in the present day, with our children and with past generations.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, put it together and what do you get?<br><br>\r\nFor Harry Verwayen, Europeana Deputy Director, ‘we transform the world with culture’ means that ‘the Europeana Network Association can contribute meaningfully to a number of issues facing society, using culture as our tool’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia says, ‘It means making culture available to everyone, transcending technological, legal and space or other boundaries, and allowing everyone to enjoy and use culture in the way they want, for personal, educational, scientific or recreational purposes.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a practical thing, then, but it’s also a philosophical one with a real feel-good factor, as my final selection of answers shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Rolf, ‘When we say that we transform the world with culture, to me that means that we want to use our common cultural heritage as a driving force to make the world a better place.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/peace.png\" style=\"width: 457px; height: 450px;\"><br><em>Peace Portal. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200140/BibliographicResource_3000051410490.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of France</a>, public domain</em>\r\n\r\n<p>And to Breandán, it means, well, pretty much everything! He says, ‘It means peace in our time! It means that we can imagine a common future together because we can reflect on our pasts honestly and completely.’ Whilst world peace might be outside our remit, Breandán certainly captures the transformative power of culture.<br><br>\r\nFinally, Eleanor says, ‘Transforming the world with culture is about opening doors through sharing. Each and every step that we take to make digital cultural heritage available, accessible and usable will help open a door to a richer world for someone, somewhere. That’s a wonderful feeling.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My thanks go to Sarah, Georgia, Rolf, Breandán, Eleanor, Harry and Jill for sharing their thoughts on what it means to transform the world with culture.</p>"

We have a window of opportunity now to influence the choices the Commission makes. Read on to find out how.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/stpeter-600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 360px; height: 550px;\"><br><em>St. Peter holding a key and book,</em>\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200122/BibliographicResource_1000056115342.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of the Netherlands</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission is committed to modernising EU copyright rules as part of its strategy to create a Digital Single Market for Europe. We welcome this news as current copyright rules restrict Museums, Libraries and Archives in their ability to provide access to information, culture and our shared European history online. If supported by modernised copyright rules the cultural heritage sector can continue its important contribution to society in the digital era and has the potential to be an important driver of the European Digital Single Market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore we would like to try to influence the outcomes. To this end, Europeana and several heads of major cultural heritage institutions have written an Open Letter strongly in favour of updated copyright rules addressed to Commissioner Oettinger, Vice President Ansip and Commissioner Navracsics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This need for change was also clearly recognised by the European Parliament in their evaluation report adopted before the summer. This report was <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/eu-parliament-in-favour-of-copyright-rules-better-fit-for-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\">directly influenced by the case for change Europeana has been making</a> on behalf of the cultural heritage institutions in its Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Encourage your director to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\" target=\"_blank\">add their name to the Open Letter to the Commission on updating EU copyright rules</a>.</strong> Widespread support from prominent cultural leaders will greatly strengthen our ability to influence the Commission’s acceptance of copyright change to create better online access to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-oct-2015-english.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> is also available in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-oct-2015-deutsch.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">German</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-danish.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Danish</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-oct-2015-swedish.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Swedish</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-italian.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-spanish.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform-online-access-to-cultural-heritage-romanian.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Romanian</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=08c60114d6f14d7894731b62bf543629\" width=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Semantic metadata enrichments can be hugely beneficial for searching Europeana in different languages and adding context to resources accessible via Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Today we’re pleased to publish the report from the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/evaluation-and-enrichments\" target=\"_blank\">Task Force on Evaluation and Enrichment</a>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/evaluation-and-enrichments\" target=\"_blank\">Read the report</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/evaluation-and-enrichments\"> on the Task Force page</a></strong><br><br>\r\nSemantic metadata enrichments can be hugely beneficial for searching Europeana in different languages and adding context to resources accessible via Europeana. Add enrichments that are incorrect or ambiguous, however, and the benefits can be reversed, spreading errors across multiple languages and harming the retrieval performance. A report from a previous <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/multilingual-and-semantic-enrichment-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech Task Force on Multilingual Enrichment</a> in 2014 has already explored some of these problems. So what have we done to build on this since then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/coin-hoard.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 418px;\"><br><em>Medieval coin hoard, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022324/267777.html\" target=\"_blank\">The British Museum and the Portable Antiquities Scheme</a>, CC BY-SA</em><br><br>\r\nFirst, we drew a broad picture of automatic and manual semantic enrichment of metadata in Europeana. We refined what we mean by semantic enrichment, taking the different notions around it into account. We created an overview of the enrichment tools and services developed in the Europeana Network over recent years, reflecting the diversity of different processes which have been investigated and used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here, we began to think more about how to select suitable datasets for enrichment. You can find our resulting selection criteria for target datasets and examples of their application in a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/evaluation-and-enrichments\" target=\"_blank\">separate companion document</a> to the main report, making them easy for others to refer to in the future.<br><br>\r\nLast of all, we carried out a large-scale comparative evaluation of automatic semantic enrichments services from different Europeana projects. By applying these tools to the same dataset, we were able to gather detailed qualitative and quantitative results about the way these systems work and how they can be optimized to better perform on Europeana’s metadata. This study is the first of its kind in our Network, and as well as providing us with a valuable insight into the topic itself, we also learned some crucial lessons about methodology that we hope future efforts can benefit from. To make it easier to read about all of this, we have also published a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/evaluation-and-enrichments\" target=\"_blank\">companion document</a> with full details of our evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-10/evaluationfigures.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 327px;\"><br><em>Evaluation figures from the report</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the Task Force’s work gives a useful overview of the different processes in semantic enrichment and offers guidance on how to assess each of these steps so as to carry out a coherent enrichment strategy.<br><br>\r\nWe hope our work will help technologists and other practitioners develop and exploit enrichment processes with greater efficiency and efficacy, and that these processes become more interoperable too - making them easier for others to compare, validate and re-use.<br><br><a href=\"mailto:antoine.isaac@europeana.eu\">Feel free to contact us</a> if you have any feedback about these documents.

        body: "<p><em>Calling all cultural institutions, museums and archives! The <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage in Motion awards are open for entries</a> until 1 December. The awards recognise European institutions harnessing multimedia technology to create exciting new routes into their collections, and each year, four institutions walk away with a prestigious prize. Here, we catch up with last year’s finalists to find out more about their award-winning projects. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the European Museums Academy conference earlier this year, four very different but equally inspiring projects won over judges to receive a Heritage in Motion award. What they share is their fresh take on visitor experience, promoting interactivity and the possibilities of digital technology over more traditional approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-05/HiM-winners-2015-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>This year's winners at the Heritage in Motion awards. Image: <a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/winners-announced-of-the-heritage-in-motion-awards-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Heritage in Motion</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the UK, the <a href=\"http://www.frameworkknittersmuseum.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Framework Knitters Museum</a> in Nottinghamshire came out top for the website and online content category with their interactive drama, <em>Breaking the Frame</em>, which follows the story of a young knitter, Ben, during the 19th century Luddite Uprising. Paul Baker from the museum explains that it was “developed in response to my desire to transform our school visitors from 21st century voyeurs into active participants”, and enabled them to implement something affordable yet of a consistently high standard for visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mobile device category, the Netherlands’ <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a> won the award for their family quest app. Inviting families to solve mysteries together, Renate Meijer from Rijksmuseum explained the thinking behind it was encourage collaboration between different age groups while learning about the vast collections. “One of the good things about it is that most groups do figure out all the riddles, exactly because they work together.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the film and video category, the jury chose the Gubec Theatre by the <a href=\"http://www.msb.mhz.hr/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum of Peasant Uprisings</a> in Gornja Stubica, Croatia. This transformed a 40 metre long monument into the backdrop for a performance commemorating the 440th anniversary of the Peasant’s Revolt. “Matija Gubec as a national hero was the motivation”, explains Goranka Horjan, the museum's former director, while “the sculpture itself offered a powerful storytelling background with potential to create huge emotional impact.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, winner of the Best Achievement award went to <a href=\"http://www.domunder.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">DOMunder</a>, an archeological experience under Domplein square in Utrecht. The project was dreamt up by design firm Tinker Imagineers. Petra Dijkstra observes that a “layered past” lay invisible beneath the square so the team’s ambition was “to open it up to the wider public… and reveal the fantastic stories” it has to tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/domunder-06-g-600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>A visitor in DOMunder. Image: Tinker Imagineers</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As this brief summary shows, the ideas that captured the judges’ attention were diverse, and each project posed different challenges for the institutions bringing them to life. For Renate and the Rijksmuseum team, it was to ensure players’ different devices stayed connected, and that everyone could feel like a ‘winner’. For the Framework Knitters Museum, the complex narrative, with opportunities to veer off in different directions thanks to the viewer’s decision-making powers, proved the biggest challenge. “The script was written to reflect the many possibilities each decision offers.” For the Croatian team, the sheer size of the monument was the obstacle they had to overcome. “We had to do a very accurate mapping of the vast surface in order to enable all the different multimedia parts to fit perfectly.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these challenges, the payoff for all the institutions was the praise and satisfaction of the visitors. Paul was delighted to find school visits rose dramatically, and the film was championed by the teaching union, even inspiring one young student to enter a competition for young historians - and win! In Utrecht, people revelled in the opportunity to play an active role, while at the Rijksmuseum Renate liked that different children found different aspects of the quest that they at excelled at. For Goranka, the feedback was “extraordinary”, and they hope to secure financial support to make the display permanent - something she imagines will be easier thanks to the award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four projects are impressive examples of the kinds of things cultural institutions can offer visitors thanks to the possibilities of digital technology. If you or the institution you work for is involved in a similar initiative, you can apply for a Heritage in Motion award until 1 December. We wish you lots of luck with your application!</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://heritageinmotion.eu/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/ApplyHiM.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 31px;\"></a>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p>A young soldier’s letter to his mother, a virtual exhibition on the history and meaning of cake, Wikipedia entries created as part of a Wiki edit-a-thon on European fashion; these are just some of the diverse cultural content available to everyone online. However, for everything that is relatively easy to share, use and re-use, there is also a wealth of cultural heritage that is not currently visible. One of the reasons we cannot easily engage with and share all cultural content online is due to current European copyright rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/soldier-letter.jpg\" style=\"width: 434px; height: 500px;\"><p><em>A soldier's letter to his mother at home in Ireland. Contributed to <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/17393#prettyPhoto\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> by Aileen Unger, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in June, we updated you on some of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/eu-parliament-in-favour-of-copyright-rules-better-fit-for-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\">work Europeana has been doing to represent cultural heritage organisations</a> at a European government level to reinforce <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/opinion/europes-cultural-heritage-institutions-deserve-better/\" target=\"_blank\">the issues the cultural heritage institutions have with the current EU copyright framework</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As custodians of in-copyright works, institutions face the time-consuming and often impossible task of obtaining copyright permission, whilst also managing the public’s expectations to provide online access. We do not want to undermine the ability of creators, publishers or intermediaries to earn a living from their creativity but simply want to make it easier to provide online access to works which will encourage and inspire new creative opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, we developed an approach for working with MEPS that was based on three main requests. The draft report on the implementation of the 2001 EU copyright directive should include language that would:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>make it easier for cultural heritage institutions to digitise the works that they have in their collections;</li>\r\n    <li>make it easier for cultural heritage institutions to make available online those works in their collections that are not in commercial circulation or otherwise actively managed anymore;</li>\r\n    <li>allow libraries to electronically lend all works contained in their collections (commercially available or not) as long as they pay compensation to the rights holders.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>In its evaluation report published before the summer, the European Parliament clearly recognised the current issues that the existing copyright rules present for institutions. This report was directly influenced by the case for change Europeana has been making on behalf of the cultural heritage institutions in its Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it is clear that the<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/2015_cnect_001_cwp_communication_copyright_rules_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> European Commission is committed to modernising EU Copyright rules</a> as part of its strategy to create a Digital Single Market for Europe, it is essential that we continue to influence and best represent the interests of our Museums, Libraries and Archives to enable us to provide access to information, culture and our shared European history online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help keep the momentum building and to best represent the real value in updating copyright rules, Europeana has worked collaboratively with heads of major cultural heritage institutions from across the EU. Together, we have written an Open Letter strongly in favour of updated copyright rules, addressed to Commissioner Oettinger, Vice President Ansip and Commissioner Navracsics. This represents Museums, Archives and Libraries in specific areas of making online access easier but also aligns with the efforts of others from across the cultural heritage sector in related areas such as extended collective licensing.The letter, which is available in a number of European languages, was initially signed by 30 key signatories from major cultural heritage institutions from 11 member states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\" target=\"_blank\">Open Letter has now been published online</a> and support is growing daily. To continue to make our voices heard by policy makers and to help influence the need for updated copyright rules,we want as many individual cultural institutions to sign as possible so would greatly appreciate if you could encourage your director to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/add-your-institution-to-the-list-of-prominent-individuals-in-cultural-heritage-calling-for-updated-eu-copyright-rules\" target=\"_blank\">add their name in support</a>. </strong></p>"

        title: 'We are Europeana: The Europeana Network Association AGM 2015'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Rather remarkably for a Dutch November morning, it was with blue skies overhead that 240 members of the Europeana Network Association gathered in Amsterdam for the 2015 AGM, this year bearing the title ‘We are Europeana’. So what did we all get up to?</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Well, with a busy programme brimming with thought-provoking talks, fascinating workshops, and an unforgettable evening at the Rijksmuseum, it’s tricky to know where to begin. I think we speak for the whole Members Council if we start by saying a huge thank you to everyone who came and made it such a lively, positive two days. The commitment of the Europeana Network Association to the future of digital cultural heritage was inspiring to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if we had to choose our highlight? Perhaps it would be the paper plane exercise, ‘Fly your Europeana Dream’. To the rhythms of Harry Verwayen’s harmonica, our dreams for Europeana and our community took flight and Jill Cousins was there to catch them… well, at least try to! You can watch a great video about it here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/145265678\" width=\"500\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/center&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/145265678\">AGM 2015 - Fly your Europeana dream</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThroughout the two days the conference’s simple motto - ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-annual-general-meeting-2015#agenda\" target=\"_blank\">We are Europeana</a>’ - was picked up on by presenters and speakers to express their vision for Europeana’s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Max Kaiser, Chair of the Europeana Network Association, in his welcome speech, as he encouraged members to build on the impressive progress made by the Network Association during its first year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Members Councillor Merete Sanderhoff as she opened the Commons session, calling on the cultural sector to work together for the mutual benefit of everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By hilarious anthropologist Colin Moon, who showed us cultural differences and ways to understand each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And by Head of Creativity Unit at the European Commission, Javier Hernandez-Ros, in his rousing keynote on the second day, reminding attendees that “Europeana belongs to all of you” and its success is down to us all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re looking for any of the presentations from the two days, you can <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/tag/europeana\" target=\"_blank\">find them on Slideshare</a>, and there are some striking photographs on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/albums/72157658728287793\">Europeana's Flickr</a> too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to seeing you next year on 7-9 November in Riga at the majestic National Library of Latvia. A new AGM Working Group will form to organise the programme and other details, so if you’re keen to get involved, keep an eye out for news in the coming month or <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu?subject=AGM%20Working%20Group\">contact us</a> to share your interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll also hear from our colleague Rolf on 24 November with the results of this year's elections. Thanks to all the fantastic candidates, and of course, the hundreds of voters too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last, but not least, we want these get-togethers to be the best they can be. If you have time, please <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y66BPNH\">fill out our survey</a> to help us improve next year’s event. We’re very grateful for any feedback you can offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y66BPNH\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/agm-survey.png\" style=\"width: 355px; height: 40px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'The missing decades: the 20th century black hole in Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>For the last couple of years librarians have talked about a 20th century black hole when trying to describe the effect that copyright has on making cultural heritage available online (it appears that the concept was first used publicly by Prof. James Boyle in a <a href=\"http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2009/09/06/google-books-and-the-escape-from-the-black-hole/\" target=\"_blank\">2009 column for the Financial Times</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana we are able to show the 20th century black hole in our dataset by looking at the temporal distribution of works within the dataset. We did so in a first analysis that we undertook in May 2012 and we have just repeated this exercise at the request of the European Commission which is looking for evidence to assess the impact of copyright on the online availability of cultural heritage. Just as in 2012 we are seeing the concept of the 20th century black hole confirmed in our data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collections that consist of works dating from the 20th century or that contain large proportions of works from that period are available online to a much lesser degree than collections from the periods before or after the 20th century. We have analysed the Europeana dataset to explore this pattern and our findings show that there is a clear gap in availability of digitized material from the 20th century (a more extensive analysis, can be found in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/Twentieth%20Century%20Black%20Hole/copy-of-europeana-policy-illustrating-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-the-europeana-dataset.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this factsheet</a>):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chronological distribution of dcterms:issued values in Europeana dataset (1800-today)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-11/blackholeeuropeana.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 297px;\"><br><em>Graph: CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The above graph represents an analysis of the 7,300,000 objects in Europeana's dataset of 45 million objects that contain the most reliable information about the date of creation of the work. The graph gives an approximate breakdown of the numbers of items represented digitally in Europeana that were created in each year since 1800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is evident that the amount of cultural heritage made available online increases steadily from the 1800s to the second half of the 20th century. From the 1950s onwards, the amount of material that is made available online falls dramatically. While the first half of the 20th century represents 35% of the sample, the second half is only around 11%. These findings reinforce our earlier research (from 2012) and illustrate once more that cultural heritage institutions are hampered in their ability to make collections from the 20th century available online (for a more detailed analysis including a full description of the methods that were used in producing the above graph please refer to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/Twentieth%20Century%20Black%20Hole/copy-of-europeana-policy-illustrating-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-the-europeana-dataset.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">this factsheet</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we cannot show a causal relationship between this and the way copyright law interacts with digitization efforts by cultural heritage institutions, feedback from Europeana data partners makes it clear that many cultural heritage institutions tend to avoid digitizing 20th century collections because of their often complicated copyright status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason Europeana and many of our Network members have been arguing that Europe's cultural heritage institutions need the legal space to do their work without always having to negotiate with copyright holders who are often impossible or prohibitively expensive to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to promote the online availability of cultural heritage from the 20th century, it is necessary to reduce the burden of rights clearance for these institutions. As we have argued in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\">recent letter to the European Commission</a> this can be done by updating the existing exceptions to copyright that apply to cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n"

As Collections Assistant for Culture24, I look into digital collection objects and paintings with the potential to be used on our sites, including <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself.com</a>, a platform created as part of Europeana Creative which allows the public to reinterpret famous paintings and share their recreations, and <a href=\"http://www.show.me.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Show.me.uk</a> – our educational website for 7-14 year olds which links up collection items, games and resources from different museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before joining Culture24, as part of my MA in Museums and Galleries in Education, I investigated the social and educational value of VanGoYourself (VGY), and interviewed some of those who had tried it out. Everyone I spoke to enjoyed the social experience, and found it ignited their interest in an artist, or renewed their desire to be creative or visit galleries.<br><br>\r\nVanGoYourself is made possible through museums <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\" target=\"_blank\">openly sharing</a> their images and data. For more initiatives like this to happen, Europeana is campaigning not only for cultural heritage to be digitized, aggregated and enriched, but, where possible, to be made openly available too. As part of this, they came to Culture24 for help getting more re-usable images of artworks into Europeana, and I began working as an advocate, encouraging institutions by using VanGoYourself as an example to bring this mission to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/two-women-from-naples-guillaume-bodinier-1795-1872-vangod-by-madeleine-mcdonald/?output=embed\" title=\"Images from VanGoYourself.com\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br><em>Madeleine, left, starring in her own recreation. VanGoYourself, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were three strands to this:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Invite institutions who had contributed works of art to VGY to improve the quality of their images and metadata on Europeana, or share them with Europeana for the first time.</li>\r\n    <li>Approach Europeana data providers with collections suitable for inclusion on VGY.</li>\r\n    <li>Look for institutions that would suit VGY, and were not already Europeana’s partner. Overall, these institutions were evenly spread across all parts of Europe.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>So… what did we discover?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve now completed the first part of our outreach and research, and approached 21 institutions already in VGY. In short – we often encountered the same difficulties as when VGY began, and found that it can be a challenging and long process encouraging institutions to make more content available online without copyright restrictions.<br><br>\r\nA breakdown of the results:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>24% were interested after some encouragement</li>\r\n    <li>14% showed interest, but are awaiting confirmation from within their institution</li>\r\n    <li>9.5% had already begun the process with Europeana</li>\r\n    <li>14.3 acknowledged there was room for improvement but are not prepared to change their policy on licenses or do not have the resources to do anything at this stage</li>\r\n    <li>38% did not respond after two attempts.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Why is this?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While talking to institutions, the main barriers we encountered were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employee time restraints</strong><br>\r\nAs metadata and collection records were created for internal use, the task of making them interoperable and fit for public use is perceived as time consuming and potentially laborious. There may also be a misconception that all of an institution’s images must be shared, rather than just a select set.<br><br><strong>A ‘pillar to post’ problem</strong><br>\r\nIndividuals within institutions might be keen to share content but are often spread across departments, and might not be able to assign licenses, update metadata or release high resolution images. This lack of clarity means the request can get lost between already overstretched departments.<br><br><strong>Concerns about control</strong><br>\r\nSome museums and galleries approach me because they love our websites, however often, there is scepticism about what happens when you share large numbers of downloadable high resolution images with open licenses or without copyright restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Start small, but think big</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>From these conversations, I believe there are many individuals in museums open to getting more artworks online, but they are either part of large organisations with procedures to follow or underfunded institutions unable to afford the time or potential costs.<br><br>\r\nTo combat this, we must keep encouraging institutions that are unsure by showing them potential benefits and mollifying their fears. We can keep persuading funders to support digitization and aggregation by presenting case studies about institutions that have successfully embraced the idea of making content openly available online. Here, individual projects like VanGoYourself and Show Me are useful. Though they acquire collection items on a relatively small scale, they have a strong appeal and can be clearly outlined to collection holders and funders.<br><br>\r\nBy opening up high quality content for others to use and remix, cultural institutions fulfil their ultimate goal of achieving wider and even deeper engagement with audiences, but without using up their own resources. If you’re a museum, archive or gallery considering how to do it, you can start small: take a subset from your collection, make it available for others to use and re-use, and then reflect on the results.<br><br>\r\nThese initiatives all open doors for new and innovative ways for researchers, educators, culture lovers and tourists to connect with our amazing shared digital heritage.</p>"

        intro: "<p>Sharing your digital collection via Europeana? Or thinking about doing so? Then the\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>\_is here to guide you.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana is evolving. Technology is ever improving. The future Europeana offers the inspired, creative or entrepreneurial the ability to take what our data partners provide and use it. For innovation. For education. For research. For business. For personal enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want the cultural heritage collections held in Europeana to be viewed, shared, used and re-used wherever and whenever possible. To support our vision to transform the world with culture, we need to look at how we manage content and bring it in line with the need to deliver it in higher quality to our audiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur research shows us that today’s audiences want accurate information, and quick and easy access to relevant pictures, texts, videos and recordings. This means Europeana’s data partners need to deliver both good metadata and, where possible, direct access to content (the digital objects themselves). Direct access via Europeana makes the process of watching a video, listening to a track, reading a book or viewing a high-resolution painting much simpler and quicker and therefore a better user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To manage content and deliver it in higher quality to our audiences, we’ve developed four tiers of participation in Europeana. What data partners provide will depend on their own agendas and capabilities, but the higher the quality of information provided by data partners, the more benefit they’ll create for their audiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese tiers are based on real examples and have been developed in wide-ranging discussion under the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/about-europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative project</a>. The initial draft was written by the Europeana Network Content Re-use Task Force and together with <a href=\"http://www.kl.nl\">Kennisland</a> and our network of aggregators a final version was created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Publishing Framework clarifies the relationship between Europeana and the data partners. It clearly outlines what we will do for the institutions depending on the content and metadata you decide to make available. This makes it easy to see what everybody can get out your collaboration with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So are you sharing your data with Europeana? Or are you thinking about doing so? Then have a look at the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Publishing Framework</a>. There is also <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/138177046\">a video introducing the Publishing Framework</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also realise that some of our partners would like to translate the Publishing Framework into their own language. So you can do this easily, we have added <a href=\"https://www.transifex.com/jpekel/publishing-framework/\">the complete text to a translation tool</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions or comments?

        title: 'The State of the Commons in Europeana: a 2015 review'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Europeana aims to give everyone the best possible access to Europe’s digitised cultural heritage, no matter where they live. Copyright is an essential part of this. When someone finds a cultural object they’re interested in, be it a book, painting or film, they need to know what they legally can and cannot do with it. Creative Commons has been helping with this over recent years.</em><br><br>\r\nToday, Creative Commons published their <a href=\"https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Commons Report</a> with the following announcement:<br><br>\r\n“Creative Commons, the global nonprofit that makes it easier for creators to share their work under simple copyright terms, announced a major milestone in the release of its 2015 State of the Commons Report today: over 1 billion works have been licensed using Creative Commons since the organization’s founding.<br><br>\r\nThis milestone was announced along with other significant data points in its State of the Commons report, which covers the growth of CC content on platforms, the globalization of CC tools, and cultural trends in the digitization of creative works. The State of the Commons report can be viewed <a href=\"https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.”<br><br>\r\nEuropeana has been offering the Creative Commons licenses to the cultural institutions we work with since we launched in 2008. With the creation of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\">Licensing Framework</a> in 2011, they became part of a set of 13 rights statements which we offer to institutions to choose from when they contribute collections to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, hundreds of cultural institutions around Europe have started licensing their works using the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">Creative Commons licenses</a> and the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\" target=\"_blank\">Public Domain Mark</a> that Creative Commons provides. This mark makes clear that the work is free from any copyright restrictions, most likely due to its age. We divide the Creative Commons licenses into two categories: the open licenses (CC0, CC BY and CC BY-SA) and the restricted ones (with non-commercial or non-derivative limitations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-12/cc-pd-in-europeana.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 487px;\"><br>\r\nAbove, you can see how the use of these licenses has grown. The increase from 2013 to 2014 was mainly down to the Europeana Rights Labelling Campaign which we carried out together with <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/en/\">Kennisland</a>. Our goal was for every record in Europeana to include a rights statement - something we successfully achieved. During the campaign, we had numerous discussions with cultural institutions about which licenses to use and many adopted a Creative Commons license as a result.<br><br>\r\nAs we approach the end of 2015, more than a quarter of the material you can find in Europeana is licensed with a Creative Commons license, as shown in the graph below. Another 22% of the collections come labelled with the Public Domain Mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-12/ccpd-25.png\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 433px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Europeana’s metadata, Creative Commons has again proved essential. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-opens-up-full-dataset-for-re-use\" target=\"_blank\">In September 2012</a>, Europeana dedicated all of its metadata to the public domain using the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain waiver (CC0) - a major milestone for Europeana and the open data movement. From this moment on, Europeana’s metadata became available to anyone, for any purpose, without any copyright restrictions. This created, and continues to create, huge opportunities for 3rd parties to re-use Europeana’s data using the Europeana API.<br><br>\r\nThe growth of Creative Commons in the cultural sector has been remarkable and we predict that, in line with the aims of the recently published Europeana Publishing Framework, the amount of open content in Europeana will amount to over half of the total collections. Despite this, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Creative Commons licenses are great, but it’s not always clear how to use them properly, or what the different implications are for each institution. We will therefore continue to offer training and documentation to the heritage sector and actively advocate for the use of open licenses and the maintenance of a healthy public domain.<br><br>\r\nToday we want to congratulate and thank <a href=\"https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmseyQpszJAhUHnRoKHY2xDwEQFgggMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIjGrbyNWoZzZAeS9SG1rGxQ5CQw&amp;sig2=xhK5_KX0Fi1cbNJ_LVN8gQ\">Creative Commons</a> for all the great work they have been doing, and for providing these tools vital to making our shared memory available to all.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>As part of Europeana Creative our partner Kennisland has developed a new service called <a href=\"http://embedr.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Embedr</a>. With Embedr, everyone can share high quality cultural heritage images on the Internet with the correct attribution. They can also zoom, pan and crop images - image embedding done right!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennisland developed Embedr under Europeana Creative to address the gap that had opened between the volume of high quality cultural heritage imagery emerging on the Internet and the lack of widely available tools helping people use them properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service exploits the new possibilities of the Europeana Content Re-use Framework to select cultural objects based on their size - all images in Embedr are at least 4 megapixels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This resolution makes it possible to explore each image in fine detail - and there are roughly 360,000 of them available to explore! They come from over <a href=\"http://embedr.eu/content/institutions/\" target=\"_blank\">50 different institutions</a> from across Europe, each of which has put huge effort into digitizing their collections at high quality, with a willingness and ability to share them far and wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Try Embedr out for yourselves</h2>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embdr_wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 77.62700069589422%; padding-top: 0px; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"http://media.embedr.eu/europeana___90402__SK_A_4701\" style=\"border: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\">Your browser doesn't support iFrames.</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Re-use of images and the platform</h2>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All images on Embedr are freely re-usable and can be embedded without permission from rights holders - either because they are in the public domain, or have an open license. Both the creators and the cultural institutions that have published the images deserve proper attribution - acknowledgement for creation of the work, and for making it available to the public. Embedr uses embedding standards - the platform is designed to retain this provenance information, notably on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its embedding standards and infrastructure, Embedr is great way to display high-resolution images on your site. It has dedicated servers in Germany storing the images which optimises their delivery and handles the bandwidth - this makes it really easy to replace the display of your image with Embedr’s viewer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in having your collection on Embedr, or do you have a question about it? Contact Embedr at <a href=\"http://hello@embedr.eu\" target=\"_blank\">hello@embedr.eu</a></strong></p>"

        body: "<p>Six months ago, we published a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/enhancing-the-europeana-data-model-edm\">White Paper</a> on developments of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> over the past 5 years. Our hope was to gather further feedback from the community about the next steps for EDM, and this began with a specific workshop just prior to the Europeana Network Association AGM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparation, we published a milestone outlining <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI/Milestones/europeana-dsi-ms29-edm-development-plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">our plans for EDM in the coming months</a>. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/edm-workshop-edm-turns-five-so-now-what\" target=\"_blank\">workshop</a> then took place on 2 November, and brought together 28 experts and members of Europeana's R&amp;D, technology and data partner teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-12/edm-workshop-600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>The workshop, kindly hosted by the Rijksmuseum. Image: Europeana, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For half a day, we discussed the future of EDM, and touched on governance and long term goals, as well as the co-existence of 'core' data alongside more complex refinements, the question of data quality and EDM, and potential extensions for the model to consider for the years ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These discussions are useful as we carry out our short term plans, but also give us a broader picture too - invaluable for developing our longer term strategy. For some areas, we even have enough input to provide guidance for the next five years!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We're pleased to be able to share <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-turns-five-so-now-what-workshop\" target=\"_blank\">a digest of the workshop</a> so everyone can read through the discussions and share their thoughts.

        title: 'From public libraries to business and brokerage: a round-up of Europeana Task Forces'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>As you may know if you’re a member of our Network Association, we run <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/task-forces\" target=\"_blank\">Task Forces</a> to bring experts in our community together to address challenges facing Europeana and its strategy. These Task Forces work on recommendations which then inform the following year’s business plan, ensuring the Network Association has a direct say in Europeana’s future. More broadly, we believe they contribute to the digital cultural heritage sector as a whole - the challenges we face, and the solutions we find, rarely apply exclusively to the work that we are doing.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the end of the year nears, eight Task Forces are wrapping up, or have already done so. They’ve been working away busily over the course of the year and will publish their findings in early 2016 (one, Evaluations and Enrichments, has already and you can read them <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/enriching-europeana-new-europeanatech-task-force-report\">here</a>). While we’ll hear from each Task Force in greater depth then, we thought we’d catch up with each of the Chairs to hear their highlights before the holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/content-re-use\" target=\"_blank\">Content Re-use Task Force</a> recently produced the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Publishing Framework</a>, an important step forward in our mission to help our partners get more out of the collections they share with us. Harry Verwayen, who led the Task Force along with Merete Sanderhoff, is delighted to have been able to share one outcome of their work. “We are excited that the hard work of the Task Force resulted in a tangible framework which manages the relationship between what cultural institutions share with Europeana, and what they can expect in return. The Task Force has done an incredible job setting standards in their respective communities and are now helping translate the framework into as many languages as possible.” The Publishing Framework has had a fantastic reception so far - if you’ve yet to read it, it’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana_Publishing_Framework.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">available here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Re-use was a priority for the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/education\" target=\"_blank\">education Task Force</a> too, chaired by Steven Stegers. “Education has great potential for re-use. And while most providers are happy to see their collections being used and re-used by students, there are barriers - copyright, for instance, and discoverability - which stand in the way of this potential being fully realised. It will take work to overcome these, but we hope the work we have done will offer opportunities for Europeana to unlock at least some of this potential, and be the basis for a lively new community of experts.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2015-12/astronomers.jpg\" style=\"width: 294px; height: 500px;\"><br><em>Astronomy: a gathering of people around an astronomical chart, engraving after J.P. Le Bas. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006117899.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Wellcome Library</a> CC BY</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-task-forces/europeanatech-floss\" target=\"_blank\">FLOSS Task Force</a> shared this desire to build an active community according to its chair Gregory Markus. “What’s most exciting about this Task Force is the potential within EuropeanaTech to form a stronger open source developer community. Rather than just working in project bubbles, we can come together and focus our efforts. There is a huge need for things like interoperability and standardizations, and developing adaptably. My hope is that we become as strong as the EDM community is now, still passionate about strengthening a tool created five years ago.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploiting opportunities for Europeana and digital cultural heritage in business is the topic for the next Task Force we hear from. Marco Rendina, the technical coordinator for Europeana Fashion, chaired <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/task-forces/brokerage-and-opportunities\">this group</a>, and the Fashion project provided the Task Force with a valuable model. “Working to define effective business cases in the cultural heritage domain is quite challenging. We had to think outside the box, and explore scenarios that were completely alien to most of us. But this exploration forced us to really focus on our value propositions, something that is easily taken for granted, and this exercise helped us better understand what we have to offer and why.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the world of business to the world of public libraries. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/task-forces/public-libraries\" target=\"_blank\">Public Libraries Task Force</a> came together to look at how to better represent the voice of this sector in Europeana. Chair Rob Davies is pleased with their progress: “the Public Libraries Task Force has opened up an important avenue toward re-use of Europeana content and services by people who use Europe’s 50,000-strong network of public libraries in local communities. This centres on the creative momentum of the Makerspace movement in public libraries and initiatives like it - the results have the potential to be quite exciting!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also looking local was the Task Force ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/task-forces/local-networks\" target=\"_blank\">Connecting local networks for collaborating and information sharing</a>’. Chair Hans van der Linden was enthusiastic about the possibilities they offer: “We identified characteristics and underlying principles for local, open networks as ecosystems for the sustainable handling of digital cultural heritage. The recommendations we have drawn up address setting up new networks as well as improving existing ones, at a European, macro-regional and local level.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, and also working to better connect individuals and institutions working towards the same goals in the broader Europeana community was the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/task-forces/europeana-network-communicators-group\" target=\"_blank\">Communicators Group Task Force</a>. “There’s the potential to create a really powerful network of communicators working together across Europe to amplify the great work being done in the digital cultural heritage sector,” explains Chair Kerstin Herlt, “and what we wanted to design was a practical framework for one - something sustainable that works across borders and domains. We’ve worked hard to crack this, and now we are ready to get started - stay tuned in the new year!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these diverse groups show, the Europeana community brings together an extraordinary array of experts from numerous backgrounds, all working towards a secure and sustainable future for Europeana. Together, they answer specific needs, not just for Europeana, but for the digital heritage sector more widely. We are grateful for all their time and efforts, and look forward to sharing their outcomes and final recommendations soon.</p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Denmark'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Denmark, one of the first countries to finalise their nominations for the campaign. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Gallery of Denmark (<a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/\" target=\"_blank\">SMK – Statens Museum for Kunst</a>) is a passionate advocate of open access art. The obvious choice, therefore, when it came to coordinating the Danish selection for Europeana 280. How did they approach the task, and in terms of licensing, encourage other Danish collections to be as enlightened?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Danish Ministry of Culture initially contacted the National Gallery to co-ordinate the Danish selection process. Merete Sanderhoff, curator of digital museum practice at SMK, is someone who is particularly well qualified for that role: “I know Europeana from the inside [she is a member of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Members Council and Management Board</a>], I was very happy to do it!” Her work at SMK, enabling digitised art collections to become more relevant – and more fun - in new ways, is closely aligned to Europeana’s vision of transforming our lives through culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Making a choice: the Danish brief</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“We spent some time thinking about the best approach to choosing a selection,” explains Merete. “This took place with museums and collections all over Denmark. There are unmissable artists but we also saw this as a huge chance for smaller collections to highlight their work and a wonderful opportunity to open up licenses with the benefits of exposure through the Europeana 280 campaign and visibility on the Europeana platform. That was a real incentive”. Were her colleagues in the Danish museum world as enthusiastic as she is about these opportunities? “Absolutely!”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brief for the Danish institutions was that an artwork should be in permanent ownership of a Danish museum, but it didn’t necessarily have to be created by a Danish born and bred artist. “In our selection, we wanted to challenge the traditional idea of a ‘Danish’ artistic heritage. So while we included a range of obvious highlights from Danish art history, we also agreed to emphasize diversity and give more focus to art and artists that are less exposed or tend to get swallowed up in big collections. Moreover, we made an effort to include works by female artists who are often overlooked when the canonical story of art is told. Finally, we decided that no more than one picture from an individual artist could be selected, to ensure a broad selection.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposals cover many periods of Danish art history from artists travelling far and wide from the 16th century onwards. Examples of Danish Golden Age art were selected alongside examples of social realism and impressionism with etchings, portraits and landscapes from different periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/denmark-smk-cc0.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 457px;\"><br><em>Artist Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann (1819-1881) was a painter married to the sculptor Jens Baumann Adolf Jerichau. A tender portrait of her husband is included in the Danish selection, but her other subjects (and her taste for the exotic - she travelled widely in the Orient), were unusual for Danish painters of the times.​ Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020903/KMS8589.html\" target=\"_blank\">An Egyptian Fellah Woman with her Baby</a> (1872), Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann, SMK, CC0.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Painterly partnerships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also some intriguing examples of painterly partnerships. At the Skagen colony in Jutland, the artists Anna and Michael Ancher and Marie and P. S. Krøyer were among those who worked there from the 1870s onwards, inspired by naturalism and plein-air painting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as painting fishermen and scenes of working life, they painted insightful portraits of each other. <a href=\"http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Skagen Kunstmuseer</a> selected a painting by Krøyer for the Europeana 280 collection. “There are a lot of stories behind the painting and how it wound up here in Skagen, so it made most sense to us,” explains the museum’s communications officer, Jakob Stig Nielsen. “Krøyer was a true European in a lot of respects, and spent a lot of time not only traveling around the Continent, learning his trade in Copenhagen and Paris, painting people and sights in places like France, Spain and Italy, but also visiting museums and collection in the major European cities to copy the works of Dutch or Spanish masters. He was very influenced by the contemporary tendencies in European art and in particular the French plein-air movement”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring that sense of European connectedness is one of the most rewarding prospects of the Europeana 280 campaign. But what are our colleagues at the Danish institutions looking forward to?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Jakob Stig Nielsen, it’s the scope of the campaign: “Ten carefully selected works from each of the different European countries is bound to result in something exciting and spectacular.” And Merete? “What I love about the campaign and what I’m looking forward to in the collection is the opportunity to see a broader diversity and see the connections between European artists and movements. I really hope to be surprised in by new artists and art I didn’t know about.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you have any questions about the Europeana 280 campaign, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:europeana280@europeana.eu\">europeana280@europeana.eu</a>.</em></p>"

It consists of several sub-projects that together offer a privacy-preserving, personalised recommendation service for cultural heritage and scholarly content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vision of EEXCESS is to \"push high-quality content from the so-called long tail to platforms and devices which are used every day. Instead of navigating a multitude of libraries, repositories and databases, users will find relevant and specialised information in their habitual environment.\" Europeana is one of their key data testing playgrounds. An EU funded project, EEXCESS have made all the tools they've developed open source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving the user's experience while investigating these massive caches of cultural heritage information is crucial for digital cultural heritage's contemporary relevance. Projects like EEXCESS not only improve the standing of institutions through R&amp;D, but by making their software openly available, it allows creatives and designers to get involved too, bringing with them fresh ideas for the heritage sector. We thought it'd be a great idea to highlight the work being done by EEXCESS after seeing their presentation at SWIB2015. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Answers kindly provided by Werner Bailer and Thomas Orgel from the <a href=\"http://www.joanneum.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Joanneum Research</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/5gy6V1M2R9M?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=tTVTb\" style=\"\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<h1>EEXCESS Project</h1>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://eexcess.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">EEXCESS Project</a> is building a framework for recommendation of cultural and scientific resources, reaching users in their 'work context', e.g., when browsing the web or authoring texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system can integrate any type of cultural or scientific resources that can be queried with an API. It consists of backend components for federated recommendation from the different data providers, and different types of clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use a number of open source tools for the development. For the server components we use <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Tomcat</a> to host our services, <a href=\"https://lucene.apache.org/core/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Lucene</a> for indexing text resources, <a href=\"https://jenkins-ci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jenkins</a> for monitoring our services and <a href=\"http://www.soapui.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SOAP UI </a>for testing. The backend software is written in <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Java</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" target=\"_blank\">IDE</a> used for development is <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse</a>, using <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Maven</a> as build system. For semantic enrichment of text resources, <a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jena</a>, the <a href=\"http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Java WordNet Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/source-code/\" target=\"_blank\">Geonames Java client</a>. For visualization, <a href=\"http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/\" target=\"_blank\">jFreeChart</a> is used in Java applications, and <a href=\"http://www.jqplot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jqPlot</a> for web-based visualizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to those mentioned above, we have used <a href=\"http://protege.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Protégé</a> for ontology development and <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Solr</a> as a search engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the applications and components developed in EEXCESS are open source, available on <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/eexcess\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. On the server side, this includes the recommenders for the different data providers and the federated recommender, which fuses their results. There is also a privacy proxy, which unlinks users and their queries and obfuscates queries to protect users’ privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For adding data providers, the <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/PartnerWizard\" target=\"_blank\">PartnerWizard</a>, a web-app developed using <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html\" target=\"_blank\">Maven archetypes</a> enables us to add new providers quickly without the need for coding. There is also a range of client applications on the repository, implemented as plugins for widely used applications: Google Chrome, Wordpress, Google Docs and Moodle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EEXCESS system is very modular, and a number of components may also be useful in other contexts, for example, <a href=\"https://github.com/EEXCESS/DoSeR\" target=\"_blank\">DoSeR</a>, a component for disambiguation of semantic resources and a set of visualization widgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What we haven’t found up to now is a robust library for parsing incomplete and approximate time and place fields. And of course, we’d like to see data providers with searchable APIs, which could then feed data into the EEXCESS system.</p>"

        intro: "<p>What better way to show off these tools than talk to the developers making use of and developing them?</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog?tag=floss\" target=\"_blank\">Who's Using What</a> is a blog series by Gregory Markus from <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> as part of EuropeanaTech. The idea behind the series was to raise awareness about the brilliant open source software options now available to institutions, and to encourage collaboration in the digital heritage community. What better way to show off these tools than talk to the developers making use of and developing them? You can also find lots of OS options in the new <a href=\"http://bgweb.nl/floss/\">E</a><a href=\"http://bgweb.nl/floss/\" target=\"_blank\">uropeanaTech FLOSS Inventory</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu\" target=\"_blank\">Catmandu</a> is an open source toolkit to manipulate (semi-)structured data. It was developed as part of the <a href=\"http://librecat.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LibreCat Project</a> - a collaboration between <a href=\"http://www.ugent.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">Ghent University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/\" target=\"_blank\">Lund University</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Bielefeld University</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its simplest, Catmandu offers a command line client and a suite of tools to ease the import, storage, retrieval, export and transformation of data. It solves all sorts of problems that institutions encounter in terms of data management, with a firm emphasis on the importance of open source. Developed by librarians for librarians, it attracts an active developer community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech caught their presentation late last year at the <a href=\"http://swib.org/swib15/\">SWIB Conference</a> and decided to follow up with them to see which tools and components went into Catmandu, and what they have planned for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answers from <a href=\"https://github.com/phochste\" target=\"_blank\">Patrick Hostenbach</a> - Ghent University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/librecat.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 273px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>LibreCat-Catmandu</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We export data from databases such as library catalogues, institutional repositories, web services, relational and nosql databases and data dumps (such as MARC, XML, RDF, JSON, YAML).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This data can be transformed using our <a href=\"https://github.com/LibreCat/Catmandu/wiki/Fix-language\" target=\"_blank\">Fix language</a> and stored once more in catalogues, databases or data dumps. The process is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\">ETL</a> and has existed for many years as a billion dollar market, but, until recently, not many ETL tools targeted at library datasets were available - and certainly not available as open source tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code is programmed in <a href=\"https://www.perl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Perl</a> and makes heavy use of existing <a href=\"http://www.cpan.org/modules/\" target=\"_blank\">CPAN modules</a> to process the various data formats. In our projects, we like to work with open source tools as <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\" target=\"_blank\">ElasticSearch</a>, <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\" target=\"_blank\">Solr</a> as our backend data stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For web development we are using the <a href=\"http://perldancer.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Perl Dancer</a> and <a href=\"http://plackperl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Plack</a> which gives a very easy access to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSGI\" target=\"_blank\">PSGI</a> framework to create fast lightweight web applications. In our coding community we make use of tools such as <a href=\"https://github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a>, <a href=\"https://coveralls.io/\" target=\"_blank\">CoverAlls</a> to keep our code clean and tidy and help our core maintainer <a href=\"http://search.cpan.org/~nics/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolas Steenlant </a>to build our CPAN releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our developers are all running <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html\" target=\"_blank\">GNU/Linux</a> environments such as <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Debian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.centos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CentOS</a>. Then there are tools such as <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a>, <a href=\"https://www.vagrantup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant</a> and <a href=\"https://puppetlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Puppet</a> to manage installations and automate a lot of the system administration tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For parallel processing we use GNU parallel to process large datasets. We rely very much on great existing open source applications such as <a href=\"http://www.fedora-commons.org/\">Fedora Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BlackLight</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.koha.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Koha</a> to implement front-ends. To create statistics we are using R. To transform unstructured data <a href=\"http://pandoc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pandoc</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many great open source tools available. As coders we don’t favor Perl, Python, Ruby or Java, rather we choose what is the best tool for the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several big projects we are working on currently. We are creating a new version of our institutional repository LibreCat based on Catmandu to add support for research data and more <a href=\"http://www.maximus.com/cris\" target=\"_blank\">CRIS</a> functionality. The code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/LibreCat/LibreCat\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> and will very soon go into production at <a href=\"http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/%28en%29/\" target=\"_blank\">Bielefeld University</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, we are working with <a href=\"https://www.iminds.be/en/contact/ghent\" target=\"_blank\">iMinds at Ghent University</a> to create tools for processing and publishing <a href=\"http://linkeddatafragments.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Data Fragments</a>. We think this is a great new technology to publish linked data on the Web. <a href=\"http://jakobvoss.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Jakob Voss</a> at <a href=\"http://www.gbv.de/\" target=\"_blank\">GBV</a> is creating a great suite of Perl modules to manipulate RDF. <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/JonasSmedegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Smedegaard</a> is pushing Catmandu into Debian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next release of Debian (Ubuntu etc) installing Catmandu will be as simple as a 'apt-get install catmandu'. But, there is so much. If you look at GitHub there are dozens of <a href=\"http://librecat.org/distributions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Catmandu repositories</a> where our community creates new data processing tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be great if, in the library world, we could exchange more data manipulation recipes. Our intent with Fix language was to create data mappings that can be read by librarians and programmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are so many open source data manipulation tools available these days in Perl, Ruby, Python, Java, NodeJS (See also: <a href=\"http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#related-projects\" target=\"_blank\">http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#related-projects</a>). It would be great to have these projects work together and exchange best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are already examples how this could be done, by, for instance, <a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/11013\" target=\"_blank\">combining LODRefine and Catmandu</a>. In our LibreCat institutional repository we have a strategic direction to use more <a href=\"https://www.r-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">R programming</a> for the statistics of data processing. There is no need to reinvent the wheel of you have such a great open source tool available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then in my dream scenario, I would open <a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/\">RStudio</a>, write a little Fix script to manipulate a giant MARC/OAI-PMH/RDF dump and generate cool graphs using R. In the end, we do this all to get the data out, cleaned, on the web so it's freely accessible with open licenses.</p>"

        title: 'Building an open layer over all knowledge: Europeana joins Annotation Coalition'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Today, Europeana joins a coalition, <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/annotating-all-knowledge/\">Annotating All Knowledge</a>. This informal initiative, announced by the <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/\" target=\"_blank\">Hypothes.is Project</a> on 1 December, gathers over 40 scholarly publishers, platforms, and technology partners who seek to build “an open conversation layer over all knowledge” that “can transform scholarship, enabling personal note taking, peer review, copy editing, post publication discussion, journal clubs, classroom uses, automated classification, deep linking, and much more.” (Read the coalition's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Xy-OPnn20SK2oqXe6VSJ8BHBx7m6r7c2Qc_Be9Y990/\" target=\"_blank\">press advisory</a> and <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-over-40-scholarly-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>.)<br><br>\r\nThis initiative especially recognizes the potential of annotations for scholarly activities, and aims to explore how interoperable annotations that follow open standards can be deployed as a meaningful, valuable layer on top of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/blog-aakcoalition.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 1066px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Projet de constitution française de 1791 annoté par Robespierre, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000045591826.html\">Bibliothèque Nationale de France</a> (BnF), Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach naturally fits Europeana’s vision, and especially the goal of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a>, where sharing digital culture is positioned as the cornerstone of a data ecosystem where scholars can find and exploit cultural data to support their research activities and publish the results in a way that gives this cultural material new context. This creates a virtuous circle where potential for re-use grows incrementally.<br><br>\r\nEuropeana and its partner projects have been involved in developing annotation solutions and applying this to research scenarios (<a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Cloud</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Sounds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The European Library</a>, <a href=\"https://sealincmedia.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SEALINCmedia</a>, etc.).<br><br>\r\nWe are currently working on incorporating the W3C <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/annotation/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Annotation technology</a>, a key component of the coalition’s proposed approach, into our data modelling and core services. For more information you can have a look at our most recent <a href=\"http://fr.slideshare.net/antoineisaac/modelling-and-exchanging-annotations-swib15\" target=\"_blank\">technical presentation on modelling and exchanging annotations</a> (focusing on the ongoing work in the Europeana Sounds project), at the <a href=\"http://swib.org/swib15/\" target=\"_blank\">Semantic Web in Libraries</a> conference.<br><br>\r\nTogether with the other members of the coalition, we’re looking forward to openly sharing and discussing this vision, as well as our more concrete case studies and lessons learned from tackling the challenges of designing and implementing this scholarly annotation layer. We believe this is vital to identifying the best practices and technical solutions that will be of greatest value to our community, and to the researchers we want to serve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Follow the progress of the coalition on Twitter at #AAKCoalition</strong></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Lithuania'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong><em>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Lithuania about their nominations. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When countries choose just ten pictures representing their artistic heritage, we get the opportunity to brush up on our knowledge of Europe’s connected political and social histories. Some vivid choices from Lithuania include images created by artists working through turbulent times and sometimes a long way from home. So how did Lithuania make its selection for Europeana 280?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ldm.lt/index_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The Lithuanian Art Museum</a> was nominated by the Ministry of Culture to coordinate the Lithuanian submissions process for Europeana 280. Donatas Snarskis, project specialist at the museum, describes how they went about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lithuania’s selection process begun after the Ministry of Culture sent an initial request to national and regional digitisation centres inviting curators to submit possible entries within their own fields. Those involved included libraries and archives, and institutions within the museums sector. The Church Heritage Museum was also approached. The Ministry of Culture then made the final selection of 10 and the Lithuanian Art Museum was nominated to coordinate from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help them make their nominations, what brief did the Ministry give Lithuanian institutions? “The general selection criteria for Lithuania were: artworks held in Lithuania; artworks by the most influential Lithuanian artists; and artworks that represented important stages in the history of Lithuanian art,” explains Snarskis. Other than these, curators were at liberty to come up with their own choices – something shown by the range of movements covered in the selections which include Lithuanian baroque, classicism, romanticism, realism and expressionism. They show artists embracing and interpreting new ideas from their travels or absorbing new influences as members of the Lithuanian diaspora.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A work of art is a new reality</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1930s, a thriving art scene gave rise to the ‘Ars’ group whose members were inspired by their studies in Paris. At their first exhibition in 1932, they proclaimed in true manifesto style: “A work of art is a new reality. We desire to enrich our lives with new values” (National Gallery of Art, Lithuania). In the Soviet-occupied times that were to follow, a whole new range of values came into force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/lithuania-280-ccby.jpeg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 602px;\"><em>Turgaus scena, Pranas Domšaitis (1947). <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048002/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Lietuvos_dail_s_muziejus___Lithuanian_Art_Museum_1_1002120.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lithuanian Art Museum</a>, CC BY.<br>\r\nA 1918 work was selected for Europeana 280 from expressionist Pranas Domšaitis who became one of the most famous painters of the Lithuanian diaspora. This later image shows the influence of his rural upbringing (he was a farmer until the age of 27) and his strong roots, even after emigration to South Africa in 1947: “Lithuanian blood does not deceive, just as my paintings are truly Lithuanian.”​</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in Germany, Lithuanian expressionist Pranas Domšaitis (Franz Domscheit) was suffering from attempts to use art as a propaganda tool. He was included along with Munch, van Gogh, Nolde, Kirchner, Mueller, Dix, and many others, in the 1937 Entartete 'Kunst (degenerate art) exhibition. His work was removed from German galleries a year later and he emigrated to South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unique figure in European arts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A more serene choice is one of Europe’s most unusual artists. But which work to choose? It’s the dilemma shared by all Europeana 280 selectors, as Raimonda Norkute, Head of Centre for digitisation, <a href=\"http://www.ciurlionis.lt/\">National M. K. Čiurlionis Museum of Art</a> explains: “How were we to select only a few works of art from the collections of the National M. K. Čiurlionis Museum of Art (from nearly a half a million exhibits)? Which one is the most representative of Lithuanian culture? The answer is in the title of the museum – the great artist and composer – Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a short career lasting some 15 years, Čiurlionis composed and created hundreds of musical compositions, paintings and etchings while finding time to experiment with photography, be actively involved in the Lithuanian national movement, and in true renaissance-man style, engage in many other spheres taking his interest from geology to astronomy (he has an asteroid named after him).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 280 selection (Sonata no. 6) is one of seven pictorial Sonatas painted by M. K. Čiurlionis, and according to Raimonda Norkute, one of his most mature works and most musical creations: “It is full of wonderful interplays of colours, a variety of rhythms and a powerful imagination. This Sonata reveals a magnificent sense of music and Čiurlionis’ visionary approach.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to sharing more about each of the fascinating artworks selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280.</p>"

        body: "<p>As you’ll have seen if you’ve taken a look at Europeana recently, our new website is now live.

        title: 'Inventing Europe brings the past alive with Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is a guest blog by Jan Korsten, business director of the Foundation for the History of Technology, about Europeana's ongoing collaboration with Inventing Europe. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting youngsters excited about European history and helping them develop a sense of historical awareness can be challenging. How do we help them actively understand why historical knowledge is important, and encourage them to discover the roots of today’s society? To answer these questions, the Foundation for the History of Technology (SHT) explores new and innovative ways of making historians’ research suitable for the classroom. As part of this, we began a pioneering collaboration with a group of European cultural heritage institutions five years ago. The project is called Inventing Europe and Europeana is one of the key partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Inventing Europe</a> is both a digital platform putting digital objects into context through exhibitions and tours, and an aid for students carrying out their own research, allowing them to select objects themselves and create their own historical narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/inventing-europe-home-page.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 611px;\"><br><em>Inventing Europe's homepage</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history the site narrates is closely tied to the ambitious research programme <a href=\"http://www.makingeurope.eu\">Making Europe: Technology and Transformations 1850-2000</a>. SHT is one of the driving forces behind this programme, which sees research carried out by an international group of technology historians. Over the past fifteen years, Making Europe research has shown how the history of Europe has been shaped not by political treaties, but by the day to day activities of companies, consumers, entrepreneurs, engineers, scientists. From the mid- 19th century, it is these individuals and organisations that have built a united Europe through the cross-border circulation of goods, people, ideas and information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a unique perspective on European history. Naturally, it shouldn’t only be accessible to scientific audiences, but to policymakers, university students, high school students, museum-goers, journalists... Inventing Europe helps make this happen, reaching audiences outside the scientific community and engaging them. It combines rich digital cultural heritage collections available via the Europeana API and results of research into Europe’s history in a <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/education/\">web-based education environment</a>. The heritage materials returned via the API help students learn about the interaction between different actors, factors and events over time. Through the lens of the objects and images, students can cross borders and dive deeper into European history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We firmly believe that knowledge about developments in the past will help us understand the present and develop in the future. Embedding European history in education through Inventing Europe and initiatives like it is hugely important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By encouraging students to actively engage and interact with Europe’s history in a way never possible previously, Inventing Europe, it’s museum partners and Europeana serve as an important gateway to a truly creative and innovative European history education. Together, they help to bring the past alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Norway'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Norway about their nominations. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Europeana 280 collection, we will be able to enjoy some emblematic paintings alongside less well-known works. One very familiar anguished face – The Scream by Edvard Munch - was an obvious selection for Norway. “Munch is central in Norwegian visual arts, that goes without saying”, explains Gro Benedikte Pedersen, Coordinator Digital Collection Management, <a href=\"http://www.nasjonalmuseet.no/en/\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design</a>, who were asked to coordinate the Norwegian selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were other more difficult choices. In terms of approach, the National Museum largely made the highlight list on its own but consulted and involved three other institutions. “And it was very hard!” exclaims Pedersen. Selections include the realist painter Harriet Backer (1845-1932): “The fact that she is female was not a main point but we still wanted to highlight such a magnificent female artist at this early stage in the development of Norwegian art”. Also modernist Ragnhild Keyser (1889-1943): “She was rediscovered by Norwegian art history much later and is typical of how the Paris avant-garde was mirrored and further developed outside of the modernist metropolis.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Inspired by landscape: the nature road</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But it is landscapes that have been an enduring and dominant motif in Norwegian art. The selections show a surprisingly diverse range of approaches from the beginning of landscape painting in the 19th century to the modernist interpretation of northernmost Norway in the 1960s by abstract artist Anna-Eva Bergman (1909-1987).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curators at the National Museum provided a little more detail about the beginnings of the landscape tradition. “There was no art academy in Norway in the 19th century so young artists trained abroad. In Copenhagen, Stockholm and Dresden, and then Düsseldorf and Karlsruhe. Our first landscapist was Johan Christian Dahl (1788-1857) who became professor of Landscape-painting at the Dresden Art Academy in 1824. He had many pupils – also from Norway – and Thomas Fearnley and Peder Balke (1804-1887) [another dramatic selection], were the most famous ones. Dahl focused on a close study of nature; “the Nature Road” as he called it.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/norway-pd.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 460px;\"><br><em>Fjordbunn III, Lars Hertervig (1866), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022608/SKMS_SG_660.html\" target=\"_blank\">Museum Stavanger</a>, Public Domain.<br>\r\nWhen Lars Hertervig died on 6 January 1902, he was unknown to most of his contemporaries. As an artist his motives were somewhat secretive and he spent time in psychiatric institutions. A painting of his mysterious trees was nominated for the Europeana 280 Collection in acknowledgement of how Hertervig is now considered one of Norway’s hidden treasures.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Hidden treasures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lars Hertervig (1830-1902) - a selection from the <a href=\"http://www.museumstavanger.no/museene/stavanger-kunstmuseum/\" target=\"_blank\">Stavanger Kunstmuseum</a> – was associated with the Düsseldorf School that attracted painters from all over the world from the 1840s onwards. According to curator Inger M. L. Gudmundson from the Stavanger, it was a period almost synonymous with Norwegian National Romanticism: “The idea of an ‘essential national character’ pervaded Europe at the time and was highly significant for the process that culminated in Norway’s independence from Sweden. It influenced artists to paint their homeland’s nature and folk life”. Hertervig was in his second year of studies in Düsseldorf when he suffered a psychological crisis. When he returned to Stavanger in 1865 with access to materials and supplies during a two-year apprenticeship at a painting firm, he could once again create oil paintings, but he spent the last decades of his life in poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Pedersen, “Hertervig with his mysterious landscapes is still not very well known abroad, but we believe he is a somewhat hidden treasure. It may be noted that Jon Fosse, the Norwegian playwright (one of the most popular on the world’s stages today and Norway’s most significant after Ibsen) was inspired by Hertervig’s biography in his novel Melancholia.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peder Balke is also one to watch, with great potential to be appreciated by a wider international audience. “Balke is an ‘emerging’ artist internationally”, suggests Pedersen, “partly due to an exhibition in the National Gallery in London last year and on the private art market.” In London, Balke was heralded: ‘Forgotten for a century, he is an important Scandinavian rediscovery”, according to the (British) National Gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope there will be many more of those discoveries to come in Europeana 280.

The old version of TimelineJS loaded a full copy of jQuery, which was kind of heavyweight, and sometimes lead to version collision problems when people embedded a Timeline in their own webpage. For the new version (and for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstorymap.knightlab.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGU6NxfIo5a9z-Vf69lI9584DNtBQ\">StoryMapJS</a> which we developed last year), we instead copied a small portion of code from the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fzeptojs.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg5pApqK9qmEX2XQqpB1yvFKLLcA\">Zepto library</a>, just to handle all of the cross-browser, cross-server complexity of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ajax-cross-domain.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSjh5o6IzHBJproNf8L7kg5HpK1A\">AJAX</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We always prefer open source tools, so the laundry list is long, and in some ways maybe not surprising: we use python for all of our server side code, including <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSU1ZCMW_LBb5E3mdq2QDIAj8M4g\">Django</a> or <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fflask.pocoo.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJ9V-_HcnDs2ho4QdgKcuzcvyZwA\">Flask</a> for web applications as appropriate. We also use the Fabric python library for build and deployment management, including with our javascript tools. We use lots of python libraries like requests, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftweepy%2Ftweepy&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSUaF2d7LZ02-QehsnAEbfcBKu_g\">tweepy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crummy.com%2Fsoftware%2FBeautifulSoup%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHG_jrlLUcKe_OXToO3kMM5eF3JeQ\">Beautiful Soup</a>, and on and on. We use <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubuntu.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHTmFHYKsnZbVKD3XP7-6c8QSVtg\">Ubuntu</a> for our servers, and on them we run <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhttpd.apache.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnE18Zqwca67qcEKHyyk34gCmIlQ\">Apache HTTPD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.postgresql.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzaJ-8YMyDLrJqiVWLkFFrmcbGVQ\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mongodb.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbhl-87RwAJABHUobqyutVb2nFBg\">MongoDB</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elasticsearch.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmTzvbPsqT3LkchMsb1uaUdRjiig\">ElasticSearch</a>. We use common node tools like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Flesscss.org%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyaG6OGCQoyYDFU5HHrHPcAFq0Jg\">LESS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmishoo%2FUglifyJS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoF2BJkPHAYiFfelQBjwQJPK4JbQ\">uglifyjs</a> for the javascript libraries. We don’t want people who want to use our software to have to buy other stuff to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are hoping that the new version of TimelineJS is slightly better factored to support community code contributions, although it’s also just hard to clearly communicate design intentions and priorities to a wider community. I know it’s frustrating when people develop a useful enhancement to an open source project which doesn’t get accepted by the core developers, but we’ve also found that a lot of people want to make TimelineJS do things that bend it away from our considered design choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a pretty different vein, we’ve been working on a toolkit for monitoring URL sharing on twitter, inspired by <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.niemanlab.org%2Ffuego%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2I7bNLjt2q9iQcKZraY-_q5vT7g\">Nieman Lab’s Fuego</a>. Over the summer, we worked with one of their developers to create a new engine that does collection and indexing. People will still need some development skills to use that to publish a website. We’ll have a more formal announcement pretty soon, and we are looking forward to seeing what people build with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m not particularly looking for any tool or library. Rather, I’m interested in helping people become more fluent with information technology. It’s going to be cool when we can “read” computers like we read books, with almost no friction. Anything we can do to reduce that friction is interesting. I’m inspired by people like <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTh0TIZahWolFwPo-IrAUvXTNy4w\">Bret Victor</a>, who push us to imagine<a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2FMediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-AaA_E5YnffRNcTR1f_08-WuZJQ\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fworrydream.com%2FMediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-AaA_E5YnffRNcTR1f_08-WuZJQ\">media for thinking the unthinkable</a>, but I think there are a lot of incremental steps to get there. I’ll be happy if I can keep being part of thinking about that problem and making small steps forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like your work profiled in this column contact Gregory Markus at <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more open source tools see the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">FLOSS Inventory</a></p>"

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/whos-using-what-eero-hyvonen.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this new series \"Who's Using What?\", <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech\">EuropeanaTech</a> Community Manager Gregory Markus from the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, will be profiling the use of open source software within the EuropeanaTech Communty and the greater digital cultural heritage world at large. Software will range from storytelling tools that enable reuse to OCRs or libraries and everything in between. Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Eero Hyvönen</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/u/eahyvone/\">Eero Hyvönen</a> directs the Semantic Computing Research Group <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/\">SeCo</a> at Aalto Universiy, Finland. Since 2002, a major goal and research theme in SeCo has been creating a national Semantic Web infrastructure in Finland based on ontologies and ontology and data services. In this work, Cultural Heritage Linked Data has been a major application domain and many applications of SeCo are now in use, such as <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/museumfinland/\">MuseumFinland</a>; (2004), <a href=\"http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/?lang=en\">CultureSampo</a>; (2008), <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/kirjasampo/\">BookSampo</a>; (2011) of Finnish Public Libraries, and <a href=\"https://onki.fi/\">ONKI</a> (2008) <a href=\"http://finto.fi/fi/\">Finto</a>; (2014) ontology service of the National Library of Finland. Using and creating Open Source tools and Linked Open Data has been a long tradition in SeCo. He has published over 300 research articles and books in addition to winning the Semantic Web Challence Award (twice) and several other awards. We are pleased to feature Mr. Eero Hyvönen in our latest addition of \"Who's Using What?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our infrastructure is based on <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/\">W3C Semantic Web</a> ;standards and on thesauri, gazetteers, and data sources already in use in Finland. At the moment we use, e.g.,<a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\">Jena</a> <a href=\"http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/\">Fuseki</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.varnish-software.com/\"> Varnish</a> for the “7-star” <a href=\"http://www.ldf.fi/\">Linked Data Finland</a> data service and <a href=\"http://light.onki.fi/fi/\">ONKI Light</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos\">Skosmos</a> for ontology services, <a href=\"http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/silk/\">Silk </a>and <a href=\"http://sieve.wbsg.de/\">Sieve </a>for data aligning,<a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_0_3/fileformats.html\">Lucene</a> for data indexing and searching, <a href=\"http://laurensrietveld.nl/yasgui/\">YASGUI for SPARQL</a> querying, <a href=\"http://protege.stanford.edu/\">protégé</a> for ontology editing, LODE and <a href=\"http://vocab.at/\">vocab.at</a> for dataset documentation, and <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\">jQuery</a> , <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a>, <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">D3.js</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev.data2000.no/sgvizler/\">Sgwizler</a> for user interfaces and visualizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also quite a few Open Source tools that we have used in larger applications before, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon\">Cocoon</a>, <a href=\"http://spring.io/\">Spring</a>, and <a href=\"http://tapestry.apache.org/\">Tapestry </a> as web development frameworks, and <a href=\"http://www.swi-prolog.org/\">SWI Prolog</a> for logic programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the tooling side, the <a href=\"http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/las/\">SeCo Lexical Analysis Service</a> combines various open source language technology tools into a web service, and <a href=\"http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/eswc2014pd_submission_46.pdf\">SPARQL SAHA</a> makes use of them for automatic annotation and data curation. Aether is a tool for analyzing Linked Data dynamics, <a href=\"https://github.com/rvagg/csv2\"> csv2whatever</a> is a tool for data transformations, and <a href=\"https://github.com/jiemakel/snapper\">Snapper </a>is a browser-based Turtle editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For linked data and ontology creation, publishing, and reuse, the Linked Data Finland platform is being developed further and is combined with various tools for a comprehensive Linked Data publishing service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Application prototypes being developed at the moment include <a href=\"http://www.seco.tkk.fi/publications/\">Semantic National Biography</a> for enriching and linking over 6300 of short life stories on the Semantic Web,<a href=\"http://www.ldf.fi/dataset/finlex\"> Semantic Finlex</a> for publishing and using Finnish legislation as a Linked Data service, and WarSampo for publishing historical datasets as Linked Data related to WW1 and WW2. We collaborate with historians in Stanford University, University of Oxford, and Colorado University Boulder regarding representing and visualizing history as Linked Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Web of Data, based on RDF and complicated semantics, requires collaboration and mutual agreements and standards between data publishers and users. When one creates data, one should also think, how it will link with the other parties’ data around, otherwise problems will arise later. Problems, that could have been prevented by collaboration and using a shared Semantic Web infrastructure and services. Albert Einstein’s saying “Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them” has been a motto in our work, aiming creating a sustainable, cross-domain Semantic Web infrastructure and applications in Finland, compatible with international developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like your work profiled in this column contact Gregory Markus at <a href=\"mailto:gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl\">gmarkus@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more open source tools see the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">FLOSS Inventory</a></p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Douglas Duhaime Developer Profile'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2015-01-22-whos-using-what-douglas-duhaime.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week’s “Who’s Using What” spotlight goes to <a href=\"http://douglasduhaime.com/\">Douglas Duhaime</a>; from the University of Notre Dame. Douglas’s research takes him to intersections of early modern natural philosophy and classical political economy in eighteenth-century literary works. Douglas has been pursuing the relationship between these two facets by using natural language processing techniques, running hand-written scripts on text data from <a href=\"http://eebo.chadwyck.com/home\">Early English Books Online</a>; (EEBO), <a href=\"http://gdc.gale.com/products/eighteenth-century-collections-online/\">Enlightenment Century Collections Online</a>; (EECO) and the <a href=\"http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/\">Philosophical Transactions</a>; looking to trace patterns in Enlightenment-era literary history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can follow Douglas on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/douglasduhaime\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/duhaime\">Github</a>, and DHcommons and gather more insight into his work on his <a href=\"http://douglasduhaime.com\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm currently working on a few different text mining projects, a few of which use libraries like <a href=\"http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/\">WEKA</a>; and <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>; for analysis and <a href=\"http://ggplot2.org/\">ggplot</a>; or <a href=\"https://github.com/mbostock/d3\">D3</a>; for visualization. Because a lot of my work revolves around natural language processing, tools like the <a href=\"http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml\">Stanford NLP Pipeline</a> , <a href=\"http://wordnet.princeton.edu/\">Princeton's WordNet</a>, and the <a href=\"http://snowball.tartarus.org/\">Snowball stemmer</a>; are standard resources. When working with early modern texts, I've also been using <a href=\"http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/vard/about/\">Vard2</a>; and the variant tables in the <a href=\"http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/\">MorphAdorner</a>; package for orthographical normalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A few of the tools I've built draw upon <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\">Selenium's</a>; browser automation framework--which handles well in Javascript and AJAX-rich environments--and <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Whoosh/\">Whoosh's</a>; full text indexing functions. Almost everything I write draws upon <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/\">Python's Natural Language Tool Kit</a>; and BeautifulSoup at some point. When working on applications that require fuzzy string matching, I like to use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html\">difflib</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm working with others in the University of Notre Dame's Text Mining Working Group to develop an open source web service capable of identifying literary allusions in user-provided texts. The prototype runs custom algorithms against an SQLite database with a Django back-end, and uses many of the text processing libraries discussed above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to see a library capable of estimating the likelihood that a given text contains one or more simple ciphers (substitution or null, for instance). Such a resource would be highly useful in certain contexts. I also eagerly await both the <a href=\"http://emop.tamu.edu/\">EMOP</a>; team's OCR engine for early modern typography and a package capable of achieving high sentiment classification scores on older prose. Both will be very valuable tools.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Rein van ''t Veer Developer Profile'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This week's Who's Using What Developer Profile spotlights Rein van 't Veer from the <a href=\"http://www.den.nl/english\">DEN Foundation</a> (Digital Heritage Netherlands, The Hague).</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2015-02-15-whos-using-what-rein-van-tveer.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rein specializes in location and heritage projects. His projects focus on archeology, the Semantic Web, Geographical Information Systems, Server Administration and Infrastructure, making use of Linux, Python, and Javascript. Rein was also formerly a field archaeologist. He has a research master's degree in archaeology from the University of Amsterdam. Let Rein tell you about the few but fantastic staple plus up and coming tools he's favoring. You can also check out his <a href=\"https://github.com/reinvantveer\">Github</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>##1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my work for the project <a href=\"http://erfgoedenlocatie.nl/\">Heritage &amp; Location</a> at <a href=\"http://www.den.nl/english\">DEN Foundation</a> (Digital Heritage Netherlands, The Hague) we focus more and more on Linked Data, and <a href=\"http://virtuos.openlinksw.com/dataspace/doc/dav/wiki/Main/\">Virtuoso Open Source</a> is my open-source RDF store of choice for the moment. I think it is the best-performing single-server open-source RDF store currently around, with a staggering amount of features. The open-source versions limited to only one processor, but the performance on that single thread is pretty impressive. I haven't really tried it to any real scale though.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd like to make a big shout out for <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>/<a href=\"http://postgis.net/\">PostGIS</a>, the best spatial database solution available. The interoperability with so many tools and stack solutions is a marvel, the possibilities are simply endless and I can still can't believe my luck that such a versatile and powerful software package is freely available. GeoServer is another extensive suite for exposing spatial data (in PostGIS for example) with well-established protocols and formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm really excited about the historical geocoding service we're developing with Waag Society and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands. It's based on <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">NodeJs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.elasticsearch.org/\">ElasticSearch</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/pelias/pelias\">Pelias</a>, fantastic emerging technology. Especially after seeing some of <a href=\"https://www.google.fr/search?q=douglas+crockford#=douglas+crockford&amp;tbm=vid\">Douglas Crockford's speeches on Youtube</a>, I found that there is a new development field with NodeJS that really takes advantage of the benefits of JavaScript. Eventually, we're developing our historical geocoding service as a means for archives, libraries, museums and other heritage institutions for them to be able to geocode placenames that are long lost. It's in its earliest development stage at the moment, but at the end of the project, we hope to provide a great enrichment service to the heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Spatial and semantic technologies are still too far apart - that's generally missing in the semantic web field at the moment: good performance and diverse functionality on the spatial front. I'm really looking forward to seeing continued development for <a href=\"https://jena.apache.org/\">Apache Jena</a>. It has been around for quite a while now and I've used it 'indirectly' with <a href=\"https://github.com/AKSW/Sparqlify\">Sparqlify</a>. I hope they keep up the improvements and extend the spatial functionality to full GeoSPARQ specs.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2015-03-20-whos-using-what-benjamin-rokseth.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this edition of “Who’s Using What?” we head north to Oslo where Benjamin Rokseth is working with The Digital Development Team at the Oslo Public Library. The <a href=\"https://www.deichman.no/side/in-english\">Oslo Public Library</a> is currently in a transitional phase as they prepare for the grand opening of what will be an <a href=\"http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/\">astonishingly beautiful building</a> on the Oslo waterfront. But with a beautiful new building comes the need for a progressive CMS and a new and improved way for local visitors and researchers as well as internationals alike seeking to access the library’s collection. The Oslo Public Library decided to make a big change their new library system on the well known OSS, <a href=\"http://www.koha.org/\">Koha</a>. You can read all about the transition in <a href=\"http://digital.deichman.no/blog/2015/01/12/working-with-koha-at-oslo-public-library/\">this fascinating piece</a>. Rokseth is an OS champion and for any library’s looking to make the switch from an old CMS to Koha, hopefully his answers and insights will provide some guidance. For more info you can investigate his personal <a href=\"https://github.com/bensinober\">Github</a> and the <a href=\"http://digital.deichman.no/\">Digital Development Team’s blog</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/digibib\">Github</a> .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>##1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, our public library is migrating from a proprietary library system to the community driven Koha, which is open source in all respects. The main focus for the present is on the development workflow and continuous integration, and in that respect we use <a href=\"http://jenkins-ci.org/\">Jenkins</a> as staging/integration tool and <a href=\"http://saltstack.com/\">SaltStack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a> for the entire deployment/setup process. For functionality testing we use <a href=\"https://cukes.info/\">Cucumber</a>, and <a href=\"http://watir.com/\">Watir</a> for browser testing. Everything neat and open source.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually, I have never used anything but open source, so the list would be too long to display. As long as there exists an open source alternative, it is to be preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. What are you currently developing?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the focus is on testing and continuous integration for the moment, we are not developing much at present. Mostly we focus on building APIs to integrate our various services to the Koha library system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. What would you like to see developed?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are strongly encouraging a move towards linked data (RDF) in the public sector, so we would like to see a growth in developnt of open source tools to propagate this move. There are numerous alternatives, but we have yet to see a clear open source alternative for working with bibliographic metadata.</p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What - Sebastian Hierl Developer Profile'
        posttype: News

        body: "<p><img src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2015-03-22-whos-using-what-Sebastian-Hierl.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being inspired by our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/whos-using-what-benjamin-rokseth/\">last Who's Using What column</a>, we are proud to welcome Dr. Sebastian Hierl from the American Academy in Rome to our growing community of FLOSSers. Before becoming <a href=\"http://www.aarome.org/it/news/features/dr-sebastian-hierl-new-drue-heinz-librarian\">Drue Heinz Librarian of the Arthur &amp; Janet C. Ross Library</a>, Dr. Hierl was responsible for developing the <a href=\"http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/widener/collections/western_european.cfm\">Widener Library’s Western European collections at Harvard University</a>. Hierl is a strong supporter of Koha as an ILS (integrated library system) for its web-based interface and flexibility as well as the strong and growing community of instituions and developers. So without further ado, Dr. Sebastian Hierl from the American Academy in Rome!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The institutions of the Koha Gruppo Italiano, composed of the <a href=\"http://www.aarome.org/\">American Academy in Rome</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aur.edu/\">The American University of Rome</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.pusc.it/\">Pontificia Università della Santa Croce</a>, all use the Open Source ILS, Koha. We are among an increasing number of <a href=\"http://www.kohagruppoitaliano.moonfruit.com/koha-in-italy/4588271863\">Koha libraries in Rome and throughout Italy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Principally, we implemented Koha in our libraries and contributed to the development of select features and the resolution of \"bugs.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently working with the Koha community and with <a href=\"https://www.ebscohost.com/\">EBSCO</a> on replacing the current Zebra search engine in Koha with <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\">ElasticSearch</a>. The community, under the leadership of <a href=\"http://bywatersolutions.com/\">ByWater Solutions</a>, aims at providing ElasticSearch as an alternate search engine, thus offering a choice to all Koha libraries between Zebra and ElasticSearch. (Read more about the collaboration <a href=\"https://www.ebsco.com/news-center/press-releases/koha-receives-massive-support-from-ebsco-for-enhancements\">here</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Italian Koha community, we would like to develop a search API integrating Koha with the Italian union catalogue, the <a href=\"http://www.sbn.it/opacsbn/opac/iccu/free.jsp\">OPAC catalogo SBN</a>, of the Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico delle biblioteche italiane e per le informazioni bibliografiche. Such an integration would dramatically increase interest in Koha as an Open Source ILS in Italy. It would help all current Koha libraries in Italy and strengthen the entire Koha community. We further would like to see greater integration of linked data with Koha and our hope is that the current development with ElasticSearch will foster this development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/boston_public_library/14668263631/\">The triumphal arch of Constantine, Rome, Italy</a> from Boston Public Library (No known copyright restrictions).</p>"

        featured: false
        intro: "<p>During the month of September we will present special \"Who's Using What?\" interviews with the development teams from three of the world's leading aggregators, protectors, and advocates for digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">DigitalNZ</a>, <a href=\"http://dp.la/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">DPLA</a>, and our very own <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>For any developer or institution currently working on, or planning to manage such massive digital collections and succesfully re-present them to the global public, these three development teams combined hold an unprecedent amount of expertise and they do it all while using open source software. Read here what tools these teams are favouring, what they've made for the world to improve upon and use, and what they hope to see in the future. Up first, Chris McDowall and the development team from DigitalNZ!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Chris McDowall and DigitalNZ</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Digital New Zealand logo\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/whos-using-what-dnzlogo.jpg\">The National Library of New Zealand's <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">DigitalNZ</a> team makes New Zealand's digital content available to find, share and use. Like Europeana, DigitalNZ aggregates metadata from many digital collections so it is available to search and also encourages the development of new discovery experiences through an <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org/developers\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">open API</a>. The team works with the collections from a wide range of organisations across the cultural sector, community groups, businesses and media organisations. It also brings in metadata relevant to New Zealand from Europeana and DPLA. DigitalNZ is almost eight years old and its most recent development is the release of <a href=\"http://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(64, 120, 192); text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;\">Supplejack</a>, an open source tool for aggregating, searching and sharing metadata records. Supplejack collects metadata about millions of items from hundreds of data sources. The tool transforms messy data, creates a unified search index and makes the reconciled metadata widely available via an open API data service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris McDowall is the manager of DigitalNZ Systems. He looks after the day to day running of the DigitalNZ infrastructure and coordinates feature development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a list of the main open source tools we use.

For any developer or institution currently working on, or planning to manage such massive digital collections and succesfully re-present them to the global public, these three development teams combined hold an unprecedent amount of expertise and they do it all while using open source software. Read here what tools these teams are favouring, what they've made for the world to improve upon and use, and what they hope to see in the future. You can read our previous piece with, Chris McDowall and the development team from DigitalNZ <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/who-s-using-what-chris-mcdowall-and-digitalnz-developer-profile\">here</a>. But up now, Bram Lohman and the Europeana Development Team!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/logo-english-horses-landscape.png\" style=\"width: 520px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Europeana Foundation</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This interview was submitted by Europeana Development Lead, Bram Lohman</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana team consists of around 10 developers, ranging from back-end developers to front-enders, a sys-admin and tester. Our main developments are the <a href=\"https://stackedit.io/europeana.eu\">Europeana Portal</a> and the home-grown ingestion system called <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/uim-europeana\">UIM</a> (based on the OSGI framework), as well as several other tools to support our business needs (such as <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/REPOX\">REPOX</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a>). All of these can be found on our <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana\">GitHub</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of our back-end is in <a href=\"https://java.com/en/\">Java</a>, and we have a <a href=\"https://www.javascript.com/\">JavaScript</a> front-end, but in the near future there are major changes underway that will see us using other languages, such as <a href=\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\">Ruby</a> and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-36\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-open-source-tools-are-you-currently-working-with\">What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To support our development process we use the ‘standard’ tools: <a href=\"https://jenkins-ci.org/\">Jenkins</a>, <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a>, <a href=\"http://junit.org/\">JUnit</a>, <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\">Apache Maven</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\">Selenium</a>, etc. The software itself uses <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>, <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Apache Solr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\">Apache Tomcat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cloudfoundry.org/index.html\">CloudFoundry</a>, <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\">JQuery</a>, and a slew of other tools, too many to name.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-37\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-open-source-tools-have-you-used-in-the-past-to-develop-larger-applications\">What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We moved from <a href=\"https://subversion.apache.org/\">Subversion</a> to Git a while back, and although each developer has their own preference a lot are using the <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse IDE</a>. There is a a shift towards <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/\">IntelliJ</a>, but these flavours of IDE tend to change with the seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-38\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-are-you-currently-developing\">What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re revamping the Europeana Portal, basing it on <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\">Blacklight</a>, which is written in Ruby. We’re also nearly moving the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> into a beta release, which uses <a href=\"https://storm.apache.org/\">Apache Storm</a>/<a href=\"https://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Apache Zookeeper</a>, <a href=\"http://cassandra.apache.org/\">Apache Cassandra</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/\">OpenStack Swift</a> amongst others.<br>\r\nWe’ve also “officialy” taken on REPOX (version 3 upwards, there are too many variations on earlier version to be able to support them), and have made major improvements on it. We’re integrating <a href=\"http://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a> in most of our software as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wmd-preview-section preview-content\" id=\"wmd-preview-section-39\">\r\n<h3 id=\"what-would-you-like-to-see-developed\">What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a keen interest in <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/package-summary.html\">Android</a> here, although we don’t do any development of it ourselves. We’ll soon be tackling our ingestion workflow system to leverage the Europeana Cloud, so any open-source tools we can re-use for that would be very welcome.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"

DPLA built their <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/developers/map/\">Metadata Application Profile</a> (MAP) off of Europeana’s EDM and have subsequently collaborated with Europeana on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-principles-for-establishing-international-interoperable-righ\">International Rights Statements</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/developing-and-implementing-a-technical-framework-for-interopera\">putting them into action</a>. But what drew me to the DPLA was something I heard at EuropeanaTech 2015 in Paris. There, DPLA Director Dan Cohen said in his wonderful presentation that the DPLA development team names all their tools after goats because “they’re curious and consume everything”. Well those sounded like developers I needed to talk to. So without further ado, read our interview with Mark Matienzo from the DPLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://matienzo.org/\">Mark Matienzo</a> is the Director of Technology for the Digital Public Library of America. Prior to joining DPLA, Matienzo worked as an archivist and technologist specialising in born-digital materials and metadata management, at institutions including the Yale University Library, The New York Public Library, and the American Institute of Physics. Matienzo received a MSI from the University of Michigan School of Information and a BA in Philosophy from the College of Wooster, and was the first awardee (2012) of the Emerging Leader Award of the Society of American Archivists.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the current development work we’re doing is built using <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\">Ruby on Rails</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a> database system, and <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Apache Solr</a> or <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elasticsearch</a> for indexing. For our metadata projects, such as to support ingestion and metadata enhancement, we’ve been using <a href=\"http://marmotta.apache.org/\">Apache Marmotta</a> as our triple store, and <a href=\"https://github.com/ActiveTriples/ActiveTriples\">ActiveTriples</a> to help with modeling RDF objects in Ruby code. We’re excited to start doing more with <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\">Blacklight</a> and <a href=\"http://projecthydra.org/\">Hydra</a> as well. We also use <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com/home\">Ansible</a> for deployment and automation, and <a href=\"https://www.redmine.org/\">Redmine</a> for tracking issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve used a variety of tools, including <a href=\"http://omeka.org/\">Omeka</a>, <a href=\"http://akara.info/\">Akara</a>, and some of the same previous tools mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All of DPLA’s current public projects are available on <a href=\"https://github.com/dpla\">our Github account</a>. Most of our work has been going towards <a href=\"https://digitalpubliclibraryofamerica.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/Heidrun\">Heiðrún</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dpla/KriKri\">Krikri</a> (parts of our new metadata ingestion system that’s been under development since October 2014). We’re also just beginning a project, called \"<a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2015/04/15/far-reaching-hydra-in-a-box-joint-initiative-funded-by-imls/\">Hydra in a Box</a>\", with Stanford University and DuraSpace, to develop a turnkey repository system built on the Hydra framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our largest need are high-performance storage and querying solutions for RDF data. We’re particularly excited about work going into <a href=\"http://linkeddatafragments.org/\">Linked Data Fragments</a>, but we’re hoping that there are more implementations that will be under way. We’d also like to see more convergence around developing shared metadata enhancement tools or common APIs for developing them, such as for geocoding and alignment of terms with authority files and vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the DPLA read Joris Pekel’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/looking-to-the-future-with-the-dpla-an-interview-with-dan-cohen\">interview with Dan Cohen from EuropeanaTech 2015</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Who''s Using What: Omeka'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Omeka is perhaps the most well known and widely used open-source web-publishing platform for libraries, museums, archives, and storytelling enthusiasts.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Just take a look at <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Sites_Using_Omeka\">their Wiki </a>of past exhibitions that have made use of Omeka, it's extensive. Europeana used it for their digital <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/art-nouveau-en\">Art Nouveau exhibition</a>. Omeka started life in 2008 at the <a href=\"https://chnm.gmu.edu/\">Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University and has been only getting better since. Let's see what tools the Omeka team are using to ensure that the platform is easy for others to build-upon, adapt and modify while retaining its strong core, and what their future plans are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This interview was submitted by Sharon Leon, Director of Public Projects at the Center for History and New Media and Director of Omeka. You can read more about Leon's work <a href=\"http://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/sleon\">here</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/omeka-page.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Open Source Tools Do You Use / Have You Used?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://omeka.org/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Omeka\">Omeka</a> relies on a number of underlying technologies. Most fundamentally, Omeka is built on the <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zend Framework</a>. It provides a lot of functionality for us to use things like routing requests, a structure for building themes and plugins, and a codebase that lets us work within an existing set of patterns. To the extent that we do a good job of adhering to those patterns, that makes an easier onramp for others to extend Omeka and suggest fixes and improvements to the core of Omeka. Currently, we also incorporate the <a href=\"http://www.tinymce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">tinyMCE</a> editor for our text/HTML inputs, and have moved toward using more of the established javascript and CSS libraries like <a href=\"http://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a> and <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SaSS</a>. As a big project, this lets us benefit from other FLOSS work focused on their own functionality, so we can concentrate on developing for the needs of our own user communitity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next generation of Omeka, <a href=\"https://github.com/omeka/omeka-s/wiki\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Omeka S\">Omeka S</a>, continues to use Zend Framework, but also incorporates newer tools like the <a href=\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html\" target=\"_blank\">Doctrine</a> ORM. Besides modernizing the codebase, this similarly allows us to use the efficiencies of Doctrine to improve our site performance and manage data relationships. One of the main goals of Omeka S is to improve data sharing between Omeka and other GLAM tools. Openness and interconnectedness, generally understood, is built into the design of Omeka S. To that end, we are relying heavily on Linked Open Data serialized as <a href=\"http://json-ld.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JSON-LD</a>, and basing our API on that. It is designed to be \"multisite\", meaning that one installation will support many distinct sites for different purposes, similar to a WordPress network installation. Different from a WordPress network, though, content is designed to be shared at a fundamental level to be shared between sites. Explicit RDF-based relationships between resources in Omeka S will be possible. To supplement the linked data implementation with Omeka S, we are also in the process of building modules to integrate a range of standardized vocabularies such as those offered by the Getty Research Institute and the Library of Congress. When it is available, we are also planning to offer a module that includes the recent DPLA/Europeana <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2015/10/06/whitepapers-for-establishing-international-and-interoperable-rights-statements-released/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"international rights statements\">international rights statements standard</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What would you like to see built?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We would love to see an open source Agile project management tool built on top of GitHub's API. Some (paid) services and products based on GitHub exist (<a href=\"https://waffle.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Waffle</a>, <a href=\"https://huboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HuBoard</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira\" target=\"_blank\">Jira</a> can connect with GitHub. But the right, magical balance of what works well for developers and what works well for project managers remains elusive. Full Agile information like user stories, story points, epics, backlog tracking, and burndowns is a significant layer on top of the developer-focused GitHub information of commit history, code review, and issue tracking. User testing tracking, documentation writing, and more involves the entire project team: coders, writers, and managers; and call for a tool in which everyone is equally comfortable working. Each product privileges either management needs or developer needs, and we have not yet found one that does not add pain-points for one group to remove them for another. We are fortunate at Omeka that the developer and project management groups are pretty fluid and conversant, and so we overcome those obstacles fairly easily. But we would still like a tool that removed the pain-points for everyone.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Now in its fourth year, the annual Europeana Licensing workshop was held on 25-26 November in Luxembourg. The workshop, organised by the Bibliotheque nationale de Luxembourg together with Kennisland and the Institute for Information Law of the University of Amsterdam, has become a central place for Europeana Network Association members to come together to discuss licensing issues and copyright policy and make sure everyone’s interests are aligned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/europeana-workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 309px;\">​<br><em>Workshop Participants, Europeana, CC BY-SA. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of this year’s workshop was to review the language of existing copyright policy, with a day dedicated to presentations on a number of projects in the field of licensing and rights clearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first day centred on copyright policy and was based on a discussion paper prepared by the workshop hosts exploring the potential of updating the existing copyright exceptions to make it easier for cultural heritage institutions to share their collections online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was an opportunity to discuss a solution other than, or even in addition to, <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/patrickp/4th-europeana-ws-lux-guibault-ecl?qid=b51d863f-b33b-466a-9e03-7bfe2fc48ee4&amp;v=default&amp;b=&amp;from_search=5\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Collective Licensing</a>, which has been the subject of the previous Europeana licensing workshops.

Against this backdrop, much of the first day of the workshop was devoted to discussing possible language for updated exceptions which would sufficiently represent the interests of the cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/1453715762_luxembourg.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 516px;\"><br><em>Luxembourg Ville Capitale du Duché du Mesme Nom, Nicolaes Jansz Visscher</em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92039/BibliographicResource_1000126238052.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Portugal</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a collaborative effort to review the existing language, the discussion paper was updated to reflect the feedback from the workshop participants. The updated discussion paper, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/Europeana_Licensing_Workshop/discussion-paper-luxembourg.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">which can be found here</a>, outlines the scope, beneficiaries and permissible acts of updated exceptions for cultural heritage institutions. As such, it gives a glimpse into how updated copyright rules could help to unlock the vast collections held by Europe's cultural heritage institutions whilst balancing the interests of rights holders to exploit works that are still important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day was an opportunity for those working on projects in the field of licensing and rights clearance to present their progress and also highlight the stumbling blocks along their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/\" target=\"_blank\">rightsstatements.org</a> project is <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/patrickp/4th-europeanawslux-keller-rightsstatementsorg?qid=b51d863f-b33b-466a-9e03-7bfe2fc48ee4&amp;v=default&amp;b=&amp;from_search=2\" target=\"_blank\">developing internationally interoperable standardized rights statements</a> for online cultural heritage.

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Emmanuelle Bermes'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Last year, we ran the Meet the Members Council blog series so you could hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better. In November, you elected seven further members to this Council, each of whom will introduce themselves via this blog in the coming weeks. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first got involved in Europeana long ago, when it was still in its infancy. In fact, Europeana as we know it hadn’t yet been established when, in a meeting room in Luxembourg, we talked about interoperability with colleagues who have since become friends. A couple of years later, we dreamt that Europeana wouldn’t be just another portal. Over a beer in a sunny spot in The Hague, we imagined a semantic network of information about people, events, works... that would give meaning to cultural data on the web. That’s how we started working on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came the time of projects, with their proposal submissions, work packages, deliverables, prototypes and so on. There were so many of them that organising and understanding their relationships became a challenge. Meanwhile <a href=\"http://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1239380998.gif\" target=\"_blank\">the portal grew richer</a> with new features, <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual exhibitions</a> and the aggregation of more and more data from institutions across Europe.<br><br>\r\nSo where are we today? The new version of the portal, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Collections</a>, has just launched. Though we have not yet achieved our original dream, we’ve made huge progress - and the portal, or the Collections site, is only the tip of the iceberg here.<br><br>\r\nFor me, Europeana’s greatest achievement isn’t just the aggregation of all this data (not that I’m saying that was easy!), but the huge boost it gave to the cultural community in Europe regarding the digitization of heritage. Countries or institutions where digitization wasn’t a priority yet began to obtain funding and start projects, and those who had already started shared not only their collections but their know-how and valuable expertise. The efforts were spread across domains - archives, libraries, museums, audiovisual institutions, and created awareness about the importance of interoperability of collections, even if the objects they contain are unique. Europeana also become an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-licensing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">influential voice on the importance of open data</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/europeanainfographic.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\"><br><br><a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/fr/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s strategy</a> has evolved to move closer to a shared digital infrastructure who serves both professionals from European institutions and the wider public. With Linked Open Data, <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">diverse types of re-use</a> have become as important as the main site itself. The ambition is to share data processing tools, and the means to enrich, transform and preserve data, thus empowering smaller institutions that don’t have the means to do it by themselves.<br><br>\r\nFinally, Europeana has become <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network\" target=\"_blank\">a network, and a real community</a>. This community shares its expertise - whether <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/\">professional</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-tech\">technical </a>or <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">scientific</a> - but also its motivation and involvement in making European culture available to everyone thanks to the digital revolution. Building and leading a community is a difficult and sometimes thankless task, but it also allows ideas to be born, to mature and to progress - even leading to projects and achievements that will transform more than just our own business and communities. Transform the world with culture - that’s Europeana’s aim.<br><br>\r\nWe can’t forget that Europeana grew out of a political idea - it still has the power, thanks to the energy behind it, to influence in favour of cultural policies in the states of Europe. I sincerely believe that, without Europeana, we would not be where we are today in terms of digital access to culture. That’s the main reason I wanted to be <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/sign-up\" target=\"_blank\">part of the Network Association</a>, and why I applied to join the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/our-network/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Members Council</a>. Now I’ve been elected, I’m delighted to have the opportunity to take part in the future of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A version of this post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://figoblog.org/2015/10/31/europeanaelects/\" target=\"_blank\">Emmanuelle's own blog</a>. </em></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Portugal'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher looks at highlights in the nominations from Portugal. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Portugal, the Director-General of the <a href=\"http://www.patrimoniocultural.pt/en/\">Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage</a> (DGPC) was responsible for the selection of all pieces of art for the Europeana 280 campaign, including paintings, manuscripts and gravure from eight museums, libraries and archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many other countries, Portugal has nominated art that reflects different times in its own national history, including the era when its fleets sailed out to create one of the world’s first (and largest) global empires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the ‘Age of Discovery’, from the 15th to 18th centuries, extensive overseas forays had a powerful impact on many European cultures. Portuguese explorers journeyed down the coast of Western Africa, to the Cape of Good Hope, they discovered a new sea route to India, they reached Brazil, and in the 16th century, China and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A selection from the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisboa provides a link to those days of epic journeys in a painting curator Maria João Vilhena describes as: “A major work of highly symbolic importance in Portuguese culture and a unique ‘group portrait’ in the history of European painting.” Six panels with 58 figures, attributed to Nuno Gonçalves (active 1450-1491), royal painter of King Alfonso V, show a solemn and monumental gathering of representatives of the Court and the various strata of Portuguese society at the time. The figures are grouped around two depictions of Saint Vincent, in an act of veneration of the patron saint, the inspiration behind the military expansion in the Maghreb [in Africa].</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-01/portugal280image.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 242px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Lion's Group – a set of artists, writers and intellectuals – regularly met in a Lisbon downtown restaurant called Leão de Ouro to discuss aesthetic issues and naturalism. Painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, an artist nominated by Portugal for Europeana 280, is the man with a top hat on his head, beard and spectacles, posing with a stick under his arm, seemingly about to leave the scene. Image: O Grupo do Leão, Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/02030/MatrizNet_Objectos_ObjectosConsultar_aspx_IdReg_200764.html\" target=\"_blank\">Museu do Chiado-Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea</a>​, CC0.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, it was Napoleon who was on the march for new territories. Conflicts on Iberian soil are reflected in a nomination from the National Library (Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal / Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga). An engraving by Gregório Francisco de Queirós, after a composition by Domingos António Sequeira, reflects the time of the Peninsular war when the city of Lisbon provided a soup kitchen for those who had fled from invading French forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the late 19th century, Portuguese painters, along with many other artists in Europe, were absorbing France’s artistic forces. The selection from realist Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro from the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado, was exhibited at the Salon de Paris in 1882. After his return to Lisbon, he was a lecturer at the school of fine arts, became a director of the museum of modern arts, and was fully engaged in intellectual and republican circles. He was commissioned to produce three official portraits of the first Presidents of the Republic and was also on the committee responsible for deciding on the design and colours of the Portuguese national flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more contemporary Portuguese in Paris is abstractionist Vieira Da Silva who was born in Lisbon but adopted French citizenship in 1956. In her early travels (her father was a diplomat), she was exposed to many artistic influences. The selection from Centro de Arte Moderna - Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian illustrates the transforming power of culture, according to curator Rui Afonso Santos in the description for this image: “The title of this magnificent painting [A Biblioteca em fogo] is, in a certain sense, metaphorical, and may allude to the burning of the Library of Alexandria and, above all, the passion and firing of the imagination and reason that reading awakens”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether we are making journeys into our souls, or remembering voyages to the other side of the world, we hope to make many other discoveries in Europeana 280.</p>"

        title: 'Out of a skip and on to Europeana? 3500 historic photos of British pubs saved'

        body: "<p>A skip full of rubbish isn't an obvious place to start sifting for cultural heritage. It was here, however, that Robert Humphreys, an employee of Charrington Brewery, found a unique archive of photographs of British pubs. Dumped during an office move, the fascinating photographs were saved by Humphreys and given to a local museum for safekeeping. They are now part of a UK-wide project being run by our friends <a href=\"http://www.historypin.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Historypin</a> and, thanks to <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Food and Drink</a>, they will soon be available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what happened inbetween? We talk to Historypin's Lise Schauer to hear more about this serendipitous story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/antwerp-arms.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 447px;\"><br><em>The Antwerp Arms, Tottenham, Charrington Surveyors CC BY-SA. Image via <a href=\"http://www.historypin.org/en/a-history-of-pubs/hoare-co/geo/51.49327,-0.115985,11/bounds/51.32173,-0.254344,51.664166,0.022374/paging/1/pin/658740\" target=\"_blank\">Historypin</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you first hear about this unusual set of photographs? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We first heard about the photographs when we were introduced to Robert Humphreys, who is a trustee of the National Brewery Heritage Trust, through a mutual acquaintance. Intrigued, we then went up to the National Brewery Centre in Burton-on-Trent to have a look at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as we saw them, we knew that we had to get them accessible and visible - they were just so amazing! So first, the images were digitized by our friends at Heritage Assets, and then we uploaded them to our crowdsourcing platform Historypin.org. All the photos can be viewed on <a href=\"http://www.historypin.org/pubs\" target=\"_blank\">www.historypin.org/pubs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We're now in the process of publishing all of the images on Europeana as part of the Europeana Food and Drink project so they become even more widely discoverable as well as reusable (they will be available under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-SA</a> licence). We're really excited to share them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us a bit about them. What do the photos show?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were stunned by the quality of the photos - they are so sharp even though some of them were taken more than 100 years ago. They mostly depict the outside of pubs owned by Charrington, and focus on architectural details as the company used them as reference materials when they refurbished pubs. Some photographs have people or vehicles in them, while others show the damage done by bombs in the Second World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photographs are all mounted on card, and their backs are just as interesting as their fronts. Because this was an archive used for running a business, the backs of the photos feature the amount of beer, wine and spirits sold in each pub per year, as well as the rent and the name of the licensee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Charrington collection is a great example of a high quality cultural heritage asset. Not only are the photos visually beautiful, they also give us a glimpse of what life was really like in the past. The annotations on their backs give us insight into social history as well. Collections like these really spark people’s imagination!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The story’s a great example of how the past, when opened up to everyone online, comes to life all over again, and the story has even been picked up by news outlets (on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35031879\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a> and ITV)! </strong><strong>Did the attention the story attracted surprise you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The response to the story has been absolutely amazing. We were not expecting this much media attention, so we were very happy to be able to share the collection with a wider audience. It looks like the ‘saved from a skip’ angle is very evocative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/news-fooddrink.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 222px;\"><br><em>Lise talks about the project on ITV News. Image: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foodanddrink_eu/status/691536297249349632\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Food and Drink</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The photographs are part of a broader project focused on pubs that’s part of Europeana Food and Drink. How’s that going? You recently published a fascinating book, <em>London Local Pubs: Past and Present</em>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to work with the Charrington collection has been instrumental for us in testing the hypothesis that digital cultural heritage can act as a catalyst for creative and commercial success - the main aim of the Europeana Food and Drink project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historypin is leading the Work Package on Public Engagement for Europeana Food and Drink, and together with our consortium partners we are trying to show the potential of Europe’s heritage to creative and commercial organisations, in order to generate economic benefits and to sustain partnerships across the non-profit and for-profit sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/londonlocalpubs-book.jpg\" style=\"width: 329px; height: 498px;\"><br><em>London Local Pubs: Past and Present, Adrian Tierney-Jones. Image: <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/applications/book/london-local-pubs-past-and-present/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Food and Drink</a></em>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe book, <em>London Local Pubs: Past and Present</em>, is one of the ways we are doing this. The 52 pubs featured in the book were chosen from the Charrington collection and are all still spaces for their communities to meet and mingle. To support this theme, Historypin has organised storytelling sessions in 10 of the pubs to gather photographs and memories about the unique nature of each of these places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book is only one of nine commercial products that have been built as part of Europeana Food and Drink using Europeana’s digital cultural heritage. From apps to educational materials, you can see all the products <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next for the project? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now working hard on evaluating the success of the Europeana Food &amp; Drink project and the London Local Pubs book, so we can draw up lessons and recommendations. In the meantime, we will continue to promote the book and the other products, and we hope they give people a taste of the digital cultural heritage Europeana has to offer!</p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Spain'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.<br><br>\r\nHere, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Spain about their nominations. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</strong><br><br>\r\nSome of the world’s greatest art is Spanish. Masterpieces such as the 17th century royal household captured by court painter Velázquez, or the ground-breaking portrayal of the horrors of war by Goya, another painter by royal appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But like many countries nominating their treasures for the Europeana 280 campaign, the opportunity to select images within a national context has led to some fascinating and unexpected choices. How did Spain go about choosing its selection for Europeana 280?<br><br>\r\nDiego Gracia, Head of International Library Cooperation, Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports, coordinated the nominations and describes a thorough process: “Spain's rich artistic heritage encompasses a wide variety of domains so we felt it was important that not only materials from museums were part of the selection, but also material from archives and libraries. With this in mind, we set up a committee with experts from those three areas that would have a perfect knowledge of the most singular items from their fields.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Art through the ages</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Encompassing a significant stretch of history was a strong motivating factor. “We wanted to cover the longest period of time possible and tried to distribute the items evenly throughout time,” continues Gracia.<br><br>\r\nSpain’s selections begin with the cave paintings of Altamira, created many thousands of years ago. The depth of art history must have been a daunting challenge for selectors, particularly choosing a single painting from renowned artists with a huge body of work. What was the brief for artists whose work is held in museums?<br><br>\r\n“We valued above other characteristics the fact that the pieces were representative of painters or artistic movements that had an importance beyond Spanish borders and had an impact in the history of art worldwide”, explains Gracia. “We chose emblematic painters and pieces from them that would be a compendium of those features that best define their style (that’s the case with Dalí and Goya).”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/spain-280.jpg\" style=\"width: 394px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>María Luisa de Borbón esposa de Carlos IV Rey de España, Francisco Goya, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022701/oai_bivaldi_gva_es_6532.html\" target=\"_blank\">Biblioteca Valenciana</a>, public domain.<br><br>\r\nFrom 1786 to 1824, artist Francisco de Goya was appointed painter to the Spanish court. He served four successive monarchs including Charles IV, whose wife is depicted here, and Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother), who inserted himself on the throne after France's successful invasion of Spain. The emblematic painting of the Spanish war for independence is the Goya selection for Europeana 280.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases it wasn’t necessarily the predictable choice. “Sometimes the nominated work of art is not the most famous one from an artist. An example of this would be Ribera. The work selected (The Pietá, from the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza) was chosen because it shows the interaction of the European artistic movements in the Kingdom of Naples.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish painter and etcher Jusepe de Ribera (1591-1652) settled in Naples (then part of the Spanish Empire) in his twenties. In the 1630s, Ribera’s style underwent a transformation and he began to work with a lighter palette. The change evident in his use of colour was probably influenced by the presence in Naples of works by Flemish painters such as Rubens and Van Dyck and by the work of artists such as Pietro Novelli, who was familiar with the work of Van Dyck and of Giovanni Lanfranco.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From royal courts to the rearguard</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The power of twentieth century graphical work is also covered in an award winning poster promoting tourism in the 1920s and an unusual nomination from the time of the Spanish Civil War. The Cartilla Escolar Antifascista and Cartilla Aritmética Antifascista are educational primers in which learning is mixed with political ideology and maths lessons illustrated with bullets and tanks. Originally published by the Ministerio de Instrucción Pública (Ministry of Public Instruction) in 1937, the Cartillas are going to be republished later this year.<br><br>\r\nThey are an example of socialist art that originated in the USSR that had a great repercussion in other European countries, according to Gracia: “The context in which the Cartillas were created is the literacy initiatives that the Republic took under their governance and also during the civil war - a whole corps of the republican army formed by two units: the Militias of Culture, consisting of teachers and writers (such as María Teresa León, Miguel Hernández and Rafael Alberti) that operated in the front line, and the Brigades against Illiteracy, working in the rearguard which were dedicated to provide literacy to the soldiers during the war.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Gracia: “This experience is unique, no other army has ever undertaken such an initiative.”<br><br>\r\nWe look forward to sharing the empowering and transforming art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon.

        title: 'Europeana aligns with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>One of Europeana's main goals is to make it easier for institutions and individuals in the digital heritage sector to share better quality digital content - you can learn more in our recently published <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) has huge potential to help us achieve this goal. If you’re not familiar with it, IIIF is a standard for serving and consuming high quality images online, with the ability to instruct a server about the desired resolution, or image manipulations such as rotation and zooming. It also makes it more straightforward to publish complex aggregations of images, for instance bringing together a <a href=\"http://demos.biblissima-condorcet.fr/chateauroux/osd-demo/\" target=\"_blank\">medieval manuscript text and an illumination that was stripped away from it</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/biblissima-1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 331px;\"><br><em>IIIF in action: in this screenshot from a Biblissima project demos, the illumination comes from the BnF's Département des Estampes, while the mutilated manuscript belongs to a different collection - that of the Bibliothèque municipale de Châteauroux. Image: CC-BY <a href=\"http://demos.biblissima-condorcet.fr/chateauroux/osd-demo/\">Biblissima project</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana hopes to promote the adoption of the IIIF technology by demonstrating its value and, from a more technical perspective, by making Europeana's own technical stack (including the Europeana Data Model and the Europeana Collections portal) more interoperable with IIIF implementation initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/david-haskiya\" target=\"_blank\">David Haskiya</a> talked more about this at the recent IIIF Conference ‘Access the world's images’, a day that has been covered in detail by our friends at Sound and Vision in <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/blog/access-worlds-images-iiif-meetup-ghent-2015\" target=\"_blank\">another blog post</a>. David's slides can be accessed in the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8APFBow4sHvYUdpS2FMcE9hclk\" target=\"_blank\">presentation folder</a> for the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that wasn’t all that was IIIF-related in Ghent that week: a series of other, more detailed meetings also took place, and again, Europeana played an active role. If you’d like to know more about these, there are minutes available for the different parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/iiif_ghent_roundtable\" target=\"_blank\">community roundtable</a> and more demos and lightning talks, working on priorities ahead for the IIIF community</li>\r\n    <li>an <a href=\"http://bit.ly/iiif_ghent_friday\" target=\"_blank\">unconference</a>, where we began to dive deeper into some of the selected issues</li>\r\n    <li>a specific <a href=\"http://bit.ly/iiif_ghent_newspaperig\" target=\"_blank\">session on IIIF and Newspapers</a>, co-chaired by Karen Estlund from Penn State University and Europeana's Alastair Dunning.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Alongside these, many other informal discussions took place. An important one for us focused on the issue of how Europeana data providers could better reference IIIF resources in the EDM metadata they send to us, and this has been captured on <a href=\"https://github.com/IIIF/iiif.io/issues/558#issuecomment-170408142\">IIIF's issue discussion space on Github</a>. As with many breakthrough discussions, intensive use of diagrams (and, to a smaller extent, drinks!) helped different experts reach a satisfying consensus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/iiif-brainstorm.jpg\" style=\"width: 448px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Sketch model from a discussion on EDM and IIIF at IIIF Ghent meeting. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1969268/12224602/a6ace814-b7ed-11e5-9b12-9c55012214c4.jpg&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1454927432576000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFD2F_RPy_N2DiicTti2vvzxF40A\" target=\"_blank\">Glen Robson</a>, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several week later, and we have now published a deliverable from the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Cloud project</a> (available <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D4.4%20Recommendations%20For%20Enhancing%20EDM%20to%20Support%20Research%20Oriented%20Content.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) that fully documents the data exchange problems and modelling options we discussed during and around the Ghent events. Europeana Cloud provided an excellent context for better aligning Europeana with IIIF as it brought together providers of IIIF images and aims to develop IIIF services for the Europeana environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deliverable, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D4.4%20Recommendations%20For%20Enhancing%20EDM%20to%20Support%20Research%20Oriented%20Content.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Recommendations for enhancing EDM for representing digital content</a>, proposes data modelling solutions for representing digital objects (such as images) and full-text with a particular focus on Newspapers resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work was based on case studies from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Library and the <a href=\"http://newspapers.library.wales/\" target=\"_blank\">Welsh Newspapers</a> from the National Library of Wales. In this report we first propose modelling solutions to link a cultural heritage object (CHO) to its digital representation(s). In this context, a particular focus is put on the interoperability with the IIIF protocol, as more and more Europeana Network members have adopted it or are thinking about adopting it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to align EDM to the solutions defined by the IIIF community and therefore extend EDM with the required classes and properties. A similar approach was taken for proposing solutions to represent full text. In order to maximise interoperability with ongoing efforts in other communities we decided to follow the data modelling solutions from both the Web Annotation Data Model and the IIIF protocol. We therefore propose to model full-text in EDM as an annotation on a given digital representations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these data modelling proposals will have to be further discussed and validated by the IIIF and the Web Annotation communities. We also hope that the collection of new cases studies will help us further explore the challenges offered by full-text resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in contributing to these efforts, please let us know by contacting us.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Slovakia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.<br><br>\r\nHere, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Slovakia about their nominations. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</strong><br><br>\r\nIdentifying treasures in a collection and finding new ways for people to engage with culture are challenges faced by every museum, especially in a digital age. But, wondered our colleagues in Slovakia, in twenty years time would it be the same treasures as those we pick now?<br><br>\r\nSo how did the country go about making their selection for Europeana 280? The Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic asked the Slovak National Gallery to coordinate the nominations. The concept of national masterpieces is something they give a lot of thought to in their own collections.<br><br>\r\n“The selection is partly based on the exhibition and catalogue <em>111 Works of Art from the Collection</em> - a ‘best of’ from the collections of the Slovak National Gallery (SNG) - with an additional painting from the Central Slovakian Gallery”, explains Michal Čudrnák – Head of Digital Collections and Services, who coordinated the process at the Slovak National Gallery. But it could be a different selection in twenty years time, according to the curator of the 111 exhibition, Dušan Buran: “Just as art itself develops, our knowledge of art also changes and the criteria for a ‘masterpiece’ are also subject to constant change.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Slovak art in an international context</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Slovakian nominations are an exceptionally wide-ranging selection covering art from many different periods, from Gothic art of the 15th century to conceptualism in the 1960s and 1970s. According to Michal Čudrnák, it was designed to place the Slovak collections in an international context: “The selection incorporates works from the old art collection, which can compete with the collections of foreign museums and galleries - if not in terms of quantity, definitely in terms of quality.” An example is a work by specialist bird and flower painter Jakob Bogdan. He left upper Hungary (now part of Slovakia), in the 1670s for Amsterdam and then moved to London, initially in connection with the coronation of the Statdholder William of Orange (for whom he worked) as King of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/slovakia-280.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 489px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Zápas kohútov (1706/1710), Jakub Bogdan, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/07101/O_2.html\" target=\"_blank\">Slovak National Gallery</a>, CC BY.</em><br><em>After moving to London, Jakub Bogdan’s big break was his involvement in the decoration of Hampton Court from 1691-1694. He painted many pictures of birds, probably inspired by the famous aviary of his well-connected patron Admiral George Churchill, at Windsor. The selection for Europeana 280 was originally painted for Churchill. </em><br><br>\r\nIt was also important to incorporate work from the modern and contemporary art collection: “paintings from our iconic modernist artists Ľudovít Fulla and Miloš Alexander Bazovský, and conceptualists like Rudolf Sikora and Július Koller,” he continues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Watching over a nation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ľudovít Fulla (1902-1980) is one of Slovakia’s most important creative figures and his work is central to Slovakian modernism. The theme of the Madonna with a child depicted in the Ľudovít Fulla selection from the Slovak National Gallery is a frequent motif in the work of Slovak modernist artists. As the curator of the collection of modern and contemporary art Katarína Bajcurová notes about the use of the Madonna and child motif, it can be highly symbolic: “A mother with a child becomes a Madonna associated with being ‘Slovak’ so that she not only metaphorically watches over the fates of individuals, but also the entire nation.”<br><br>\r\nWhat is Michal Čudrnák most looking forward to in the Europeana 280 collection? “It will be interesting to see our paintings in that context. Where the stylistic and historical perspectives with other collections overlap and where they diverge”. The SNG keep an eye on the global context of their own collections already: “Our online collection website <a href=\"http://www.webumenia.sk\" target=\"_blank\">Web umenia</a> (edited by Lukáš Štepanovský), enables us to see the paths a selection of our artworks are taking online and sometimes they can be quite unexpected and illuminating.”<br><br>\r\nIn an exhibition currently running at the SNG, visitors can have fun digitally ‘painting’ a Madonna created by another modernist, Mikuláš Galanda. “In its playful way, it exemplifies the democratisation of access to art and cultural heritage,” suggests Michal Čudrnák, “just as our institutions strive to publish high-resolution images of work in the public domain.”<br><br>\r\nWe look forward to sharing (as widely as possible) more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Seven keys to unlocking digital heritage for use in education'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>There is a wealth of digital heritage available online. World renowned galleries, archives, museums and libraries provide online access to their collections, and many local initiatives make digital heritage more widely available. As access to the internet improves, and more people own smartphones and other similar devices, these collections can be accessed online by students and educators with fewer and fewer technological barriers. So far, however, this has failed to lead to the improvements in education you might expect. Why is this? And what can be done to unlock the potential for the (re)-use of digital heritage in education?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To answer these questions, the “Europeana Taskforce for Education” - a cross-domain group of professionals working in the field of digital heritage and education - was set up. Here, we present their conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/education-tf-x600.jpeg\" style=\"text-align: -webkit-center; width: 473px; height: 600px;\"><br style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\"><em style=\"text-align: -webkit-center;\">The Drawing Lesson, Abraham van Strij, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_396.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendations are presented in the form of seven keys to unlock the potential for re-use of digital heritage in education:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevance</strong> of digital heritage for educational purposes. Collections should be used to enable specific learning outcomes.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Discoverability</strong> of digital heritage. For digital heritage to be easily found, ensure metadata includes search terms that educators and students use.</li>\r\n    <li>There is sufficient <strong>context</strong> information about the source, for instance, essential information such as maker, author, date, translation.</li>\r\n    <li>The source is of sufficient <strong>quality</strong> (e.g. texts are readable, essential details visible).</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Copyright</strong> allows for re-use. It must be legally possible to use the digital heritage in open educational research that can be shared.</li>\r\n    <li>Easy and reliable <strong>access</strong>: the sources can be used beyond where they are found, for example through direct links or embed functions, and links don't change.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Interoperability</strong>: use via different learning platforms is possible, e.g. the standards used in the digital collections are are interoperable.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>Significant investments are needed in order to create these conditions, and business models [1] are lacking. In addition, a variety of key stakeholders must be involved, and their interests are sometimes conflicting. [2]</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How can educators help cultural institutions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Content providers - the cultural institutions with collections to share - are not the only ones that can help stimulate the re-use of digital heritage in education. Educators have an important role to play as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin, they can work with content providers to identify the items in their collections that have great potential for educational purposes. They can then outline what kind of extra information they’d like to see added for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In return, it is good practice to always acknowledge the cultural institutions that have opened up their collections so that students know where items come from.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What have we already learned?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no clear-cut answers to removing all these barriers, but there are lessons learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana for Education Task Force has started to collect information about what different stakeholders promoting the re-use of digital heritage in education have tried so far. These case studies either emphasise the problems that they tried to solve, or the conditions for re-use that they hope to create. These will be published on Europeana Pro using the hashtag #Europeana4Education.<br><br>\r\nThe case studies we plan to share need to be understood in their current context. The changing nature of education and technology [3] means we will need to regularly update information so they should be seen as working documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Future directions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The case studies collected so far are the result of two international meetings bringing together specialists from digital heritage and education, and working in museums, archives, NGO’s, local and national providers. This collection only scratches the surface of the experiences that are out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the complications are great, the potential benefits are high, and because the challenges are unlikely to be solved quickly, it is important to continue to share examples, learn from them and help one another avoid mistakes.<br><br>\r\nWe invite you to share your experiences and lessons learned in the re-use of digital heritage in education using <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana%20Network%20Task%20Forces/Related_documents/template-europeana4education-blogs-final.docx\" target=\"_blank\">the template</a> that the Europeana Taskforce for Education has developed.<br><br>\r\nYou can also help the #Europeana4Education community by advocating for change using the Europeana Recommendations for Education and Learning (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\" target=\"_blank\">download them here</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please contact <a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu\">Milena Popova</a> or <a href=\"http://steven@euroclio.eu\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Stegers</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Europeana%20Network%20Task%20Forces/Related_documents/template-europeana4education-blogs-final.docx\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/download-button.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 35px;\"></a>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>1. Business models are lacking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investments are needed for the development of digital learning resources, but it is difficult to create returns on these. Depending on the type of educational re-use, investments can include web-development, quality control, curation, and copyright clearance. Educators are often pressed for time so providers of educational resources, even those that are free, must be able show the educational value of their product almost instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, investment in digital learning resources lags behind investment in hardware and printed learning resources. As a result, the most common business model for the provision of digital learning resources is institutional support (by organisations willing to make investments in quality educational resources because this fits their mission or because of the social value this creates).<br><br><strong>2. Conflicts of interest</strong><br><br>\r\nOne challenge for creating a fertile environment for the re-use of digital heritage in education is the conflicts of interest that exist between stakeholders and within institutions. In the case of copyright regulations, a balance needs to be found to create access to culture in education while protecting the rights of cultural producers. A similar dilemma is posed by opening of collections an institution increases its visibility, but at the same time loses a level control over its collection. It is our aim in these blog posts to share the different ways organisations are dealing with these conflicting interests in practice.<br><br><strong>3. The changing nature of education and technology</strong><br><br>\r\nA recurring challenge for the re-use of digital heritage in education is the changing nature of both education and technology. These occur naturally: both education and technology providers are always looking for ways to improve. In practice this means that some services are no longer supported.</p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Bulgaria'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over the next weeks we'll be discovering a little bit more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.</strong><br><br><strong>Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Bulgaria. We’ll start sharing the nominated works from each country soon - so stay tuned!</strong><br><br>\r\nIn making their nominations for Europeana 280, several countries have included a treasure from a different country that has taken an interesting route into their own national collections. It’s a reminder that collectors and patrons play a significant role in the world of art and the paintings we can see today on the walls of Europe’s museums and galleries. How did Bulgaria make its selection for Europeana 280?<br><br>\r\nBulgaria’s nominations were from several institutions and include contributions to Slavic and European culture with Cyrillic texts and manuscripts from different periods, as well as paintings from the end of the 19th century and 1920s. Elitsa Terzieva, expert at the National Gallery, explains how they came up with a list: “We chose examples that best illustrated different stages of the evolution of Bulgarian art. Also artists that are known and that, at some point, worked abroad.”<br><br>\r\nBulgaria’s modern art heritage is relatively recent. After five centuries of being part of the Ottoman or Turkish Empire, Bulgaria gained independence in 1878. When it was newly established, private collectors played a significant role in boosting cultural development. Industrialists and civil servants purchased and displayed work by French, German, Austrian, Italian and English artists. A key collector (and later, donator) was Prince Ferdinand, a sybaritic member of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty with members of its clan scattered around the royal courts of Europe. That’s how an iconic work by German symbolist Franz von Stuck came into the collection of the National Art Gallery in Sofia.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Royal donations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum provided more details of the provenance: “The painting Lucifer was purchased personally by the Bulgarian Prince Ferdinand I in 1891 for the Royal Collection, when he visited the artist's studio in Munich. On December 25th 1930, the painting was donated by the Bulgarian King Boris III to the National Museum in Sofia and entered its collection. Around 1948 the painting was transferred to the recently founded National Art Gallery, Sofia.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franz von Stuck was one of the co-founders of the Munich Secession of 1892 and a teacher at the Munich Academy. His work runs parallel to that of Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud who were all interested in the desires and anxieties of the human psyche. As an artist, his painting output was not huge, as Elitsa Terzieva pointed out: “Franz von Stuck has produced few works and it's really exceptional to own one.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/280bulgaria.jpeg\" style=\"width: 344px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>International Kunst-Ausstellung Münchens (Secession), Franz Stuck, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_2000081569601.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>, PDM. A group of artists split from the Munich Artists’ Association in 1892 and formed a cooperative to promote and defend their art against what they saw as conservative and restrictive attitudes such as firm opposition to impressionism, expressionism, symbolism and other contemporary trends. Franz von Stuk was a co-founder of the Munich Secession. His iconic painting Lucifer has been nominated for Europeana 280 by Bulgaria, as a treasure in their collections.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expressionist master</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A homegrown hero is Vladimir Dimitrov–Maystora (1882-1960), one of Bulgaria’s most renowned artists. Dimitrov studied and graduated from the Fine Arts Academy in Sofia. In his student years he visited Russia and Italy and all its key locations for art – Rome, Florence, Venice and Naples. He was a war painter in both Balkan wars and the First World War, and for a period in the 1920s, was sponsored by the American collector, John Crane. This gave him the financial means to travel widely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In later years he chose to give away money and possessions, never shaving, becoming vegetarian, and somewhat messianic. He was a delegate to the World Peace Councils in Warsaw, Paris and London from 1948-1950. The Europeana 280 selection, a painting from travels in Istanbul and Syracuse from the National Gallery Sofia, created a stir when it was first exhibited as it showed artistic directions that had not yet been encountered in Bulgarian art.<br><br>\r\nDimitrov was at the forefront of a literary and artistic movement in the 1920s and 30s that attempted to create art with pure Bulgarian character with its soul in rural life. Art that was ‘pure, pious and compelling’ according to critic and painter Kiril Tzonev. Also dominant in the interwar period in the 1920s and 1930s was the gradual Europeanization of culture. Kiril Tzonev was part of the Munich-based German modernist realist art movement– Neue Sachlichkeit (new objectivity). His portrait of the painter Eliezer Alshekh is painted in this manner.<br><br>\r\nWe look forward to sharing more insightful art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon.

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Marco de Niet'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Today we re-introduce one of our Members Council representatives, who has just rejoined the Council.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Back to the beginning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My involvement with Europeana goes back to the very beginning of European collaboration among cultural heritage\_institutions on the web. As a staff member of the research department of the National Library of the Netherlands, I was involved in the creation of Gabriel, the shared web service of the National Libraries of Europe, which was launched in 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gabriel became The European Library, which laid the foundation for the European Digital Library, which ultimately became Europeana. In 1999 Gabriel hosted one of the first European digital heritage exhibitions: Treasures of the National Libraries of Europe. A kind of precursor to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=96&amp;view=grid\">Europeana 280</a>, you might say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshot of Gabriel\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/gabriel.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the Gabriel website</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through Gabriel I also got involved in collaboration among European museums and I was fascinated by the differences and similarities in digitisation practices. While libraries were beginning to think about mass digitisation, museums had already put thought into the marketing side of building digital services, for instance in relation to tourism.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>DEN building</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006 I got the opportunity to start working for the Digital Heritage Netherlands Foundation (the Dutch abbreviation is DEN), of which I became the director in 2007. DEN is a government-funded organisation to support all cultural heritage institutions to help them improve their digital strategies and services. Working at DEN I constantly looked for opportunities to build cross-domain connections, especially among archives, libraries and museums, and promoted open standardisation in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At DEN I also helped to shape the work on Digital Culturel Heritage Statistics in Europe, a.o. as core partner of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enumerate\">ENUMERATE project</a>. After the project end, Europeana kindly offered to include the ENUMERATE Framework in Europeana DSI. While the Europeana Pro Dashboard shows the statistics of the 'inner world' of the Europeana service, the ENUMERATE surveys map the developments in all European countries and show Europeana’s potential for growth. And as ENUMERATE also addresses the use of digital heritage collections, we also collect valuable information for the Europeana Impact Framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New opportunities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, after having worked at DEN for 11 years, I moved to Leiden University Libraries in September 2017, to become the Division Manager for Research and Educational services as well as Deputy Director there. In that capacity, I will try to continue building bridges between the physical and the digital library on the one hand, and between the digital heritage and the academic communities on the other, e.g. by further exploring the connections between open and licensed content and understanding the impact of open content in academic research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this background, I intend to contribute to two aspects of the work of Europeana as a re-elected member of the Members Council. Firstly, I would like to contribute to a better understanding of what cross-domain digital cooperation is all about. Galleries, archives, libraries and museums have different traditions and different ways of thinking about innovation and the potential of digital. Cross-domain cooperation is not just about bringing digital collections together, but also about understanding different views about creating and exploiting digital collections and services and connecting them. I can bring in the experience from an academic library which holds magnificent cultural heritage collections of all sorts to the table, and in return take the lessons from this European collaboration back to Leiden. \_\_<br><br>\r\nSecondly, I will stay involved in the work on impact assessment of digital cultural heritage as co-chair of the Europeana Impact Taskforce 2.0. What value do we create with our digital collections in general and with Europeana in particular? And how can we determine that we have made an impact on our different user groups? Now that we have published the <a href=\"http://https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-impact-playbook-the-cultural-heritage-professionals-guide-to-assessing-your-impact\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> in 2017, we are working on better understanding the impact of digital cultural heritage by collecting real-life stories. If you have great examples that can help us to better understand the impact of digital heritage collections on society and that you would like to share with the Europeana network, I would be very happy to support your success stories from the perspective of the Europeana Members Council. #AllezCulture!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Latvia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Ministries of culture together with museums and galleries all over Europe have been busy selecting their top artworks for the Europeana 280 collection. Over recent weeks, we've been finding out a little more about how and why particular images were selected and the stories behind some of the choices.<br><br>\r\nHere, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Latvia. To give you a taste of what’s to come, we’ll start sharing some of the chosen works from different countries in March – so stay tuned!</strong><br><br>\r\nIn Latvia, the Culture Information Systems Centre operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture of Latvia was responsible for the nominations for Europeana 280. Selections came from the collections of the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), an institution which has undergone many changes - in terms of its name, ownership, collection contents and operating policy, with further new developments to come in 2016.<br><br>\r\nRiga is one of the largest centres of Art Nouveau (Jugenstil) in Europe so it makes sense that some important art from that period has been nominated. Symbolist and art nouveau artists covered different genres including landscapes and portraits and play a key role in Latvia’s art heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/latvia-280.jpeg\" style=\"width: 444px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dziesmu svētki Rīgā (1933), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/03808/8_visparejie_latviesu_dziesmu_svetki_objekts_10_.html\" target=\"_blank\">Latvijas Nacionâlâ Bibliotçka</a>, CC BY-NC. Graphic art was one of many art forms practiced by the versatile Latvian Niklāvs Strunke (1894-1966). He also worked in the field of stage designing and painting. The 1927 selection for Europeana 280 is a cubist work influenced by Italian trends as encouraged by the Berlin gallery owner and futurist writer Ruggero Vasari.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what kinds of works are included from these painters? One standout example is a portrait of a princess with a monkey by Janis Rozentāls (1866-1916), which reflects a theme he returned to repeatedly in the last years of his life. Some interpretations see the painting as an allegory of the relationship between an artist and society reflecting the power of money over the artist. Or perhaps the princess is ‘great, beautiful art’ and the monkey the artist: her servant and plaything, bound by golden chains. Rozentāls’ work included graphic art and in 1910 he worked on the decorative frieze of the newly built headquarters of the Riga Latvian Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Well travelled art</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another work from this period is a landscape from Vilhelms Purvītis (1872-1945) who is considered the central artist of Latvian art in the first half of the 20th century. His popularity has not diminished in the decades since his death in 1945 as a refugee in Germany. Winter, the selection for Europeana 280, is a very well travelled painting and ‘one of the most expressive examples of Art Nouveau in Latvian painting’ according to the LNMM.<br><br>\r\nAt one time it adorned the apartment of millionaire newspaper owner Emīlija Benjamiņa but during Soviet times the Benjamiņš house was the home of the Writers’ Union. In 1954 the organisation gave the painting to the State Museum of Art (now the Latvian National Museum of Art). It represented Latvia for the 2007 exhibition Masterpieces of European art to dedicate the 50th anniversary of the European Union, so its inclusion in Europeana 280 marks another chapter in a fascinating story.<br><br>\r\nA selection from modernist painter Jēkabs Kazaks (1895-1920), a student at the Riga City Art School under Purvītis, portrays tough times for Latvians. In 1916, Kazaks changed his painting style under the influence of French modernists. He takes for his central subject matter the plight of Latvian refugees in World War I. An unsentimental depiction of a nation’s resilience, yet full of pathos, according to the National Museum of Latvia describing this image: “These people leave an impression of spiritual and physical unbreakability.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1920s, Latvian artists were interpreting modernist trends and forms including constructivisim and cubism. Niklāvs Strunke (1894-1966) took an active interest in many avant-garde forms including producing powerful graphic work. The 1927 nomination for the Collection incorporates the metaphysical trends current in Italian 1920s painting that were oriented towards the world of subconscious visions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The talk of Riga society</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But earlier history still affected later Latvian artists. The German occupation of Riga during the First World War left an indelible impression on artist Kārlis Padegs (1911-1940) despite him only being a small child at the time. Paintings such as Madonna with a Machine Gun were the result, and became the talk of Riga society. “The power of the grotesque seen in the modernist Padegs’ expressive drawings, watercolours and paintings has no parallel in Latvian art”, according to the museum about this selection. Padeg’s gun-toting Madonna was painted in 1932, an interwar period where national culture flourished. “Only he could have had the idea to paint a woman holding a machine gun as a challenge to common sense.”<br><br>\r\nWe look forward to sharing more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>A springlike Copenhagen and the Statens Museum for Kunst played host to the first Europeana Members Council meeting in 2016. This meeting was particularly exciting for us as it was a chance to celebrate the Europeana Network Association’s first anniversary and get to know our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/and-the-results-are-in-introducing-your-new-members-council-representatives\" target=\"_blank\">newly elected colleagues</a>. Together, we are now a group of thirty, each with our own specific backgrounds and expertise but with a shared commitment to ensuring Europeana’s future success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you aren’t familiar with the work we do, it’s our job to advise across all Europeana’s activities, from prioritising the issues addressed in annual business plans, to set up themes for the annual conference. We act as the voice of Europeana in the wider cultural sector and support its work in the Europeana Network Association too. We meet two to three times each year, although with plenty of virtual catch-ups in between!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were gathered in Denmark with some important items on our agenda: to recap on the Network Association’s first year of activities, to review the role it plays against the 2016 Business Plan, published tomorrow, and to develop the role of the Network Association in the context of Europeana’s broader <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2015-2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the major ways we do this is through Task Forces and Working Groups. Working Groups are ongoing, whereas Task Forces are tied to Europeana’s annual business plans. Having invited you to submit ideas for 2016 Task Forces, we've now reviewed them and will get back to all Task Force candidates in the coming days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-02/mc-vgy.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 525px;\"><br><em>The Members Council convincingly recreate Christ in the Realm of the Dead, Joakim Skovgaard, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020903/KMS3141.html\" target=\"_blank\">Statens Museum for Kunst</a>, CC0. Image: Gina van der Linden, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a core part of these discussions, we developed plans for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllezCulture?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">an #AllezCulture revival</a> to both celebrate the amazing potential Europeana has for Europeans and support it as it addresses sustainability challenges. We’ll share more about this campaign soon, and will let you know how to get involved. It will be an important opportunity for the whole Network to come together and raise their voices in support of the Europeana ecosystem, and make noise about the value of the wider digital cultural heritage sector. We do hope you’ll join us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we relaxed with a guided tour of the SMK’s spectacular collections. If you’d like to do the same but can’t make it to Copenhagen anytime soon, there are thousands of beautiful artworks from the gallery <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Statens+Museum+for+Kunst&amp;q=Statens+Museum+for+Kunst\" target=\"_blank\">on Europeana for you to enjoy</a>, and all with an open license too! Our personal highlight of the tour? A fantastic VanGoYourself-inspired group reenactment of <em>Christ in the Realm of the Dead</em> by Joakim Skovgaard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, we’d love to hear about your thoughts relating to any of the issues and updates above, so do feel free to get in touch with us if you have questions or ideas. A full report from the meeting will be available on Europeana Pro soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>This year, we’ve done things a little differently with our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\">annual business plan</a>. It still sets out how we’ll carry out our <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategy 2015-202</a><a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">0</a>, and it comes out of valuable discussions with our partners and Network Association. But we’ve made it shorter and more readable with a strong emphasis on the goals to reach rather than the tasks to tick off as we go. We thought you’d like that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there’s less text to wade through, we’ve expanded the vision inside the plan, laying out our priorities for the next two years, rather than just one, to help us avoid becoming short sighted. Obviously, things will develop along the way, so we’ll update it next year to reflect that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/bp2016-cover.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 434px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So what’s in store for 2016 and 2017?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As you know, we have set ourselves four major goals for the next two years - you’ll recognise the first three from our Strategy 2015-2020, but we’ve added the fourth to help us grow as a community:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal 1: Create value for partners<br>\r\nGoal 2: Improve data quality<br>\r\nGoal 3: Open the data<br>\r\nGoal 4: Strengthen the Europeana ecosystem</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of them individually contributes to our ability to succeed as a platform for cultural heritage; combined they bring us a step closer to our vision to make all our heritage available for re-use, for the mutual benefit of all participants. I encourage you to read about how we aim to achieve these goals, and how you can contribute and benefit. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\">Download the Business Plan</a> <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\">2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have called this year’s business plan ‘Creating Cultural Connections’ because we feel that removing obstacles between institutions, large and small, who have heritage to share and users who are looking for it is our main focus for the year. In the words of one of my colleagues: ‘we need to make it insanely easy to publish on Europeana’ and we need to get to know our users intimately to understand their needs. There are a couple of things in store this year that we’d like to bring to your attention that relate directly to this ambition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first is the introduction of what we call ‘thematic collections’- first <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music\" target=\"_blank\">Music</a>, Fashion and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\">Art History</a>, and later Photography and Newspapers. We bring together some incredible collections in these areas. They deserve to find their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll also start innovating the aggregation infrastructure to make it simpler for institutions to share their data. This innovation will be organisational - with the development of expert hubs - as well as technical - by revamping Metis and by exploring more lightweight harvesting. Exciting new avenues for all of us, so stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, this will be an important year for our network with regards to structural long term funding. In particular the coming months under the Dutch Presidency will be critical in this regard. Of course we count on the continuous support of our Network Association members.

        title: 'Introducing Europeana to the Learning Resource Exchange'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>As part of its mission to encourage <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\" target=\"_blank\">re-use of digital heritage in education</a>, Europeana is working to bring its collections to the platforms used by Europe’s educators. <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/\">The Learning Resource Exchange</a> from European Schoolnet (EUN) is one such platform, allowing teachers to access educational content from numerous countries and providers. Here, <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">David Massart from European Schoolnet</a> tells us how Europeana’s collections have been made a part of this trusted service for teachers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Learning Resource Exchange (LRE) brings together high quality Open Educational Resources (OERs) from a range of providers and countries. At the moment, though open to any educational partners, the LRE is mainly used by European Ministries of Education. It works in a similar way to Europeana: it aggregates the descriptions (or metadata) of OERs, and compiles these into a searchable catalogue. E-learning platforms (e.g. virtual learning environments or educational portals) can then access this information via LRE’s API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given its specific audience, the LRE catalogue does not aim to refer to all the OERs available in Europe and beyond, but rather to the resources that ‘<a href=\"http://www.eqnet.eun.org/web/guest/travel-well-learning-resources\" target=\"_blank\">travel well</a>’ across national, cultural and linguistic boundaries so that they can usefully complement the national resources already offered by Ministries of Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of Europeana DSI, EUN worked on putting in place ways to add relevant Europeana resources to the LRE catalogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/eun-object.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>An example of a Europeana collection item in the LRE</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Adding Europeana to The Learning Resource Exchange</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding Europeana’s resources to the LRE catalog took several steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Identifying relevant resources</strong>: Europeana contains millions of digital resources, but which are educators teaching at the K-12 levels in Europe most interested in? Our first task was to identify relevant subsets for these teachers in Europeana’s collections. On top of K-12 relevance, they needed to offer educational value and have the potential to ‘travel well’, as mentioned above.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Metadata acquisition</strong>: Once we identified the relevant resources, we prepared the queries needed to obtain the metadata records describing them by calling the Europeana API.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Metadata mapping and vocabulary crosswalks</strong>: In LRE’s catalogue, OERs are described according to the <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/metadata\">LRE Metadata Application Profile</a> (LREMAP), which is very different to the Europeana Data Model and the controlled vocabularies it uses. To import the records into the LRE, we mapped them from EDM to LREMAP.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Metadata Enrichment</strong>: Next, we wanted to enrich them to increase their retrieval and re-use. We focused on doing this for the resources considered to be particularly interesting from a teaching and ‘travel well’ perspective, enriching these with educational metadata.</li>\r\n    <li>\n<strong>Automation</strong>: Last of all, we automated this process so it can be repeated on a regular basis (i.e. at least weekly). This ensures relevant new resources added to Europeana are automatically included in the LRE.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>Below, you can see the logic to our approach:</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/eun-diagram.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 520px;\">\r\n\r\n<p>Implementing and automating all of this workflow was greatly simplified by using <a href=\"https://github.com/UnderstandLingBV/Tuktu\" target=\"_blank\">Tuktu</a>, an open source big data analytics platform that focuses on ease of use. Through this work, the ability to query Europeana is now part of the official Tuktu distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What kinds of things can teachers now find?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of Europeana DSI, the LRE now provides a curated selection of Europeana’s resources adapted to teaching and learning. These resources are well suited to a variety of school subjects. Biology teachers, for instance, can help students get inside the mind of Darwin through his <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/resource-details?resourceId=643051\">fascinating drawings</a> while teachers introducing students to world religions can explore these via a <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/resource-details?resourceId=642992\" target=\"_blank\">3D rendering of an early Christian church</a> or <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/resource-details?resourceId=643094\" target=\"_blank\">vivid illustrations of the life of Buddha</a>. Or if they’re planning a lesson on Europe’s colonial empires, why not use this original <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/resource-details?resourceId=643226\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch map of Africa</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about 500 curated resources at the moment, with more being added each month. <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the entire collectio</a><a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest/europeana\">n</a>.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>This month, we’ve started highlighting some of the works nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign next month. On <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art History Collections</a>, we’ll showcase treasures from a different country each week, and if you download the popular app <a href=\"http://www.getdailyart.com/\">DailyArt</a>, you can enjoy a Europeana 280 artwork every Tuesday and Sunday in March. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We’ll also continue this blog series, finding out more how different countries went about making their choices. Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher looks at Estonia’s nominations. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artistic responses to turbulent political times have been referenced by several countries nominating artwork for Europeana 280 but are a particular feature of the selection from the Republic of Estonia. The aftermath of the First and Second World Wars and Soviet occupation in the 1940s had a profound impact on artists and provide the context behind many of the selections.<br><br>\r\nThe Ministry of Culture coordinated the process and nominations cover a wide range of periods and styles from different institutions. From the 15th century, there is a monumental fragment of a Danse Macabre – the dance of death. There are also examples of academicism, social realism and symbolism and from the second part of the 20th century, Pop art and concrete poetry. Some of the nominated artists went on to play significant roles in the development of both domestic and international art institutions. So what treasures can we expect to find in the Estonian selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Heritage heroes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Painter and illustrator Kristjan Raud is a key figure in Estonia’s art history. He was a strong advocate for the preservation of national culture and a separate museum dedicated to folklore. In the 1930s, he illustrated Kalevipoeg, the Estonian epic poem. In his symbolist triptych, The Maiden of the Grave (1919), the Art Museum of Estonia notes how Raud interpreted mythological content in a modern and political way to reflect the era in which he was working: “It was a time when Estonia was fighting for its independence against two major powers – Germany and Russia – and it creates the image of a small nation’s eternal existential striving for survival.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/280-estonia.jpg\" style=\"width: 363px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Poster ‘Survey Exhibition of Estonian Art’, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08548/kataloog_GOLDENHOME_kirjed_kaust_13786_pilt_2316_docPicture_pub.html\">Conservation Centre Kanut / Kadriorg Art Museum</a>, CC0<br>\r\nBattles on the eastern and southern fronts at the time of the Estonian War of Independence did not hold back cultural life in the Estonia’s capital Talinn. In the summer of 1919, an exhibition featured more than 400 works by 49 artists. Estonia’s most famous graphic artist, Eduard Wiiralt designed the poster and while the difficult times are reflected in the paper’s poor quality, the artistic level remains unaffected. </em><br><br>\r\nThe aftermath of the First World War, followed by the Estonian War of Independence didn’t stop artistic activities. Graphical artist Eduard Wiiralt, was studying in Tallinn in 1919. He was born in St Petersburg to parents who worked on a Russian country estate, and moved to Estonia with his family, but his formative years as an artist were spent in Paris. He died there in 1954 and is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. His works focus on the dark aspects and fears of human nature and the hallucinatory qualities of his graphical creations have been attributed to drinking excessive quantities of absinthe, a potent spirit that was a part of bohemian life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Explosive colour</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Artist Konrad Mägi was also in Paris for a while and part of the Estonian colony in Montparnasse. Impressionism and Fauvism were influential on his use of colour and he later turned to expressionism. Mägi was famous for his landscapes but also his sensitivity to societal tensions. The Art Museum of Estonia chose a Post-Impressionist work that highlights both of these aspects. In Landscape with a Red Cloud (1913-1914): “Mägi uses his exceptionally unique artistic style and explosive colour palette to create powerful, emotional images in politically disturbed times.” When Estonia achieved its independence after the First World War, Mägi became a significant figure in the Tartu art scene and was the first director of the Pallas art school that became the training ground for dozens of Estonian artists.<br><br>\r\nAnother vivid selection from the Tartu but this time from the 1960s, is a dazzling Pop art work from ‘the grand old lady of Estonian art’, Malle Leis. She originally trained as a scenery artist and was a member of the creative group ANK ’64. In a recent exhibition, the museum described the role of nature in her life, whether in oil paintings, watercolours or silkscreen painting: “Flower and plants lead their own very vital life, in places even more vital than people.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We look forward to sharing more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon.

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Laura Carletti'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Last year, we ran the Meet the Members Council blog series so you could hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better. In November, you elected seven further members to this Council, each of whom will introduce themselves via this blog in the coming weeks.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first came across Europeana through <a href=\"http://www.europeanalocal.eu/eng/About\">EuropeanaLocal</a>, a Best Practice Network, funded by the European Commission under the eContentplus programme. The project was designed to help local and regional libraries, museums, and archives make their content available on Europeana. Although the project dates back to 2008, I still have vivid memories of entering the Europeana’s world of metadata standards and interoperability, and of the organisational complexities of connecting the local and the EU levels.<br><br>\r\nEuropeanaLocal was an exciting project. However, I didn’t have the chance to be involved until its conclusion, as in 2009 I started my PhD in Technology and Learning Sciences. My PhD research focused on digital engagement strategies and the use of social media by spontaneous online communities. I explored amateurism and crowdsourcing by studying the <a href=\"http://2.%20%20%20%20http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/digital-engagement-the-history-of-advertising-trust-ghostsigns-archive/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostsigns project</a>, an initiative aiming to photograph and preserve faded painted wall advertising signs. This was a pioneering example, led by an amateur, of co-creating a digital collection through social media. The collection was later ‘institutionalised’ in the archive of the <a href=\"http://www.hatads.org.uk/ads/ghostsigns.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">History of Advertising Trust UK</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ghostsigns study showed that crowdsourcing can be a powerful mechanism of engagement, as well as an effective co-creation process. Moreover, the study revealed the challenges of integrating public-generated content into institutional repositories, and raised interesting questions such as: How do we draw boundaries between ‘official’ and externally-generated knowledge? How can the professional framed context and metadata standards be connected with the just-in-time, emergent nature of amateur online collection and curation? Shall user-generated content be hosted by the organisation or separated, hosted by social media platforms or personal blogs?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The museum as a platform</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Those open issues are still central in my research and since 2010 I have been based in Horizon - the multidisciplinary research centre on the impact of digital technologies - at the University of Nottingham, expanding my work on co-creation practices, crowdsourcing, and public humanities. Among others, I worked on the <a href=\"http://artmaps.tate.org.uk/\">‘ArtMaps’</a> project, which developed a crowdsourcing platform in collaboration with Tate and the University of Exeter to explore different ways of engaging the audience and visualising the Tate digital collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ArtMaps provided insights into the <a href=\"http://5.%20%20%20%20http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/art-maps-and-museum-platform\" target=\"_blank\">notion of the museum as platform</a>, and stimulated considerations about the preservation of audience-generated content, the implications of open ended vs. framed experiences for the public, and the use of third-party platforms. The reflections and findings generated by the ArtMaps research are also valuable in the EU context. Europeana, as indicated in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Strategy%202020.pdf\">Strategy 2015-2020</a>, aims to evolve from a portal into a “platform for cultural heritage”, “a place not only to visit, but also to build on, play in and create with.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/1457087429_portal-platform.png\" style=\"width: 271px; height: 279px;\"><br><em>Diagram from Europeana's <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Strategy%202020.pdf\">Strategy 2015-2020</a>, p.11.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>New forms of interaction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In my research practice, I regularly collaborate with heritage institutions in co-creating alternative forms of visitors’ interactions with archival resources and digital collections. For instance, within ArtMaps, I designed <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/art-maps-tool-web-based-engagement-digital-collections\">Web-based activities</a> to experiment with online audience engagement; I coordinated <a href=\"https://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/newsroom/2015/05/19/digital-storytelling-experience-to-uncover-the-hidden-stories-of-venice/\">‘Hidden Stories of Venice’</a>, a digital storytelling experience linked to the EM15 collateral exhibition at the Venice Biennale 2015; and I curated the digital interactivity of ‘<a href=\"http://9.%20%20%20%20http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/uncoveringtheinvisible/\">Uncovering the Invisible</a>’, a temporary and touring photo exhibition by Pablo and Roxana Alison. Coherently with the Europeana Strategy and in line with my theoretical and practical background, I am willing to contribute to advance Europeana as creative platform to aggregate people and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Europeana Strategy it is also highlighted that only 10% of the European heritage is digitally available. While endeavours to increase the digitisation of the remaining 90% continue, I am convinced that we need to commit further in designing experiences for the public to explore and engage with the millions objects digitally available. There are some great examples already implemented such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, mixing resources on World War I from libraries and archives, as well as crowdsourced memories and memorabilia from families throughout Europe. My belief is that we need to experiment more in this direction and, in my new role as councillor, I will strive to promote Europeana as public engagement space, starting by actively supporting the ongoing #AllezCulture campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Malta'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>This month, we’ve started highlighting some of the works nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign next month. On <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art History Collections</a>, we’ll showcase treasures from a different country each week, and if you download the popular app DailyArt, you can enjoy a Europeana 280 artwork every Tuesday and Sunday in March.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We’ll also continue this blog series, finding out more how different countries went about making their choices. Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Malta about their nominations.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malta has a fascinating history. It played important roles in both the First and Second World War, when the whole nation was awarded the George Cross for heroism. It has a rich cultural heritage that stretches back over millennia, and it has welcomed many distinguished artistic visitors. Valletta, EU’s smallest capital city, has outstanding Baroque works that are still in place in the locations for which they were originally commissioned. All these factors played a part in the narrative of Malta’s selection, according to Russell Muscat from Malta’s Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government. “Our choice stands for our story and its interconnections with Europe,” he explained. So how did Malta go about making their final selection for Europeana 280?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the initial call to Ministries of Culture, the team working on the new national community art museum was approached to coordinate the selection, as Russell Muscat continued: “Heritage Malta is currently leading the MUZA Project; a participatory museum and flagship project of Valletta 2018, European Capital of Culture”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What were the criteria for the Maltese selections? “The major challenge was the medium”, explained Muscat “We also omitted most of our Prehistoric legacy which we felt would have not fitted within the given brief.” The intention was to underpin Malta’s European significance with key works. “We opted for a balanced choice by going for works by European painters in Malta and those recognized as having Maltese connections - even if they are still relatively unknown - to show our contribution to our European identity.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Artistic visitors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Malta’s selection includes works from some distinguished artistic visitors that had a decisive impact on European art. Michelangelo Merisi, known as Caravaggio, arrived in Malta in July 1607, on the run from Rome. His volatile temperament led to his involvement in a brawl in which a member of the Knights of the Order of St John - which at the time ruled the island - was seriously injured. He was imprisoned, but escaped and fled to Sicily. “Caravaggio’s Beheading of St John the Baptist stands for the artist’s short stay on the island”, explained Muscat. “His impact on European art is decisive even though in Malta he only painted for the inner circle of the Grandmaster of the Order of St John.” This artwork still hangs in situ, in St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, in the space for which it was commissioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/malta-09-preti-sjb-x600.jpg\" style=\"width: 402px; height: 600px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Just one of the treasues chosen by Malta for Europeana 280. St John the Baptist Wearing the Red Tabard of the Order of St John, Mattia Preti. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063617/MAL_280_009.html\">National Museum of Fine Arts - MUZA (Heritage Malta)</a>, public domain.</em></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Calabrian Baroque artist Mattia Preti, on the other hand, spent over forty years in Malta during which time he was admitted to the Order. He ran a busy workshop painting for clients in Italy and elsewhere. According to Muscat: “Back then, Malta had the potential to produce art for the whole of the European continent where most of Mattia Preti’s works are still to be seen and enjoyed.” Preti largely designed the richly embellished High Baroque interior of St John’s Co-Cathedral as well as painting several of the altarpieces in its chapels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another influential visitor was British artist and architect Victor Pasmore who was a pioneer of abstract art in the 1940s and 1950s. He decided to settle in Malta when it became a nation-state. What is his role in Malta’s art heritage? “Much like Preti and Caravaggio before him,” said Muscat, “Pasmore stands as an artist whose stature connects him to the major European art institutions and is part and parcel of our story”.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Commemorative memorial</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the First World War, Malta did not take an active part in the fighting but became known as the ‘Nurse of the Mediterranean’ due to the multitude of hospitals on the island that treated many thousands of injured soldiers and sailors including those from the Gallipoli and Salonika campaigns. An artistic response to these times came from Maltese sculptor Antonio Sciortino, who studied and worked in Rome. He created one of the first designs for a monument to commemorate an unknown soldier. According to the New York Tribune in 1921, artists considered his Temple of Nations to be ‘the finest monument that has so far been designed in commemoration of the Allied victory’. “Sciortino responded with a bold vision,” states Muscat, “and his legacy is more pertinent than ever today, as we commemorate the sufferings of a Great World War which happened just a century ago.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to sharing more insightful art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon.

        body: "<p>Quality data is a key priority for our whole community. The issue was discussed during the last <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/data-quality-etech15-roundtables\">EuropeanaTech conference</a>, and with the outcomes of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and the recent Task Forces on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Metadata%20Quality%20Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">metadata quality</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-task-forces/evaluation-and-enrichments\" target=\"_blank\">enrichment</a>, we have general recommendations for quality improvements.

Items such as mandatory elements for ingestion of EDM data, data checking and normalisation and data completeness have been already added to the Committee’s agenda.

        body: "<p>When I was a child, my father used to spend his free time painting, and showing me books and journals containing beautiful buildings and vibrant masterpieces. He taught me how to recognise Greek or Gothic architecture, and how to analyse an artwork or a cathedral. I first heard of names like Velázquez and Goya, and places like Toledo or Santiago de Compostela when I was only seven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, having gained a degree in Art History, I work in Spain for The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports as a civil servant – a curator of state museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2005 to 2011 I have been of Head of the Documentation Museum Unit and at the moment, I am Head of the Collections Unit at the State Museums Department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this, I have been responsible for co-ordinating the Museum Documentation Programme of the State Museums Department, focusing in particular on the development, implementation and use in Spanish Museums of the Integrated System of Documentation and Museum Management (DOMUS), of the Digital Networking Museum Colecctions (<a href=\"http://ceres.mcu.es\">CER.es</a>) and also of the compilation of <a href=\"http://tesauros.mecd.es/tesauros\">Multilingual Cultural Heritage Thesaurus Projects</a> on technical terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/diapositiva5.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 379px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Connecting museums together</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the Europeana Network Association’s Council, I can offer my professional experience of museum collections documentation: the rules for describing museum collections and how to make them accessible and interoperable online. I know the problems posed by standardization processes, descriptions, vocabulary and ontology constructions very well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana is a new challenge for cultural institutions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All of us are share the belief that Europeana makes the use and re-use of cultural heritage possible, and in a different way to anything else on offer. But this new way sets new challenges for cultural institutions: how do they make contemporary heritage accessible? How can they keep a record of how collections are used, and by whom? Or in what ways? How many digital items are being used? And for what purposes? The questions could go on – there are many we need to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Metadata is important but we need to do more</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The reality is that each country that contributes to Europeana Collections supports a different type of metadata for describing local collections. By reinforcing the Europeana Data Model we can guarantee its continuation - as curators of cultural heritage we must respect each data model at the same time that we ensure interoperability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Institutions play an important role in supporting EDM. Lots of institutions use it to become part of Europeana, but alongside other models - this is costly for institutions. One way we could reinforce the EDM framework could be to encourage use of EDM by institutions new to interoperable data - if we can convince these institutions, we have overcome the most important challenge.</p>"

        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>This month, we’ve started highlighting some of the works nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign next month. On <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Art History Collections</a>, we’ll showcase treasures from a different country each week, and if you download the popular app <a href=\"http://www.getdailyart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DailyArt</a>, you can enjoy a Europeana 280 artwork every Tuesday and Sunday in March.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We’ll also continue this blog series, finding out more how different countries went about making their choices. Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from the Czech Republic.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bordered by Germany, Austria, Slovakia and Poland, and including the historical lands of Bohemia, Moravia and Bohemian Silesia, the Czech Republic has absorbed many artistic influences that are reflected in some fascinating nominations for Europeana 280.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaromíra Mizerová, Head of the EU Division at the Czech Republic Ministry of Culture, told us a little more about how the works were selected: “After the original call for nominations, the department for museums and galleries contacted national institutions to submit their proposals. A list of selected objects was presented to the Council of the Ministry and the Minister of Culture confirmed the final ten objects.” So what are some highlights from the Czech selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Holy Roman Emperors and Kings of Bohemia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fourteenth century, Charles IV (1316-1378) was the first King of Bohemia to also become Holy Roman Emperor. Well-travelled, well-educated and well-connected to royal courts, artistic endeavors flourished in his reign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His court painter was Master Theodoric and one of his works, <em>Painting of St Jude Thaddaeus</em>, is a nomination from the National Heritage Institute. It's one of over 100 sumptuously decorated panels painted in the Chapel of the Holy Cross at the royal residence Karlštejn Castle, near Prague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Bohemian Gothic panel painting regarded as the beginning of the ‘beautiful style’ – a specific Central European variant of the ‘International style’, according to the National Gallery in Prague, comes from the Augustinian monastery‘s Church of St Giles in Třeboň (South Bohemia) and is featured below. The international gothic style was stimulated by the growing cultural rivalry of European royal courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/czech-republic-master-of-trebon-altarpiece-o-477.jpg\" style=\"width: 414px; height: 600px;\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Třeboň Altarpiece Resurrection, Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063619/CZR_280_008.html\" target=\"_blank\">The National Gallery in Prague</a>, CC BY NC-SA. The elegant forms and naturalistic detail of the triptych depicting the death and resurrection of Christ, from a church in the medieval town of Trebon (in German, Wittingau) in southern Bohemia, are regarded as characteristic of the ‘beautiful style’, a variant of the ‘international style’ of gothic art.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prague was the centre of the Holy Roman Empire once again in the 16th century, at the time of Habsburg ruler Rudolf II; Arcimboldo’s unusual portrait of that unusual monarch is a Europeana 280 nomination from Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the period between these two Holy Roman Emperors, (and many of the following years), was marked by conflict and wars between Catholic and Protestant states. The religious reformations that swept across Europe in the 16th century had an earlier precedent in the Czech Reformation of the 15th century. Its dominant figure was Jan Hus, who was burnt at the stake in 1415. His martyrdom is recorded in <em>The Altar Wings of Roudníky</em>, which was discovered in 1966, a selection from the Hussite Museum of Tábor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bohemian Baroque</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Protestant Karel Škréta, one of the most important figures in Bohemian Baroque, fled Prague at the time of the Thirty Years War and eventually made his way to Italy in the 1630s. According to the National Gallery in Prague, Škréta’s “intimate acquaintance with Venetian art had a profound impact and lasting influence on his oeuvre”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he moved on to Rome, he joined an unusual group of Dutch and Flemish artists called the Bentvueghels (Dutch for ‘birds of a feather’), who were famous for their <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_4672.html\">initiation rites</a>, which have been painted by several artists. Škréta returned to Prague in 1638. The selection from the National Gallery, <em>The Portrait of the Gem-Cutter Dionysius Misseroni and His Family</em> is one of his most famous works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Czech Cubo-Expressionism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Czech selection also includes some 19th and 20th century works. Bohumil Kubišta (1884-1918) was a prominent artist of the pre-World War I Czech avant-garde. In <em>St Sebastian</em>, 1912, the National Gallery notes how Kubišta combines a Cubist form with spiritual content in a distinctive manner to create something unique that might not have received sufficient appreciation at the time: “This paramount achievement in Kubišta’s oeuvre tends to be interpreted as the symbolic representation of the artist’s fate in his struggle against the public’s and art critics’ lack of understanding of his art.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to appreciating more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europeana280?src=hash\">#Europeana280</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>In 1992, five friends and I founded Sirma AI; in 24 years it has grown to be the largest Bulgarian software group (<a href=\"http://www.sirma.com\">Sirma Group</a>) with 400 staff and 12 spin-offs. It had an IPO on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange last year. I’ve always worked for Sirma companies. Managing some large projects motivated me to get a PMP certification and since 2009, I've taught IT Project Management at the New Bulgarian University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“AI” in the original company name stood for Artificial Intelligence, and we’ve always sought to take interesting, challenging and research-oriented projects. The unit that best realised these dreams is <a href=\"http://ontotext.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ontotext Corp</a>, which started as a research lab in 2000, got VC investment and spun off as an independent company in 2008. I joined Ontotext in 2010, working on data, conversions, metadata, ontologies. You can find out more about this in <a href=\"http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pubs/\" target=\"_blank\">my publications/presentations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Introducing Ontotext</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ontotext works on Semantic Technologies: semantic data integration, deduplication and coreferencing, ontology engineering, RDF repository (database), semantic text analysis and enrichment, conceptual and faceted search... This sounds abstract and complex, but it’s all about extracting knowledge from text and disparate data sources, and interlinking it. A big part of it is using and developing the LOD cloud to allow more and better links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In all kinds of domains (from life sciences to product lifecycle management, biodiversity to e-Government, publishing to Holocaust studies), professional communities face similar problems: large numbers of disparate data sources and texts that vary in language, terminology, database/metadata schemas, and so on. This disjointedness raises barriers to effective research and collaboration, and semantic technologies promise to lower these barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ontotext invests heavily in research and has worked on 36 EU research projects since 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/vladimir1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 473px;\"><br><em>(<a href=\"http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/Ontotext-FP-projects-timeline.html\">Interactive version</a> with links to project information)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2008 Ontotext has had a strong focus on commercial projects, and struck gold in 2012 with the first massive industrial application of semantic technologies - the BBC Sports linked data platform. A whole new genre of <a href=\"http://ontotext.com/semantic-solutions/dynamic-semantic-publishing-platform/\">Dynamic Semantic Publishing</a> appeared, and many others followed this lead. Publishing (media, scientific, technical, financial) is now our strongest business, with clients such as BBC, UK &amp; NL Press Associations, Financial Times, Euromoney, Oxford University Press, Wiley, IET and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So what’s the relation between Semantic Technologies and Cultural Heritage?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Semantic technologies are appropriate to cultural heritage (CH) for these reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>CH data is complex and spread over disparate systems: its semantic integration better enables use and research. The Europeana Data Model is based on RDF.</li>\r\n    <li>Culture is by its very nature international and multilingual, so the value of interlinking CH data is immense.</li>\r\n    <li>Semantic enrichment will play a big role to make CH objects better searchable and interlinked.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>My work in CH began in 2010. Ontotext initiated <a href=\"http://bulgariana.eu\">Bulgariana</a>, an Europeana aggregator and NGO promoting CH in Bulgaria. We are active in establishing CLARIN and DARIAH in Bulgaria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We developed the ResearchSpace prototype for the British Museum, gaining strong experience with the CIDOC CRM and FRBRoo ontologies. I helped mapping Yale Center for British Art data to CRM, and I’m currently mapping one of the most important museum &amp; architecture aggregations to CRM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also published as LOD some of the most important thesauri in the CH domain and contributed to the development of the ISO 25964 ontology (latest standard on thesauri).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Collaborating with Europeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europeana Creative we worked on semantic enrichment: geo-referencing, crowdsourcing, researched <a href=\"http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/CH-names/README.html\" target=\"_blank\">Name Data Sources for Semantic Enrichment</a>. We added two new access channels in <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana Labs</a>: OAI and SPARQL; see <a href=\"http://ontotext.com/blog/ontotext-contributes-to-3-kpis-of-europeana/\">Ontotext contributes to 3 KPIs of Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/vladimir2.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 454px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europeana Food and Drink we developed a Food and Drink classification based on Wikipedia categories, semantic enrichment of English &amp; Bulgarian collections (now working on French), and a <a href=\"http://efd.ontotext.com/app\">semantic demonstrator</a>. It is like a “mini-Europeana” but in addition to flat facets (provider, dataProvider, country, type) we created semantic facets for Places and FD Topics. This enables semantic hierarchical browsing and “precision search”, e.g. <a href=\"http://efd.ontotext.com/app/search?query=&amp;limit=24&amp;offset=0&amp;category=Fermented_beverages&amp;place=Asia\">Objects Related to Fermented Beverages and Asia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/vladimir3.png\" style=\"width: 605px; height: 372px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, I have also participated in five Europeana Task Forces, mostly on technical topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>EDM and FRBRoo Application Profile</li>\r\n    <li>Multilingual Enrichment Strategy</li>\r\n    <li>Evaluation and Enrichments</li>\r\n    <li>Europeana for Education</li>\r\n    <li>Free, Libre, Open Source Software</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Quality is priority #1 in the <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a>. This change in emphasis from Quantity to Quality is important for Europeana's consumers, and I am excited to be on the DBpedia and Europeana quality committees. We can take a multi-pronged approach to data quality:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Work with the Europeana Aggregator forum to adopt quality standards and best practices</li>\r\n    <li>Deploy data problem discovery and reporting tools and creating a feedback loop back to the data providers</li>\r\n    <li>Work on semantic enrichment to expose meaning currently hidden in text fields</li>\r\n    <li>Deepen EDM deployment to accommodate more elaborate data - for instance, we can use edm:Event to express the particular role a Contributor had in object creation​</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>I​ look forward to representing you in all this work - let me know if you have any questions. #AllezCulture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Who''s Using What: PREFORMA Project'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>For this edition of Who's Using What we look towards the digital preservation challenges that GLAMs face. We present two developers from the <a href=\"http://www.preforma-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">PREFORMA Project</a>.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>PREFORMA will develop open source tools that double-check files being preserved long term and adhere to open standards. This will allow memory institutions full control over the process of conformity testing files which will be ingested into their collections - vital to resolving issues, such as non-conformity, that can arise from digitization to preservation, dramatically slow down workflow, and drain precious resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A problem that many institutions face in terms of long term digital preservation is that the files they receive may not be compliant with standard implementations - in turn, causing read, write or playout problems later on. The PREFORMA project published a call to support the development of three open source projects developed around an open reference implementation for documents, photographs and video files and to develop tools that check file conformance. The project has organised an open workshop in Stockholm where the early stage tools will be presented. You can register and join <a href=\"http://opensourceworkshop.preforma-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. For more information about the project, see the <a href=\"http://www.preforma-project.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">PREFORMA website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Xavi Tarres: Easy Innova</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Xavi Tarress is a developer at Easy Innova, a company developing DPF Manager as part of the PREFORMA Project. DPF Manager is an open source modular TIFF conformance checker that is extremely easy to use, integrate with existing and new projects, and deploy in a many different scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a developer I use a lot of open source frameworks and libraries. Frameworks and libraries not only let you l quickly develop software and avoid reinventing the wheel, they also allow you collaborate with bigger OS projects and to improve them. Nowadays, I use open source tools in each stage of software development. I favour <a href=\"https://eclipse.org/downloads/\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse IDE</a> for coding as it is flexible and there large number of plugins available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also use <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MAVEN</a> as package management and building automatization system. For testing, I use the <a href=\"http://junit.org/junit4/\" target=\"_blank\">Junit</a> library for the unitary tests and the <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GIT</a> as version control software. Currently, I’m developing with <a href=\"https://java.com/en/download/\" target=\"_blank\">Java</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm\" target=\"_blank\">JAVA FX </a>and of course using some of the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Software Foundation</a> projects, which are essential for any Java project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In my career as a developer I have used a large number of open source projects. As web developer I used the <a href=\"http://cakephp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cake PHP</a> framework and <a href=\"https://jersey.java.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Java Jersey</a> for the back-end running under Apache and <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Tomcat</a>. Usually using <a href=\"https://www.mysql.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a> as <a href=\"http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/65016/what-is-meant-by-ddbb\" target=\"_blank\">DDBB</a> but sometimes I used <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MongoDB</a> and <a href=\"http://redis.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Redis</a> data bases. Some years ago I developed a Multi-platform Mobile application using the <a href=\"http://www.appcelerator.com/mobile-app-development-products/\" target=\"_blank\">Titanium SDK </a>and <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SQLite</a>. Recently I developed the <a href=\"http://www.durafilesb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Durafile</a> platform: this project aims to offer a novel software solution for preserving personal digital information, by detecting obsolete files or files at risk of obsolescence and executing digital preservation plans in order to migrate these files. In the Durafile project we use a large number of open source projects like <a href=\"http://www.taverna.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Taverna</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/owncloud\" target=\"_blank\">Owncloud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual Box</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you start using open source resources you rapidly become aware of how powerful it is to have access to the source code, the right to make changes and a whole community behind a project. Since then it’s been difficult for me to change to proprietary software.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I’m working on the <a href=\"http://www.dpfmanager.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">DPF Manager </a>application as part of the PREFORMA Project. The aim of the PREFORMA Project is to implement good quality standardized file formats for preserving data content in the long term, giving memory institutions full control of the process of the conformity tests of files to be ingested into archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DPF Manager is a multiplatform application and a framework designed to allow end users and developers to gain full control over the technical properties and structure of TIFF images intended for long term preservation. The DPF Manager identify TIFF images based on the 'TIFF Baseline Specifications Revision 6', and validates the conformance to a specific normative. These normatives can be defined by an ISO standard or a specific acceptance criteria based on locally defined policy rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also started working in the PRESEMEDIA project. PRESEMEDIA’s objective is to carry out digital preservation of online and social media information for personal and corporate environments. This means preserving the content of social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn , Blogs, Webpages) and transparently storing the preserved information to third-party systems (e.g. DAS, SAN, NAS, private cloud storage, social networks, Dropbox, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, I am not looking for a specific open source Project. But, some months ago, we were looking for a Scrum Project managing framework connected to GitHub or Bitbucket. Unfortunately, we didn’t find a project that could satisfy our requirements and we had to resort to a paid service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jérôme Martinez-MediaArea</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Jérôme Martinez is a developer at MediaArea, an organisation developing MediaConch as part of the PREFORMA Project. MediaConch (CONformance CHecking for audiovisual files) is an extensible, open source software project consisting of an implementation checker, policy checker, reporter and fixer that targets preservation-level audiovisual files.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. What open source tools are you currently working with?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are mainly working with <a href=\"https://www.linux.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Linux</a>, <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">GCC</a>, <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.9.2/\" target=\"_blank\">MinGW64</a>, <a href=\"http://www.openssh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SSH</a>, <a href=\"http://www.putty.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Putty</a>, <a href=\"https://tortoisegit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TortoiseGit</a>, <a href=\"http://openbuildservice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OBS</a> (Open Build Service), <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox, Thunderbird</a> for doing our job and we use <a href=\"http://www.qt.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Qt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.xmlsoft.org/\" target=\"_blank\">libxml</a>, <a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/\" target=\"_blank\">libxslt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/\" target=\"_blank\">sqlite</a>, <a href=\"https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/\" target=\"_blank\">libcurl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html\" target=\"_blank\">autotools</a>, <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a>, <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jstree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JSTree</a> as libraries for our projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What are you currently developing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently developing <a href=\"https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo\" target=\"_blank\">MediaInfo</a>, a convenient unified display of the most relevant technical and tag data for video and audio files, and <a href=\"https://mediaarea.net/MediaConch/\" target=\"_blank\">MediaConch</a>, a conformance checker sponsored by the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What would you like to see developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though some people in our team use mainly open source software, some others do still use some major non-open source software like Windows, Mac OS X, <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/\" target=\"_blank\">XCode</a>, and we all still use software like Gtalk, Skype or GitHub for communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be great to have a good audio/video chat software and service, as well as a perfect open source development environment. At the moment, the equivalent open source tools are unfortunately not at the same level as the non-open source counterparts. Having something equivalent to Mac App Store for open source operating systems would also be great - at the moment I personally still have huge issues when I try to install software on Linux, due to old versions of the tools in the repositories or the absence of several tools that I want to use.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi! My name is Ellen. I love nature, museums, books, music, radio, films, sports, meeting people and I love children – especially my own three marvellous ones. Luckily for me, they share many of my interests. And like me, they love coloring the collection books of museums. As they put it: \"Mummy, where do you get these pictures? In school they never give us these wonderful drawings!\" And I thought to myself, \"But they could, couldn’t they? That's one meaningful way to ‘transform the world with culture!’\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/rhinocolour.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 224px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/rhino2.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 224px;\"><br><em>Some wonderful rhinos from Europeana's <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2016/02/colorourcollections-europeanas-colouring-book-for-grown-ups/\">#ColourOurCollections colouring book</a>. Image: The rhinoceros by Enea Vico, 1533-1567. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_1903_A_23317.html\">Rijksmuseum</a>, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And beyond this, there is so much more one can do with the cultural wealth shared by heritage institutions via Europeana and national equivalents like the German ‘<a href=\"http://www.ddb.de/\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>’ which I work for. Let’s continue to forge cultural connections and our vivid European cultural identity!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How the current legal framework holds us back</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I first came into contact with the prospects of digitizing and sharing our cultural heritage whilst organizing a conference on ‘Cultural memory in the digital age’ in 2004. But it remained a <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/WTI4O5TQ36KTVWYEDYIXCHNUVYCGBBEL?query=ellen+euler&amp;isThumbnailFiltered=true&amp;rows=20&amp;offset=0&amp;viewType=list&amp;firstHit=5PTYDO37XHDIBCI6IYNHW6DWTTLLICT2&amp;lastHit=lasthit&amp;hitNumber=7\">conference transcript</a>: realising the vision and opportunities was prevented by a variety of factors. Many of these problems were solved in those early years, primarily the technical issues. But many were not: the goal of the cultural platforms in making our cultural heritage and treasures available online is still being hampered by the current legal framework and especially by the copyright rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright may be useful within the exploitation chain of some works. Some people say this applies to about 2 – 4 % of the works. But apart from that – and especially for older works that are not commercially exploited any more but are still copyright protected – it's mostly harmful. Furthermore, copyright harms new business models that could bring new value to the works and their content. Last but not least, the existing copyright rules are harming our digital cultural heritage because we cannot re-use it in new creative ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>We need change!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the rightholders have the opportunity to change this situation. Many do so and license their content with a free Creative Commons license which allows the author of a work to define how their works can be used by others. As the national project leader of the Creative Commons Licenses in 2004, I was responsible for the adaptation of the very first version of the CC licenses to the German national legal requirements. The Creative Commons licenses have since changed a lot, but unfortunately not to the advantage of the cultural heritage institutions who are usually not rightholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/creative-commons.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 251px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then decided to investigate the legal framework in a more meaningful way and look at it from a cross domain and intermedia perspective. What are the problems the museums, archives, and libraries have to face in order to fulfill their public mission? Although cultural heritage institutions have safeguarded and preserved our cultural heritage and their mission is of public interest, they have had to face many uncertainties and legal challenges while carrying out their tasks under the newly changed conditions of the digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uncertainties regarding the legal status of older works must not impede heritage institutions in their work – work which is carried out for the public good and funded with public money. Nevertheless, because of the existing legal framework this is exactly what happens. In my legal PhD, I suggested a fair use exception for cultural heritage institutions referring to their public mission. I am convinced that this is still needed to boost our digital cultural memory in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>My voice for the cultural heritage lobby</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensuring that the voice of cultural heritage institutions across domains is heard in the discussion about a modernization of the legal framework is of great importance. The cultural heritage lobby is unfortunately very weak because lobbying is not one of the core tasks of cultural heritage institutions. Far from a general solution, we are currently dealing with special purpose solutions such as the orphan works directive. Needless to say: it hasn't really worked. (See more: <a href=\"http://de.slideshare.net/eeuler/impacts-of-the-orhan-works-directive\">http://de.slideshare.net/eeuler/impacts-of-the-orhan-works-directive</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright reform with regards to our digital cultural heritage is not about expropriation of rightholders but about ending a situation in which neither rightholders nor anyone else benefits and about ending the practice of <a href=\"https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit9vrvqdTLAhXJ2xoKHQHmALUQFggnMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kl.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F04%2Fpaul-klimpel-law-and-practice-final_5.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNG42GWYhc0CNl_T1hpERRN7GRFrtg&amp;cad=rja\">copyright fraud, presumptions and fictional writing up of rights</a>. All regulations that avoid right clearances and legal assessments as well as high transaction costs will boost large scale digitization and the chance to share our cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/ddb-knot.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 413px;\"><br><em>An example of a record in <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/item/DFSI5I4MAENMSXTTUS7EMXCTSRM3SFH4?query=gordische+knoten&amp;isThumbnailFiltered=true&amp;rows=20&amp;offset=0&amp;viewType=list&amp;firstHit=AB6AYZN5EWMYDCZMJ2ADUED4C75MY3DZ&amp;lastHit=lasthit&amp;hitNumber=3\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My mission?

The meeting will include a roundtable debate between cloud experts, each of whom has been invited to share their opinions with the Europeana Cloud Work Packages leaders, as well as representatives of the project partners. The meeting is by invitation only – we hope that this will help stimulate lively discussions and debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than bringing together all project partners to run through their project results, the idea is to create something valuable at the political level: by talking about the issues the project has faced in creating the Cloud with external experts, and getting their input before publishing final recommendations. This will help inform the European Commission in preparation for future efforts in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the morning, the Work Package leaders will meet to gather lessons learned in the project for sharing with external experts. In the afternoon, Work Package leaders can learn about benefits, good practices, challenges and failures of current and past cloud projects to help them appraise their own experiences, and put them into a broader contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics to address include: Cloud Infrastructure and Operations; Application Development with Cloud; Innovation with Cloud; Cloud Security; Cloud Governance; Cloud Management and Monitoring; Cloud Architecture Design; Cloud Standards and Compliance and Cloud Service Procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expert round table aims to design a set of recommendations for the implementation of future cloud infrastructures for the cultural heritage sector - through an open debate among various stakeholders such as representatives of the European Commission, technology practitioners, commercial vendors and others involved in similar cloud initiatives. The outcomes of the debate will be shared widely in the final phase of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/europeana-ecosystem.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 408px;\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-strategy-2020\">http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-strategy-2020</a></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Slovenia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>This month, we’ve started highlighting some of the works nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign next month. On <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art History Collections</a>, we’ll showcase treasures from a different country each week, and if you download the popular app <a href=\"http://www.getdailyart.com/\">DailyArt</a>, you can enjoy a Europeana 280 artwork every Tuesday and Sunday in March.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We’ll also continue this blog series, finding out more how different countries went about making their choices. Here, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Slovenia.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In nominating their national treasures for the Europeana 280 collection, many countries balanced selections from early centuries with contemporary work including examples from living artists who continue to play a significant role in their nation’s cultural history. This was the approach taken by Slovenia, who nominated five works from their National Gallery including examples from gothic and neoclassicism periods, and the other five from the Museum of Modern Art. What are the highlights of their final selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Slovenian modernism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Museum of Modern Art explained how they went about making their contemporary nominations: “In Moderna galerija's case, the selection process tried to include some of the most representative or best artworks in its national collection.” Gabrijel Stupica is considered one of Slovenia’s finest painters and one of the most outstanding abstractionists in Yugoslavia. The characteristic motifs of his work emerged in the 1960s and 70s, and according to the Museum in a recent retrospective, “now represent canonical images of Slovenian modernist painting.” The Triumph of Flora, painted in 1965, presents the image of a young, yet somehow old-looking ‘bride’, typical of his late or white period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marij Pregelj grew up in a literary family - his father was an expressionist writer - and he is considered one of Slovenia’s pre-eminent postwar modernists. His paintings, such as Pompeian Company at Table, also from the 1960s, were influenced by wartime experiences. According to the Museum: “The dead bird signals hunger or both concrete and symbolic impoverishment and appears in a few paintings Pregelj made immediately after WWII, which depict scenes of life in labour or prisoner-of-war camps, which the artist himself experienced twice.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Artist for Peace</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of contemporary work in the Europeana 280 collection enables us to discover some of the counterculture movements of the 1960s. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09203/EUS_7F9B54EA930B4173BF2D2EF96F87A5C0.html\">OHO group</a> was a Slovene artistic collective who participated in conceptual and land art exhibitions at home and abroad, including New York. Programming and ritual were principles applied to all areas of their work that included literature, film, and printmaking. In Programmed Print - the Vertical Line Program (1968), Marko Pogačnik used complex numerical programs to create clearly abstract forms. In 1971 Pogacnik founded a rural and artistic colony, the ‘Sempas Family’ (who exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1978) that put a greater emphasis on spirituality and the environment. Pogacnik is still working in this direction today and in February 2016, became a UNESCO Artist for Peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pleasing horror of nature</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The nominations from the National Museum of Slovenia in Ljubljana reflect earlier artistic periods. Neoclassicism is represented by the 19th century work, Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake, by Franc Kavčič/Caucig, painted at a time when artists, influenced by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09428/urn_nbn_de_gbv_3_1_335622.html\">Kant</a> and the writings of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200143/BibliographicResource_2000069286002.html\">English philosophers</a>, were focusing on the sublime qualities of nature. According to the Museum: “The mightiness of nature combined with the aesthetics of pleasing horror are present here.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/slovenia-portret-of-the-artist-father-ngs0466-x600.jpg\" style=\"width: 494px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Portret očeta / Portrait of the Artist's Father (1848), Jožef Tominc (1790-1866), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/api/RbWPAapQ6/redirect?shownAt=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ng-slo.si%2Fen%2Fpermanent-collection%2F1820-1870%2Fportrait-of-the-artist-s-father-jozef-tominc%3FworkId%3D1697&amp;provider=Europeana+280&amp;id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeana.eu%2Fresolve%2Frecord%2F2063615%2FSLO_280_007&amp;profile=full\">Narodna Galerija, Ljubljana / National Gallery Of Slovenia</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the National Gallery of Slovenia, Tominc’s works represent the highest achievement in Slovenian art in the first half of the 19th century. A portrait of his father, painted in 1848, is the nomination for Europeana 280.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ascending middle classes of Central Europe during these times, realistic renderings of security and home lives were artistically in demand. The Beidermeier period resulted in a blossoming of domestic arts particularly in furniture design and interior decorating that catered to new urban bourgeois audiences. Jožef Tominc worked in the Austrian Empire and Italy and established himself mainly on the Gorizia and Trieste scenes. The nomination for Europeana is a portrait of the artist’s father painted in 1848 for his eightieth birthday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what is the Moderna galerija looking forward to in Europeana 280? They welcome the exposure for distinctive work: “The promotion of smaller, less known cultural or art institutions, their collections, and especially artists and artworks that are unknown to the general (or the Western EU) public”. They also look forward to an expansion in our artistic horizons: “Hopefully it will have the effect of discovering the yet unknown in art or the rediscovery of the already known.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to appreciating more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'What I will do as Europeana''s Impact Analyst'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>It is probably the question cultural institutions thinking about sharing their collections online ask most: What do I get out of it? What is in it for me and what impact will it have? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To answer this question, we need to start by asking ‘what kind of impact do I want to get out of my digital collection?’ Do you want to attract more visitors to your website? Do you want kids to learn from your collection? Do you want to support the tourism sector in your region? Perhaps all of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the cultural heritage sector, but in almost every other domain too, the word ‘impact’ has become more prominent. When we start a project we want to make sure it has impact. But what does this actually mean? When you look for a visual metaphor for impact you quickly end up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle\">Newton’s Cradle</a> where the knock of one ball moves another one: direct impact. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this is exactly the opposite of how the impact I am talking about works. It is, for example, impossible to make a statement like “I will publish my collection online under an open license. This will result in Wikipedians using it in their articles and my collection getting loads of views.” If only it was that straightforward. No, when we measure impact we need to take a much broader look, for example, at the connections being made, the new opportunities given to artists and the ways your collection has touched the lives of people around the world. When looking for a visual metaphor for impact, the ‘ripple effect’ would be more accurate. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/children-pond-600x.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 473px;\"><br><em>Kinderen in speeltuin met vijver, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021641/publiek_detail_aspx_xmldescid_121096121.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gooi en Vecht Historisch</a>, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach follows the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20strategy%20impact.pdf\">Europeana Impact Framework</a> which stresses the importance of distinguishing between actions, the output of these actions, the outcome of these actions, and ultimately the impact we have on real people. In particular, it encourages us to look beyond the immediately measurable ‘output’ of our actions towards the demonstrable outcome, which leads to defining the real impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/impact%20framework1.png\" style=\"width: 562px; height: 148px;\"><br>\r\nBut measuring impact is a tricky exercise. Some things are quite straightforward to assess, like the amount of website hits and clickthroughs generated, or the most popular items in a collection. At Europeana, we realise that this basic information is crucial for cultural heritage institutions that put effort into sharing their collection via Europeana. It’s for this reason we will launch the Europeana Statistics Dashboard in the first week of April - something we’ve been working on for a while. The Dashboard will offer insight into all these basic web metrics for all our data partners, so stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To go one step further however we need different methods. We can, for example, count the number of times visitors use the new download button on Europeana, but what happens after that? Using reverse image search tools like Google Images and TinEye can help us to track how digitised works of art travel online and to study the contexts in which they are used. At a recent <a href=\"https://www.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2016DigitalEngagementAndCulturalHeritage\">Digital Methods Winter School</a>, I was part of a group doing some interesting research on this, which I will blog about soon. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many interesting questions to explore. Why are certain online collections more popular than others? Is this down to the nature of the content and the prestige of the institution, or are there other factors that are important such as metadata and image quality? Is it possible to determine the perfect conditions which will allow you to achieve maximum impact? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the kind of research I will conduct in my role as Europeana’s impact analyst. For this, I will rely heavily on the Europeana Statistics Dashboard but also data from <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/enumerate\">ENUMERATE</a>, digital methods and direct conversations with institutions and users. My aim is to publish a number of data blogs and case studies throughout the year about my findings. If you are interested in collaborating on this or have ideas for interesting research then please <a href=\"mailto:joris.pekel@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>!</p>"

Old, young, familiar or sometimes even forgotten. But who inspires you, and why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want you to tell us, from today, in any language you like, who your cultural hero or heroine <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;q=\">in Europeana</a> is and why you picked them using ‘I am @Europeanaeu’ and the hashtag #AllezCulture!

If you’re feeling creative, why not make a GIF or a collage? Just make sure you include the link to where you found the items you’ve used in Europeana so others can enjoy them too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s easy to get involved. When you tweet a link to an item from Europeana Collections, a Twitter card will be created automatically.

Then <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-network-association-agm-2016-tickets-19528942593\">get your early bird ticket before 26 September</a>. Early bird tickets cost €50. After this, the prices goes up to €85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-network-association-agm-2016-tickets-19528942593\">Here’s where you can register. </a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re not sure where to stay, we’ve <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016#hotel\">put together a list</a> of some our favourite hotels in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana can reimburse your travel and accommodation, but only if you meet <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/europeana-foundation-rules-for-the-reimbursement\">our criteria</a>. First of all, you must be a fully fledged member of the new Europeana Network Association. You can sign up <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/sign-up\">here</a> if you aren’t currently a member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, you must not be attending on behalf of a project or as a DSI partner - this is because travel and accommodation can be reimbursed through the project rather than through Europeana directly. Please ask your project manager if you’re unsure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network Association AGM is always a brilliant chance to get together with like-minded friends and colleagues, and catch up on developments in the sector. We very much hope we’ll see you there!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Cyprus'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>During March, we started highlighting some of the treasures nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign in April. Daily Art fans enjoyed weekly artworks from the nominations, while different countries were showcased each week on Europeana Art History Collections.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We also continued this weekly blog series, finding out some of the backstories behind selections. This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher chats to Cyprus about their fascinating nominations. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The timeline in which Western art history is usually framed, where the Renaissance is followed by the enlightenment and a progression of other intellectual movements, does not apply to the island of Cyprus or indeed to some other countries in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It presented a challenge for selectors choosing works for the Europeana 280 campaign as Louli Michaelidou from Cyprus' Ministry of Education &amp; Culture, Culture Department - Visual Arts, explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Artistic production in countries of the so-called ‘western periphery’, like Cyprus, instead developed what critical writers like to call an ‘alternative modernity’. While deeply influenced by mainstream modern art movements – especially since many artists, at least in the case of Cyprus, were trained in western institutions – these artistic influences may have appeared much later, in modified forms, and as part of specific individual expressions rather than as parallel to the main western centres of art. It constitutes a significant critical point for contemporary art criticism.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So how did Cyprus make its final selection?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nominations come from the archive of the State Gallery of Cypriot Contemporary Art. “Historically, what can be classified as secular art here begins to appear and circulate from the end of the 19th century onwards,” explains Michaelidou.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vassilis Michaelides (1849-1917) is considered the national poet of Cyprus and also the first Cypriot, based on available historical data, who attempted to study fine arts. He spent time in Naples and possibly elsewhere in Italy, and the ideals of classicism were an influence in his painting <em>Madonna and Child - </em>one of Europeana 280 nominations from the State Gallery of Cypriot Contemporary Art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-03/mother-child-600x.jpg\" style=\"width: 447px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Madonna and Child (1875-1880), Vassilis Michaelides. Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063608/CYP_280_008.html\">Cyprus Ministry for Education and Culture</a>, CC0. In 1875, Michaelides spent time studying painting in Naples and Rome - a legacy which is visible in this work.</em>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rural traditions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of the 20th century, Cypriot society was still predominantly rural and deeply traditional. But artists were beginning to follow European developments and combine their knowledge of those trends with local Cypriot life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his work, <em>Return to the Village</em> (1930), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09411/F336694F4EEB9B3DB7A05912D35E14E8DC7284D7.html\">Ioannis Kissonergis</a> sought to pass on to future generations some charming aspects of a way of life that had now passed as well as his experience as a painter: “He played a key role in fostering artistic education by reforming the teaching method of art and bringing students in contact with European painting”, according to the State Gallery. Other artists reflecting rural traditions in their work were Telemachus Kanthos and Adamantios Diamantis, the ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09411/70A329FB7AD58394C6A1406486162BD86749A451.html\">two pillars</a>’ on which modern Cypriot art was built. <em>The Planters</em> by Diamantis is one of his most famous paintings of the Greek Cypriot peasantry. Ordinary people, especially women, are fixed in time and place and become as one with the landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The favourite subject for Telemachus Kanthos was the hills surrounding his village that he depicted in expressive ways in combination with other demanding artistic forms like wood engraving. These two artists, along with another selection from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09411/A4DEF64DF4A260B1C269CDEB3EAD85164DF2A433.html\">Pol. Georgiou</a>, captured the colourful and turbulent history of Cyprus in the twentieth century leading up to independence in 1960, and were very influential on succeeding generations of artists in Cyprus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Post-independence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The abstractionist Stelios Votsis is representative of the generation of Cypriot artists who came to the fore in the period after the declaration of independence of the Republic of Cyprus. He studied in post-war England at the Slade School of Fine Art and after graduating, returned to the island to co-found the Cyprus Chamber of Fine Arts. He was one of six artists representing Cyprus at the 1968 Venice Biennale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another representative was the charismatic Christoforus Savva. After fighting in the Second World War, he enrolled at St Martin’s School of Art in London and, after time in Paris, returned to Cyprus for good in 1959. The nomination <em>Stymphalian Birds</em> (1960) is inspired by the sixth labour of Hercules. After succeeding in clearing out the Augean Stables, his next task was to drive away an enormous flock of (possibly man-eating) birds gathered near the town of Stymphalos. Despite his short time in the visual arts of Cyprus (he died young in his forties), Christoforos Savva was a catalyst in the gradual intermingling of Cypriot art into the global art scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to appreciating more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&amp;q=%23Europeana280&amp;src=tyah\">#Europeana280</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p>Now that we’ve settled into 2016, it’s time to look back on the achievements of 2015 with our latest annual report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with the next <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/how-can-we-create-stronger-cultural-connections-business-plan-2016\">business plan</a>, we’ve done things a little differently this year - we’ve gone for an <a href=\"https://app.slidebean.com/p/EC8Smo1E7s/Europeana-Annual-Report-2015\">attractive visual and digital version</a> (embedded below) alongside <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-annual-report-accounts-2015.pdf\">a full length report and overview of our accounts</a>. So you can browse through easily, and dive in deeper when you’d like to find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://app.slidebean.com/embed/EC8Smo1E7s\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual report shows how together last year we worked towards the goals set out in both our long-term strategy and our yearly business plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Strategy 2015-2020</a> looks towards the development of a multi-sided platform - a networked organization with the world’s largest repository of trusted, accessible and re-usable digital heritage. We’re definitely on our way there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, we promised to work together on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Make%20the%20Beautiful%20Thing%20Business%20Plan%202015.pdf\">making the beautiful thing</a>. We aimed to ensure our core infrastructure, processes and products were fit for purpose so all our partners and audiences could do more with the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlights of 2015? A much improved website - <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a> - showcasing Europe’s fascinating cultural heritage. And a new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and infrastructure making it easier for cultural organizations to share that heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also contains updates from across the organization and Europeana Network Association - from work on improving data quality, sharing fascinating new open collections and moving to continuous publication of new datasets, to providing more value to partners, working towards greater multilingualism in Europeana, enabling innovative uses of digital cultural heritage in apps and services and celebrating how we’ve strengthened the Europeana ecosystem with 2015’s great get-togethers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we’ve encountered hurdles, but we’ve worked (and continue to work) hard to overcome them. Thank you to all our staff, partners, stakeholders and audiences for their contributions. 2015 is a year to be proud of.<br><br>\r\nPlease read and <a href=\"https://app.slidebean.com/p/EC8Smo1E7s/Europeana-Annual-Report-2015\">share the annual report</a> - if you’re using social media, please include the #AllezCulture hashtag.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Marcin Werla'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Hi! My name is Marcin Werla and I currently lead the Digital Libraries and Knowledge Platforms Department at<a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/\" target=\"_blank\"> the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center</a> (PSNC) located in Poznań, Poland. My adventure with digital libraries began in Autumn 2002, when I started to work at the PSNC as software engineer as part of a team developing software platform for<a href=\"http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/\" target=\"_blank\"> Digital Library of Wielkopolska</a>. At that time, it was one of the first Polish digital libraries, and the first one created by a regional consortium (of, in this case, academic libraries). We even attracted the attention of a local TV crew who were making news about the first thousand publications made available online!</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Cooperation is better than competition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this project PSNC, with its mission to integrate and develop IT infrastructure for science, cooperated closely with the local community of memory institutions to develop a flexible digital library framework. We wanted to have something that could be re-used to implement the cooperative model of shared infrastructure for opening culture in other regions and cities of Poland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using terms that have since become popular, I could say that what we were working on constituted a regional cloud, allowing aggregation of digital content and metadata from various kinds of memory institutions and opening up access to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years later the software platform was mature enough to be re-used in other regions of Poland and, in 2006, when we had over a dozen of digital libraries up and running in the PIONIER network, we found that users need a single, trusted point of access to cultural resources distributed on many websites. That’s how we started to work on the idea of a metadata aggregator for Polish cultural and scientific resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first public release of this service, called the<a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/\"> Digital Libraries Federation</a>, was in June 2007, with fewer than 20 data sources and around 80 000 metadata records. In December 2009 we started delivering data to Europeana, with over 350 000 records harvested under the Europeana Local project. For both PSNC and for me personally it was the beginning of fruitful cooperation with Europeana and its network of partner institutions that endures to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My experiences, with the creation of a network of over a hundred of digital libraries in Poland and the connection of that network with a European infrastructure, made me deeply believe that entities cooperating towards a common aim, with a “win/win or no deal” approach, can achieve great results, even if some obstacles appear on the way and the amount of necessary resources is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/2063613-pol-280-004.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 383px;\"><br><em>Battle of Orsha on 8 September 1514, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063613/POL_280_004.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Museum in Warsaw</a>, public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why I decided to get involved in the Europeana Network by participating in the Members Council. I think that the Network, with its new Association structure, is a great way to maximize the impact of the cooperation between Europeana’s partners, and will in turn lead to intensified cooperation around open cultural heritage data at both national and European levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Innovation, Technical Development, Open Data, Culture, History</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the keywords I chose to show what my priorities are when preparing my profile for the Members Council elections last year. I chose them because, as a person with a strong technical background, I think that innovation done with the support of technical development and open data can significantly change the way we access, use, re-use and research our culture and history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My particular field of interest, and the challenge I want to address, is to make the cultural metadata and digital content distributed all over Europe interoperable to an extent that it can be seamlessly used, even with advanced tools like humanities virtual research environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, it might seem an extreme use case from the point of view of a regular citizen, but I think that making such usage scenarios possible opens new possibilities in other areas as well. Results that are useful for research can be an inspiration for new ideas of content re-use outside the research sector too, leading to something new that will be useful, usable, efficient and effective, but also desirable by many of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your votes last Autumn. I hope that, when my time on the Members Council finishes, you will feel satisfied with the activities I have carried out on your behalf.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'The Europeana Statistics Dashboard is here'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Today we are excited to launch the first public beta version of the <a href=\"http://statistics.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Statistics Dashboard</a>. A tool for our partners that allows us to be fully open and gives granular insight into how each collection is performing on Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana helps cultural institutions across Europe share their digital collections with a wider audience. We collect data from thousands of institutions from all European countries and make that available online. In an average month we reach over half a million people looking for the cultural treasures of Europe. But how many of these visitors have a look at your collection? Where do they come from? And what items are they looking at most? All of this is vital information for a modern cultural institution for both reporting and planning purposes and for public accountability but, up until now, not easy to find out. This is where the new Europeana Statistics Dashboard comes in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/screencapture-statistics-europeana-eu-europeana-1459869990931.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 309px;\"><p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can you find in your dashboard?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>Traffic overview: how many people visit your items each month? We’ve added a yearly total too, to make it easy for you to include in annual reports. Besides this, there’s information on your most popular items, and where visitors come from.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Collection statistics: how many items are there in your collection? What types of content does it include, and how much of it is available for people to re-use?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We have generated dashboards on four levels: for cultural institutions, aggregators, countries and finally Europeana as a whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often, unexpected and lesser known items appear on top 25 lists in dashboards for different countries and institutions, demonstrating the diversity of collections in Europeana. Interestingly, these top items tend to change from month to month, and usually account for a low percentage of any institution or country’s total views. Over time, we will be able to analyse these patterns in greater depth, looking at the influence of factors such as social media activity, search engines and data quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What else can I expect?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s launch is for the first public beta version of the Statistics Dashboard: a clue to the fact that we are by no means finished with our work on it. In the coming months, we will work not only on stability and visibility, but also introduce new functionalities and charts. Very high on our wishlist, for instance, is offering data about the four tiers in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/publishing-framework\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and making it possible for visitors to download the raw data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We really appreciate your help in further developing the Dashboard. If you have any feedback or questions you can send them directly to <a href=\"mailto:dashboard@europeana.eu\">dashboard@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough talk, time to find your own dashboard, or have a look at somebody else’s on <a href=\"http://statistics.europeana.eu/\">http://statistics.europeana.eu/ </a></p>"

The feature also opens up opportunities for university teachers looking to encourage their students as they become more advanced researchers in their chosen fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/what-s-like-this-at-europeana-section.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 312px;\"><br><em>An example of a 'What's like this?' section inviting students to discover further items relating to their research</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">Inventing Europe</a> went live in September 2012, over 15, 000 European students have worked with our website during their courses at no fewer than 13 universities in 11 countries. Inspiration for teaching can be found on our web-based <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/education\">education page</a>. Inventing Europe is unique in that it connects 17 years of historical research on the history of science and technology by more than 300 scholars with the collections of 13 renowned European science museums. As such, the website creates new meaning and context for the study of European history, and for Europe’s fast growing digital cultural heritage collections. Europeana has been one of our key partners since the start of our project back in 2011, and the data available through Europeana is frequently used at universities in all corners of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/what-s-like-this-filters.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 464px;\"><br><em>The 'What's like this?' feature also uses Europeana's filtering capability</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Particularly at Masters level, one of the most important shared learning objectives amongst teachers is ‘engagement with current debate in European historiography (such as transnational history, or the historical role of technology in European integration), allowing students to contrast differing historical narratives, like national histories. Students use Europeana’s data to <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/education/intensive-assignments/\">create their own tours</a> through European history. The “What’s like this?” sections give them the option to find objects from different collections and create cross-collection connections. In turn, they can pose new and transnational questions about European history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/detailed-object-view-and-information-useful-for-student-research-and-engagement-with-european-history.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 380px;\"><br><em>A detailed object view of an object made available through Europeana</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A side effect of this is that students learn about the people, like them – engineers, consumers and experts – who have built Europe’s infrastructure, society, economy and culture on a daily basis long before the start of the Industrial Revolution. As a consequence, students can start to contemplate their own role in Europe’s future, as architects, engineers, computer specialists, historians and economists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Bachelor level, most students use Europeana data through our “What’s like this?” section for shorter exercises, such as our <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/education/short-assignments/\">Object Contextualization assignment</a>. The internet opens up many new opportunities for university teachers hoping to help their students to become skilled researchers. By using the “What’s like this?” section, students learn to contextualize historical items, and appreciate the local, national, international and European meaning of objects. They begin, for instance, to question the objects themselves, their metadata and ways to interpret these in relation to where the object is located on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the assignment, students often report back to their teachers that they finally feel that they have created real value and new meaning, and recognised that they are part of a larger community of students who are all part of this international project, ‘Inventing Europe’. By re-using digital cultural heritage materials in this way, students become active creators of Europe’s future economy and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Luxembourg'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Last month, we started highlighting some of the treasures nominated as part of Europeana 280 in preparation for the launch of the campaign in April. Daily Art fans enjoyed weekly artworks from the collection, while different countries were showcased each week on Europeana Art History Collections.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We also continue this weekly blog series, finding out some of the back stories behind selections. This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Luxembourg.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the six founder members of the European Union and the current President of the European Commission is Luxembourgish. Their nominations for Europeana 280 span 900 years of cultural heritage from five institutions and were coordinated by the Ministry of Culture. What are the highlights of their selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Music for the eyes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Luxembourg is one of the countries that also chose to reflect national literary and linguistic traditions in their artistic nominations for Europeana 280. Roger Manderscheid (1933-2010) was a radical poet, novelist and playwright as well as being a renowned visual artist. According to the Centre national de literature about their selection Schrëftbild 1998, Manderscheid referred to his calligraphic images as ‘music for the eyes’. These are playful works where the artist let loose his imagination, according to the CNL: “purely ornamental, non-functional drawing characterized by rich colour nuances and an elegant aesthetic.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Museum of Modern Art Grand-Duc Jean selected another contemporary Luxembourg artist whose creative energies extended across many different aspects of popular culture including digital media. According to Lisa Baldelli of MUDAM: “After consultation with our Ministry of Culture, we decided to submit an artwork by Michel Majerus, who was born in Luxembourg in 1967 and died in 2002. He was regarded as one of the most promising painters of its generation and left a remarkable body of work.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nomination <em>Halbzeit</em>, relates to the commercialization of time. “The slogan Thirst - juice. Desire - product, is the rhythm which links consumer and advertising: the minimum time required to bypass reflection”, according to the museum. Majerus, whose work was very much about exploring new frontiers in art, addressed the borders between installation and painting – one commission was a skate ramp. He died in a plane crash aged only 35 and the selection for the Europeana 280 collection is one of his last paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Send in the clowns</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Two selections from the early 20th century show the impact of artistic movements that were influencing painters all over Europe at differing times. Dominique Lang (1874-1919) is considered Luxembourg’s most important impressionist painter though he worked in other styles as well. After studying in Antwerp, he turned towards symbolism, but also created art showing the influence of Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites. Impressionism was a dominant movement in Luxembourg art for a considerable period of time and according to the Musée national d’histoire et d’art Luxembourg, Lang was painting at the peak of his powers when he created the painting <em>Le Barrage</em> (1913): “His sense of nature and the authenticity of his approach fall into the great tradition of Monet, Renoir and Pissarro.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/2063622-lux-280-005.jpeg\" style=\"width: 444px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Tête de Clown (1937), Joseph Kutter (1894-1941), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063622/LUX_280_005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Musée national d'histoire et d'art Luxembourg</a>. Expressionist Joseph Kutter is Luxembourg’s most renowned 20th century artist. Anxieties about his illness were represented through his painting of clowns.</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another selection from MNHA is a work by Joseph Kutter, Luxembourg’s most renowned artist of the 20th century. Born in 1894, he was also influenced by impressionism and after studies in Munich, German expressionism. But his main influences were French and Belgian art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1924, he returned to Luxembourg and became a leading member of the Luxembourg Secession in 1927 along with Claus Cito, Nico Klopp and Auguste Trémon. These artists, all of whom had studied in Munich, not only wanted to free themselves from 19th century academicism but also from impressionism. When he became incurably ill in the 1930s, Kutter dealt with his pain by painting a series of clowns. These become vehicles for his suffering and his anxiety about his own illness – which doctors were unable to diagnose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's not the first time Kutter has represented his homeland. When countries were asked to select an artwork representing their nation in the 50th anniversary of the European Union in 2007, Kutter was chosen to represent Luxembourg. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Iconomaques</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-figurative work did not come into its own in Luxembourg until after the Second World War. Influenced by the School of Paris, and its many avant-garde movements, the Salon de la Nouvelle Equipe took place in 1948 and the Iconomaques (iconoclasts) group was established in 1954. Two of its founders – Joseph Probst and Michel Stoffel – are abstract selections for the Europeana 280 collection. Stoffel was also a writer publishing essays on art and in 1944, La Clef de Mélusine, a patriotic interpretation of a mythical tale featuring Seigfried and Mélusine (often depicted as a mermaid) and their battles against dark forces. Published just before Luxembourg’s liberation from Nazi occupation, it was ‘un mythe essentiellement luxembourgeois’ according to Stoffel’s introduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to appreciating more art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>Europeana Cloud Final Event at the Historical Museum, The Hague, 6 April 2016</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By Joanna Goodman MBA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Cloud Final Event on 6 April at the Historical Museum, The Hague, was a roundtable discussion on the outcomes of the project aimed at identifying recommendations for cloud infrastructures for the cultural heritage sector. The event was imaginatively titled Shooting for the Moon with the aim of finding the ideal set up for facilitating online access to Europe’s cultural heritage – in terms of making material as easy as possible to upload, store and access digital images and related metadata and finding innovative new ways of delivering, combining and accessing digital assets via the Europeana portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/final-event-europeana-cloud-6-april-2016-pavel.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first two discussion sessions of the event covered practical technology topics: data privacy and security and service procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data privacy and security are major issues for other industries, but for the cultural heritage sector they are operational considerations rather than huge challenges, which is why the session describes them as ‘good problems’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data security is more about data ownership and copyright as cultural heritage data is being collected specifically to broaden public access, although Daniele Catteddu of the Cloud Security Alliance highlighted the need to control how it is shared and used. The technology challenge is cultural, but not in a heritage or artistic sense: the misgivings that some industries have about entrusting their data to the cloud do not really apply here, and this needs to be communicated to Europeana’s stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procurement is an important consideration, and here we heard sensible advice from global experts around common challenges for any organisation moving to cloud computing As Arthur van der Wees of Arthur’s Legal observed, it’s important to have an exit strategy, to allow for future technology developments – for example VR (virtual reality) and the IoT (Internet of Things) offer fantastic opportunities to experience cultural heritage in new and exciting ways that were not considered possible just a few years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third session focused sharply on strategy and culture. First we heard a presentation by Dirk van Rooy, European Commission, DG Information Society and Media, who gave us an update on the very latest developments in the European Commission’s cloud policy.. We heard how Europeana was genuinely learning by doing, to the extent of changing its strategic direction to incorporate, the interviews with key stakeholders and partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of major changes were made to the initial strategy, simply because of technological developments, including the widespread adoption of cloud infrastructure and the falling cost of data storage. The project’s 2012 objectives included cost-effective content and metadata storage, but as the cost of storage has fallen drastically, cheap storage will not be considered as one of the project’s major benefits. Feedback highlighted the need for more user-friendly data aggregation and web publishing tools as the existing ones are outdated and cumbersome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This session highlighted an important challenge – probably for all EC-funded projects. The proposal documents that the European Commission requires in order to provide project funding is so detailed that it is difficult for a project to change direction part-way through – this does not mean that the project itself is a failure, but that feedback and results of the work as it develops could signal the need for a change in direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/final-event-europeana-cloud-6-april-2016-panel.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panel discussed the difficulties of pitching for project funding, particularly in relation to projects that involve rapidly changing technology. Paul Iske from Maastricht University highlighted his philosophy about brilliant failures, which is basically about incorporating flexibility and agility into project proposals without anyone feeling that resources were being ‘wasted’. Rather it’s about investing resources into finding the right direction. One way of clarifying that would be more transparency, for example to publish the interim findings. As one panellist said, if we knew the outcome, it wouldn’t be called research!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final two sessions covered communication – how to explain cloud technologies to different audiences and stakeholders, and ensure that all partners and contributors shared a mutual understanding of particular terminology. This might sound straightforward, but as cloud computing has gone through multiple iterations over the past decade or so, clarifying and reiterating definitions and terms is an essential starting point of any cloud project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we heard about current use cases, including Hamburg’s Smart City project. Pavel Kats wrapped up the event which was followed by a tour of the museum. It was a privilege to hear how Europeana Cloud will broaden global access to the arts and culture. It’s an inspiring project that uses technology to support Europe’s academic, educational and cultural heritage.</p>"

        body: "<p>Today, Thursday 14 April, Europeana and the DPLA are launching <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/\">rightsstatements.org</a>. RightsStatements.org provides <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en\">11 standardized rights statements</a> for online cultural heritage objects that can be used by cultural heritage institutions around the world. The rights statements make it easy to see if and how online cultural heritage works can be re-used. <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2016/04/14/announcing-the-launch-of-rightsstatements-org/\" target=\"_blank\">See press release</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/rightsstatement.org-screen-shot.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rightsstatements.org is the outcome of the International Rights Statements Working Group that was set up in 2014 by Europeana and the DPLA with support from the <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/\">Knight Foundation</a>. Other members of this Working Group include <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://kl.nl/\">Kennisland</a> and key stakeholders from Europeana and the DPLA’s networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task of the Working Group was to build a set of internationally interoperable rights statements based on the principles of the existing Europeana Licensing Framework. Until now, the Europeana Licensing framework - which has been been widely recognized as a best practice model when it comes to communicating the rights and re-use status of digitized cultural heritage objects - makes use of rights statements that have been specifically developed for use by Europeana. The Working Group was tasked with developing rights statements that work independent of a specific national or regional context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In combination with the Creative Commons Licenses and Public Domain tools the rights statements launched today cover the whole spectrum of copyright situations encountered by cultural heritage institutions that make their collections available online. The rights statements have been designed with both human users and machine users (such as search engines) in mind and are made available as linked data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By developing these rights statements Europeana and the DPLA want to contribute to increased standardization across our projects and collaborate with other similar initiatives around the world. Having standardized rights statements that are used by cultural heritage institutions globally will make it easier for our users to understand how they can engage with the cultural content that is made available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The #DPLAfest marks the kickoff for the DPLA’s effort to use the new rights statements, and Europeana plans to implement the new rights statements into the existing Europeana Licensing Framework before the end of the year. This process will begin at the upcoming Aggregators Forum in the Hague, and you can find more information about how this will happen <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/IPR/rightsstatements-org-factsheet.pdf\">in this factsheet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Want to know more?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find more information about the rights statements and the technical architecture of RightsStatements.org in two White Papers. The White Paper <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/files/160208recommendations_for_standardized_international_rights_statements_v1.1.pdf\">“Recommendations for Standardized International Rights Statements”</a> outlines the design principle behind our rights statements, and provides detailed information about each individual Rights Statement. The <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/files/160322requirements_for_the_technical_infrastructure_for_standardized_international_rights_statements_v1.1.pdf\">“Requirements for the Technical Infrastructure for Standardized International Rights Statements”</a> White Paper describes the technical underpinnings of our Rights Statements.</p>"

        title: '40 languages, 30 countries and over 280 artworks: Europeana’s Art History Challenge on Wikimedia'
        posttype: News

        body: "<p><strong>This weekend marks the start of an exciting strand of the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2016/02/introducing-europeana-280/\">Europeana 280 campaign</a>, which launches in full next week. It’s the beginning of a six-week competition (15 April - 30 May) on Wikipedia to write and translate articles about each of the magnificent nominated artworks.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge\">The Europeana Art History Challenge on Wikimedia</a>: a challenge to get local communities across the continent engaged with the campaign’s artworks, and increase accessibility of information about these artworks too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/280-visualisation.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 508px;\"><br><em>A few of the Europeana 280 nominations visualised by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hayify\">@hayify</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the artworks that have been nominated as part of Europeana 280 will now receive their own dedicated Wikipedia articles. What better way to illustrate both the value of open cultural heritage and the idea of unity in diversity that the campaign embodies than bring together volunteers across the continent, all writing encyclopedia articles about each other’s important artworks in their own languages?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's also one of Wikipedia’s largest ever translation competitions to date! By setting the challenge to give each of the Europeana 280 campaign artworks its own Wikipedia article, we are targeting the creation of over 10,000 artwork/Wikipedia-language pairs across dozens of European languages! You can see the complete table of artworks and languages we are tracking from the 30 countries taking part <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Data#Translations\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and Wikimedia have a long history of working together. Last year, a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/new-recommendations-outline-ways-to-strengthen-europeanas-future\">Europeana Task Force </a>outlined the best ways to deepen this relationship, and its primary recommendations included embedding Wikimedia directly into major activities and technology, and also to focus on the emerging potential of Wikidata. The Europeana 280 offered an exciting opportunity to put this plan into action!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikidata not only forms the base of this challenge, we are leveraging its technology too. Wikidata is the database connecting all the different Wikipedia language editions together when they have articles on the same subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every single one of the artworks in Europeana 280 also includes a reference to its associated Wikidata item, and vice versa. In the future, it might be possible to automatically show visitors to Europeana snippets of Wikipedia articles for the artwork they are viewing, in their own language, simply by asking you the language preference of your web-browser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the moment, however, the focus is on the volunteer Wikimedia communities across Europe who are involved in this challenge. There are over <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge#By_participating_country\">30 participating countries</a> who will be attempting to improve the coverage of Art History across <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge#By_language\">40 language editions</a> of Wikipedia. To mark the start of the challenge this weekend, there will be “editathons” - in-person Wikipedia editing events - held at participating museums across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/fireshot-capture-21-jason-evans-on-twitter-tomorrow-nlw-https-twitter.com-wiki-nlw-statu.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 421px;\"><br><em>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WIKI_NLW/status/720227352077344768/photo/1\">tweet</a> from Jason Evans' about the National Library of Wales' Europeana 280 editathon</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One participant is the National Library of Wales: their Wikipedian in Residence, Jason Evans, will be helping library staff to tackle the Welsh nominations: “The National Library of Wales is thrilled to be sharing a cross selection of its iconic Welsh artwork for the Europeana 280 campaign. Wales has a strong cultural and artistic heritage with its own unique identity and I hope that by improving Wikipedia content about our chosen artworks we can share this rich heritage with a global audience”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll be sharing more details from different events across the continent soon. If you would like to participate in this challenge - and perhaps win some prizes! - sign up <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Participants\">on the participation page</a> or contact <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Participants#Organisers\">your local Wikimedia organiser</a>. You can also follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europeana280?src=hash\">#Europeana280</a> to stay up to date with the campaign.</p>"

        body: "<p>On 29 - 30 June 2016, the Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) will organize a conference during the Netherlands’ Presidency of the EU. The conference is titled: ‘<a href=\"https://b-com.mci-group.com/EventPortal/Information/EventInformation.aspx?EventInformationPageCode=WELCOME&amp;EventCode=OCWEUCDCH\">READY TO REACH OUT: Connecting Cultural Heritage Collections and Serving Wider Audiences</a>’. Europeana Network Association members are invited to attend and can <a href=\"https://b-com.mci-group.com/EventPortal/Information/EventInformation.aspx?EventInformationPageCode=REGISTRATION&amp;EventCode=OCWEUCDCH\">register online</a> until 1 May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/2048426-item-q36gtyafkgvd3wovfkvdfp25z4bnvpcf.jpeg\" style=\"width: 562px; height: 194px;\"><br><em>Detail from Kapitel VI. Michelangelos Verhältnis zu Dante, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048426/item_Q36GTYAFKGVD3WOVFKVDFP25Z4BNVPCF.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bauhaus-Universität Weimar. Universitätsbibliothek​</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last November, the Dutch Ministry of Culture asked the Europeana Members Council to support the event, and advise on potential speakers and themes. It was a great chance for the Members Council to act on behalf of the Europeana Network Association, and demonstrate the pertinence of our members and their expertise to the wider European cultural landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, <strong>Tjeerd de Boer, ‎Senior Advisor at the Ministry</strong>, highlights the main aims of the conference, the must-see speakers and the people expected to take part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference has three main themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Engaging Audiences: Taking Visibility and Re-Use as the Starting Point</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Digesting Cultural Impact: How Digitization is Changing our Institutions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The Network Approach: Reinforcement of the Digital Heritage Infrastructure</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We expect to host Ministries of culture from across Europe, EU and European Commission representatives, policymakers and key players from the cultural heritage sector, Europeana Network Association members included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speakers announced so far include Jet Bussemaker, Dutch minister for Education, Culture and Science, Martine Reicherts and Marjan Hammersma - DG Media and Culture - from the European Commission, Georgia Abeltino from the Google Cultural Institute, Alexy Karenowska from the Institute for Digital Archaeology and Maarten Pronk from Rijksmuseum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 280 campaign (which launches in full with a #BigArtRide event in Brussels on 21 April) will also be presented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This focus - particularly on re-use and the strengths of networks in the heritage sector - is obviously of great relevance to Europeana’s broad community of cultural heritage, technology and creative professionals. We hope members of the Europeana Network Association will join us there! <a href=\"https://b-com.mci-group.com/EventPortal/Information/EventInformation.aspx?EventInformationPageCode=REGISTRATION&amp;EventCode=OCWEUCDCH\">Register your interest before 1 May</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Finland'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>This week, on 21 April, we'll launch Europeana 280 with a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Campaigns/Europeana_280/introducing-europe's-bigartride.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">#BigArtRide event</a> taking place in both Brussels and Amsterdam, and the introductory chapter of our brand new virtual exhibition, <em>Faces of Europe, </em>which includes awe-inspiring works from all 29 countries taking part in the campaign. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We also continue this weekly blog series, finding out some of the back stories behind selections. This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Finland.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When one of Finland’s best-loved paintings was first displayed in 1903 at the annual exhibition of the Finnish Art Society, there was no title for the work - simply a dash. This was the artist’s way of saying that there was no single interpretation or reading of the painting. It’s a reminder that, while we get a fascinating insight into how countries see themselves through their cultural choices for Europeana 280, over 300 artists will also challenge us as individuals. <em>The Wounded Angel</em> by Hugo Simberg (it eventually acquired a title) is one of many fascinating choices from Finland whose nominations were coordinated by the Finnish National Gallery. What are the highlights of their final selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Father of Finnish arts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert Wilhelm Ekman (1808-1873) has often been dubbed the pioneer and father of Finnish fine arts. He studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts from 1824 and received a scholarship to fund his travels in the Netherlands, France and Italy. But even as a student, Ekman wanted to portray ordinary people. The nomination for Europeana 280, <em>Kreeta Haapasalo - Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage</em> from the Finnish National Gallery, shows different strata of society joined together to celebrate their common musical heritage. The historical context of this painting is the Finnish ‘national awakening’ of the mid-19th century when Finnish culture – particularly music and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021001/https___viola_linneanet_fi_vwebv_holdingsInfo_bibId_664169.html\">song</a> - was promoted as a means of nation building. The reality (as shown by Tsar Alexander’s portrait hanging on the wall) was that Finland would remain a Grand Duchy of Russia until 1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But despite the political uncertainties, the last few decades of the 19th century are considered part of the golden age of Finnish art. As their country moved away from historic ties to Russia and Sweden, artists looked beyond their borders for cultural inspiration and many of them were drawn to Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/finland-280-600x.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 515px;\"><br><em>Out into the World (1889), Maria Wiik, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063618/FI_280_004.html\">Finnish National Gallery</a>, CC BY<br>\r\nChanging roles for women at the end of the 19th century as portrayed by Finnish artist Maria Wiik. A bronze medal winner at the Exposition Universelle of 1900.</em>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>International exposure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Albert Edelfelt (1854-1905) was one of the first artists from Finland to gain international fame. He studied at the drawing school of the Finnish Art Society and at the Antwerp Academy of Art in Belgium before stating at the Ecole Nationale des Beux Arts where he soon won medals and awards. The selection for Europeana 280, <em>The Luxembourg Gardens, Paris</em>, is the only large-scale work he made depicting Paris and symbolizes his close relationship with the city and how it was the epicentre of the art world in those times. The Exposition Universelles (a form of 19th century madness, according to Gustave Flaubert) were an important space for artists to promote their work. In Paris in 1900, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2024913/photography_ProvidedCHO_Parisienne_de_Photographie_79882_25.html\">the Finnish Pavilion designed by Eliel Saarinen</a> was a triumph and Finnish artists, selected by Edelfelt (and including Simberg), also exhibited in the Russian fine arts section in the Grand Palais on the Champs-Elysées.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Out into the World</em> (1889), by Maria Wiik, was a bronze medal winner at the 1900 Exposition Universelle. Women played a prominent role in Finnish arts during this period and Wiik was a key member of the Scandinavian group of artists in Paris at the end of the 1870s. She painted light-filled landscapes, and like other plein-air artists, painted in Brittany, Pont-Aven and also in St Ives, Cornwall, but was particularly known for insightful portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Finnish Modernism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Later 20th century art movements were significant in Finland and nominations for Europeana 280 include examples of several including cubism, modernism and symbolism. Yrjö Ollila was an impressionist and member of the Septem group that set up in 1909, but in the 1920s, he lived in Paris with his family and his painting style changed. The work nominated for Europeana 280 is <em>Hearing the Homework</em> and an example of 1920s classicism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vilho Lampi is considered a tragic figure in Finland due to the manner of his death. On 17 March 1936, he threw himself into the River Oulujoki in his hometown of Oulu and drowned. His body was found later that spring. The self-portrait chosen for the collection is an example of magic realism where representational art is mixed with elements of fantasy. For the viewer (who is addressed directly), there’s an air of mystery or ambiguity. What seems like an ordinary scene is not quite what it seems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to unveiling more surprising art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign very soon. In the meantime, follow the conversation on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europeana280?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">#Europeana280</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>Today, we’re kickstarting <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/Europeana280\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 280</a>, our cross-border campaign to get Europe excited about its shared art heritage and celebrate <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art History Collections</a> - and we want you to join us as we promote it across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign, which we’ve been building up to with a weekly blog here on Pro, invited all 28 EU Member States to identify 10 works held in their national collections that have helped define Europe’s art history. All 28, and Norway, said yes, resulting in a collection of over 300 works of art that tell the story of Europe’s art down the centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/facesofeurope.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 302px;\"><br><em>A screenshot from our new virtual exhibition, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/FacesofEurope\">Faces of Europe</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re launching our unfolding virtual exhibition, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/FacesofEurope\">Faces of Europe</a>, bringing together magnificent artworks from all 29 countries taking part in the campaign. The introductory part unveiled today gives a glimpse of the exciting journey ahead. Caravaggio, Goya, Velázquez, Munch and Manet… There are lots of famous names from European art. But what about Leis Malle or Hanna Pauli? True to the spirit of Europeana 280, household names from art history sit side by side with their fascinating but less widely known counterparts. Every fortnight from today until July, we’ll unveil a new chapter, and touch on themes like revolution, the inspiration of nature and ideas of truth and beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/FacesofEurope\">Explore the exhibition</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get people interacting with the artworks contributed in fun and innovative ways, we’ll also be starting a series of public events in cities across Europe with the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/big-art-ride\">#BigArtRide</a> - a ground-breaking mix of virtual reality, great art and... cycling!

        body: "<p>In the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> project we aimed to ingest a great variety of data with special relevance to scholars and the Humanities and Social Sciences, i.e. the core target audience of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a>. In a previous <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-cloud-ingesting-for-the-future\">blogpost</a>, I highlighted some examples of data sets that we ingested in this context. In addition, the project ingested a wide range of materials which enhanced the existing Europeana dataset, and reflects Europe’s linguistic and cultural diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valuable scholarly metadata (a total of over 2.4 million items) was sourced from institutions as diverse as the Croatian Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Hungarian University of Debrecen, and the Bavarian Library Consortium. Languages featured include Czech, Dutch, German, English, French, Italian, Latin, Russian, Greek and Hungarian. The datasets cover a great variety of materials, including digitised maps, manuscripts, incunabula, archival materials, pamphlets, playbills, dissertations and journals, as well as visual materials such as portraits, architectural drawings, photographs, images of plaster casts, films and video. Topics covered include (in no particular order) political studies, economics, law, philology, linguistics, psychology, education, history, Judaic studies, philosophy, religion, theatre studies, history of fencing, folklore, architecture, geography, literature, Egyptology, medieval history, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/mitropolitul-andrei-saguna.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 329px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bust (1920): <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200400/BibliographicResource_3000117442569.html\">Mitropolitul Andrei Saguna</a> (1808-1873), from the Biblioteca Facultatii deTeologie \"Andrei Saguna’din Sibiu\". Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new content, with solid contributions from Belgium, Croatia, Finland and Romania filled some of the lacunae in the existing dataset, while adding audio and video files from the middle of the 20th century helped to address the 20th-century black hole in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project aggregated metadata for digital objects (including, of course, the all-important link to this object), but a second task in the Ingestion Work Package worked on the ingestion of actual digital content. The project ingested Newspaper material and content contributed by project partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several associate partners of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers project</a> had not been able to aggregate their full-text/digitized newspapers under the umbrella of that project. The Cloud project subsequently stepped in to load the data for some of these libraries in the course of the Europeana Cloud project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The datasets for the National Libraries of Belgium and Iceland were thus processed. The dataset of the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR) resulted in 17,129 metadata records, and 135,330 thumbnails. As the KBR image server is not fully supported by the The European Library portal the images are not currently visible in the Newspaper browser that was developed for the Newspaper project. 302,172 records for full text issues from the National and University Library of Iceland (BOK) have also been processed. Both datasets will be migrated to the Cloud infrastructure and will then be available via the Europeana Cloud API in the same way as the newspaper collections that were part of the Europeana Newspaper project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newspaper collection of the National Library of Wales became part of the Research and Development work published in Europeana Cloud <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Cloud/Deliverables/D4.4%20Recommendations%20For%20Enhancing%20EDM%20to%20Support%20Research%20Oriented%20Content.pdf\">D4.4, Recommendations for enhancing EDM</a> to represent digital content. Together with the National Library of Wales, the Europeana Research and Development team explored improved Europeana data interoperability with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Image_Interoperability_Framework\">IIIF</a>. The work on making use of IIIF to present this newspaper data holds a great promise for a much better user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/\">Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Centre - PSNC</a> has ingested its 1.8 million thumbnails into the Europeana Cloud infrastructure. With this migration the Europeana Cloud has become the repository from which the images are drawn when a results set is displayed in the PSNC search interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open University is responsible for <a href=\"http://core.ac.uk/\">COnnecting REpositories - CORE</a>. The mission of CORE is to aggregate all open access research outputs from repositories and journals worldwide and make them available to the public. Five million digital objects were added to the Europeana Cloud infrastructure, in five representations (oai-pmh xml representation of the original record; enriched json representation of the above metadata; .pdf file of the article (where available); extracted text (if the above pdf was available); and a thumbnail preview of the article (if pdf was available) in png format).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both metadata and content ingested in the course of this project are stored in the Europeana Cloud, with the aim of creating a supportive environment for innovative exploration and analysis of Europe’s digitised content. Europeana Cloud is not an archive but supports active storage and direct access to European cultural heritage content for its manipulation and reuse. Europeana Cloud data may be accessed, and downloaded, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Cloud/wiki/Europeana-Cloud-API\">Europeana Cloud API</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20Cloud%20blog%20images/portolan-charts-and-portolan-charts.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 280px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200271/BibliographicResource_3000058904036.html\">Oliva, Franciscus, n.d.

        intro: null
        body: "<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu/fileadmin/ENUMERATE/documents/ENUMERATE_Conceptual_Framework.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">latest ENUMERATE survey</a>, which gathered feedback from about a thousand memory organizations in Europe, the median budget spent on ICT per cultural institution is about €15,000 each year. Given that there are roughly 40 times more institutions in Europe than the number surveyed, the total annual budget could be as high as €600 million. 26% of this budget, the survey goes on to suggest, fuels the commercial market of heritage ICT vendors. And yet at the moment, this crucial group is invisible within the Europeana Network Association. What can we do to address this, and why should we?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What can software companies contribute to the Europeana community?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s not just economic reasons that mean it would be useful to get these companies more involved in the digital heritage community. Largely, they share our mission of working with information and knowledge for public good. It’s this that compensates for the comparatively modest commercial gains cultural projects offer - memory organizations tend to be small businesses with small budgets and, let’s face it, not always the easiest customers either!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/15801-ediprouteurbml-ediprouteurbml-aspx-application-affl-26action-rechercherdirectement-nuid-558-affl-3baffichervuesurenregistrement-vue-fiche-principal-3bafficherframeset.jpeg\" style=\"width: 448px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Ils ont construit des cathédrales, Equipe \"Alain-Fournier\", 1940-1944, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15801/eDipRouteurBML_eDipRouteurBML_aspx_Application_AFFL_26Action_RechercherDirectement_NUID___558__AFFL_3BAfficherVueSurEnregistrement_Vue_Fiche_Principal_3BAfficherFrameset.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon</a>, public domain.</em>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As commercial businesses with a technical specialism, they have plenty to offer the Europeana Network that complements the expertise of heritage professionals and the research carried out in the sector. It is their mission to develop, sell, maintain and service ICT solutions in a sustainable way. Furthermore, as the heritage industry is information-based, we stand to gain from these companies with their knowledge of targeted information management. This is knowledge derived from their work with a huge range of public information services – a much broader range than the scope of heritage professionals. It’s this that opens up opportunities for us to strengthen our Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Europeana Inside</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Inside was a Best Practice Network (BPN) that previously tried to better involve this sector in the digital heritage community, through collaboration between CMS vendors, and between vendors and their clients. The sharing of knowledge within the project lead to what are known as ‘system-agnostic workflows’, based on requirements for sharing collections supported by IT solutions and named ECK, or the Easy Connection Kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the project ended, at the start of 2015, the idea was to make the BPN part of the Europeana Network. This turned out to be trickier than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating a workflow which connects Europeana Collections all the way through to the individual data curators at heritage institution was not fully resolved by the project. Although almost a million objects made it onto Europeana, there were challenges too: the BPN aimed towards greater control and the instant exchange of collections – something that Europeana, at the time, could not support. As a result, vendors could not offer their clients an easy connection to Europeana, in turn meaning there was reduced demand from clients to participate in Europeana. As such, the technical vendors had no reason to remain involved in the BPN once the project was over.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bringing the BPN back to life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can we revive this Best Practice Network?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I approached one of the vendors involved, Semantika, whose director, Sašo, is a member of the Members Council. Together, we talked to Europeana and arranged a pre-conference as part of Europeana’s AGM in Amsterdam in November 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussions held showed that everyone shared a professional drive to make more use of the digital collections available in content management systems around Europe – even if each organization had a different idea about how to do it. Generally, the vendors felt that they could do a great deal for Europeana – all run successful businesses with large user bases willing to pay for the tools and services they offer. These user bases bring together the data of thousands of collections – and the vendors bring technical knowledge and skills that can support curators in making data of the highest possible quality available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Collaborative agenda</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, the participants gathered ideas for collaboration in the short and longer term. Europeana Cloud offers some opportunity to further experiment with automated exchange of collection data without direct visibility in Europeana’s portal. The validation and preview services developed by Europeana Inside were on the wish list of Europeana’s development team. As concrete actions, Knowledge Integration was subcontracted in DSI-1 and will be a partner in DSI-2, when the full re-engineering of the aggregation infrastructure will start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizations like DEN and Collections Trust see the legacy of Europeana Inside in terms of knowledge and quality. The functional requirements against which the ECK was built, and the user guidelines that have been written, can help stimulate greater use of more generic workflows and tools. More control on the side of content providers is important for their commitment to better quality data - here I believe the collaboration with CMS vendors can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>See you next year?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until now, the Easy Connection Kit, available in a number of European CMSs as a result of Europeana Inside, is used for several data exchange initiatives but not for Europeana. Now these vendors are a part of our Network, we can realistically hope that – by the next AGM in Riga this year – there will be enough incentive to use the Easy Connection Kit for Europeana too. The benefits this brings will be visible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<p><strong>Last week saw the launch of Europeana 280 with the start of the brilliant #BigArtRide tour in The Hague and Brussels, and the first part of our new virtual exhibition Faces of Europe, showcasing beautiful artworks from every country taking part. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As art lovers across Europe begin to explore the over 300 fascinating works contributed, we continue this weekly blog series, delving a little deeper into each country’s selections. This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights nominations from Croatia.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Croatia joined the EU in 2013, although with its unique natural and cultural treasures, it has always been a strong part of Europe. Nominations for Europeana 280 reflect several periods of vivid and complex history but particularly focus on contemporary work from the many groups active in the second half of the 20th century. The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia - as the national aggregator for Europeana - coordinated the nominations by inviting Croatian cultural institutions to join the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Benković and the Baroque</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters was opened on 9 November 1884 with 256 works from Bishop J. J. Strossmayer. From its collection comes a work <em>Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac</em> painted in 1715 from a late Baroque Dalmation painter, Federiko Benkovíc. This big composition shows how Abraham, in carrying out God's mission to sacrifice his own son, is stopped at the last minute by an angel. The painting is one of four compositions that Benković, ‘the last great Schiavone’, painted in 1715 for the Schönborn castle in Pommersfelden. It was purchased for the Strossmayer Gallery at the London art market in 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/croatian-work.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 419px;\"><br><em>A screenshot of a Croatian work featuring in the introduction to Faces of Europe, our new virtual exhibition. A new part of the exhibition will be launched every two weeks until July. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Early avant-garde</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Marino Tartaglia (1894-1984) was one of the painters who introduced the avant-garde into Croatian art. Born in Zagreb, he left for Italy in the turbulent times before the First World War and studied and worked in Rome, Florence and Paris. After returning home in 1931, he began to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts and enjoyed a long career, participating in hundreds of exhibitions including the Venice Biennale of 1940. The Museum of Contemporary Art describes their selection of his <em>Autoportret </em>(1917) as ‘an exceptional example of expressionism in Croatian painting’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architect and painter Josip Seissel was an urban planner, but under the pseudonym Jo Klek, also participated in avant-garde movements around the Group Travelers and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92002/BibliographicResource_1000093325441_source.html\">Zenit</a> magazine. His painting <em>Pafama </em>(1922), another selection from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, is considered to be the first abstract composition of Croatian modern art and has been described by them as their ‘trademark’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Croatian art on the international stage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Naive art plays a special role in Croatia’s art heritage. The Croatian Museum of Naive Art, opened in 1952, is the first museum institution in the world that was founded to record, collect, study and present this form of art. A group of artists from a small village on the border of Hungary, which became known as the Hlebine School, attracted international recognition. Ivan Rabuzin is a painter of lyrical and idealised landscapes, founded on the sequencing of circles or circular forms, brimming with optimism and spirituality. His unique style and the distinct modernism of his visual expression has been recognised and appreciated on a worldwide scale, used for theatre curtains in Japan and even <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048053/MUO_016879.html\">tableware</a>, including a line designed for famous manufacturer Rosenthal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exat 51 and Gorgona</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Artists of the 1950s who wanted to put some distance between officially sanctioned styles, such as socialist realism, and their own artistic freedom, included members of the Exat 51 Group. In their manifesto, they declared that ‘non­figurative or so-called abstract art are not expressions of decadent aspirations’. Ivan Picelj was a founder member and a key work from his participation in the group - <em>In Honour of El Lissitzki</em> (1956) - is a Europeana 280 selection: an homage to Lissitzky, an important figure of the Russian avant-garde.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another 1950s collective, but of a completely different nature, was the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048053/MUO_024410.html\">Gorgona</a> group. Although they held exhibitions (Studio G) and published an ‘anti-magazine’ (11 editions, including one by British writer <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020112/media_e164aa299a_8_1_tif_thumbsize_s.html\">Harold Pinter</a>), these didn’t follow conventional patterns. There was no artistic manifesto and the work of each individual artist (whether painter, sculptor or writer) remained distinct. The shared ideal was the freedom of art. Painter Julije Knifer (1924-2004) was a member, and the Europeana 280 nomination <em>Meander </em>(1960), is an example of his repetitive (and from 1960, single) artistic motif, where form and content were reduced to a minimum. Knifer referred to them as anti-paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their more unusual forms of communication or ‘Gorgona behaviour’ such as sending invitations – please attend – but without giving a place or time, reflect the legacy of Dada. An exhibition of Gorgona work was held in February 2016 in Zurich as part of the city’s year-long program to mark Dada’s centenary in the city where it started. If the aims and intentions of Gorgona are complex, the same applies to Dada, as in their famous saying: “Only Dadaists know what Dada is. And they don’t tell anyone.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can discover <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=croatia&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">each of Croatia’s thought-provoking nominations</a> on Europeana Art History Collections – tell us which you like best using #Europeana280.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

Please note that we'll do our best to release all these new products and features, but there's likely to be some changes as the year progresses. It's also important to mention that we'll be aiming to release new products early and new features frequently in order to get your feedback to make them better. As such, not everything will be perfect on first release, and we appreciate your patience and help in honing the new and updated services. We’ll return during the year with updates and product news when we have them!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do alpha, beta and in production mean?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alpha</strong>: an early test of software where availability is not guaranteed at all and features and design can change frequently, even daily. The purpose is primarily to perform technical tests but also to get user input as early as possible in the development process. The alpha testing period is typically longer than the beta testing period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beta:</strong> a post-alpha test of software primarily for the purpose of quality, performance and stability control. While features and design can change the change are typically of a fine-tuning character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Production</strong>: when software has passed the beta test it is released for real use, it enters production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*This blog was inspired by our friends at DigitalNZ. <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/blog/posts/changes-afoot-in-2016\">Read about their plans</a> for 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

All are protected by copyright but were never created with commercial intent. As they are all housed in various cultural heritage institutions across Europe, they have all ‘acquired’ the status of being recognised as signifiers of social and cultural importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tension between respecting copyright, which prevents institutions publishing such works, whilst also fulfilling the primary role of museums, libraries and archives - to encourage the public to discover and learn about their own cultural heritage - has become more present in a digital space. Platforms such as Europeana and other digital projects provide a way to reach new audiences for collections, and people who may never otherwise be able to see these cultural treasures - but only if copyright allows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many organisations hold 20th century materials by well-known authors and creators which are of high commercial value. There is also a vast amount of material ranging from core collections and archives such as books, photographs, monographs and film, to more unusual and ephemeral objects like posters, cards, flyers, brochures, legal texts, banners, street signs, buttons, etc. Often these have important socio-cultural value and were not created for commercial sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These collections vary in terms of why they were created and what they represent. However they share a common theme. Most 20th century works are protected by copyright if the term of life of the creator plus 70 years (for most works) has not expired. This means that legally permission should be obtained from the copyright holder before a work can be re-used in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However this presents several challenges for cultural heritage institutions including the time and cost involved in identifying and contacting copyright holders and the legal uncertainty on what a CHI can make available in line with legal frameworks such as the European Orphan Works Directive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The need for change</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, these collections often remain hidden behind closed doors, and in drawers and vaults, never to see the light of the digital day. The lack of 20th century material online is highlighted in our factsheet <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Advocacy/Twentieth%20Century%20Black%20Hole/copy-of-europeana-policy-illustrating-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-the-europeana-dataset.pdf\">‘The 20th Century Black Hole: How does this show up on Europeana?’</a>, and reinforces the position Europeana Foundation and its Network outlined in an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\">Open Letter </a>to the European Commission in October 2015 expressing the need for a change in current copyright rules to make it easier to access cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support the European Commission with their aim to make it easier to publish out-of-commerce works online, as outlined in their communication on copyright reform in 2015, we have worked with 6 institutions representing museum, library and archive collections. They kindly shared their first-hand experiences of balancing the practical day-to-day management of their collection and the expectations in making them available to the public, together with the difficulties they have in clearing rights for digitising certain types of material and making them available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have drawn up <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/IPR/160331rights_clearance_case_studies_public.pdf\">case studies</a> about their experiences which we share with you today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence suggests that cultural heritage institutions largely make decisions on what to publish based on what is likely to be in the public domain, not an Orphan Work, and how much time is likely to be involved to clear rights when there is more than one rights holder for one work. The cost for rights clearance varies hugely and often exceeds the economic value of the work itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, there is good practice for clearing rights within cultural heritage institutions but this could be made easier, more cost-effective and, importantly, allow for more out-of-commerce 20th century material to become visible online with updated copyright rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>To read more about the challenges museums, libraries and archives face in tackling rights clearance of out-of-commerce 20th century material, see the full case study report <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/IPR/160426rights-clearance-case-studies.pdf\">here</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>With the Europeana 280 campaign in full swing across Europe, we continue this weekly blog series, finding out some of the back stories behind each country's selections. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=austria&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;q=europeana+280&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">nominations from Austria</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the world’s greatest Renaissance artifacts, the gold-plated <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063629/AUS_280_002.html\">Saliera</a> (salt cellar), created in Paris by master craftsman Cellini between 1540 and 1543, is the very epitome of treasure. Designed by an Italian, commissioned by a French king, and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum collection in Vienna, it’s one of Austria’s glittering choices for Europeana 280. Nominations come from several institutions that were allowed to select just two objects from their collection according to the brief provided by the Ministry of Culture. What are some highlights of the Austrian selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Graphic masterpieces</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies by Michelangelo Buonarroti and Albrecht Dürer are early 16th century nominations from the Albertina in Vienna. Founded in 1776 by Duke Albert of Saxe-Teschen, the collection includes 65,000 drawings and around a million printed graphic works on paper from all major artistic periods from late Gothic to contemporary. A difficult choice but according to curator Regina Doppelbauer, the nominations are representative of an outstanding resource for these artists at the museum: “The Albertina safeguards some 120 drawings and watercolours and the complete body of graphic prints produced by Dürer, as well as around 4,000 drawings by Italian artists such as Raphael and Michelangelo.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/austrian-x600.jpeg\" style=\"width: 468px; height: 600px;\"><br>\r\nUmar defeats a dragon, attributed to: Dasavanta and Tara (1567 to 1572), <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063629/AUS_280_007.html\" target=\"_blank\">MAK – Austrian Museum of Applied Arts / Contemporary Art</a>, public domain.\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art (MAK), comes a vivid document of the golden age of Hindu-Islamic culture during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar the ‘Great’ (1556-1605). The elaborately detailed paintings in the heroic epic Hamzanama fuse principles of the traditional Persian, Indian, as well as Chinese painting schools. When 60 folios (out of 200 that survive) were presented in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2024911/photography_ProvidedCHO_IMAGNO_brandst_tter_images_GesmbH_00649479.html\">Pavilion of the Persian Empire at the Vienna World’s Fair in 1873</a>, they were immediately acquired by the MAK. As Peter Klinger from the museum stated about their selection: “Even at that time, the museum recognized them as genuine treasure troves of costumes, architecture, vessels, devices, weapons, all of which are ornamented in a most rich and captivating way. They are among the most superb and significant existing anywhere in the world”.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Exemplifying Austrian art</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Belvedere museum, housed in a complex of Baroque palaces in Vienna, nominated two iconic works of national importance, as baroque-curator Dr Georg Lechner explained: “The Simpleton by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt and Gustav Klimt’s Kiss can be seen to exemplify Austrian art. Each belongs to a period of crucial importance to the region of modern-day Austria: the Baroque era and the time around 1900. The accomplishments in art, architecture, and music of these two ages have come to shape the country and its image to this day.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both objects are closely related to the history of the museum’s holdings, according to Lechner. “These collections found a home in the Belvedere palaces, originally constructed for Prince Eugene of Savoy between 1712 and 1723. Klimt’s Kiss – shown in 1908 at the legendary <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15508/DG2003_933.html\">Kunstschau</a> exhibition where it was acquired for the museum – was a key piece at the Moderne Galerie, founded in 1903, which would later evolve and expand into today’s Österreichische Galerie Belvedere. The Baroque collection, on the other hand, including Messerschmidt’s Heads, was established in 1923 following the reorganization of the state museums in the aftermath of the First World War.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Expressionist treasure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over in Germany in the 1920s, expressionism was one of several experimental cultural trends looking to the future that were reflected in film as well as in painting and literature. The poster for the Fritz Lang film Metropolis (1926) was designed by Heinz Schulz-Neudamm and features a female automaton from this forerunner of science fiction films. It is a nomination from The Austrian National Library of Vienna. Few copies from films of the 20s and 30s have survived, and unsurprisingly, this iconic robot has been referred to as the ‘crown jewels’ of film posters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying appreciating the wonderful art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign soon.

        body: "<p><strong>With Europeana 280 in full swing across Europe, we continue this weekly blog series, finding out some of the stories behind the selections. This week Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=germany&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">nominations from Germany</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany has played a crucial role in the development of European art history. The influence of its artists, movements and schools, ranging from masters of the Renaissance to the Vienna and Munich Secessionists and Expressionists of the 20th century, can be seen in Europeana 280 selections from many other countries. Nominations come from collections throughout Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Renaissance masterpieces</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Gallery of Old Masters), part of the Dresden State Art Collections, nominated one of their most famous works, as Dr Andreas Henning, Curator of Italian Painting, explained: “<em>Raffael's Sistine Madonna</em> (1512/1513) is one of the best known Renaissance paintings in the world. We chose this image for the Europeana campaign to share it with an international audience and to welcome people to visit it in Dresden.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two cherubs at the bottom of the painting have also enjoyed solo careers since the beginning of the 19th century. In the exhibition at the museum dedicated to the 500th anniversary of the painting, their versatility as marketing vehicles was on show in products ranging from embroidery and greeting cards to a German baking mix called 'Erotik Brot'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/2063623-ger-280-001-x600.jpeg\" style=\"width: 434px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Self-Portrait with Fur-Trimmed Robe (1500), Albrecht Dürer, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063623/GER_280_001.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alte Pinakothek</a>, Munich, public domain. With this painting Dürer, then 28 years old, created one of the most unusual works in portraiture history.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most unusual self-portraits in all of art is from Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer. According to the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, about their selection: <em>Self-Portrait with Fur-trimmed Robe</em> (1500), Dürer’s gaze and his hand, representing an artist's tool, are emphasized, while the frontality and strong idealization are reminiscent of representations of Christ, aspects which are inseparable from Dürer's early studies of human proportion. The artist’s self-awareness is revealed in its inscription: “Thus I, Albrecht Dürer from Nuremberg, portrayed myself with characteristic colors in my 28th year.\" Dürer was one of the first great sightseers of European art and already famous in his twenties. Many of his vast body of works reflecting his consummate skills as a painter, printmaker and theorist can be seen on Europeana, from collections across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Germany’s Picasso is a woman</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“When we were asked by the State of Bremen, whether we would like to nominate Paula Modersohn-Becker for the Europeana 280 project, we were immediately enthusiastic”, said Verena Borgmann, Curator Museen Böttcherstraße, Bremen. The painter, who worked both in Worpswede and in Paris, plays a prominent role in European Modernism. “By 1900, there was no other German artist who was as radically modern as Paula Modersohn-Becker,” continued Borgmann. “Inspired by French Modernism and searching for simplicity of form, she developed a specific and distinctive visual language that leaves the aesthetic and thematic canon of the 19th century far behind.” Paula Modersohn-Becker’s <em>Self-Portrait on the 6th Wedding Day</em> (1906) also plays an iconic role in art history – it’s the first nude self-portrait by a woman in the world. When exhibitions of her work were shown in Bremen in 2007/8, German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) proclaimed: ‘Germany’s Picasso is a woman’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lady Dada</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hannah Höch was the only woman involved with the Berlin Dada movement and in 1919 she began to use the technique of photomontage. <em>Dada-Rundschau</em> (1919), according to the Berlinische Galerie - Landesmuseum für moderne Kunst, Fotografie und Architektur, is a political kaleidoscope: “In this complex cross-section through the era following the First World War, it is possible to recognise individuals such as the German President Friedrich Ebert wearing bathing trunks and, above him, the American President Woodrow Wilson dressed as an angel of peace”, the museum said about their selection. Höch referred to her work as a parody of the ‘gigantic global nonsense’. As an artist, she examined representations of female identity in the complex postwar period, but also worked for a publisher of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=Die+Praktische+Berlinerin\">craft and fashion magazines</a>. She was a close friend of dadaist Kurt Schwitters, a Europeana 280 nomination from Sprengel Museum Hannover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Klaus Killisch studied at the Art Academy in East-Berlin from 1981-1986 and dkw. Kunstmuseum Dieselkraftwerk Cottbus said about their nomination: “Klaus Killisch is like no other painter of the young in the 1980s generation of artists in the GDR”. Killisch’s work has been represented in many exhibitions of German art including the Venice Biennale. He is also a musician. The selection <em>Tango bis es weh tut</em> (1988) derives its title from the Tom Waits song <em>Tango Till They're Sore</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the diverse art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign.

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Greece'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>With Europeana 280 in full swing across Europe, we continue this weekly blog series, finding out some of the back stories behind selections. This week, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher highlights <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=greece&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;q=Europeana+280&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">nominations from Greece</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mainland Greece was part of the Ottoman Empire for four centuries from the middle of the 15th century and while its earlier art heritage defined a different progression to that of Western Europe, Greek artists were part of the trends of the 19th and 20th centuries that swirled around Europe. This is reflected in some fascinating selections for Europeana 280, all of which come from the National Gallery-Alexandros Soutzos Museum. Here are some highlights from the Greek selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cretan treasures</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Andreas Pavias was painting at a time when Crete was under Venetian rule and known as the Kingdom of Candia. It was an important production centre for Byzantine art and iconography. While earlier commissions were unsigned, artists such as Pavias were now gaining individual fame. The Europeana 280 selection, <em>The Crucifixion</em> (second half of the 15th century) is dramatically narrated on many levels. The dead rise from their graves, a colourful crowd witnesses the event with soldiers playing dice, while angels lament and hold cups to catch the blood of Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domenicos Theotokopoulos (El Greco) was perhaps the most famous Cretan artist who moved from a Byzantine tradition to take different artistic directions in his career. According to the museum, <em>The Entombment of Christ</em> (c.1568-1570) is representative of a particular phase in the artist's development when he sought to assimilate the teachings of the art of the Renaissance, particularly that of Venice, where this work was created.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Romantic Heroes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A selection reflecting Greek history and the War for Independence comes from artist Konstantinos Parthenis. He broke with academic influences and introduced modern styles after training in Italy and Vienna. By the 1920s, he had turned to symbolist and allegorical subjects, and in the 1930s “certainly under conscious or unconscious influence by the predilections of that generation” according to the Musem, Parthenis' style changed again. <em>The Apotheosis of Athanasios Diakos</em> (before 1933), takes as its subject the Greek revolutionary hero who died a martyr's death near the Alamana Bridge on April 24, 1821. This tribute to Diakos is considered one of the crowning masterpieces of modern Greek art.</p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/strawhat.jpg\" style=\"width: 442px; height: 600px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063620/GRE_280_07.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Straw Hat</a> (ca 1925), Nikos Lytras (1883-1927), National Gallery-Alexandros Soutzos Museum, PDM. </em>\r\n\r\n<p>Artist Theodoros Vryzakis grew up in the years covering the war of Greek Independence. After the hanging of his father in 1821, he was sent to an orphanage and then a school in Munich founded by Ludwig I for the orphans of the war. His painting, <em>The Reception of Lord Byron at Missolonghi</em> (1861) reflects the participation of Britain’s most famous poet. Known for his brilliant, reckless personality and his lifelong support for liberal causes, this was Byron’s last great adventure. He died of fever in Missolonghi in 1824 aged only 36. Vryzakis studied at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, and introduced the school to Greece where it was the most important influence on academic painting in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Munich and modernism</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nikolaos Gyzis is another selection from the Munich School. Born on the island of Tinos, Gyzis, he departed for Munich in 1865. By 1888, he was a professor at the city’s Academy of Fine Arts. The nomination, <em>Behold the Bridegroom</em> (1899), which is described by the museum as a ‘magnificent, transcendental work on the Second Coming’ reflects the strong spiritual feelings Gyzis had at the end of his life. According to the museum: “His real calibre is shown by his idealistic, allegorical and religious work, in which he was in step with the aims of the avant garde movement Jugendstil”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gyzis spent time travelling with the artist Nikiforos Lytras whose son Nikos Lytras is considered one of Greece’s finest modernist painters. Initially taught by his father, he then lived in Munich where he was influenced by the artistic experimentation of those times including German expressionism. As well as being an innovator in painting, he influenced the development of future Greek artists through his teaching and modern approach. <em>The Straw Hat</em> (1925), shown above, is considered one of the most impressive and daring works of early Greek modernism. According to the museum, it “conveys a sense of joy rather than anguish, which is usually the case with the paintings of the German Expressionists…His brushwork, uniquely personal and extremely modern, has no precedent in Greek painting”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p>In this blog series, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher has been highlighting different national nominations, and finding out a bit more about some of the choices. Here, Ann looks at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=ireland&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;q=europeana+280&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">the fascinating nominations from Ireland</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ireland’s selection for Europeana 280 is the most contemporary choice of all countries nominating treasures for the campaign. It includes a wide range of work in different media from living artists of the 21st century as well as those breaking away from the artistic status quo of the 1920s. The choice was made by the institutions themselves and coordinated by the Department of Culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A family affair</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brocas family of artists – two brothers and their four sons - flourished in Dublin in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Ha'penny Bridge Dublin (1818) by SF (Samuel Frederick) Brocas, is a selection from the National Library of Ireland and depicts a famous landmark, the cast iron footbridge crossing the Liffey, built in 1816. The National Library holds an extensive archive of artistic work by all six members of the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/ireland-600.jpeg\"><br>\r\nThe Ha'Penny Bridge Dublin (1818), Samuel Frederick Brocas, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063628/IRE_280_001.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Ireland</a>, PDM</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Development of Irish modernism</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first part of the 20th century, there were tensions between the conservative art establishment and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200344/BibliographicResource_3000055240207.html\">proponents of newer European developments in art</a> (e.g. Cubism). Irish artist Mainie Jellett trained at the Metropolitan school in Dublin and then at the Westminster School of Art in London with Walter Sickert, along with Evie Hone. In 1921, they moved to Paris to train with cubist painters André Lhote and Albert Gleizes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jellett first exhibited her non-figurative work in Ireland in 1923 to much criticism but continued to act as an advocate for abstraction. Four Element Composition, painted around 1930, is a selection from the Irish Museum of Modern Art. In 1943, Jellett played a central role in the establishment of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art and is considered a doyenne of Irish Modernism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The avant-garde White Stag Group, originally formed in London, were another group encouraging a move from academicism to modernism and influenced artists such as Patrick Scott. He studied architecture, worked as a graphic designer and while still a student, exhibited with the group. Meditation Painting 28 (2007), also from the IMMA, encourages the viewer to contemplate the link between the physical and metaphysical world. According to the museum: “Scott's love of gold ground was fostered on journeys to Venice and Ravenna in the late 1950s and early 1960s.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Challenging nature</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of contemporary Irish women artists such as Dorothy Cross and Alice Maher are well established within international art circuits. In the 1990s, Maher worked with natural materials such as bees, nettles, berries and hair to create surreal works that appear like enchanted objects from a medieval folk tale. Berry Dress (1994), presents the delicate shape of a child's dress, decorated with berries, but on closer inspection, it loses its innocence, taking on a more sinister appeal. The pins holding the berries in place are arranged internally: should the dress be worn, these pins would pierce the skin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dust Storm (Manter, Kansas) (2008) is a work by John Gerrard who developed his first works in Realtime 3D in 2002. According to the IMMA: “Using the hyperreal qualities generated by simulation and video-game technologies, John Gerrard challenges the viewer with portraits of beautiful environments imbued with an unnerving serenity and sense that what we are seeing is perhaps too real, too slick and instilled with the potential to change or adapt, mirroring that plasticity found in nature.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Abstract variations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nominations from the Crawford Gallery highlight the work of two renowned contemporary painters. The selection from Sean Scully, who has twice been nominated for the Turner Prize, is hard-edged abstraction in style. In East Coast Light (1973), the overlaid bands of colour create a sense of depth in the work. Paintings from other periods can be seen on Europeana as well as an unusual <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048215/pages_Main_idt_131122_inventary_CE092624_table_FMUS_museum_MT.html\">fashion tribute</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hughie O’Donoghue was born in England but worked for many years in Country Kerry. Medusa (2005) is principally an abstract work but evokes the theme of shipwreck. The title relates it to Theodore Gericault's The Raft of the Medusa (also referenced by Delacroix in La Liberté guidant le people, a Europeana 280 selection from France). O’Donoghue’s work draws on elements of history and mythology to create emotionally intense experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying exploring the art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign so far.

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: Belgium'

        body: "<p><strong>In this blog series, Europeana 280’s Exhibition Coordinator Ann Maher has been highlighting different national nominations, and finding out a bit more about some of the choices. Here, Ann looks at the diverse nominations from Belgium. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a special challenge for culturally divided countries such as Belgium to nominate so-called ‘national’ treasures for Europeana 280. The two largest regions comprise the northern Dutch-speaking Flanders and southern French-speaking Wallonia while the capital Brussels is bilingual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hans van der Linden of the Flemish Department for Culture, Youth, Sports and Media explains: “From a Belgian point of view, it is hard to talk about ‘Belgian’ art. Speaking about ‘Flemish art’ would not be correct either because the Flemish viewpoint on cultural heritage is to display diversity rather than focussing on identity-confirming masterpieces.” From a Flemish perspective, museums are custodians of culture. “Rather than the government deciding, Flanders asked platforms such as Contemporary Art Heritage Flanders (CAHF) and the Flemish Art Collection (VKC) to make a selection”, van der Linden explains. “These platforms are bringing together different museums focusing on contemporary and fine arts and have a task to promote those internationally.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The national selection was therefore a process involving several cultural agencies and spans nearly 900 years of art heritage from illuminated manuscripts of the 12th century to work created in the 21st. What are some highlights in the Belgian selection?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Perfection in paint\L</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Two masterpieces from Jan van Eyck are included in the CAHF nominations. The Ghent altarpiece from the Saint Bavo Cathedral completed in 1432 and <em>The Virgin and Child with Canon Joris Van der Paele</em> from the Groeninge Museum in Bruges. Van Eyck was a diplomat and a court painter and one of the most important figures in the Northern Renaissance. “His precise observation and naturalistic rendering of reality, his brilliant colouring and the oil technique that he perfectly mastered, though did not invent, gives Van Eyck a virtuosity that scarcely will ever be matched”, according to the Groeninge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-04/belgium.jpg\" style=\"width: 510px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sainte Cécile de Rome, François-Joseph Navez, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063627/BEL_280_008.html\" target=\"_blank\">Délégation générale à la numérisation des patrimoines culturels</a>, public domain. Neoclassicist François-Joseph Navez was the director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels from 1835-1862</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contemporary artist also known for his stylistic perfection is Michaël Borremans. His painting <em>The Unicorn</em> (2010) is a nomination from S.M.A.K, (Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst) in Ghent. Initially trained in photography and graphic design, Borremans turned to painting at the age of 30 and his atmospheric and unsettling works invite multiple interpretations.\L\L</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Romance, neoclassicism and decadence\L</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Selections from the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles come from five different institutions and include the painter and sculptor Antoine Wiertz, who is a somewhat controversial artistic figure in the Belgian Romantic movement. His paintings, often on a huge scale, depicted historical and religious scenes but also the erotic and grotesque. His first great work, <em>Les Grecs et les Troyens se disputant le corps de Patrocle</em> (1836) is a nomination from the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Liège.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neoclassicist François-Joseph Navez was a pupil of Jacques-Louis David who had a strong influence on academic salon painting in the early 19th century. Navez became the director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels from 1835-1862. The vivid <em>Sainte Cécile de Rome</em> (1824) is a selection from the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Mons.\L\L</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belgium’s significant contributions to symbolism and art nouveau are reflected in the choice of artists Fernand Khnopff and Félicien Rops. Both were members of the influential artistic group Les XX (Khnopff was a founder member, Rops was invited later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <em>Pornokrates </em>(1878), a selection from the Musée Félicien Rops, the artist depicted his vision of contemporary women and their arrogance, composure and ruthlessness. The museum quotes a letter from Rops to his friend H. Liesse in 1879. “This drawing delights me”, Rops wrote. “I did this in four days in a room of blue satin, in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the opopanax and cyclamen gave me a slight fever conducive towards production or even towards reproduction”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope the art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign has been surprising and inspiring you.

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: the Netherlands'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Continuing our weekly series exploring <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/Europeana280\" target=\"_blank\">each country's nominations for Europeana 280</a>, Ann Maher, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator, looks at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=netherlands&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=24&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">the Netherlands' selections</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rembrandt and Van Gogh regularly feature in Europeana’s lists of most popular searches. Over 180,000 images from the Rijksmuseum alone can be accessed and downloaded in the highest resolution possible, without copyright restrictions. So when it came to making its nominations for the Europeana 280 collection, the Netherlands decided to draw attention to some less well-known treasures alongside its masterpieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“We didn’t want a limited selection or exclusive ‘canon’ of Dutch art,” explained Robert Verhoogt, from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science that coordinated the nominations together with the Dutch Cultural Heritage Agency. “We aimed to take a more inclusive approach in order to promote and stimulate access to digital art in the context of Europeana”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the beginning, the selection aimed to be a broad one: “To start our contribution for Europeana we looked for interesting works by famous and less famous Dutch artists in our history of art”, continued Verhoogt. “Of course we selected a few iconic works like Rembrandt’s Nightwatch and Vermeer’s Little Street, from the Rijksmuseum. They are part of the world’s collective art history”. But the nominations also include less internationally known artists like the fifteenth-century sculptor Jan van Steffenswert, a selection from the Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht and also from the Rijksmuseum, the modern artist and photographer George Hendrik Breitner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Situated largely below sea level, the unique, man-made Dutch landscape - “probably our largest cultural artifact” – according to Verhoogt - is a very important motif in Dutch art. “Ever since our famous landscape painters of the seventeenth century, like Ruysdael and Van Goyen, our landscape inspired the artistic imagination of generations of Dutch and foreign artists from all over the world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/dutch-tree.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 411px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Avond (Evening): The red tree (1908-1910), Piet Mondriaan, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063630/NE_280_005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gemeentemuseum Den Haag</a>, CC BY. This painting of an apple tree from the Zeeland coastal resort of Domburg marks a break with Piet Mondriaan’s earlier work and signals his first steps towards abstraction.​</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The red tree</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One nomination that deserves special consideration is a vivid work from Piet Mondriaan, <em>Evening: the red tree</em>, from the Gemeentemuseum, Den Haag. With almost 300 works, the Museum’s collection covers every phase of Mondriaan’s work. “Piet Mondriaan can be considered one of the most influential modern artists of the twentieth century”, according to Verhoogt: “Influenced by Dutch impressionism and naturalism of the Hague School he was inspired by Dutch landscape too. From 1898 he wandered around the city of Amsterdam to paint the polders and the glimmering reflections of light and water.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1900 Mondriaan was more and more inspired by new aesthetic ideas of the international avant garde: “Exhibitions with works by Vincent van Gogh, Jan Toorop and Jan Sluijters opened his eyes to new ways of seeing. Rooted in the Dutch landscape tradition Mondriaan started to experiment with color and new ways of expression.” In1908, he painted <em>Evening: red tree</em>, which showed his new approach. “On the one hand it’s still rooted in the naturalistic landscape tradition, on the other hand it shows his creative imagination looking for abstraction,” explains Verhoogt. “It paved the way to the ideas of De Stijl and the modern abstract art of the European avant-garde.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1911, Mondriaan moved to Paris, which marked the beginning of further profound changes in his work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sharing art in the digital world</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a beautiful painting that marks an interesting starting point for the Dutch contribution to the Europeana 280 project, reflected Verhoogt: “It’s rooted in our history of art and our Dutch landscape tradition, but at the same time, it shows the fascinating engagement with other artistic influences from the international avant-garde around 1900.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In sharing this painting with Europeana we want to do the same and join this European project. Rooted in our Dutch cultural tradition, looking forward to new artistic discoveries and new horizons and sharing our cultural artifacts in the digital world.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the magnificent art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign via Europeana Art History Collection, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\" target=\"_blank\">our virtual exhibition</a> or at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/big-art-ride\">one of our public digital events</a>.

        title: 'Choosing a country''s artworks for Europeana 280: France'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>Continuing our weekly series exploring each country's nominations for <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/Europeana280\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 280</a>, Ann Maher, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator, highlights nominations from France.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=france&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=24&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">selections from France</a> reflect different periods in its vivid national history and include iconic paintings that influenced the history of art worldwide. The profound impact of French artists and institutions can be seen in the nominations across art movements from every other country submitting works for the 280 campaign. What are some highlights of the French selections?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Treasures from royal courts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve nominations from six institutions (Musée du Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Centre Pompidou - Musée national d'art moderne, Centre de création industrielle and Château de Versailles et Trianon) cover work from the 13th to 20th centuries. From the Louvre comes a celebrated Renaissance portrait of the second school of Fontainebleau. After religious wars, Henri IV (1553-1610) resumed the decorative renovation of royal palaces and according to the museum the anonymous painting of Gabrielle d’Estrées and her sister typifies the ‘sensuality, fresh color, and Italianizing style of French court painting at this time’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2051908/data_euscreenXL_ina_CPB77051643.html\">Gabrielle d'Estrées</a> (1571-1599) was a royal favourite and the affectionate way in which her sister tweaks her nipple has been interpreted as a reference to her pregnancy with the child of Henry IV. The Musée du Louvre acquired the picture in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also from the Musée du Louvre, a vision of absolutism in the portrait of Louis XIV in his coronation robes by Hyacinthe Rigaud (1659-1743), a French Baroque painter of Catalan origin. Although commissioned by the sun king as a gift for his grandson, Philip V, it was so popular it never made it’s way to Spain and a copy was made for Versailles. According to the museum it remained in the royal collections until after the Revolution and in 1793 was handed over to the Muséum Central des Arts de la République, later known as the Musée du Louvre.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Revolution!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eugène Delacroix witnessed the uprising against the last Bourbon king, Charles X, and according to the Musée du Louvre, “His emotional temperament largely explains the force of his portrayal of the recent explosion of rage on the streets of Paris.” <em>Liberty Leading the People</em> (1830) was presented at the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200143/BibliographicResource_2000069341465.html\">Salon of 1831</a> where it was one of 23 paintings representing events of the July revolution. Many critics, attuned to more classical representations, rejected the work and it was initially hidden from public view. Delacroix is now considered a leading figure in French Romanticism, influencing later movements such as Impressionism and Symbolism due to his brushwork and use of colour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/2063621-fra-280-004.jpeg\" style=\"width: 438px; height: 600px;\">\r\n\r\n<p><em>Berthe Morisot au bouquet de violettes (1872), Edouard Manet, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063621/FRA_280_004.html\" target=\"_blank\">Musée d'Orsay</a>, CC BY-NC-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Paris: epicentre of art</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The annual or biannual exhibitions of the Académie de Beaux-Arts in Paris, known as the Salon, attracted huge crowds and press coverage including cartoons by caricaturists such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2032003/GR_item_61451.html\">Daumier</a>, but the conservative selection juries were unresponsive to new artistic directions. Painters such as Edouard Manet and Claude Monet - selections from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris - were striving to portray modern life and painting in new ways. The eight Impressionist exhibitions from 1874-1882 and the Salon des Indépendants (1884) and Salon d’Automne (1903) became the influential showcases for new trends, which along with the attractions of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055225117.html\">bohemian</a> life in the capital, made Paris the global epicenter of art in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Gauguin’s banking career in Paris was abandoned after the financial crash of 1882. After an unsuccessful move to Copenhagen with his children and Danish wife Mette, he continued to move in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92023/BibliographicResource_2000068823197.html\">artistic circles</a> and eventually he abandoned finance altogether to paint full time. According to the Musée D’Orsay, their Gauguin selection <em>Tahitian Women</em> (1891), “is typical of his paintings during the early part of his first stay in the Pacific, paintings often depicting Tahitian women busy with simple daily tasks… above all, these characters herald the coloured effects of Matisse with their powerful graphic style and vivid colours.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Strange and spellbinding</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eduard Manet sought recognition until the end of his life. He chose not to join the Impressionists in their first exhibition, continuing in his determination to ‘conquer the Salon’, according to the Musée D’Orsay, but lent work by Monet and Sisley from his own collection to support a later show. The painting that was accepted at the salon of 1872 was a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200369/BibliographicResource_3000148266454.html\">seascape</a>, but it is <em>Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets</em> (1872), shown in a retrospective of his work at the third Salon d’Automne in 1905, that is world famous now. According to the Musée D’Orsay: “This strange and spellbinding portrait was rapidly considered by his friends to be one of the artist's masterpieces.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the wonderful artworks selected for the Europeana 280 campaign via Europeana Art History (where the entire selection of 280 artworks can be seen in all their glory) and in our virtual exhibition Faces of Europe. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/big-art-ride\">The #BigArtRide</a> will be in Paris next week!

        title: 'Who''s Using What?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Who's Using What: North Carolina State University Library</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Who's Using What is a blog series by Gregory Markus from <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\" target=\"_blank\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> as part of EuropeanaTech. The idea behind the series was to raise awareness about the brilliant open source software options now available to institutions, and to encourage collaboration in the digital heritage community. What better way to show off these tools than talk to the developers making use of and developing them? You can also find lots of OS options in the new <a href=\"http://bgweb.nl/floss/\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech FLOSS Inventory</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this issue of Who's Using What EuropeanaTech spoke with Bret Davidson and Jason Casden from North Carolina State University Library. We were drawn to Bret and Jason because of this fascinating paper they had published in the Code4Lib Journal. The paper, \"<a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/11148\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Open Source: Evaluating the Community Availability of Software</a>\" where they discuss extending the open source software values of collaboration and transparency to include the wide and affordable distribution of software as a way of increasing the efficient deployment, uptake and continued use of the rich Open Source tools available for libraries. They investigate whether larger, better financed institutions have a responsibility to assist smaller instituions with the implementation of certain OS tools as this will by and large imporve the community as a whole. Bret and Jason's answers are detailed and insightful. A wonderful addition to the growing Who's Using What catalogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/bookbot.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 346px;\"><em>Still from a <a href=\"http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxl5OaURy8\">video</a> about the Automated Book Delivery System or 'bookBot' at James B. Hunt Jr. Library, North Carolina State University</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"im\">1. What open source tools are you currently working with? </span></strong><br><br>\r\nMuch of our current work is focusing on using virtualization, container, and provisioning technologies like Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible, to improve the availability of our software to less well-resourced institutions or standardize our development and production environments. We are also looking at opportunities to support open research practices and research training using tools like Jupyter, the successor to iPython notebooks, and developing broadly applicable strategies for social media harvesting and archiving. We are exploring the capabilities of Solr 5 for supporting statistical reporting and data science needs in our applications, Capistrano and DevOps best practices for simplifying production application deployment, Vagrant for unifying our development environments across developers, and persistence.js and localForage as solutions for persistent in-browser data storage. Of course, we are also constantly evaluating a number of text editors like vim, Atom, and Sublime Text, but we can’t seem to come to any agreement on which one is best.<br><br><strong><span class=\"im\">2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?</span></strong><br><br>\r\nWe’ve used a huge variety of open source tools, libraries, and languages over the years. Most of our web applications are written in either Ruby or PHP with JavaScript for client-side work (and a bit of server-side code using node.js), and we frequently use Python for basic server scripting and quick data analysis tasks. We try to use established frameworks with thriving user communities where possible, like Ruby on Rails, Zend, and Angular.js, to improve the quality and stability of our applications and increase the amount of time we can invest toward solving our primary goal of supporting new and enhanced library services. We’ve stuck with mature databases as well, focusing primarily on MySQL with some projects using PostgreSQL where needed. We’ve also used Solr extensively to meet many of our indexing and searching needs. That said, we have experimented with cutting edge libraries and technology where it makes sense in our projects, like <a href=\"http://code4lib.org/conference/2012/casden\" target=\"_blank\">persistent in-browser storage</a> for supporting offline data collection and <a href=\"http://code4lib.org/conference/2013/davidson\" target=\"_blank\">D3.js for developing rich data analysis tools</a>. In these cases, we typically share the results of our investigations with the broader library community.<br><br><strong><span class=\"im\">3. What are you currently developing? </span></strong><br><br>\r\nWe’ve been making progress recently on using Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible to package social media archival software like <a href=\"https://github.com/gwu-libraries/social-feed-manager\" target=\"_blank\">Social Feed Manager</a> (developed at George Washington University) and <a href=\"https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/lentil\" target=\"_blank\">Lentil</a> (developed at NCSU) into a single software package, <a href=\"https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/Social-Media-Combine\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media Combine</a>, that can be deployed quickly and easily to desktop computers and used to start initial social media archiving programs across the spectrum of cultural heritage institutions. This system was supported by a grant from the State Library of North Carolina funding the creation of a <a href=\"https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/social-media-archives-toolkit\" target=\"_blank\">Social Media Archives Toolkit</a> to guide archivists in developing their own social media collection programs.<br><br>\r\nRecently, we’ve started the process of migrating the data collection client of our mobile space assessment toolkit, <a href=\"https://github.com/cazzerson/Suma\" target=\"_blank\">Suma</a>, to Angular.js and integrating updated in-browser storage tools like localForage to improve the cross-browser compatibility of the application. If that all goes well, we hope to add some features that have been requested by our user community. Suma is a leading open source tool that has been adopted by over 100 institutions around the world, but we’ve found from user feedback that institutions with less IT resources often struggle to implement Suma, irrespective of the level of documentation. To address this, we have been working on developing Docker containers and <a href=\"https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/Suma-Vagrant\" target=\"_blank\">Vagrant development environments</a> for Suma to make it easier for our users to deploy Suma to a wider variety of environments and lower the barrier to entry for developers who want to contribute to Suma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/suma.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 160px;\"><br><br><strong><span class=\"im\">4. What would you like to see developed? </span></strong><br><br>\r\nWe think the library community would greatly benefit from the existence of more sophisticated software packaging tools (similar to those available to the developers of desktop applications) for server-based software, with a particular focus on making server-based software available to individuals and smaller institutions. We have presented some potential guidelines for <a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/11148\" target=\"_blank\">evaluating the effectiveness of our software distributions</a>], and the <a href=\"http://hydrainabox.projecthydra.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hydra-In-A-Box project</a> is also undertaking promising explorations in this area.<br><br>\r\nWe have started receiving an increasing number of requests from researchers for relatively straightforward research data management and collaboration platforms (i.e. problems that could be mostly solved using Microsoft Access), but the cost of repeatedly developing these systems is fairly high relative to the number and consistency of the requests. There are commercial application and database builders, such as <a href=\"https://www.knackhq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Knack</a> and <a href=\"https://doolli.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Doolli</a>, that allow less-technical users to create and manage relational data stores, and we think that an open-source version of this idea would be extremely useful if hosted by libraries.<br><br>\r\nMaybe the most significant thing we would like to see isn’t necessarily a tool or library, but a community around public services library technology. Although individual open source software projects often have their own communities and there are excellent organizations around library technology and infrastructure like LITA and Code4Lib, we think there is still an opportunity for developers and designers of library public services software to come together to collaborate on open source software.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>How do you develop meaningful understanding in students, while stimulating their interest too? This is the challenge every teacher, at every stage of education, faces. Adding multimedia resources to teaching materials can be one solution – especially when applied to online learning content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://platform.europeanmoocs.eu/\">European Multiple MOOC Aggregator</a> (EMMA) is a platform that helps university educators create and share their Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with a wider online audience. Currently, 12 European universities contribute to the platform and provide free MOOCs in multiple languages and on various topics from Art and Humanities, Business and Economics, to Computer Sciences and ICTs. The platform has grown in popularity and has registered approximately 20,000 users so far.<br><br>\r\nIn line with its strategy to increase the distribution of digital cultural heritage for educational purposes, Europeana launched a collaboration with EMMA and announce a call for educators and experts to create the first MOOC with Europeana data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/emma.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 431px;\"><br><em>Image source: <a href=\"http://platform.europeanmoocs.eu/\">EMMA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first step applicants should submit their course proposal using Europeana Collections to EMMA till 31 July 2016. If their course has been selected, they can start creating the virtual lessons on the EMMA platform, including adding relevant digital content from the Europeana collections. The selected courses will be then published on EMMA and hosted for free till 30 May 2017.<br><br>\r\nSo, if you are an educator who wants to boost the impact of your course with great cultural material, explore the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a> for inspiration and <a href=\"http://project.europeanmoocs.eu/project/get-involved/run-a-mooc-on-emma-using-europeana-collections-to-boost-the-impact-of-your-course/\">apply</a> for an EMMA MOOC!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana4Education</p>"

        title: 'The power of images: Europeana Collections help students learn how visuals can be used to influence the way people think'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>A guest blog post by Steven Stegers, Programme Director of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is often said that young people today prefer visuals over text in their education. The widespread digitization of images from the collections of museums, archives and libraries offer educators the chance to meet this preference. For individual educators the offer, however, can be overwhelming, which is why<a href=\"http://euroclio.eu/\"> EUROCLIO</a> in partnership with Europeana has created sets of visual sources specially selected for use in history education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the context of history education, students should be able to make a judgment on the usability of their sources, to be able to answer historical questions based on origin, purpose and trustworthiness. A good way of learning about these is by focusing on sources that have been created specifically to influence what people think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/vateristim.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The first page of the <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/kinderbuch-vater-ist-im-kriege-father-is-at-war\">Children’s Book Vater ist im Kriege</a> “Father is at war\", 1915, contributed by Monika Schmitz to <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana1914-1918</a>, CC BY-SA 3.0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a>, EUROCLIO and Europeana have made accessible a set of <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">seven featured source collections</a> that allow students to compare different ways in which visuals were used to control - or at least try to have an impact on - the population. Students can learn about how visuals are used by looking at different aspects of the visual sources. What aspects are emphasized? What aspects are left out? What does the maker of the visual source want us to believe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the source collections about?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three source collections deal with the subject of the First World War. <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/world-war-i-postcards\">World War One Postcards</a> and <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/the-visual-front\">The Visual Front</a> show sources that initially do not seem to be propaganda but were in fact created with the intention to influence public opinion. These two source collections consist of official photographs and postcards. Another collection related to the First World War is <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/kinderbuch-vater-ist-im-kriege-father-is-at-war\">Kinderbuch</a>, a more biased collection of sources from a children’s book glorifying enlistment in the army during the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other source collections can be clearly understood as propaganda. <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/posters-from-the-ddr\">Posters from the DDR</a> and <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/posters-from-communist-china\">Communist China</a> show that it is not just the message of the poster that can influence people’s opinions but also the illustration or painting style. A source collection about the <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/spanish-civil-war-in-poster\">Spanish Civil War</a> illustrates the different sides within one conflict. Finally, a source collection about <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/suffragettes-in-the-united-kingdom\">Suffragettes in the United Kingdom</a> tells the development of the suffragette movement and shows visuals meant to influence public opinion, both for and against universal suffrage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can the source collections be used to teach history?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source collections are very useful to make students aware that many visuals have been made with a specific purpose in mind. There are examples that make this very obvious, while others are subtler and are not immediately identified as propaganda. With this set of source collections, history teachers can help their students become more critical in real life when they find images, online or offline. The release of these collections will allow teachers to help students make a habit of reflecting critically on visual sources, by discussing the motives and purposes of visuals. And to determine what information is left out of the image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the featured source collections here can be found on <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">Historiana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana4Education</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Pretty much in line with what has been so <a href=\"https://medium.com/@MSanderhoff/your-imagination-is-the-only-limit-67cc98ebaab1#.c5l02t9v1\">eloquently stated</a> by Mikkel Bogh, Director at the Statens Museum fur Kunst (SMK).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>”With our digitised collections, we can support people in being reflective, creative human beings. But the precondition is that cultural heritage is common property, and that each and every one of us can use it for exactly what we dream of (…) Our role is still more to facilitate public use of cultural heritage for learning, creativity, and innovation. Today, learning happens in reciprocity. We are all a part of the web. We shape each other.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why write business plans? The main reason (in my opinion) is to give our organisation enough focus to be effective, and stakeholders confidence that we are heading in the right direction. In fact, I think we need this sense of direction even more than organisations who are in business. In the business world there is a very direct relationship between the investment you make and the returns you expect (the famous ‘Return on Investment’). Euro in = Euro out. Do you not make enough return? Then change your tactics or you will be out of business. That’s not the case in the not-for-profit world, where results should be measured in social and economic ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-strategy-2015-2020-impact\">impact</a>’, which is quite different kettle of fish, and much more difficult to evaluate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how do we come to a shared understanding of what to do (and what not to do - even harder) ? To be frank: it’s complicated. Business Plans should not suffocate the reader with unnecessary detail, but they should not be so high level that they lose their meaning altogether. You need to have your conversation at the right level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year we developed a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/europeana-bp-2016.pdf\">business plan</a> that we were reasonably happy with. We involved a lot of people in our network, the plan was less textual and more visual than the year before (easier to read), the plan was directly tied to our strategic aims (consistent), and we were able to settle (it is a bit of a negotiation after all) on 8 objectives and 4 performance indicators. Moreover, we were able to publish it before the new year started, so we could hit the ground running after we recuperated from new year festivities. And Bob’s your uncle. Or, not quite?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The business plan does give a sense of direction, really. And we discuss outcomes with the team and have regular meetings with our Board and Members Council where we report on achievements. But does it leave us agile enough to pick to up on new opportunities when they arise, or stop certain activities when they don’t yield enough result? And besides that, 8 objectives are a lot of things to remember, does that give us enough focus? These are things to keep in mind when starting the process next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year we therefore decided to start very early. Last week (we are, after all, talking May here) we had our kick-off meeting with everyone in the office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moonshots</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first warm up exercise we looked out as far as we could see and we asked ourselves: “what could the world look like if we had no restrictions, whatsoever?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they should, the ideas varied between the difficult but achievable (participate in Europeana with a simple check box - hey why not?), the idealistic (Europeana in all school classes) and the truly far out (Europeana on Mars).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then looked at organisational culture. More and more we realise that strategy can only take you to a certain point. Some people even say <a href=\"http://www.torbenrick.eu/blog/culture/organisational-culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast-lunch-and-dinner/\">Culture eats Strategy for breakfast</a>. We think they go hand in hand: strategy is rational and defines the aims, culture is emotional and defines our ability to get there. Culture is energy in motion, the muscles that make the concept work in practice. We asked what is going well in our organisation (and that includes the Europeana Network)? What should be improved? We need to chew on the results but we can already say that our team still likes the driven, pleasant atmosphere (phew…) but heavy workload, diversity of activities and diffused communications were often mentioned as points to improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Customer pains &amp; gains</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/painsgains.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo from Europeana Business Plan 2017 workshop by Sebastiaan ter Burg CC-BY-SA </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we stepped into the shoes of some of our customers. We divided into 5 groups (culture vultures, researchers, creatives, network members and cultural institutions) and tried to imagine what these people are looking for in their daily activities, what problems we could solve for them (pains) and what makes them happy (gains). At the moment, these are our building blocks that need to be reshuffled to build the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all this was a great start. But truth be told, this was the easy part. The next step is to discuss and prioritise ideas with the management team in the next couple of weeks and later in June with the representatives of the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this space for: (The making of) business plans at Europeana Part 2..</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\" style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">(The making of) business plans at Europeana Part 1</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\" style=\"position: absolute; top: -1999px; left: -1988px;\">(The making of) business plans at Europeana Part 1</div>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-05/blocks.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Photo from Europeana Business Plan 2017 workshop by Sebastiaan ter Burg CC-BY-SA </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<p><strong>Our Members Council, the heart of the Europeana Network Association</strong><br>\r\nIn 2015, we transformed the Europeana Network into the Europeana Network Association, a democratic, transparent organisation to represent the interests of all individuals who work with or contribute to Europeana and support the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/cultural_commons_papers/european-cultural-commons-summary.pdf\"> Europeana Commons principles</a>. The Europeana Network Association currently represents <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-members\">1,417 members</a> (May 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Network Association elects a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Members Council</a> every year and this year we have 30 councillors in total. All of them play a critical role across Europeana’s activities, from prioritising issues in the Business Plan, to setting the agenda for our annual conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members Council meets 3 times a year and act as both the voice of Europeana for the cultural sector, as well as champions of Europeana Association to the network. The Members Council represents the many diverse communities involved in Europeana, including: Tech, IPR, Data providers and Aggregators, Digital Cultural Heritage professionals, Creative re-users, Research and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23 available seats</strong><br>\r\nThe Members Council is elected for a period of two years and this year 23 councillors will have served the Association for two years. This means that at least 23 seats will be open for renewal at the 2016 elections at the Europeana Network Association AGM on November 8th and 9th in Riga, Latvia. We will invite Association members who want to be considered for the Members Council to come forward and present their manifestos in the Autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They’ll then be campaigning hard to win support until the voting begins on 8 November at the AGM in Riga. And whilst you are deciding who to back, you’ll be able to follow their campaigns via our Europeana LinkedIn group and by keeping an eye on the hashtag #EuropeanaElects. Once voting opens at the AGM, you’ll be able to cast your vote online. And you’ll have a week to choose your preferred candidates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And a new Management Board...</strong><br>\r\nTo oversee the work of the Members Council, the Councillors will also elect a renewed <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Management Board</a>. The Management Board is responsible for ensuring that we are all working towards achieving our objectives, as well as providing direct input into the governance of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/foundation-governing-board\">Europeana Foundation.</a> Note that the 6 Management Board representatives also sit on Europeana Governing Board - See graph above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the conversation on Twitter via #EuropeanaElects</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><strong>How exploring Europeana collections can help to put historical figures into perspective. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-d62a2ca6-070e-9529-9311-c073eedc9d76\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A guest post by Steven Stegers, Programme Director of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO). </span></span><br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/josephstalin.jpg\" style=\"width: 410px; height: 600px;\"><br><em>Stalin as the Revolutionary Leader of the Soviet Nation, 1949. Stadtgeschichtliches Museum Leipzig, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A relatively small number of famous historical figures dominate history. They appear in history textbooks, in movies, in documentaries and in literature. There are many primary sources about these figures in collections of museums, archives and libraries but only a few of these are ever used. This leads to a narrow understanding of those figures who have helped to shape history as there is little room to address the controversies and complexities that characterise history and good history education with a limited set of sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dominance of particular sources on some historical figures is because a limited number of websites appear most frequently in search results. If you can find a good source in almost no time, why would you need to look for another? The main issue is the amount of time that it can take to find these other - just as interesting - resources. Language barriers and copyright restrictions can also make finding sources more difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To overcome these barriers <a href=\"http://euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a>, in partnership with Europeana, has created sets of sources that show known historical figures in a new light. Europeana offers users the unique opportunity to search across collections of different archives and museums. It can often be difficult to search across collections because institutes tend to use their own system of documentation and categorization. But in the case of historical figures, it is often possible to find matching sources, because almost all institutes have used the person’s name as their search term. The results of this are now published at <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">Historiana</a> in the form of a new series of source collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A rationale for selecting historical figures</strong><br>\r\nChoosing which historical figures to feature in Historiana was the hard thing. With limited time at our hands we could never do justice to the many and diverse historical figures that could have been chosen. Our purpose was also not to make a definitive selection but to find out what could be gained from looking for sources about really well known historical figures in the collections of different archives across Europeana. The figures we chose to focus on – <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/julius-caesar\">Julius Caesar</a>, <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/jeanne-darc\">Jeanne d’Arc</a>, <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/adolf-hitler\">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/charles-darwin\">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/joseph-stalin\">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/queen-victoria\">Queen Victoria</a> – are all figures that most people in Europe will know and they have been the topic of much debate and interpretation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can these source collections be used to teach history?</strong><br>\r\nThese source collections on Historiana offer the opportunity to see what extent the associations that people have with historical figures is mirrored in material from different institutes. <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">Historiana</a> source collections can also be used to compare and contrast the material that different institutes have and have not included in their collection about each historical figure. And because it is clear where each item comes from (e.g. which institute provided it), these source collections can also be used to learn about the way institutes build their collections. We can ask questions like: How do items arrive in their collection? What is their criteria for selecting and describing them? Students can be asked to select sources that challenge or change their ideas about a historical figure and to explain how that material is challenging or changing their ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The featured source collections can be found on <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">Historiana</a> and can be used to create online learning activities.</p>"

        title: 'Studying the impact of digital collections with Wiki-Data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This blog post was written by Marcin Wilkowski from Digital Humanities Laboratory at the University of Warsaw. More: his blog <a href=\"http://wilkowski.org/about\">wilkowski.org</a> and Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcinwilkowski\">@marcinwilkowski</a>)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's clear that in order to study the impact of digital collections, the GLAM sector needs data – data that is useful and easy-to-aggregate. Some basic information can be accessed relatively easy: the number of files made available on digital repositories, and the views/users statistics from Google Analytics or PiWik. These can easily be obtained and presented in annual institution reports. Europeana does this for example via the <a href=\"http://statistics.europeana.eu\">Statistics Dashboard</a>. But data of this type is limited in its use for analysing impact due to its bespoke nature. It is gathered in relation to a website, while digital content is available in many places on the Internet and is, by its nature, shareable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the famous “Milkmaid” from the Rijksmuseum’s collection is available on thousands of websites. But when measuring the impact of that digital reproduction with Google Analytics we can only tell how many views it has generated on the museum’s official official site. But what about other places the Milkmaid can be found? Shall we ignore them only because they are unofficial and files are often published in low quality? It seems that tools to measure an images’ reach on the Web do exist ‒ think of popular ones such as the Google Images Search. But even if we were able to find the alternative and unofficial publishers of our digital heritage content, more work needs to be done to measure the impact of those mirror sites. An institution would need further research to find answers on how many people reach the digital reproductions and for what purpose they are being used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/yellow%20milkmaid%20copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 348px;\"><em>Different version of Vermeer's Milkmaid as found on Google Image search in 2013. By Joris Pekel (CC0).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is one popular, widely known and massively used digital space where our content can easily be republished: Wikipedia and its sister projects, notably Wikimedia Commons. Wikimedia projects, with hundreds of millions of unique visitors per month, can be a reliable source of impact data for our GLAM efforts, thanks to the general open policy of Wikipedia and its sister projects (open licenses or public domain on content, and the public domain status of the data itself). It generally means that all public data gathered via Wikipedia and its sister projects should be available via open datasets for free reuse and all research purposes. You can access the content and data from Wikimedia projects on the <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps\">data dumps page</a> using a <a href=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc\">special API</a> or even by querying the database with a <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Quarry\">Quarry interface</a> . So using data generated by Wiki projects as a source of impact data can help our efforts to build a more reliable framework for measuring the impact of digital collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what exactly can be measured?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When our files are copied into Wikimedia Commons, we can find not only how many views they have generated during a period of time, but also for what purposes they have been used within the Wikipedia environment. Even if an institution doesn’t contribute to Wikimedia Commons directly, we still can find out the impact of its digital collections. Tools and resources to do this are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BaGLAMa 2</strong>: <a href=\"http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/baglama2/index.html\">BaGLAMa</a> displays page view statistics for pages on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects which contain Commons files in a specific category. If your institution publishes collection on Wikimedia Commons within one category, you can check which files have been used to illustrate specific Wikipedia entries, or which are available in other Wikimedia projects (ie. Wikipedia articles in other languages, or sister projects like Wikivoyage or Wikinews). This information helps us to answer the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- for what purposes is our visual content used?<br>\r\n- how many views does it generate within Wikipedia and other wikiprojects?<br>\r\n- why is our content, available on Wikimedia Commons, not reused on Wikipedia pages?<br>\r\n- what are the differences in usage of our files/media between Wikipedia language versions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GLAMorous</strong>: <a href=\"https://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/glamorous.php\">GLAMorous</a> allows you to check the usage of specific images across different Wikimedia projects. You can check how many times an image is currently published within Wikimedia articles and in which language versions. The data is available also in xml format, so you can easily reuse it for your purposes. Questions that can be answered with that data include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- how many of our files are used within all Wikimedia projects?<br>\r\n- for what purposes is our visual content used?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can predict the future impact of your content in Wikimedia Commons and decide which photos or scans are worthy to be added to its repository and you can also check traffic stats of Wikipedia entries by using a tool available at http://stats.grok.se/. If you discover that many users are interested in a certain topic, you can prepare some visual resources to illustrate related articles and upload relevant content to Wikimedia Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if your institution cannot publish on Wikimedia Commons because of copyright issues? The Wikimedia environment supports only open or public domain content ‒ this is the basic rule of publishing anything to that repository. If an institution already publishes scans on its own digital library or digital archive, it is possible that some Wikipedia articles can link to these external sources. You can easily check this by using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LinkSearch\">external link tracker</a>. Such information can support your efforts for making specific content from your institution available on the Commons. And more wikimedia tools for culture sector can be found on <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Resources/Tools\">GLAM-Wiki page</a>.</p>"

        title: 'A family with no history is not a family at all'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>“A family with no history is not a family at all.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On June 3 and 4 we held another edition of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> roadshow, events where we collect family histories about that daunting era in our history. Since we started in 2011 over 180 of these events have been organised in 24 European countries. A staggering 190, 000 objects have been contributed to be digitized, varying from helmets to diaries and many, many postcards and photographs. This one was not unlike the others. A troupe of volunteer students had gathered at the <a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/\">Poznan Super Computer Center</a>, Poland, home of long time Europeana partner Marcin Werla. They were trained by our collecting day veteran Frank Drauschke in the fine art of collecting and digitizing the artifacts and - at least as important - noting down the sometimes very moving stories. The only difference this time was that I was actually there to be part of something that I had been talking about since 2011 at presentations and press conferences. Reminder to self: talking to ‘real’ people and users is always worth the detour!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first day unfolded somewhat slowly (most contributors came on the second day) but it gave me the opportunity to follow the process from start to finish very closely. Our first contributor was Ms. Elżbieta Sobiak-Rybarska.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>She brought with her a number of personal photographs and postcard that had been in her family’s possession ever since the war. She told her story to two of the students who noted it down (in Polish, see the record <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/contributions/20851/#prettyPhoto\">here</a>) as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/grandf.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 1217px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>PZ03_002 Photograph of my grandfather Bronisław Sobiak taken in Berlin.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is the photograph of my grandfather, Bronisław Sobiak. It is the only souvenir I own connected with the father of my father. During the first world war my grandad was fighting in the Prussian Army and got severely injured in the battle of Verdun. This photo was taken in Berlin in 1916, right after he left the hospital. I remember my grandfather telling me stories from the war and also singing a lot of songs in German. He died in 1976 when I was 15 years old.” What strikes one in this photograph is the small head and body in what seems a totally oversized suit. As if the body belongs to another, much bigger man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterwards we interviewed Mrs .Sobiak separately for a project we are undertaking to understand the impact of the 14-18 collection, to see if it actually makes a difference? We asked her why these images were so important to her. She replied: “A family with no history is not a family at all”. Her grandfather was always weeping while singing the German songs. She said like she was feeling the pain he experienced during the war through him when she heard him. “This is what I want to transmit to future generations. This is why this project is of such crucial importance.”</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/169337542\" title=\"The impact of the war\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A video showing Mrs. Sobiak-Rybarska, telling the story of her grandfather who was wounded in Verdun.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is a lot of responsibility. I left Poznan reinvigorated and with the feeling that collecting people’s stories is as important as digitizing the objects and safeguarding them for the future. How do we make sure future generations can not only read the facts but also understand the emotions behind the metadata? How do we translate the energy that is unleashed when people ‘unload’ their story by expressing them to us in a room, to a compelling online experience? Currently they end up being part of a large corpus of individual narratives but we have yet to uncover the pan-European story that runs through all of them. This will require a lot of work to transcribe and translate the texts. But if we don’t do this we will have failed. A European union without a history is no union at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Good news (and some homework) for Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>As you may have noted, last month the Council of the European Union published a document entitled '<a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9643-2016-INIT/en/pdf\">Council conclusions on the role of Europeana for the digital access, visibility and use of European cultural heritage</a>'. While it will probably appear somewhat obscure to most people contributing to Europeana, this document marks an important milestone in the history of Europeana and with this blogpost we want to provide some more information on the history and significance of this document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/treveszaa.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 359px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_1904_2855.html#\">A meeting of the States-General</a>, 1732 by Jan Caspar Philips, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Council Conclusions?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To start, let's answer the most obvious question: what are Council conclusions and why are they important? The European Council is one of the three main institutions of the European Union and brings together the governments of the 28 Member states (the other two are the European Commission and the European Parliament). Next to the European Commission (the largest supporter of Europeana in monetary terms) its members are the most important institutional stakeholders of Europeana, contributing both financially and in kind. In addition to being a significant source of funding for Europeana, the Member states also played an important role in the genesis of Europeana. It was the heads of state of six Member states of the EU who gave birth to Europeana by sending <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=5978\">a joint letter to the commission in 2005</a> in which they argued for the creation of a publicly funded counterpart to the then new Google books project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Council conclusions are an important way for the Member states to let the Commission (and everybody else) know what they think of a particular topic. The Council conclusions published last month give an indication of how the Member states look at the (future of) Europeana, and as such they provide guidance to the Commission on how to proceed with regards to our project. This marks the second time that the Council has published conclusions on Europeana (<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52010XG0527(01)\">see here for the previous conclusions from 2010</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Continued funding for Europeana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publishing Council conclusions is not an easy undertaking as it involves ensuring that the outcome is acceptable to all 28 Member states. As such, the process involves a lot of behind the scenes diplomacy (or 'wrangling') which is coordinated by the council presidency. This year's conclusions are the result of a lot of effort (and skill) of the <a href=\"http://english.eu2016.nl/\">Dutch council presidency</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting early summer 2015, the Permanent Representation and the Ministry of Culture in the Netherlands investigated the will and interest of Member States to reflect upon and find solutions to the development and funding of Europeana in its role for the digital access, visibility and use of European Cultural Heritage. Or to put it in simpler words: do the Member States think that Europeana should be continuously funded and if so, how?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The now published Council conclusions are the outcome of that process and outline a scenario for the continued funding of Europeana by the European Commission and the Member States. They are the result of a lot of discussion among the Member States, and between the Member States and the Commission. Europeana has provided input into these discussions, both via the Europeana Foundation and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Members Council</a> of the Europeana Network Association. While not all our input has been taken on board, the final Council conclusions represent another step forward for Europeana as they address the issue of continued EU funding for the short, medium and long terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the current available funding mechanisms of grant or procurement of this multi-annual framework budget (ends 2021), the Member States decided for procurement with safeguards of the core service, rather than make Member States contributions structural. Council conclusions therefore fall short of recommending a structural funding mechanism for Europeana by Member States. Instead they recommend a model that is based on procurement of a core service by the Commission and grant based funding for a set of generic services that operate on top of the core service. Specifically the Council asks the Commission</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"...by October 2017, to switch the funding method for the Europeana DSI under the CEF to a combination of procurement and grants. Under this model, EU procurement will fully cover the core service platform to ensure stability and interoperability, whilst EU grants (up to 75% of eligible costs) will be available for related user-oriented projects (i.e. generic services under the CEF) which Member States can co-fund on a voluntary basis, either directly and/or through participating national organisations\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-06/watermill.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 426px;\"><br><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_156.html\">A Watermill | Hobbema, Meindert</a>, Rijksmuseum, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are still some open questions with regards to how procurement will actually work, the good news here is that it should allow Europeana to fully cover the costs of running the core platform with EU funds, in accordance with the service that is being requested. Until now the grant based funding structure meant that Europeana was dependent on Member States contributions to fund essential parts of its own organisation. Some continued external funding will be needed, and indeed is requested in the Conclusions to carry out activities the Europeana Network or Foundation deem important but which are not covered under the procurement service level agreement. Overall this will give more financial stability to the Europeana Foundation and will allow Europeana to focus on continuing to build the best possible platform for connecting cultural heritage institutions all over Europe with users around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As highlighted in the above quote, the funding for the core services will cover the activities that are currently funded under the label of the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure. As such, the core funding will not only cover the activities undertaken by Europeana Foundation but will continue to include a consortium of core partners working on delivering the core service. The wider network of cultural heritage institutions working with Europeana will continue to be eligible for grants that support \"related user-oriented projects\", that make use of Europeana's core infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recognition for our work..</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the question of funding, the Council conclusions contain a number of observations and recommendations related to the current functioning of Europeana. From our perspective it is especially welcome that the Council conclusions clearly recognize Europeana's role as a platform, pointing to the various services beyond the search engine capabilities of the website. We are equally happy that the Member States have noted our new governance structure and acknowledge the key role that the Europeana Network Association plays within the Europeana Ecosystem, by organizing input from the network, sharing knowledge and identifying common solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>..and some homework</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Member States have also used the opportunity to assign some homework to Europeana as well as the Commission and themselves. As part of the Conclusions they point out that user friendliness, multilingual support, search and semantic interoperability of Europeana should be improved, and they stress that the same goes for the quality of the data that is aggregated and made available by Europeana (compare points 12, 13 and 14 of the conclusions). It is not a coincidence that all of these points have also been identified as part of the current strategic plan of Europeana and are part of the business plans for 2016 and beyond. The Member States also point out that they think that the governance needs to become more inclusive, meaning they would like to see the number of Member States' representatives on the board of the Europeana Foundation increased from one to three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>…enfin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that is the nature of Council conclusions, they represent a compromise position between many different parties involved and on balance they will really help to make Europeana stronger and better. A massive thank you to those on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/how-we-work/foundation-governing-board\">Governing Board </a>or <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Members Council</a> who were involved the discussions. Stay tuned as we will still need your support for the next stage. We will publish another Blog in the coming weeks detailing the next steps.</p>"

        body: "<p><strong>How Europeana collections can help us imagine what life was like before new technology.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A guest post by Steven Stegers, Programme Director of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/eurotelephonelg.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 698px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An early example of wireless communication, France, 1919, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055615935.html\">National Library of France</a>, Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We live in a world full of technology and most young people have hardly any personal memory of life before these technologies. It can be hard for them to imagine what life was like without modern means of communication and transportation. By focusing on one particular type of technology and showing how this technology evolved over time, we can help students to get a better understanding of chronological developments and help them see evidence of how the past differs from the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the Europeana Collections there are many resources related to innovation and technology, and archives. Tekniska Museet (the Swedish National Museum for Science and Technology) and Danmarks Tekniske Museum (the Technical Museum of Denmark) even specialise in this field. A vast amount of artefacts, images and videos are available and can be used to teach about changes in technology. Because the amount of information available can be overwhelming, Europeana and EUROCLIO worked together to make <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\">collections</a> that show how certain types of technology - cars, airplanes, photo cameras, music recorders, maps, mobile phones - have evolved over time and changed people’s lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source collections on <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/still-photography\">photo cameras</a> and <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/music-recordings\">music recordings</a> can also be used to help students reflect on how technology impacts the way we look at the past, because it is only through them that we actually have a record of the past. The source collection of <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/mobile-phones\">mobile phones</a> can help students realise how quick some technological changes can happen, useful when they ask their parents what life was like when people could not be reached at all times by a mobile phone. The source collection on <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/the-car\">cars</a> and <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/aviation\">airplanes</a> can help students understand how the world became (relatively) smaller because more people could travel further distances more easily. This had a big impact on the economy, the military and everyday life. The source collection on <a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/collection/maps\">maps</a> helps students realise that there was a time when people had literally no idea where they were going. That our knowledge of what is where is the result of centuries of collecting information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nTogether, these source collections can help us look at social history through the lens of technology, and to measure the speed of societal change. The collections also help us to make judgements about the significance of technological changes and innovations for the world today. The source collections also show that people demand changes over time, as considerations like aesthetics, price and user-friendliness begin to play a more important role.</p>"

These relate to instances where legal restrictions (other than copyright) can impact on the extent of re-use of works that are in the Public Domain or when data providers would like to allow permission to use in-copyright works for educational purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on this feedback, Europeana, in consultation with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/rightsstatements-org\">International Working Group on interoperable rights statements</a> , has developed two rights statements that can be used to support data providers in making more of their collections available online. In April 2016 both rights statements were launched as part of the rightsstatements.org initiative:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/page/NoC-OKLR/1.0/\">No Copyright - Other Known Legal Restrictions</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-EDU/1.0/\">In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following consultation with the European Network via the Copyright Working Group, the recommendation to include these 2 rights statements in the Europeana Licensing Framework was proposed to and have been approved for use by Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that in November of this year they will be included as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/rightsstatements-org-launches-at-dpla-fest-in-washington-dc\">part of the broader transition</a> to the statements provided by<a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/\"> rightsstatements.org </a>and will offer more accurate rights statements for data providers when selecting what works they wish to make available via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the new rights statements mean for data providers and users</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some collections made available via Europeana are in-copyright and permission will have been granted by the copyright holder before they are published online. Equally, there will be a number of works which are in the public domain. Wherever possible Europeana encourages data providers to respect that all public domain works should remain available in the public domain once they are digitised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of the new rights statement ‘In Copyright - Educational Use’ will allow data providers to make available for the first time some in-copyright works for educational use only. This will allow users to engage with content shared via Europeana as part of educational activities. This rights statement is intended for use in situations where the data partner is not able to make the digital object available under one of the Creative Commons licenses (which offer much more robust permissions for re use).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst Europeana promotes the principle of what is public domain should remain public domain, as outlined in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Public%20Domain%20Charter%20-%20EN.pdf\">Public Domain Charter, </a>we also accept that in some countries other legal restrictions may be relied on to inform what is made available online and under what terms. An example of when the rights statement ‘No Copyright Other Known Legal Restrictions’ might be used by a data provider is by Italian organisations who can provide access to public domain works but in some cases it might be limited by the Italian Code of Cultural Heritage and Landscape (the ‘Codice Urbani’).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of when the ‘No Copyright Other Known Legal Restrictions’ might be used is by French organisations. The Public Sector Information Directive governs how much access and re-use may be made of public sector material, allowing French institutions to limit the commercial re-use of public domain heritage content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this basis , the working group recommended to and had the following approved by Europeana Foundation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘We recommend to Europeana Foundation to add the In Copyright - Educational Use Permitted rights statement to the list of available rights statements as part of the transition to rightsstatements.org later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend to Europeana Foundation to add the No Copyright Other Known Legal Restrictions rights statement to the list of available rights statements as part of the transition to rightsstatements.org later this year. Use of this statement on Europeana should only be permitted when the data provider identifies a concrete legal basis for the restrictions on re-use and provides a URL that contains more information about the specific restrictions and their legal basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend that Europeana Foundation reviews the use of both rights statements 1 year after they have been made available for use on Europeana and shares the outcomes of this review with the copyright working group of the Europeana Network Association.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will introduce the new rights statements in November as part of the transition to rightsstatements.org and will help data providers in best managing, sharing and engaging others in discovering their collections via Europeana.

        body: "<h3><strong>Best Practices for Multilingual Access</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, we asked you to<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/help-us-tear-down-language-barriers-together\"> contribute your knowledge to the White Paper on multilingual access to digital cultural heritage content</a>. Many of you accepted our invitation and dedicated time to give feedback, add comments and make recommendations. It was a lively discussion and many different perspectives and new resources were introduced. We are now happy to announce that we have republished this <strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/best-practices-for-multilingual-access\">White Paper</a> </strong>incorporating all your feedback and taking your suggestions into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With your input, this White Paper has become a richer resource for practitioners and professionals working in digital cultural heritage. We have integrated new references and extended the section on evaluating multilingual components and the particular challenges of multilingual access. The white paper focuses on three different components of multilingual cultural heritage information systems: data, interactions and interface. We have collected together practical advice covering common challenges and listed best practice gathered from various projects within the area of digital cultural heritage. Amongst other things, you will find information on the different aspects of interface language, best practices for query translation as one form of multilingual access, recommendations for multilingual metadata and various language independent access options, such as the newly introduced color search in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/colours.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 501px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana’s 'Search by color' is a way to cross language barriers and find resources independent of their (metadata) language.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank everyone who contributed their perspectives, experiences, new literature and interesting links. We hope that you find the White Paper useful and draw on the resources when it comes to giving access to cultural material across languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<h3><strong>Two new publications on improving Search in Europeana Collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/90402-rp-p-ob-15-870lg.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 391px;\"><em>Theseus and Ariadne by Crispijn van de Passe, 1602 - 1607, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/RP_P_OB_15_870.html\">Rijksmuseum</a>, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>53 million paintings, books, newspapers, audio recordings and more; items from more than 35 countries, in more than 40 languages. Europeana's collections are rich - but with such immense and varied holdings, finding what you're looking for can be a challenge. Are you interested in Paris of Troy, or Paris, France? Venus the planet, or Venus the goddess? Danzig or ... Gdansk? Whatever the question, Europeana probably has the answer. But locating the items that you want and need isn't always as easy as it should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 30 October of last year (2015), we published <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI/Milestones/europeana-dsi-ms30-search-improvement-plan.pdf\">The Search Improvement Plan</a>, outlining the steps we intended to take in the immediate future to improve the search performance of Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we are pleased to announce a double publication. The first of these is a status report on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI/Milestones/europeana-dsi-ms-31-report-on-the-improvement-of-search.pdf\">progress of the Search Improvement Plan</a>. Alongside this we are also publishing our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-search-strategy\">Search Strategy White Paper</a>, setting these improvements in context and describing our broader vision for the future direction of search within the Europeana platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of results, the news is mixed. Significant improvements have been made but in some cases these improvements were not as great as hoped. The foundations for the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI/Deliverables/europeana-dsi-d6.1-requirementsfortheplatformbackend.docx.pdf\">Entity API</a> that stands at the heart of Europeana's planned information architecture have been laid. Our query testbed now covers almost all official EU languages, and several unofficial languages as well. A new relevance algorithm (BM25f) has been deployed. But technical limitations connected chiefly with the responsiveness of our backend data stores and our logging framework have meant not all changes could be implemented as planned. Notably, the ambition of improving our search-ranking effectiveness by 50% has not been met, with an increase of 24% being attained. Some work remains to be done here, although the process of sorting out these technical obstacles has begun and the way forward is clearer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This development works to support the larger reconceptualisation and transformation of Europeana's search functionality as described in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-search-strategy\">Search Strategy</a>. While this document is intended to be relatively long-term and wide-ranging, the theme that emerges from its apparently disparate concerns is that search is to become deeply user-centred. At the most immediate and obvious level, this means making improvements to the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the portal. More fundamentally, it means leveraging user interactions to inform search behaviour - with search results being derived not just from query terms but from implicit user information such as clickstream data and explicit user feedback such as annotations and user-created collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>User-informed search in this conceptualisation becomes not so much a single act of information retrieval, as a kind of dialogue between users and our content, in which our platform anticipates the needs of our users, satisfies them and sometimes even surprises them with 'unknown unknowns', the knowledge they didn't realise they had to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested in finding out more about search? More information can be found in the blog posts below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        body: "<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider-\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>After six weeks of editing, the Art History Challenge on Wikipedia and Wikidata in support of Europeana 280 has now finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of competition there were 472 Wikipedia pre-existing articles across all 39 tracked languages (an average of 12 articles per language). Now, <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Data#Translations\">there are now over 1,300 articles - an average of 34 per language</a>. This makes this challenge the largest ever GLAM-Wiki competition, the first to incorporate Wikidata and the second largest Wikipedia translation event after its sister-competition, <a href=\"http://ceespring.eu/blog/2016/06/03/cee-spring-is-over-lets-gather-the-fruits/\">CEE Spring</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But most importantly, volunteer <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Participants\">participants from across the continent</a> have learned about each other’s art history and, by sharing that information, helped spread it to a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/172726398\" title=\"Europeana Art History Challenge\" width=\"960\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A video about the Art History Challenge, the results and the winners</em>.<em> Also available <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge.webm\" target=\"_blank\">on Wikimedia Commons</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By connecting these artworks to the wider Wikidata repository, it is possible to query - and visualise - the collections in new ways.

He has contributed a prodigious amount of new material - <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Participants/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80\">writing 58 new articles and translated 31 others into the Bulgarian Wikipedia</a>! For the last three years Spasimir has worked with the digitised photograph collections of the Bulgarian State Archives. Because of this his favourite work is in the the 18th century collection of botanical illustrations, the watercolour <a href=\"https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5_%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5_%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5\">Choix des plus belles fleurs</a> below, from the selection of works provided by Lichtenstein (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08701/C8B2C0B3D410915CC20E00AAA7562BB3B7491B2D.html\">in Europeana</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/flower-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 824px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bengt Oberger (<a href=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anv%C3%A4ndare:Boberger\">user:Boberger</a>) from Stockholm, Sweden came second in the challenge, having written dozens of articles for the competition in the Swedish Wikipedia but also by adding artwork labels to Wikidata in Swedish, Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Latvian, Danish, and Polish! This helps to increase the discoverability of those works and Europeana hopes to incorporate these translations into our own search engine results. As his particular favourites to write about were in Swedish, Bengt nominated Paula Modersohn-Becker’s 1906 work below, from the German selection: <a href=\"https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sj%C3%A4lvportr%C3%A4tt_p%C3%A5_den_sj%C3%A4tte_br%C3%B6llopsdagen\">Self portrait on the sixth anniversary of marriage</a> (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063623/GER_280_010.html\">in Europeana</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/mode-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 873px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In third place was Marisa (<a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usuario:MarisaLR\">user:MarisaLR</a>) from Barcelona, Spain. Her method was to use the new <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/tag/content-translation/\">Content Translation Tool</a> to create articles into the Asturian, Catalan and Spanish Wikipedias. Of course, some languages received more new content than others. Unsurprisingly, English Wikipedia received the most new content, but thanks to the work of Spasimir and Marisa, the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge#By_language_2\">Bulgarian and Asturian Wikipedias came 2nd and 3rd</a> respectively. Marisa’s volunteering has previously <a href=\"https://www.wikimedia.cat/2015/11/15/marisa-lobato-editar-a-la-viquipedia-es-una-satisfaccio-i-ajuda-a-la-gent/\">featured by the Catalan Wikipedia community</a> for her work on improving the quality of content relating to the European Union. Her favourite work to write about was <a href=\"https://ast.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_ciud%C3%A1_(pintura)\">The City</a> by August Strindberg (1903) belwo from the Swedish selection (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063602/SWE_280_010.html\">in Europeana</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/vigneron-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 1065px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And a special mention also goes to fourth placed Nicolas Vigneron (<a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilisateur:VIGNERON\">user:VIGNERON</a>) from Rennes, France, who was <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2016/04/19/europeana-art-history-challenge/\">featured in the Wikimedia Foundation blog</a> for taking an early points lead in the competition by adding artwork labels on Wikidata in the Breton language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as the overall and national prizes offered by Europeana, both Wikimedia Sweden/Swedish National Gallery and Wikimedia Norway/Norwegian National Gallery offered <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Europeana_Art_History_Challenge/Participants#Prizes\">extra incentives</a>. Winners of these prizes included Jane Darnell (<a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Jane023\">user:Jane023</a>) representing the Netherlands, who wrote the best article about a female artist’s work on Harriet Backer’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christening_in_Tanum_Church\">Christening in Tanum Church</a> (1892) below from the Norwegian selection and Ritta Austere from Finland who - with 400 added statements to Wikidata - became the most active newly registered Wikimedia volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-06/artgallery-copy.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 459px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As importantly, volunteers from countries beyond those directly involved in Europeana 280 also became involved. For example, <a href=\"https://hy.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D5%84%D5%A1%D5%BD%D5%B6%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%AB%D6%81:Armineaghayan\">Armine Aghayan</a> from Armenia and <a href=\"https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87:Andrew_J.Kurbiko\">Andrei Kurbiko</a> from Ukraine both brought many artworks into their local Wikipedia languages. Armine chose <a href=\"https://hy.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D5%85%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D4%B3%D5%AB%D5%AC%D5%A4%D5%B4%D5%AB%D5%BD%D5%BF%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%AB_%D5%BA%D5%A1%D5%BF%D5%AF%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%BD%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%B0%D5%A8\">The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz</a> from the Netherlands selection as her favourite due to its detail meanwhile Andrei, who declares a love of scandinavian culture, particularly enjoyed translating <a href=\"https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8E%D1%8E%D1%82%D1%8C\">Boys Drawing</a> from the Swedish selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the Art History Challenge has concluded, already some of the work is taking effect. The TED organisation’s own <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/TED_conferences/TED_speakers_challenge\">Speakers Challenge</a>, uses many of the tools built to track and report about the Art History Challenge.</p>"

        body: "<p>Our #BigArtRide connecting people across Europe through art and technology has come to an end, finishing its run (pedal?) in Amsterdam and Bratislava last week. It has been an amazing journey filled with artworks contributed by cultural institutions from across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/bigartride.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 481px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the cutting edge technology of the virtual reality (VR) Occulus Rift headset, the Dutch design studio DROPSTUFF.nl created a virtual ride through a virtual city that allowed users to experience centuries of Europe’s art along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its start on 21 April in Brussels and Den Haag, the #BigArtRide visited Wrocław, Rome, Vienna, Prague, Berlin and Paris. As each of these cities hosted the #BigArtRide, a parallel one happened in Holland – bringing together two participants in two different cities to race against each other for the fastest time. The final #BigArtRide in Amsterdam and Bratislava celebrated the outgoing Dutch Presidency of the EU and the incoming Slovakian Presidency. To symbolise this, Marjan Hammersma, Director General of Ministry of Education, Culture and Science in The Netherlands and Ivan Sečík, State Secretary of the Slovak Ministry of Culture raced against each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many of our riders it was their first experience with VR. Usually VR experiences like this are static, you just sit in a chair. But we added the bike and a race (we are based in Holland, after all) and so made the experience much more participatory – and shared. Across European squares, in parks, at festivals and at the European Parliament the #BigArtRide brought people of all ages and walks of life together: from young kids to seniors, from cyclists to politicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, public support and participation was joined with support and participation from key stakeholders in the digital and cultural world. Some highlights of the #BigArtRide experience include EU Vice President and Commissioner for Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/ansip/blog/art-cycling-and-promoting-rich-diversity-european-culture_en\">blogging</a> about his ride. EU Commissioner Günther Oettinger tweeting in support and taking a #BigArtRide was Martine Reicherts, Director-General for Education and Culture at the European Commission We had the Dutch Minister for Education, Culture and Science Mariëtte Bussemaker virtually racing the CEO of the ING Bank, Rik Vandenberghe, and we had Dutch royalty in the figure of Prince Constantijn cycling in Utrecht (below). We have a #BigArtRide <a href=\"https://storify.com/Europeana/bigartride\">Storify</a> if you want to explore more of the social media stories the tour generated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/168366282\" title=\"#BigArtRide -  Connecting Europe through Culture and Creativity\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The #BigArtRide project was part of our #Europeana280 campaign, launching our thematic Europeana Art History Collections. The 280 campaign was named for the 28 members states who were all asked to nominate 10 art works that have contributed to a major European art movement. All the artworks nominated for Europeana 280 will be shared, with their wider stories, in our online exhibition <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our next new-media-meets-art experience will be #JumpingJacks was introduced in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania on the night of 17 June. With #JumpingJacks you become part of the art. A blog post about that evening is coming very soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<h3>The Launch of #JumpingJacks in Vilnius<br><br>\r\nAs Europeana 280’s public engagement events move from #BigArtRide to #Jumping Jacks, Donatas Snarskis tells us how the Lithuanian Art Museum kicked off this exciting event series. Read on to find out how it went and how you can get involved.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The #Europeana280 campaign offers great entertainment for those who want to engage with European art. One can celebrate Europe’s art history not only by exploring the unique <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=48&amp;view=grid\">#Europeana280 collection online</a> but also by participating in a series of events across Europe. Nine cities have already been involved in the virtual reality tour <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/big-art-ride\">#BigArtRide</a> that invited you to take part in a bike race through a virtual city populated with #Europeana280 artworks. And on the night of 17 June 2016 an interactive digital installation #JumpingJacks was launched in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. It kick-started another set of events that will be held in cultural venues across Europe until November 2016. This blog post aims to share my impressions of the Lithuanian event and to provide some insights for those eagerly waiting for their turn to try #JumpingJacks themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/jumpingjacks.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br><em>Interacting with Europeana 280 artworks in a different light. Photo by Tomas Kapočius.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Software and Artworks</strong><br>\r\n#JumpingJacks uses software designed by the Danish agency Spild af Tid that combines art, interactive technology and responds to dynamic human bodies. Participants of the #JumpingJacks digital installation see their own bodies projected onto a wall or a screen, only they are transformed by cut-out pieces from #Europeana280 public domain artworks. Instead of one’s head, torso, arms and legs - various cut-out fragments from different artworks appear. As one moves, the #JumpingJacks figure moves as well. New, unique, and moving artworks are created with every motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Context of the event</strong><br>\r\n#JumpingJacks was not the only event happening in Vilnius during the night of 17th June. There were almost 200 other projects and events spread throughout the city, part of the annual <a href=\"http://kulturosnaktis.lt/en/pages/about\">Culture Night Festival</a>. During this one-night festival theatres, museums, galleries, and churches open their doors to visitors. And various types of artistic projects - music, dance, theatre, cinema, photography, state-of-the-art installations - fill squares, streets, parks, and the most unexpected spaces of the Old Town. All the events are free and open to all. As a result, the city is filled with crowds of people eager to engage with culture and arts. You could not wish for a better occasion to host #JumpingJacks in Vilnius!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Location and Setting</strong><br>\r\n#JumpingJacks was projected on the exterior wall of the Museum of Radvilas Palace, the department of the Lithuanian Art Museum dedicated to collections and exhibitions of foreign art. It seemed an appropriate location for the event as the Lithuanian Art Museum has contributed a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/choosing-a-country-s-artworks-for-europeana-280-lithuania\">great selection</a> of images to the #Europeana280 campaign. Paintings such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063603/LIT_280_010.html\">Woman with the Artist</a> (1948) by Vytautas Kasiulis and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063603/LIT_280_003.html\">Settlers</a> (1933) by Antanas Gudaitis were highlights of the #JumpingJacks mix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, it was the setting of the event - outdoors and in the dark - that made the experience of #JumpingJacks even more special. ‘Night Changes Everything’ was the slogan of this year’s Culture Night festival and it was hard to argue with that. Lights coming from #JumpingJacks were seen from far and wide and being outdoors and outside the museum, they were symbolic of the commitment to bringing art closer to audiences that #JumpingJacks represents. Using interactive technology allowed people to directly engage with art. But the outdoor setting was equally important, so art could be enjoyed and discovered by everyone, not just museum visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weather</strong><br>\r\nNaturally, hosting an outdoor event comes with a risk of bad weather. Forecasts on the morning of 17 June were far from reassuring. Nearly apocalyptic weather - strong winds, rain, and storm with thunderbolts and lightning - was predicted for the event. Fortunately, the storm came several hours early. The weather cleared right on time and was perfect throughout the event, allowing people to enjoy the outdoor festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong><br>\r\nThe generally festive atmosphere of Vilnius was not the only factor enhancing the launch of #JumpingJacks. The Nordic Countries Concert took place less than 20m away, with Swedish, Icelandic, Danish and Nordic-Baltic bands performing. The concert gave an additional dimension of music which otherwise was missing from a #JumpingJacks event. And the audience loved it! Participants were interacting with #Europeana280 artworks while dancing with their #JumpingJacks figures were dancing along. Music and #JumpingJacks is a great fit!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience</strong><br>\r\nThe most rewarding part of the event was the number of people attracted by #JumpingJacks and their reaction to the project. Right from the start at 22.00 until the end of the festival at 02.00 people were queuing and waiting to try #JumpingJacks themselves. And many more people enjoyed watching people enjoying themselves.

        posttype: News

        body: "<h3>How was news received and reported in Europe? A question that can only be answered when archives, libraries and museums work together across borders.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A guest blog post by Steven Stegers, Programme Director of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">EuropeanaNewspapers</a> and other digitisation projects, millions of historical newspaper pages from across Europe are now freely accessible online. Free access and a standard way of organising information about these sources (such as date of publication, name of the newspaper, text of the article) help to answer the questions of how certain events were reported in Europe when they happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/newspaper.jpg\" style=\"width: 519px; height: 681px;\"><br><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/enewspapers/14441865616/in/album-72157644788660537/\">Glos Slaski</a>, frontpage, 02-07-1914, National Library Poland</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wwi-in-historic-newspapers-the-assassination-of-franz-ferdinand/\">blog post</a> by the EuropeanaNewspapers project on how the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie was reported in the news in June 1914, illustrates what can be learned from comparing and contrasting newspaper coverage across Europe and how important it is to have knowledge about the source. The blog post was complemented with a broader selection of newspaper coverage that was published as a set on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/enewspapers/sets/72157644788660537/\">Flickr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information about the date of publication helps us to find out how quickly news travelled at that time. In this case it took several days before the news was picked up in other newspapers. The information about the placement of the article (is it front page news, or is it tucked in the back?) and how it is presented (with or without illustrations, with clear headlines?) gives information about the importance given to the event. For example, the issuing of an extra edition about the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie by the Illustrirtes Wiener (The Illustrated Viennese) underlines the significance of the event for Austria-Hungary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nature of a newspaper article (what is the headline and what is actually reported) helps students to understand how the event was perceived by different groups and individuals. In this case, it is telling what words are used to describe the key people involved (for example, is Gavrilo Princip described as accused, suspect, murderer or terrorist) and the event itself (is it an assassination, murder, killing, death).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both for the analysis of the importance given to the event and the way the event is covered, it is important for students to know more about the newspapers themselves. In some cases the newspapers contain clues. For example, the text “für Gott, Kaiser und Vaterland!” (for God, Emperor and Country) above the title “Tiroler Volksblatt” (Tiroler People’s Paper) is a clear indication that the newspaper is supportive of the Austrian emperor. When these clues are less obvious it would be very helpful for educators if some background information (such as political orientation) about the newspaper is also accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In hindsight, it is also interesting to know that at the time none of the newspapers were mentioning the danger of the escalation of the conflict into a world war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The example of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand shows the potential for learning offered by access to multiple archives, museums and libraries. It also shows just how much is required to enable educators to make the best use of these resources. The blog post by EuropeanaNewspapers provides translations of key elements of the sources (such as titles) and gives contextual information about the set of sources as an introduction for researchers. In addition, the pre-selection of sources has already been made and saves anyone who would like to use the sources the time looking for these themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this work is both needed and worthwhile, museums, archives and libraries need to work closely with educators to identify what content is most relevant for them to use, and what questions are most relevant to ask and to answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana4Education</p>"

        body: "<p>Last week we released a new version of Europeana Collections, which contains improvements to the user experience. We're releasing new versions of Europeana Collections every few weeks but the most recent improvements can be summarised (in a what/how/why format) as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>License filtering: </strong><br>\r\nWhat: We have improved the \"Can I Use It\" filter.<br><br>\r\nHow:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>We have renamed the license options with more friendlier labels such as \"Free re-use\" instead of \"Yes, with attribution\".</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We have added the option to filter on individual licences (\"Show more specific licences\"), so you can filter on all public domain material, for instance.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We have grouped the individual licenses together with the three bigger license options to make it more clear which licence belongs to which category.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Why:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>User research has shown that some of our users found the labels confusing.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We have many users who like to filter on specific licenses.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Browse content:</strong><br>\r\nWhat: We have added the ability for users to just browse \"all\" of Europeana.<br><br>\r\nHow:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>On the homepage and on the homepages of the Thematic Collections there is a new option called \"Browse\", where you can browse all the nice images, videos, sounds or text files of Europeana.

So: Can't find what you're looking for in the Music Collections? Try the whole of Europeana instead.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Why:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>To improve the notion of Thematic Collections.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/screenshot.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 366px;\"><em>Les Saisons, a decorative panel by Alphonse Mucha, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055950174.html\">National Library of France</a>.

        title: 'Publishing a joint position with libraries on copyright reform'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana and library associations join forces and outline the benefits of updating the current copyright rules.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Together with our partner library associations we have authored a <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/8t8m86hzwmgm2po/140916%20eu-copyright-proposals-libraries-and-cultural-heritage-institutions-respond.pdf?dl=0\">joint paper</a> presenting recommendations that update and strengthen justified exceptions and limitations to European Copyright laws. The joint recommendations were developed by Europeana, <a href=\"http://www.eblida.org/\">EBLIDA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.publiclibraries2020.eu/\">Public Libraries 2020</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/\">IFLA</a> and <a href=\"http://libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a> in response to the Commission’s December 2015 communication “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-modern-more-european-copyright-framework-commission-takes-first-steps-and-sets-out-its\">Towards a modern, more European copyright framework</a>’. This recent publication clarifies our common position to adapt exceptions to digital and cross-border environments, and follows on from the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-ipr/advocacy\">advocacy work</a> that Europeana has been undertaking on behalf of the broader cultural heritage community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What have we been doing recently on copyright reform?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2015 we sent an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/open-letter-on-copyright-reform\">open letter</a>, supported by 67 cultural heritage institutions, to the European Commission in October 2015, and which reinforced the value and importance of being able to easily provide access to those collections which are currently invisible to the public online. This was followed by our publication of reports on t<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">he 20th century black hole</a> and a number of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/rights-clearance-case-study-report\">rights clearance case studies</a> which provide empirical evidence of the challenges, costs and consequences of the current copyright rules in the rights clearance process of publishing works online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2015 the European Commission published a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/towards-modern-more-european-copyright-framework-commission-takes-first-steps-and-sets-out-its\">communication</a> that, among other things, contains four different actions aimed at modernizing those aspects of the copyright framework that govern how Libraries, Archives and Museums can operate in the digital environment. These include a new text and data mining (TDM) exception to support and allow for greater sharing of knowledge and information within the research community and updates to the exceptions for preservation, research and private copying. In addition, the Commission also said that it aims to make 'it easier to digitise out-of-commerce works and make them available'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June’s joint paper, together with the four library organisations, we present three recommendations to address the imbalance between current copyright law, ongoing technological developments and the ability to fully benefit those working in a digital space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, we recommend the extension of existing exceptions to reflect technological realities by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Introducing a robust harmonised and mandatory exception that allows Text and Data Mining (TDM) both for non-commercial and commercial purposes. Any type of stakeholder should be allowed to carry out TDM where content has been legally obtained.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Clarifying the preservation exception (5(2)c) to provide a clear space for preservation by cultural heritage and research institutions, reflecting the use of digital technologies for preservation and the needs of born-digital and digitised works.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Updating the scope of the existing exception for private study (5(3)n) and research to take into account current practices of accessing digitised collections, including on site consultation and remote access via (closed) networks and non-commercial cross-border document supply [...] and to make available online for non-commercial purposes works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions that are not available via commercial channels, or otherwise actively managed by their rights holders.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Secondly, we recommend that these exceptions are harmonised and mandatory to facilitate the success of the single market. And finally, we recommend outlawing contractual and technical mechanisms that are routinely used by rights holders to limit the rights that cultural heritage institutions and users have as the result of exceptions to copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next on the copyright reform agenda?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission intends to propose concrete legislative proposals on 21st September 2016 that will deal with the issues identified in their communication of December 2015. Whilst there has been some recognition from the Commission of how the cultural heritage sector could benefit from introducing exceptions that work in practice, (most recently a good response to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/rights-clearance-case-study-report\">rights clearance case study report</a> which presented the realities of rights clearance from 6 organisations across Europe), it is not yet obvious which path the Commission will take. One path requires minimal changes to the existing system and suggests 'solutions' based on (extended collective) licensing. The other - ours - we have outlined here: updating existing exceptions to make copyright laws fit for the digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will continue to work collaboratively both with the Network and other organisations from the cultural heritage sector to influence decisions around real reform in Europeana Copyright law. We believe that this is essential to help improve the way we can all access, share and use cultural content online and transform the world through culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meanwhile in Vienna… the Members Council continues its work'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 21-22 June, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">Members Council</a> - the 30 elected representatives of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/about-our-network\">Europeana Network Association</a> - gathered in Vienna to discuss the Association’s role in the wider Europeana ecosystem, and its practical implementation: the 2017 Business Plan. In addition, the Councillors went through achievements to date, and Working Groups projected their next milestones.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The learned and beautiful surroundings of the <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/\">Austrian National Library</a> provided the backdrop to the second Members Council meeting of this year. The main items on the agenda were reviewing the Association’s role in the context of <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana’s strategy</a>, and contributing to Europeana’s 2017 Business Plan. But first, it was time to reflect on the work done since <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/meanwhile-in-copenhagen-our-thirty-strong-members-council-meet-for-the-first-time\">last meeting</a> and celebrate some achievements!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Highlights of the past months</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some weeks ago, the Council of the EU adopted <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9643-2016-INIT/en/pdf\">Council conclusions on the role of Europeana for the digital access, visibility and use of European cultural heritage</a>. This important document outlines the Member States’ view on Europeana, its role and future funding - read more about this in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/good-news-and-some-homework-for-europeana\">our previous blog post</a>. Over the last few months the Members Council successfully worked with Europeana Foundation to provide input into these Conclusions and raise support for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another success story was the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/i-am-europeanaeu-find-your-hero-or-heroine-in-europeana\">#AllezCulture campaign ‘I am @Europeanaeu’</a>, which invited people to post their cultural hero(in)es from Europeana Collections, on social media. The campaign, spearheaded by the Members Council, inspired hundreds of contributors from all over the world to share their favourite items, reaching almost 1 million unique individuals on Twitter. A new campaign will be launched in the autumn, so stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-07/mc-meeting1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/27238991033/in/album-72157667407030703/\">Councillors at work</a>, Austrian National Library, Image: Sebastiaan ter Burg, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Members Council had also been working on governance matters, reviewing the Association’s statutes, bylaws and procedures. Based on the lessons learned last year, we proposed amendments to these documents, which we will put before you for approval at the next Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November. Speaking of the AGM, your Councillors have been busy putting together an inspiring programme with an impressive line-up of speakers. Check the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016\">AGM page</a> for updates, and get your ticket now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reviewing the role of the Association</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we discussed the role of the Association within the wider Europeana ecosystem, as well as interaction within the Association, and its collaboration with Europeana Foundation. Using real-life scenarios, we developed ideas for improving communication and engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, the topic sparked so much interest and discussion among the Councillors, that a dedicated group will further evaluate the role of the Association in the light of current and future developments. This group will create a realigned mission statement to be ratified by the General Assembly at the AGM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing the Business Plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day of the meeting, we focussed on contributing to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/the-making-of-business-plans-at-europeana-part-1-wooden-blocks-shopping-bags\">the creation of Europeana’s 2017 Business Plan</a>, one of the Members Council’s key tasks. After some rounds of groups discussion, selected Councillors pitched the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/task-force-recommendations\">outcomes of the finished Task Forces</a>, and together we decided which of the recommendations we thought should be incorporated in the plans for the next year. The Council’s suggestions will be taken on board in the next step of the Business Plan development: the review by the Governing Board of Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-07/mc-meeting-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/27749705602/in/album-72157667407030703/\">The Members Council in action in the Austrian National Library</a>, Image: Sebastiaan ter Burg, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting ended with several <a href=\"/structure/working-groups\">Working Group</a> meetings to plan for the coming months, but not before the Councillors had the chance to get some first-hand experience of Viennese culture. Under the approving gaze of Franz Josef and Sisi, we enjoyed a guided tour through the Austrian National Library’s historic <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/state_hall.htm\">State Hall</a> and the Library’s new <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/ev/literaturemuseum.htm\">Museum of Literature</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the meeting saw lots of engagement from the Councillors, who each contributed their own expertise to the discussions. A full report of the meeting will be available soon; in the meantime, check out the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157667407030703\">pictures</a>! Our work will continue over the summer, so we’ll keep you posted on new developments here. The Council’s next meeting will be in Riga, right before the start of the AGM. If you have topics you’d like to see discussed, do not hesitate to get in touch with <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\">one of the Councillors</a>. See you in Latvia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<h2 id=\"docs-internal-guid-390a2ae7-e8a5-d774-ec74-af236aa72010\"><strong>Next steps for Council Conclusions</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-9643-2016-INIT/en/pdf\">Council Conclusions</a> are a success for Europeana. Placing us back in the hearts and minds of culture ministries, assuring financing (under procurement) to halfway through 2020 and if we do the job well until the next multi-annual framework and beyond. They clearly recognise Europeana's role as a platform, mentioning the various services beyond the website. These are part of the current strategic plan and its operational business plans, but we need to take the opportunity and impetus of the Council Conclusions to reflect on where we are going and what we can really achieve, what do users actually want and where we can have the greatest impact and we should do this against user data not just because we or policymakers think it might be right.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They request a couple of things from the Commission and the Member States as well as from Europeana. The Commission is asked to carry out an independent evaluation and Member States to increase the quality and openness of material that is made available. Both of these are of huge value to Europeana as a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facility-cef-digital-service-infrastructures\">Digital Service Infrastructure</a> or Platform for the Digital Cultural Heritage of Europe. The evaluation will help surface evidence of our achievements and in my view, it is a chance to get over the message of Europeana being a <strong>platform for Europe’s cultural heritage</strong>. It should also give a value to the collaborative working of the Europeana Ecosystem and the Europeana Network Association. And yes I am sure it will give insight into areas that need more attention!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The demand for better quality material chimes with user demand and particularly its use by educators and researchers. Improved data quality will also hugely help the search capability. Council Conclusions also express the need for greater user-friendliness on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections,</a> which we will also do our best to fulfil. We acknowledge that Europeana Collections and the thematic collections of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art History</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/music\">Europeana Music</a>, while a strong step in the right direction, still need a lot of work. But this should be done according to the needs of our audiences and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-07/thumbnail-by-url.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 416px;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15803/eDipRouteurBML_eDipRouteurBML_aspx_Application_ENLU_26Action_RechercherDirectement_NUID___10276__ENLU_3BAfficherVueSurEnregistrement_Vue_Fiche_Principal_3BAfficherFrameset.html\">Carte du bassin oriental de la Méditerranée</a>; Saint Christophe; Combat naval | Pierre Collin, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/api/RbWPAapQ6/redirect?shownAt=http%3A%2F%2Fsged.bm-lyon.fr%2FeDipRouteurBML%2FeDipRouteurBML.aspx%3FApplication%3DENLU%2526Action%3DRechercherDirectement%7CNUID+%3D+10276%7C%7CENLU%253BAfficherVueSurEnregistrement%7CVue_Fiche%7CPrincipal%253BAfficherFrameset&amp;provider=Biblioth%C3%A8que+municipale+de+Lyon&amp;id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeana.eu%2Fresolve%2Frecord%2F15803%2FeDipRouteurBML_eDipRouteurBML_aspx_Application_ENLU_26Action_RechercherDirectement_NUID___10276__ENLU_3BAfficherVueSurEnregistrement_Vue_Fiche_Principal_3BAfficherFrameset&amp;profile=full\">Bibliothèque municipale de Lyon</a>, Public Domain Marked </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sea Charts helped navigators set their position.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\n<strong>We need to own our position - </strong><strong>Audience/Users</strong>\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our research is telling us very conclusively that a site showing cultural heritage in the round is not what the majority of the world wants. Users coming in from the search engines, take the item they had found but rarely go on to browse the site. They do however use the material via Instagram, Wikipedia or Pinterest and they like the curated exhibitions and experiences such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/faces-of-europe\">Faces of Europe</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history/big-art-ride\">#BigArtRide</a> but as one-offs, not as repeat or longer than three-minute experiences. These “casual users” benefit from the work of Europeana to place the material elsewhere and to make it work in the search engines but they do not really use Europeana Collections. Europeana Collections is however seen to be very useful to “professional“ users, be they academics or researchers and increasingly, as the quality of the material gets better, we are reaching educators and creative reusers. These users spend time on the site and appreciate efforts to make the material work for their workflows and into their ecosystems. They account for 30% of traffic and are the returnees. Perhaps we can entice more of the casual users into the wider offerings of Europeana Collections and we should certainly try but we also should do what is the most effective use of time and money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\n<strong>We need to agree which audiences we serve and how - </strong><strong>Platform </strong>\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana started in 2008, technologies and understanding have moved on, our contributing data partners the cultural heritage institutions need more than being able to get their material out and publishable on the internet. Many cultural heritage organisations have used knowledge gained by being part of the Europeana Platform, from interoperability via the data model to frameworks for licensing and help on multilingualism. They have a made use of the platform to improve their reach and place their material into Wikipedia or within national systems or to gain access to new markets in education and research but we should be providing more, supporting them in their quests for new markets, creating shared technologies and systems to reduce costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will not be able to make the best search engine or most wonderful user experience because of the diversity and range of quality of the material provided but we can continue to work with our cultural heritage institutions to make the data better quality, more machine-readable and more open so that others can find it. Together we can continually create and implement standards and frameworks that underpin a digital service infrastructure - a platform - upon which others can build.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>We need to prove the intrinsic value of a shared platform to cultural heritage institutions and to re-users (educators, researchers, creatives) - Sustainability</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The switch to procurement means that the Commission is buying a service that fulfils a job. The service is bought with taxpayer money so it needs to be money well spent with a known return on the investment. How will they know that they have value for money? Besides agreeing to an impact framework with measurable outcomes, all stakeholders should be able to articulate the benefits and advantages of continuing financial support for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission needs to know that it is solving a market failure. That the presence of Europeana allows Europe to work more effectively as a single market as well as demonstrating our shared values through shared and diverse cultural histories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Member States need to know that their institutions have and do benefit directly from improved interoperability, from standards, from international visibility because of multilingual translation or semantic enrichment or correct legal use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional Users - Researchers need to cite the resource; Educators need to curated high-quality images; Creatives need more accurate and granular search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do we provide a service that people want and do they recognise the value of that service sufficiently to support the Commission paying for it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>We need to prove this.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We must provide the case studies and statistics, we must continue to convince the politicians and paymasters that the loss of the platform is a loss that will be felt. We must have the courage of our convictions and do this is in ways that we know will work, against what we know audiences actually want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not a coincidence that all of these points have also been identified as part of the current strategic plan of Europeana and are part of the business plans for 2016 and beyond. A variety of groups from the Member States to the Europeana Network Association have been set up to evaluate and recommend by the November 2016 how best to develop a Europeana that works for us for the next 8 years.

        body: "<p><strong>Applying Crowdfunding and Crowdsourcing for a Study Collection</strong><br>\r\nThis blog post was contributed by Olivier Schulbaum from Platoniq</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 14th June cultural heritage professionals were invited to a workshop that took place at the <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\">Mode Museum</a> (MoMu), in Antwerp. During this event they learned how to work with co-creation and crowdfunding processes designed to bring users into closer contact with their collections, including ways to attract valuable assets and services from users such as new data, voluntary work, financial contributions, and even actual collection pieces. The workshop was held by the Goteo Foundation and MoMu, with the support of Europeana. Goteo Foundation is a non-profit platform for civic crowdfunding and collaboration on citizen initiatives and social, cultural, and educational projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MoMu and the University of Antwerp have been compiling a fashion collection intended for research training and inspiration: the Study MoMu collection. This collection is available on Europeana Fashion and contains about 600 objects provided by MoMu and around 1,000 objects coming from the Heritage and Sustainability Collection from the University of Antwerp. The goals of these two institutions include improving metadata and images of the study collection, and to make them available on Europeana Fashion under an open license. To see some highlights of the Study MoMu collection, check out this <a href=\"https://es.pinterest.com/dieter_suls/study-collection-momu-university-of-antwerp/?etslf=5752&amp;eq=momu\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/kimono.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 654px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bridal gown, photo by Stany Dederen for MoMu, CC-BY-SA</em><br><br>\r\nTaking into account the importance of unlocking collections, MoMu and the University of Antwerp have partnered with Goteo Foundation to build a hybrid crowdfunding/crowdsourcing framework geared towards the creation of a “reusable fashion museum”. The study collection, to be released in September, was selected as the use-case for the workshop, because it allows participants to use and re-use the collection as they choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop posed the following questions for exploration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>How can crowd engagement support open standards for collaboration?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How can this collaboration help design a comprehensive, educative lab context?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How can we integrate the entire process (conception, design, prototyping, financing) for new project development?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop started with a few presentations introducing relevant case studies and available alternative funding tools for cultural projects. Dieter Suls of the MoMu Library presented the use-case “Study MoMu” collection to participants. Anne Debreuck, a consultant at the King Baudouin Foundation, followed with a short talk on Instruments for Cultural Patronage. With more than 30 years’ experience and a special focus on the preservation of heritage, the <a href=\"http://www.heritage-kbf.be/your-philanthropic-project\">King Baudouin Foundation</a>, based in Belgium, manages philanthropic projects, options and instruments. These include practical ways of joint fundraising, such as their “Donor’s Circle” and “Friends Of” funds, which permit individuals to join together to support projects of their choice, collectively known as their “<a href=\"https://www.kbs-frb.be/en/Centre-for-Philanthropy/Our-philanthropy-vehicles/Philanthropy-close-to-home\">Philanthropy Close to Home”</a> project. In 2015, the King Baudouin Foundation made over €30 million available to thousands of organizations; funding projects addressing civic engagement, development, health, heritage, poverty, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, a presentation, “Putting the crowd in the picture”, highlighted different crowdfunding platforms and processes, including micro-credits and peer-to-peer loans. Platoniq representatives also explained the Goteo model, which is based on social responsibility, the right to tax returns for donors who support commons-based initiatives (such as digital heritage), and creating wealth through developing open data programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first hands-on session the participants learned how to prepare a crowdfunding campaign using the Goteo model (and saw how a crowdfunding platform actually works). They also studied cases of real campaigns that were centered on open data and open culture and funded through Goteo, such as the <a href=\"https://www.goteo.org/project/vangoyourself\">VanGo Yourself campaign</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second hands-on session, the participants designed their own “RE-usable Fashion Museum” campaign, learning the ropes of crowdfunding as a strategy for financing projects, but also for building a community and creating greater social impact. You can watch a video of the workshop <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/kg2ttbhlb0cmjbd/IMG_1427.mov?dl=0\">here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the workshop, the MoMU crowdfunding campaign focused on the study collection will be published in September on goteo.org. The campaign aims to sponsor the acquisition and digitalization of new items for the collection, including personal items contributed by supporters. Most importantly, the crowdfunding campaign will focus on building a “reusable fashion museum”, a physical exhibition that provides users with direct access to the collection pieces, which means the possibility of coming to MoMu and getting hands-on with the collection (by seeing items up close and touching them) and also making the digitalized items available for open re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to this outcome, the majority of the participants stated in the questionnaire at the end of the workshop that they would use Goteo’s methodology for a crowdfunding campaign, and that they would be interested in organizing a similar workshop in their museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Workshops like this one are part of a growing ecosystem, where cultural heritage and philanthropy professionals can discuss things like setting up co-design labs to examine new digital financing trends, such as crowdfunding and blockchain. The ultimate aim is to provide solutions in participatory grantmaking and funds allocation for non-profit organizations, but at the same time, give greater visibility and highlight the benefits of a more open and democratic governance of networks and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSo, if you are a cultural institution interested in organizing a similar workshop about crowdfunding and crowdsourcing for new, groundbreaking prototypes, we’re ready for you! Please join us, get in touch and we can make a forward-thinking difference together.</p>"

        body: "<p>In the last few months, Twitter has been buzzing with messages about cultural gems discovered in Europeana. People from 37 countries around the world have been sharing their heroines and heroes of cultural heritage, using the phrase ‘I am @Europeanaeu’ and the tag #AllezCulture. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwnHseUg-a97NnJMYm9HWkNiQ3c/view?usp=sharing\">2,500 tweets were sent out, reaching almost 1,000,000 people</a> - check out these top 10 <a href=\"https://storify.com/TamaravanHulst1/top-10-tweets-allezculture\">inspiring examples</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/stats.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 399px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Statistics of campaign participation. Image: FollowtheHashtag.com, CC BY-SA Europeana.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The occasion for all of this activity was an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/i-am-europeanaeu-find-your-hero-or-heroine-in-europeana\">#AllezCulture campaign launched 29 March</a> by the Europeana Members Council. The aim was to heighten awareness of Europeana during the period leading up to Council Conclusions on the future of Europeana, as well as show the uniqueness of Europeana’s content by creating a buzz around it’s breadth, depth and diversity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discovering the diversity of Europeana</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to an amazing effort by members of the Europeana Network, I AM @Europeana.eu succeeded in capturing the attention and imagination of cultural heritage users, professionals and policy makers all over Europe and beyond. Tweets were coming in from all EU countries, but also from far away friends in Australia, Chile, South Africa and Japan. You all helped shed light on the awesome diversity of Europeana’s holdings - from pioneer explorers of unknown territories and local cultural figures from all nooks and crannies of Europe, to female artists, composers, writers, politicians and scientists who are often overshadowed by their male colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/scrnshot.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 295px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of two cultural heroes posted on Twitter</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strengths and weaknesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the clear and simple call to action - ‘Find your hero(ine)’ - succeeded in making more people go into Europeana to look for their favourite cultural people and items, we also faced some challenges. Participation was by far highest among Members Councillors and our immediate networks of friends and peers. Engaging wider communities of culturally interested users did not happen to the extent we had initially hoped - potentially, wider take-up across the Europeana Network Association would help for future campaigns so we need to find approaches encouraging that take-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metrics at the end of the campaign are interesting - suggesting how the choice of channel influences participation. For instance, we saw a clear gender bias towards female participation, which completely aligns with Twitter’s general gender balance with 62 % female users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A pilot to learn from</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s worth keeping in mind that this campaign was a pilot and very much dependent on a dedicated effort by the Members Council. Encouraged by the good results despite limited resources, we hope to support Europeana’s actions with future campaigns which, like this one, will be conducted in close collaboration with members of the Network. At our recent Members Council meeting in Vienna, the Working Group started sketching ideas for the next campaigns we plan to run. Some of the potential topics on our agenda are to raise awareness of the historical diversity of Europeans, and to focus attention on the creative resources in Europeana. Whatever the final topics, the goal will be to involve the Network more in communicating the value of Europeana to our sector and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFor upcoming campaigns, we’ll learn from the lessons of this one and as always, we’re open to your feedback and ideas. So please let us know what you thought worked well and what could be improved in the recent campaign, and <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu\">share your ideas for future ones</a>. We look forward to keeping working with you. #AllezCulture!</p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<h3>The benefits of having one central access point to cultural heritage online: a view from the field of education</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first heard about Europeana in 2008, I could immediately see the potential having one common reference point for European cultural content could have on education. Having one central access point to explore the diverse collections of archives, museums and libraries would, for example, enable students across Europe to compare and contrast how historical events were reported, to do archival research from any place with an internet connection, and to find sources that challenge preconceptions in much less time and less effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/train.jpg\" style=\"width: 605px; height: 403px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>A detail from the box of miniature trains, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021659/S2004_0441.html\">Deventer Museum</a>,CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nOf course, at that point, this vision had yet to be turned in to a reality. And realising the vision was easier said than done. There were, and still are, many obstacles that stand in the way of providing full access to the collections. But important steps have been made, and Europeana is now much closer to achieving its original vision than when it started. It is now possible to filter on the size of an image, making it possible to leave out those sources that are too small to be of use. More sources are available in high quality (stimulated by the availability of higher quality scanners and improved digitisation techniques). There has been a significant increase in the amount of sources that are licensed in a way that they allow for educational (re)-use and it is possible to search for similar items in the Europeana collections (so that you can find a set of sources, rather than just an individual source). Finally, it is now possible to have direct access to the source (which offers more opportunities for the use of Europeana by third parties).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince Europeana was started with the support of the European Commission, several member states and cultural institutes from Europe and beyond have worked together to provide access to cultural heritage on themes or topics of common interest via this platform. As a result of these efforts, it is now possible to search, for example, historical newspapers by date and see differences and similarities on the reporting of the same event in different newspapers. It is possible to see how news travelled in a time when communication was not so quick, to see what significance was given to the event (by looking at the place and length of the coverage) and compare what images have been used to illustrate the events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efforts have been made to provide access to sources of a certain type (such as photography through EuropeanaPhotography and EuroPhoto or moving images through EUScreen, European Digital Film Gateway and EUScreenXL), to sources related to a field of interest (such as Jewish History though Judaica or social and labour history through HOPE – History of People’s Europe), or historical events (such as the First World War through Europeana1914-1918 or EuropeanaCollections1914-1918 and the Social Political Changes in 1989 through Europeana1989). The fact that these efforts have been made by cultural institutes from multiple countries makes it possible for educators to access a much wider range of sources (compared to searching only one institute) and the streamlining of metadata makes it increasingly easier to find matching sources from the collections of different cultural institutes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom the perspective of providers of educational resources, having one central point to access the collections of multiple archives, museums and libraries is beneficial because it enables them to make use of those sources that are licensed for educational use (as long as direct links are available). EUROCLIO – European Association of History Educators, is a provider of educational resources, and is currently building online tools that educators can use to create their own online learning activities together with Webtic (an innovative internet company) and educators from its network to be integrated in Historiana (an online educational resource designed for history learning). In this context, EUROCLIO, Webtic and Europeana worked together with Europeana in the Europeana DSI1 project to create a Search and Select tool that enables educators to directly search the Europeana Collections and select sources that they want to use in their educational practice. If Europeana did not provide one central access point to the collections of various archives, museums and archives, it would have been very costly and labour-intensive to help educators access the same sources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat can still be improved, in terms of stimulating the use of the collections in education, is that educators should need less time to find what they are looking for. It can be difficult for someone who is not familiar with Europeana to get a sense of what the collections are about (within the Search and Select tool, we tried to help educators with this by providing brief overviews of selected content providers to help educators decide why they might be interested to search the collection of a specific archive). What can also help is to ensure that the Europeana Collections have enough relevant source materials on at least those areas of learning that are (most) common in curricula across Europe. For example, whereas a search on “First World War” leads to 90,094 results that are allowed to be used with attribution or restriction, a search on “Industrial Revolution” leads to only 73 results. This does not mean that there are no relevant sources, but it does mean that it takes time for educators to find what they need. In an ideal scenario the most relevant sources would be highlighted or presented as a set with a manageable amount of selected sources (as EUROCLIO has done for several sets of sources). This can be done by actively engaging communities of educators (to help set priorities for digitisation), and further investment in digitisation and improving metadata to ensure that usable content for key areas of the curriculum can be found in the Europeana Collections.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe more complete the Europeana Collections are and the easier it gets for educators or providers of educational resources to find what they are looking for, the more valuable Europeana will be become.</p>"

        body: "<p><strong>Continuing our series exploring each country's nominations for Europeana 280, Ann Maher, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator, highlights nominations from Romania.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ministry of Culture, in cooperation with the National Heritage Institute and the Art History Institute, conducted the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history?f[COUNTRY][]=romania&amp;f[PROVIDER][]=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=48&amp;view=grid\">Romanian selection</a> process for Europeana 280.

According to The National Museum of Art of Romania, their selection Girls Spinning at the Gate (1870), “captures the intimate relation between man and nature, the elegant simplicity of the folk costume while focusing on the landscape.” Grigorescu studied in Paris and was also part of the Barbizon school. For over forty years, from about 1830, artists flocked to the modest village to the southeast of Paris and took their easels out into the countryside, painting the landscape, and as ever, their fellow <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2048047/Athena_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Institutul_Na_ional_al_Patrimoniului_AF8CB242728845FBA35E8EDFE36AFC15.html\">painters</a>. In 1877, Grigorescu was a <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200221/000281248.html\">frontline artist</a> in the Romanian War of Independence (with Russia, against the Ottoman Empire).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grigorescu was a mentor to another key figure in Romanian art heritage, also known for his landscapes and still lifes. Ștefan Luchian studied in the Munich Fine Arts Academy, but left for Paris and the Académie Julian after a year. In 1900 he contributed to Romania’s pavilion at the Exposition Universelle but also experienced the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis (he died aged 48). Willows at Chiajna (1905), nominated by The Cluj-Napoca Art Museum, ‘belongs to a group of oil paintings during the artist’s full maturity period’ according to the museum. “The most brilliant colours are put together in a daring flame; the thick paint incorporates and prodigiously gives back the brilliance of the light.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cultural heyday</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romanian artists were founder members or central protagonists of many important artistic European movements such as Dadaism and Surrealism. Bucharest also experienced a flourishing of the arts in the period between the First and Second World wars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/archive/euresponsive/e6cd14f08ef21fd08ad236ccbf69dc82_euresponsive_4.jpg\">Marcel Iancu</a> (or Janco) was one of the leading Romanian intellectuals of his generation working as a painter, graphic artist, writer and architect. He was a leading exponent in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023879/LinkedHeritage_Update_ProvidedCHO_Aggregator__Museums_in_Israel___The_National_Portal_ICMS_JCO_C_14_1983.html\">Dada</a> and constructivist circles in Zurich, returning to Bucharest in 1922 where among other activities, he edited Romania’s leading avant garde magazine <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200470/BibliographicResource_3000136313152.html\">Contimporanul</a>. Portret de fată (1930), the nomination from the Constanța Art Museum, reflects his artistic directions and ‘could be considered cubist and constructivist’. Facing Jewish persecution, Ianco emigrated to British Palestine in 1941, together with his second wife Medi and his two daughters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artist and writer Victor Brauner became a leading figure in the surrealist movement but progressed through many different avant-garde styles. The Brauner selection from The Visual Arts Museum Galaţi is a portrait of the poet Ilarie Voronca (pen name Eduard Marcus), with whom he founded the Bucharest Dadadist review 75HP. In Portret of the poet Ilarie Voronca 1925, strong colour contrasts are in harmony with geometric forces. Brauner was also a contributor to the periodical <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200470/BibliographicResource_3000136330774.html\">unu</a>. Voronca, who became a French citizen in 1938, was a member of the French Resistance but committed suicide in 1946. Brauner, also based in France for much of his life, died in Paris 1966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Post-war work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Romanian artists in the country when it was under communist rule from 1948 until 1989, there were pressures to conform to the official Socialist realism view of art, but as ever, artists who continued to forge their own creative path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A selection from The Timisoara Art Museum Somnul The Sleep (1959) is the work of Corneliu Baba. Citing El Greco, Rembrandt and Goya as particularly strong influences, Baba exhibited widely at home and abroad, winning many awards, and was a significant figure in artistic education. The museum holds an extensive selection of his work including portraits of key cultural figures such as the musician George Enescu. According to the museum their selection depicts two peasants asleep: “ The rest is a dignified fall and the sleep is a surrender to the elemental world.“</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About the whole selection experience, Codruta Cruceanu from the National Museum of Art of Romania said: “The country-wide call for nominations challenged curators to think about Romanian masterpieces from new angles. One concerned contemporary European audiences, the other the idea of national visual identity as a reflection of shifting historical, social, cultural paradigms. The sheer difference between the post-Byzantine visual legacy of the Last Judgement by Toma de la Suceava or of Lady Roxanda’s portrait by Dobromir, the French open-air and impressionistic echoes in Grigorescu’s Girls Spinning at the Gate and the highly idiomatic avant-garde promoted by artists such as Mattis-Teutsch, Brauner or Janco, all active in Romania in the inter-war period, highlights the country’s capacity to reinvent itself and the visual expression of its open cultural identity.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the magnificent art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign via Europeana Art History Collection, our virtual exhibition or at one of our public digital events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        title: 'Searching the European Film Gateway'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>European Film Gateway: Improving search results on WW1 topics by streamlining metadata amongst content providers</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>A guest blog post is a collaboration between Steven Stegers, Programme Director of the European Association of History Educators (EUROCLIO), and Georg Eckes and Julia Welter from the European Film Gateway (EFG).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Making sure that it is possible to find information is a challenge that those in charge of curating collections have in common. People faced with this challenge have – as could be expected – responded to it in different ways, have often organised and catalogued their collections following an internal logic. As a consequence, it can become difficult for users of online portals (that give access to collections from various cultural institutions) to search across collections, often because a lot of different vocabularies are used, from different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The<a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\"> European Film Gateway</a> faced this challenge when they worked with 26 partners to make over 700 hours of film footage (ca. 3,000 film titles) from 21 film archives available online in the scope of the<a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/content/efg1914-project\"> EFG1914 project</a> (2012-2014). In order to make it easier for people to find footage they are looking for, the project partners agreed to enrich their own metadata using a sub-set of WWI-related terms from the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). Not only did this ensure that users could find interesting and relevant resources more easily, but it also helped the archives set their priorities for digitization and to identify common themes across their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, using a common vocabulary proved useful when the EFG1914 project shared their data on the<a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/\"> Europeana 1914-1918</a>. On this portal the film archives’ collections can be searched alongside documents held by national libraries that also applied WWI-related LCSH terms. Similar to the thematic entry points on the European Film Gateway, Europeana 1914-1918 also offers users access to collections via several topics based on the LCSHs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-07/gateway.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 559px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>A screenshot of <a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/content/wwi-topics\">European Film Gateway</a>, Educators can immediately get an idea of what content is available.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For educators and other users, this streamlining of vocabularies is very useful because it makes it easier to find, compare and contrast relevant content from multiple sources. Using a thematic entry point into the WWI collections allows educators to explore different aspects of the war across different countries, for example the lives of civilians, or how animals were used in the war. The list of topics made available on the European Film Gateway page (see screenshot above) also helps educators to get a quick overview of what content is available in the collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because of the streamlining of metadata, educators now have access to audiovisual materials covering different aspects of World War I with content from different archives. For example, those who select the category 'casualties' will find material from more than 20 different content providers. This is important because searching for 'casualties' within one collection often shows a one-sided perspective that might, for instance, give an impression that the war casualties were enemies. The ability to search across collections gives a much richer offer of materials and different perspectives for educators that want to teach about this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The presentation of the selected World War 1 topics using thumbnails and titles helps educators to see at a glance what is available in terms of content. The presentation itself invites research questions (such as how different the fighting was at the various fronts, or what the impact was on civilians), encourages educators to focus on aspects of the war that normally do not get so much attention (such as the role of women in the war, the impact of the war on children or use of animals in the war) and enables students to look at aspects of the war that they find especially interesting (which helps to motivate them to learn more about this topic). By presenting the content in such a way, curators can highlight content that they know is interesting and which educators would otherwise have difficulty finding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#Europeana4Education</p>"

        title: 'The Case for logging'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<h3>Centralized logging and the ELK Stack</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana has a new system of centralized logging. When we say logging we do not mean the process of cutting and loading trees or logs onto trucks, but the process of collecting individual information of a running process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-08/kobo.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Kobo the elephant pushing a log, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000094769502.html\">National Library of France</a>, 1921, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s put logging into simpler words. Logging is about what happened in the past. Imagine your everyday life, most of the things that happened by the end of the day you still remember them. You know that you brushed your teeth after you had breakfast and that you locked the front door of your house before you left. Some things you know in more detail, for example that you had a doctor’s appointment at 13:00 exactly. Many of the things you remember are not particularly important but some are, like a parking spot that is paid the minute - you need to remember when exactly you purchased your ticket and for how long it lasts. This is a natural ‘logging’ in the brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In computing, logging is stored in files and these files contain precise time based activities that happened to a particular running software. Each application has it’s own logs. In bigger organisations there are usually a big set of applications that are closely related to each other. Logging in this case can be used to track down failures of a specific part of the application set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many of the things that the application will have logged will not be important but when that one failure happens, this log information will be very useful. So logs are there to provide information when something, anywhere, goes wrong. Another use case of logging is to collect and analyze user information, for example recording which country most often accesses your website based on IP address geolocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So far so good, everything looks fine, until the application set becomes bigger and bigger and is spread around multiple servers. In such big clusters questions arise like which instance has failed? From which server machine? Which application triggered the failure in the first place? In such systems it becomes very difficult and complicated to track down the series of events between applications, instances and machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At this point comes the concept of centralized logging. As the name implies, centralized logging is the concept of consolidating all the logs from multiple places in to one centralized location. So instead of logging in into each of the remote servers to locate a crash problem that one application caused, you have to access only one location, which is faster. What makes it faster is that centralized solutions nowadays provide indexing and filtering of all your logs for searching needs. Centralized logging is also useful because it allows you to identify issues that span multiple servers by correlating their logs during a specific time frame. On top of that, graphical web user interfaces make it much easier for anyone to access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana has chosen to follow the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack\">ELK</a> Stack, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/beats\">Beats</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/4.0/index.html\">Curator</a> open source solutions. The ELK acronym comes from <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash\">Logstash</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana\">Kibana</a>. This approach is free to use, with a big community behind it and all components are developed from the same company named <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/\">Elastic</a> and are well documented and efficient. A short description of the components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Elasticsearch is a distributed, scalable, highly available database with real-time search and analytics</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Logstash is a software between the application and Elasticsearch which helps parse the log events into a more meaningful structure for Elasticsearch, with many plugins supported for different needs</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Beats is a framework used to read the log files from a server and send them to logstash</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Kibana is the graphical user interface that sits on top of Elasticsearch</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Curator (as its names implies) curates the elasticsearch database by means of cleaning old indexes and optimizing the new</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following is the original structure model which would handle a very large amount of logs efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/a/janeaudas.com/drawings/d/sdTZkw8ZKH9WzS6xIF-OSmg/image?w=784&amp;h=415&amp;rev=1&amp;ac=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course we decided to go step by step and scale as we go and right now we have implemented the 3 layers on the right of this design. We have not included the redis messaging broker and buffer, because so far it was not needed. Currently, then, Europeana has a cluster of 3 elasticsearch nodes on separate dedicated servers with 2TB space each plus 1 logstash instance on another dedicated machine. Kibana, the graphical user interface, is hosted on one of the elasticsearch nodes. On average we currently have 4K documents (log events) served per second and can hold up to 90 days of data with around 40% of the storage used. We host 90 applications transmitting logs into the ELK Stack. So far we haven’t considered scaling more to reach the above design, since everything looks stable at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Centralized logging is a critical part of any well-maintained IT infrastructure. It is useful for developers and system administrators to monitor all applications at the same time on one screen and having the possibility of searching easily indexed values between them instead of looking for needles in haystacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How Kibana’s interface looks on a first glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-08/kibana-first-look.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 310px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>1.Kibana first look</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another use case is that of making visualizations out of your searches to get product information, like all the active unique api keys and how much they are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"API visualizations.png\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vxSVIdP-QdN40didyBOjBvZAaWEzy9a9awpNZn-zCAr6ulKO_5M9m_RniZZvC_p0AGZyFscXxAX2IHjJuChsmRvzY76DX78zQqkLVW7Z0B_zSEFfNMId726n91xjCpP-HR8BK-fb\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><em>2.

This gives us much more insight in what is happening in our fast growing set of applications and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Further details on how to structure and install an ELK Stack can be found online and Elastic provides enough <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/index.html\">documentation</a> and is also easy to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px/20px &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background: rgb(189, 8, 28) url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot;) no-repeat scroll 3px 50% / 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 0.85; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; border: medium none; top: 176px; left: 24px;\">Save</span></p>"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<h3>Continuing our series exploring each country's nominations for Europeana 280, Ann Maher, Europeana 280's Exhibition Coordinator, highlights nominations from England.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The selections from eight English institutions include one of the earliest selections for Europeana 280, the Lindisfarne Gospels from the eighth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-08/blake.jpg\" style=\"width: 396px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europe: a Prophecy (frontispiece), The Ancient of Days (1794), William Blake, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063624/UK_280_004.html\">The British Museum</a>, cc by nc-sa</em><em>. A prophetic book by the poet, painter and printmaker William Blake whose personal mythology has no parallels in art.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Defining the landscape (and an artistic rivalry)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the popularity of his paintings today, John Constable’s work was not particularly well received in his lifetime, though he met with success in Paris. The Hay Wain (1821), a selection from the National Gallery, is based on a site in Suffolk, and today, the cottage and river path are much as they were in Constable's time. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 (but failed to find a buyer) and then the Paris Salon of 1824 where it was awarded a gold medal by Charles X (that was never collected in person. Constable never travelled outside England).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great rivalry with another English artist, Joseph Mallord William Turner (who proclaimed ‘I am the great lion of the day’) was played out every year in the annual summer exhibition of the Royal Academy. Held without a break since 1769, it was a fixture in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2024904/photography_ProvidedCHO_TopFoto_co_uk_EU037206.html\">social season</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Turner selection from the National Gallery in London is The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up, 1838 (1839) and the moment the ship that played a distinguished role in Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar travelled from Sheerness to Rotherhithe to be broken up. The spectacularly colourful setting of the sun draws a parallel with the passing of the old warship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Responses to changing society</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artistic responses to the very dramatic changes in society in the 18th and 19th centuries including the philosophies of the enlightenment (and reaction against them) are shown in diverse selections for Europeana 280 from William Blake, Joseph Wright of Derby and William Hogarth. They were turbulent times for artists reacting against the industrialization of society. In the mid-nineteenth century, “Seven young friends who formed the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848 changed the face of British art for ever”, according to the Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery. Admiring the simplicity and clarity of medieval Italian art before Raphael (1483-1520), gave them their name. The selection from Birmingham Museums is The Last of England (1852/1855) by Ford Madox Brown, depicts the point of emigration to Australia – ‘departure in desperate circumstances for a foreign land‘. The Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery holds the most important collection of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brown trained in Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp and travelled extensively, settling in London in 1846. He worked independently and was also a designer and painter of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022317/7C17AFB2C3CF7A5347CCA37EC2317E534994B376.html\">stained glass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Victoria_and_Albert_Museum_W_10_1_to_28_1927.html\">furniture</a> for the firm of William Morris. A commission of frescoes for the Town Hall in Manchester in 1878 was completed in the year he died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manchester mill life</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he is best known for depictions of industrial landscapes, Manchester artist LS Lowry covered a wide range of themes and subjects from portraits to seascapes. He only ever used five colours: flake white, ivory black, vermilion (red), Prussian blue and yellow ochre, according to The Lowry, the arts centre that houses the largest public collection of paintings and drawings of this artist in the world. Their selection, Coming from the Mill, 1930, was described by the artist as ‘my most characteristic mill scene’. According to the museum, the painting is based on an earlier pastel drawing Lowry made in about 1917 which was one of his first composite industrial scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the magnificent art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign via our virtual exhibitions at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history\">Europeana Art History</a> or at one of our public digital events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>A post written by<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/networkpartner/merete-sanderhoff\"> Merete Sanderhoff</a>, Curator and Senior Advisor at <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en\">SMK</a>, </em>Statens Museum for Kunst, the national gallery of Denmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SMK loves Europeana. We share the same vision to inspire people everywhere to take an active part in art and culture and make it a vital part of their lives. As the National Gallery of Denmark, SMK are proud contributors to Europeana 280, the campaign that is encouraging people to explore Europe’s art heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our artworks are being put into new creative re-use – along with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5bCOUNTRY%5d%5b%5d=denmark&amp;f%5bPROVIDER%5d%5b%5d=Europeana+280&amp;page=1&amp;per_page=24&amp;q=europeana+280&amp;view=grid\">works from 13 other Danish museums</a>, and institutions all over Europe. People have been able to enjoy our collections in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/da/collections/art-history/big-art-ride.html\">#TheBigArtride</a>, on Facebook, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyArtApp\">Daily Art</a> and more. And at the upcoming SMK Friday 26 August, we’re featuring #JumpingJacks where you can make artworks come alive with your own body movements.<br><br><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-08/jumpingj2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\"><br><br>\r\n#JumpingJacks is an interactive installation developed by the Danish company <a href=\"http://www.spaceandtime.dk/\">Space &amp; Time</a>. It uses high quality images of public domain artworks shared in Europeana 280, a collection which features more than 280 diverse and unique artworks from all EU Member States, plus Norway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Space &amp; Time have created a fun and playful experience where you make figures - cut out from artworks - come alive. When you move your body in front of the installation, the figures wave their arms and legs accordingly and new combinations of body parts from different paintings appear. Check out what it looked like when <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/dancing-with-artworks\">#JumpingJacks</a> was first launched in Vilnius earlier this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an extra treat for visitors to SMK Friday, Space &amp; Time have developed a special edition of #JumpingJacks based on two classics from the SMK collection – Jens Juel’s <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020903/KMS6251.html\">portrait of the Ryberg family</a> and Constantin Hansen’s <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020903/KMS3236.html\">group portrait of Danish artists</a> in Rome. This installation will take #JumpingJacks one step further. Here figures come alive within the context of the painting, so they move around immersed in their original surroundings, as you guide their movements with your own body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SMK Fridays is a monthly event featuring a great blend of art, music, art talks, film screenings, drinks and street food served in an informal, friendly atmosphere. For the SMK Friday 26 August, we have teamed up with <a href=\"http://copenhagenartweek.dk/\">Cph Art Week</a> whose theme this year is <em>Open Gestures</em>. This is mirrored in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1570418399920530/\">SMK Friday program</a> which is all about bodies moving and gesticulating. What better occasion to launch #JumpingJacks at SMK!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are excited to be working once again with the great people from Space &amp; Time (formerly Spild Af Tid) who did pioneer work on the<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/structure/europeana-creative\"> Europeana Creative project</a> which ended with a big celebration at SMK Friday in May 2015 under the headline <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/visit-the-museum/calendar/begivenhed/aktivitet/smk-fridays-20/\">Set Art Free!</a>. Back then, their huge installation <a href=\"http://culturecam.eu/\">CultureCam</a> took over our beautiful, vaulted gallery for the evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With #JumpingJacks we look forward to hosting the new iteration and we invite you all to get playing and jumping around with art!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, see you at SMK Fridays 26 August 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/2016-08/jumpingjackssmk.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>"

        intro: ''
        body: "<h3>Continuing our series exploring each country's nominations for Europeana 280, we asked the Welsh Culture Minister and the National Library of Wales to tell us about the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art-history?f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=united+kingdom&amp;f%5BCOUNTRY%5D%5B%5D=unitedkingdom&amp;f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=National+Library+of+Wales&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+280&amp;per_page=24&amp;view=grid\">selection from Wales</a>.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-08/footballer.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 820px;\"><em>Shane Williams by David Griffiths, 2012, National Library Of Wales, CC BY 4.0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Library of Wales chose works for Europeana 280 that portray the richness of the visual history of Wales, including landscapes, portraits and genre works, from outsiders’ perspectives of Wales from the 18th century through to the 19th century, to an indigenous artisan painter’s work from the 19th century, to portraits from the 18th and 19th centuries through to works by contemporary Welsh artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Landscapes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Central to the canon of Welsh art history is, naturally, its magnificent landscape. Wales became a fashionable destination for artists during the second part of the 18th century. Due to the Napoleonic Wars people could no longer travel to Europe (especially for the ‘Grand Tour’) and so artists turned their attention to Britain. Wales with its mountainous landscape full of castles and its unique language and myths attracted artists from across Britain. The art historian Peter Lord argued in his work Gwenllian: '...Wales was perceived by English intellectuals as a strange and ancient place with the customs, dress and language of the people belonging to another age, these qualities were considered attractive'. As a result of works such as Richard Wilson’s landscapes (1712/13-1782) and Thomas Pennant’s Tours in Wales (1726-1798), Wales became very popular amongst artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the list of works for Europeana 280 are examples of how artists during this period perceived Wales in their search of the picturesque. These works include J.M.W. Turner’s ‘Dolbadarn Castle’ from 1799-1800 and James Ward’s ‘An Overshot Mill in Wales’ from 1847. There is also a landscape by arguably the best known Welsh artist of the later 20th century Kyffin Williams and his work ‘Farmers on Glyder Fach’ from ca.1980. These three examples are essential in showing how Wales has artistically evolved and that the country is now being recorded and appreciated by indigenous artists as well as by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Portraits</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Library of Wales’s Portrait Collection is the largest collection of Welsh portraits in the world, comprising over 65,000 items. Prominent figures from Welsh history are represented in the collection, from the earliest times to the present day. Sir John Ballinger, the first Librarian at the National Library of Wales, had a vision for the Library’s portrait collection when he stated that the Library should collect ‘portraits of men and women, not only celebrities, but racial types and interesting characters.’ The portraits chosen for Europeana 280 provide a varied taste of the portraits in the collection from the Welsh artist Richard Wilson’s portrait of Catherine Jones of Colomendy from c. 1740, to Benjamin West’s 1784 portrait of Dr Richard Price to the Welsh artist Christopher Williams’ portrait of Sir John Williams from c.1900-1919 to our portrait by the Cardiff based portraitist David Griffiths of the National rugby player Shane Williams before playing his final match for Wales in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Indigenous art</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>John Cambrian Rowland's work of ‘The Bellringer of Caernarvon in Costume of Trade’ is a fine example of a Welsh indigenous artisan painter who was working in Wales in the late 19th century. His subject of a lady in the traditional Welsh national costume is also integral to understanding how the country’s sense of ‘Welshness’ was formed in the 19th century. The field of Welsh art-history is constantly evolving thanks to the works of such art-historians as Peter Lord and Dr. Paul Joyner who have understood the integral role played by the Welsh artisan painters during the 18th and 19th century to the canon of Welsh Art history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modern art</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thought-provoking work ‘Vase of Flowers’ by Gwen John from ca.1910 has been included as she is an internationally acclaimed Welsh artist. But her work also highlights another important issue, Gwen John is an example of an artist who had to leave her country of birth due to the lack of academic training available in Wales during the early 20th century. Including work by Shani Rhys James, the internationally acclaimed Welsh contemporary figurative artist in this project, shows how artists are now able to create a name for themselves within Welsh borders. Shani Rhys James’s thought-provoking work ‘Studio With Gloves’ is a fine example of how Welsh art is constantly evolving to incorporate new and dynamic ways of thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope you're enjoying the magnificent art selected for the Europeana 280 campaign via our virtual exhibitions at Europeana Art History or at one of our public digital events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can follow the conversation on Twitter via #Europeana280</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original version of this text can be found at <a href=\"https://www.llgc.org.uk/discover/digital-gallery/pictures/europeana-280/\">The National Library of Wales website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>"

        body: "<h3><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7fd3c064-e544-f391-b3e9-91504b433211\"><span style=\"font-size: 18.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">Matching Public and Private Funds with Crowd Donations to Preserve and Re-use Digital Heritage: The Case of Goteo</span></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This article, written by <a href=\"http://www.youcoop.org/en/\">Platoniq</a> together with Goteo Foundation, is an introduction to a study on match funding produced as part of their involvement in the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI) project. Both organisations have been working with Europeana since 2014, designing services including co-creation, agile collaborative development and crowdfunding for re-user communities and content holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span style=\"font-size: 18.6667px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/vangogh.jpg\" style=\"width: 550px; height: 406px;\"></span></span><br><br><em>From the VanGoYourSelf crowdfunding campaign: <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/vango/man-lying-on-a-wall-l-s-lowry-1887-1976-vangod-by-tori-hryniw/\">Man Lying on a Wall</a>, LS Lowry, vanGo'd by Tori Hryniw, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous institutions interested in promoting and supporting creative projects in culture, research, technology, or science. Sometimes, they find it difficult to make their contribution visible, to reach the right sector and audience, or to get communities engaged. Institutions also search for means to help these projects raise funds, better manage the high administration costs and ensure long-term project sustainability. A match funding programme provides a powerful tool to achieve all of the above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In match funding, an institution makes a sum available to develop a specific area (culture, education, etc), then calls the community to submit projects in this area and appeals to the general public to pledge money. The crowd supports a specific project by making small fund donations that the institution matches with the same amount. For example, if the crowd donates 1,000€ to a specific project, the match funding institution (a public or private organisation) will also provide 1,000€, thus increasing the total project budget to 2,000€.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-vimeo\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/180870827\" title=\"Goteo: Matching Public and Private Funds with Crowdfunding\" width=\"600\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The match funding programmes have a clear “multiplier” effect. To start with, the credibility of the crowdfunded project increases when it has the institution’s hallmark. It receives the trust of the community and thus has a better chance of attracting crowd donations. The more crowd funds received, the higher the matching contribution by the institution and, as a result, the bigger the total project budget becomes. Data shows that a crowdfunding campaign with institutional support receives on average 180% more from crowd donations than a campaign without institutional support. Also, its success probability (reaching the minimum set campaign/project budget) is increased by up to 90% (in comparison to 71% success rate for campaigns without match funding).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example for this multiplier effect is the VanGoYourSelf crowdfunding campaign. The <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself</a> (VGY) online service was developed with the Europeana Creative project and inspires people to take a photograph of themselves while recreating well-known paintings and share the results. The VGY team ran a <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/project/vangoyourself\">crowdfunding campaign </a>on the Goteo platform during June-July 2015 to support their next development phase. For every 1€ the crowd gave to the project, the International University of Andalusia (UNIA) gave another 1€ , with a limit of up to 100€ per contribution. As there were numerous contributions above 100€, the total amount given by UNIA was 1,436€ which matched the 4,031€ given by the crowd. The campaign was successfully closed by exceeding the set budget of 5,000€.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goteo Foundation has conducted eight <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/blog/5365\">match funding calls</a> with public institutions. We gathered valuable data, which will enable the platform to improve its means for projects to build broader communities, and for match funder organisations to communicate the benefits and impact of this hybrid funding model. During the DSI1 project period, Goteo carried out research which identified opportunities for further improvements to data facilitation and visualization. All improvements have been documented on <a href=\"https://github.com/GoteoFoundation\">Goteo Foundation’s Github</a> and in the <a href=\"https://developers.goteo.org/doc/calls.html\">API matchfunding entry point</a> for developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of particular importance is the visualisation of the budgets committed to each match funding program and the flows generated by crowdfunders, as well as their social impact and geographical reach. Having this data available allows for new forms of storytelling. Goteo’s match funding site now includes a map of influence, showing campaign’s locations, gender balance, and types of organizations willing to launch projects. When a campaign is active, the map of influence becomes a map of capital flow demonstrating the strength of the multiplier effect and the co-responsible contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"mapa_fase02_ENG.jpg\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hFiO_u0UdOcndcvu8mLnRhZEUxXR5SlllTMnf8nrmmHGO29UoSEdEucL7GHKsPikh9qEk4SwfGuc-tNHK7s0btDDXP2eL1S0qjbjw7_SAhpl7Y1GCtbdOyVrqVyum6FuVzMr8tf0\" style=\"height: 318px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"mapa_fase02_ENG.gif\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/l9cHBvBnsP_5otay0ls4LEnFShZmBVPj5MwYW6sDp0O-JjYyXF-uGoSKMOMsRmmlS4NDxMmyOnepMLGvplfG6dOlm-cPJtvx0deIN8F8C1nD6p5V0JvjbZ4NULJ2dwzBOxliL3FW\" style=\"height: 318px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important development is the \"pledger's wallet\", which is an account for partners to pledge any sum at any time, and later decide which campaign(s) should receive the funds held in this virtual wallet. This feature is particularly relevant because Goteo is a foundation which allows both citizen supporters and participating private institutions in Spain to receive tax returns against their contributions to a crowdfunding campaign on Goteo. Goteo Foundation, together with Europeana, is already working on expanding this model on a European level by building a network of foundations across Europe which will serve as project certifiers to the local tax authorities.Through donation certification from the respective foundation in their country of origin, users outside Spain who make a donation to a campaign on Goteo will receive a return on their donation from the local tax authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All ideas and improvements outlined here aim to inspire institutions to release new crowdfunding calls and to encourage potential campaign initiators not only to apply, but also to detect the priorities and interests of their communities. Institutions can reach into sectors and audiences who do not usually apply for grants or public funding; they can identify new topics and specific types of projects that attract the interest of their communities. A study to define the needs related to a specific topic or community, or section of a community, can also be conducted by Goteo to inform future calls and tenders of a match funding institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Goteo Foundation and Platoniq will host a special seminar on match funding on 1 and 2 December 2016 in Barcelona.

        title: 'Merci pour tout, LUDOVIA #13: Encouraging re-use of digital cultural heritage for education in France'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Once a year, teachers, researchers and publishers for primary, secondary and higher education in France gather in the charming commune of Ax-les-Thermes for<a href=\"http://ludovia.org/2016/\"> LUDOVIA</a>, a four-day event focused on digital education. With mountains as the backdrop, educators discuss and learn about new teaching practices to engage and motivate students. On 23-26 August, over 800 participants, of which approximately 150 were speakers, attended LUDOVIA 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13th event edition focused on the use of digital resources by educators to develop presence, attention and engagement in classrooms. Europeana was invited to be this year’s guest of honor as recognition of its potential as a digital educational resource and in line with our partnership with the Ministry of Education of France. We brought a delegation comprising of representatives of Europeana and our key educational partner <a href=\"http://euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO, </a>the European Association of History Educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guest of honor, we got great exposure to the French educational communities through sessions on each event day as well as at a dedicated Europeana stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span style='font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: \"Open Sans\"; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/picture-1-jill-cousins.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span style='font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: \"Open Sans\"; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'>Jill Cousins, executive director of Europeana, gives a keynote presentation on Europeana use and goals for education. Image: CC BY-SA Europeana.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the first day of LUDOVIA our Executive Director Jill Cousins gave a keynote presentation on Europeana and its current and potential use in the field of education. In her speech, she elaborated on our strategy in education, referred to our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">policy recommendations for education</a> and highlighted examples of applications that have been developed with Europeana content or with the integration of the Europeana API. Joke Van der Leeuw-Roord, founder and special adviser at EUROCLIO, followed with a presentation on the benefits and potential of the Europeana Collections for innovative teaching, having the educational content on<a href=\"http://sas.historiana.eu/sas/\"> Historiana</a> as a case study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second event day, a round table posed the question \"Which digital resources develop presence, attention and engagement in the classroom? \". Participants explored where educators can find relevant and openly licensed digital resources and how they can effectively use them for for their classes. Milena Popova from Europeana and Alain Thillay from the French Ministry of Education were among the speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/files/2016-09/picture-2-roundtable-participants.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/picture-2-roundtable-participants.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 289px;\"></a><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0a77d260-ffb0-d4a6-59bf-c856e81e7547\"><span style='font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: \"Open Sans\"; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Participants in a round table during LUDOVIA #13. </span><span style='font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: \"Open Sans\"; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'>Image: LUDOVIA #13, CC BY-SA</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Collections were also featured in the special Explore Camp workshop on digital pedagogical resources. Aleksandra Strzelichowska from Europeana presented the Europeana 1914-1918 project and the use of this thematic collection in education, including the Europeana WW1 <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/europeana-launches-multi-touch-book-and-itunes-u-course-on-the-first-world-war\">Multi-Touch book</a> and <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/\">Transcribe</a>, a crowdsourcing initiative for the transcription of digitised historical documents. Steven Stegers, Deputy Director at EUROCLIO, demonstrated Historiana as a useful multimedia tool for history teachers to find relevant, multi-perspective, and cross-border sources (including from Europeana) and design engaging learning activities for their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/picture-3-europeana-workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0a77d260-ffb2-1639-a0b8-9d737a515f9c\"><span style='font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: \"Open Sans\"; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;'>Participants attend an Europeana workshop during LUDOVIA #13. Image: CC-BY-SA Europeana.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the last day we held a workshop on what Europeana API is and how it can be used in education. Cecile Devarenne, Europeana, introduced the audience into the Europeana API, including practical examples of queries on our portal. Her presentation was followed by three case studies showcasing the usage of the Europeana API in education: the integration of Europeana content in the <a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/\">Learning Resources Exchange portal</a> of European Schoolnet, in the European digital museum for science and technology <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">Inventing Europe</a> and Historiana of EUROCLIO. Take a look at all Europeana presentations on our <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\">Slideshare account</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was rewarding to receive positive feedback from the participants in person as well as on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisFiasson/status/768391845722394624\"> Twitter</a>, where educational professionals showed excitement in discovering Europeana and interest in creatively using our resources in classrooms. We also built connections with potential partners, varying from educational providers, such as <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reseau-canope.fr/\">Canopé</a> to educational startups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As next steps, we will actively follow up on these new connections at LUDOVIA to encourage the use of our content and the Europeana API for education. We will also continue working closely with the Ministry of Education in France towards reaching educators in France and increasing the openly licensed content from France for educational purposes on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Alain Thillay, Chief of development and dissemination of digital resources (Direction du numérique pour l'éducation [DNE]) sums it up:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Giving a better knowledge of Europeana ‘s digital resources for teachers or of the APIs to content and service publishers during the 13th annual LUDOVIA event was a real opportunity to promote Europeana4Education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this occasion, the Directorate of Digital Technology for Education (DNE) in the Ministry of Education, reaffirmed their interest in continuing dialogue with Europeana that was started during the exchanges on the Eduthèque portal, to facilitate the use and reuse by teachers (and students) of quality digital resources coming from great French cultural and scientific institutions.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow up on <strong>#Europeana4Education</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div></div>"

        title: 'Copyright reform: a first look at the Commission''s plans for cultural heritage institutions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Over the last week a number of European Commission documents have leaked, painting a relatively clear picture of what the Commission will propose later this month as part of its long awaited copyright reform package. We have seen leaks of the Commission's <a href=\"http://statewatch.org/news/2016/aug/eu-com-copyright-draft.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Assessment</a> (a working document that compares the impact of different policy options) of the proposal for a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6d07lh0nNGNNjZpcGlsQ3pJN3M/view\" target=\"_blank\">Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</a> ('DSM directive' - the actual legal text containing new copyright rules) and the accompanying <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Doc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Communication 'Promoting a fair and efficient European copyright-based economy in the digital single market</a>' (an explainer for the proposed legal measures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there has been <a href=\"http://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/08/geoblocking-google-tax-copyright-reform-shunned-eu-plan/\" target=\"_blank\">quite some controversy around parts of these plans</a> as Europeana we should be aware of what these plans - if enacted - would mean for the cultural heritage sector. Measures aimed at improving the situation of cultural heritage institutions feature prominently among the issues that the Commission plans to address: <strong>Among the 10 proposed interventions are a new, mandatory exception that would allow cultural heritage institutions to digitize their collections and a EU law that would require Member States to implement (extended) collective licensing mechanisms for the making available of Out Of Commerce works.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed directive also contains a new exception for text and data mining (<a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/2016/09/06/commission-proposes-limit-text-data-mining-europe/\" target=\"_blank\">see here for an analysis by COMMUNIA</a>). However, a number of other issues raised by cultural heritage organisations such as e-Lending, remote access to collections via (closed) networks and non-commercial cross-border document supply are not addressed by the Commission in this copyright package. A mandatory exception for preservation! With regards to the issue of digitizing works that are in the collections of cultural heritage institutions the Commission proposal is fully in line with what cultural heritage institutions have asked for. Article 5 ('preservation of cultural heritage') of the proposed DSM DIrective states that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"Member States shall provide for an exception to the rights provided from in Article 2 of Directive 2001/29/EC [the InfoSoc directive], Article 5(a) and 7(1) of Directive 96/9/EC [the database directive], Article 4(1)(a) of directive 2009/24/EC [...] and Article 11(1) of this directive [this refers to the new neighbouring right for publishers], permitting cultural heritage institutions, to make copies of any works or other subject matter that are permanently in their collections, in any format or medium, for the sole purpose and to the extent necessary for the preservation of such works and or other subject matter.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not explicitly mentioned in the text this article provides the legal basis for the (mass) digitization of works contained in the collections of cultural heritage institutions in all EU Member States. In many Member States digitization is already allowed under national implementation of article 5(2)c of the InfoSoc directive. However not all national implementations apply to digitization of full collections. Based on the above proposal cultural heritage institutions across Europe would have the same uniform right to digitize works in their collections and the Commission should be applauded for providing a level playing field here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/copyright_advocacy_blog_image.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 381px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200387/BibliographicResource_3000117276548.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wylde's Great Globe</a> from \"Two Centuries of Soho: its institutions, firms, and amusements.

Almost no one disagrees that this is a core task of cultural heritage institutions that should not be hindered by copyright. But as cultural heritage institutions have been pointing out digitizing collections is only a first step towards making them available online. Whereas the question on whether there is a need for copyright rules to make it easier for cultural heritage institutions to make available online the Out of Commerce works in their collections has been much more controversial. Given this controversy, it is not surprising that the Commission is proposing a different, more modest, approach to this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Collective Licenses for Out Of Commerce Works </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all it needs to be noted that having the issue of access to Out Of Commerce works to be addressed in the Commission's proposal is a huge success for the cultural heritage sector. Initially this issue was not on the radar of the Commission but sustained advocacy efforts by the sector have managed to have the issue recognised in this reform package. This is a huge success for all of those who have been involved in this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To facilitate access to Out Of Commerce works held by cultural heritage institutions the Commission is proposing a licensing based approach. Article 7 ('use of out-of-commerce works by cultural heritage institutions) of the proposed directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market states that:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(1) Member States shall provide that when a collective management organisation, on behalf of its members, concludes a non-exclusive license for non-commercial purposes with a cultural heritage institution for the digitization, distribution, communication to the public or making available of out-of-commerce works or other subject matter in the permanent collections of the institution, such a non-exclusive license may be extended or presumed to apply to rightsholders of the same category as those covered by the license who are not represented by the collective management organisation, provided that: </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(a) the collective management organisation is, on the base of mandates from from rightsholders, broadly representative of rightsholders in the category of works of other subject matter and of the rights which are the subject of the license. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(b) equal treatment is guaranteed to all rights holders in relation to the terms of the license; and </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(c) all rightsholders have at any time, the possibility of objecting to their works or other subject matter being deemed to be out-of-commerce and of excluding the application of the licence to their works or other subject matter </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>(2) A work or other subject matter shall be deemed to be Out Of Commerce when the whole work or other subject-matter, in all its translations , versions and manifestations, is not available to the public through the customary channels of commerce and cannot be reasonably expected to become so. [...] </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving aside a number of technical issues with the proposed language (such as the fact that under the language of this proposal works would not qualify as Out Of Commerce if a single translation is still commercially available) the proposed language would be a substantial step forwards for the cultural heritage sector. Once implemented by all Member States there would be collective licensing mechanisms facilitating rights clearance for collections that are currently locked away because of their copyright status.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Collective Licensing vs Exceptions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However comparing this proposed approach to an exception based one (which had been advocated for by most cultural heritage institutions, which most unfortunately has not been analysed in the Commission’s impact assessment) a number of limitations become apparent:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>As implicitly conceded by the European Commission in it's impact assessment <strong>this approach will take a long time before it will show any results on the ground</strong>. Where an exception would likely need to be implemented into national law within 2 years of being adopted by the EU legislator, the current proposal requires Member States to pass legislation that enable collective management organisations to include Out Of Commerce works of non-members in the scope of licenses that they grant. Licensing negotiations can take substantial amounts of time, which will likely delay the effects of such legislation for some time. Also there is no requirement on the collective management organisations to issue such licenses (although they will have a strong incentive to do so). <strong>In the end this means that while the Commission's proposal creates the possibility for a solution, it makes the realisation of the solution dependent on the willingness of CMOs to offer licenses that meet the requirements of cultural heritage institutions</strong>.</li>\r\n    <li>The approach proposed by the Commission does not apply to all types of Out Of Commerce works. While the impact assessment makes it look like the approach would cover all types of works and other subject matter this is not true. <strong>The language proposed by the Commission is limited to types of works for which there is an existing collective licensing practice and where collective rights management organisations are broadly representative</strong>. There are substantial differences with regards to the scope of collective rights management across Europe and with regards to the different types of collections held by cultural heritage institutions. <strong>By only extending the scope of existing licensing arrangements this approach will create a situation where there will be a new class of works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions that falls in between the solutions offered by the OOC regime established by the DSM directive and the works covered by the Orphan works directive</strong>.</li>\r\n    <li>Finally the approach proposed by the Commission does not contribute to more harmonization between the Member States. Article 8 of the proposed DSM directive deals with the cross border recognition of Out Of Commerce works by requiring that such works are registered in a central EU database maintained by EUIPO. <strong>Proposing a solution that will result in 28 different implementations via national legislation for a problem that is essentially the same in all of them is very difficult to reconcile with the ambition of the Commission to create a Digital Single Market</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Finally the approach proposed by the European Commision is currently questioned in a case underway at the CJEU. Based on the <a href=\"http://www.communia-association.org/2016/07/14/advocate-general-wathelet-extended-collective-licensing-not-answer-mass-digitisation/\" target=\"_blank\">Advocate General's opinion in the Soulier and Doke case</a>, extended collective licensing arrangements of the type proposed by the Commission may violate the exclusive rights granted by the InfoSoc directive. While it is out of scope of this analysis to assess the impact of the draft proposed directive on the questions raised in Soulier and Doke, it seems very likely that a decision in line with the AG opinion would severely undermine the approach chosen by the Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The way forward </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The above analysis is based on leaked draft versions of the Commission's plans. While it is still possible that elements of these proposals change it is quite unlikely. Once the Commission has published its proposal for the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market later this month, the directive needs to be approved by the European Parliament and the European Council. While the Commission has indicated that it expects a fast track procedure this is also rather unlikely and we can expect intensive discussions in the European Parliament over the course of the next year. While there are some indications that Parliament would like to see a more comprehensive approach to dealing with the issue of Out Of Commerce works (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/eu-parliament-in-favour-of-copyright-rules-better-fit-for-a-digital-age\" target=\"_blank\">the Reda report which was adopted in 2015 called for an exception based approach</a>) the position of the Council is likely to be more in line with what the Commission has proposed (as it gives Member States more leeway to find implementations in line with their own legal traditions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this situation the cultural heritage sector will need to decide whether it would like to move forward based on the Commission proposal and to focus its energy on remedying some of its technical shortcomings (which we will analyse further in a follow up-piece) or if it wants to continue its push for a comprehensive exceptions based approach instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing on the basis of the Commission's proposal it has the advantage that this approach is likely to meet less resistance from other stakeholders and from the Member States. The downside of this approach is that it is likely to be further weakened during the process. As a result the cultural heritage sector will end up with a very limited mechanism that only addresses parts of the issues faced by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this context it is important to remember that the Orphan Works directive was substantially weakened during the parliamentary process through the addition of additional requirements and last minute compromises between the different the political groups. As a result the final directive is substantially less useful for Cultural Heritage Institutions than the original Commission proposal was. There is a considerable risk that the same will happen to the Commission's proposal for dealing with Out Of Commerce works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing to push for an exceptions based approach will limit some of these risks as such an approach would establish a more comprehensive base-line. On the other hand there is a high risk of not managing to achieve such an ambitious objective, especially in respect of the position that can be expected from some of the Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It would be a missed opportunity if the approach suggested by the Commission becomes reality. It is clear that even in the best case it would only unlock some parts of the Out Of Commerce works from the collections of Europe's cultural heritage institutions</strong>. This will result in a situation where sooner or later the cultural heritage institutions will need to go back to the European legislator for a solution for the rest of the out of commerce works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly one way to reconcile the interests of Member States with an exceptions based approach can be found in another part of the Commission's proposal. The proposed exception for 'Use of works and other subject-matter in digital and cross-border teaching activities' includes an option for Member States to not apply the exception in areas where 'adequate licenses' are available in the market. <strong>This mechanism could be employed to ensure the coexistence of licensing based solutions and an exception for the making available online of Out of Commerce works. This would ensure that Licenses are used where possible while there is an exception as a fallback mechanism that kicks in where licensing does not work.</strong></p>"

It also means that its members can elect the people that speak and make decisions on their behalf.<br><br>\r\nThese elected representatives make up the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Members Council</a>, currently a group of 30 who sit at the heart of everything Europeana does. I’m lucky enough to be one of these 30 in 2016, and I sit on the six-strong Management Board of the Members Council too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I’m excited to kickstart the 2016 elections! From now until <strong>October 11</strong>, we are inviting Network Association members to put themselves forward to join us as Councillors in the Members Council. There are 28 positions open for application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current elected Members Council is composed of 30 representatives, 21 of which have served as Councillors since 2014. These representatives can either step down, run for candidacy again or return to being Association members. Over the next few years the Members Council will increase in size. In 2017 there will be 36 seats, increasing to 50 by 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/elections-blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055607035.html\" target=\"_blank\">Versailles : la salle du Sénat pendant le vote</a>, National Library of France, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So why should you run?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms, being a Councillor means helping create the annual Business Plan, or representing the interests of the Network Association, and your wider professional network, in decision making. We also lead <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/task-forces\" target=\"_blank\">Task Forces</a> and target <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/working-groups\" target=\"_blank\">Working Groups</a> on all sorts of different issues we believe are worthwhile. We very much hope that our work will lead to an increased dialogue between Association members. One way in which we work towards this is through the monthly Network newsletter. With this, each Councillor has the opportunity to speak directly to members. If you want to know more about the work of the Members Council over the past year, have a look at the series of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/network-association-newsletters\" target=\"_blank\">blogs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do I know if I’m eligible?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and sectors relevant to Europeana so long as you’re a member of the Network Association. Check out the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/management-board-members-council\" target=\"_blank\">profiles of the current Councillors</a> to learn more about their background.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-01267d4d-0e67-b029-b501-6fe314e4970c\"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re not a registered member, there’s still time to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/our-network/sign-up\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> in order to run in this year’s round of elections. You must have registered before October 5, so don’t waste any time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong><br><br>\r\nFirstly, we need you to send us a candidate profile, please do this by submitting your candidacy via the button below no later than October 11. Your manifesto will tell us why you’re running, what you stand for and want to work towards and why people should vote for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=309200e45f2a4838b6e23227a6f164a1\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://dabuttonfactory.com/button.png?t=Submit+your+candidacy&amp;f=Open+Sans-Bold&amp;ts=24&amp;tc=fff&amp;tshs=1&amp;tshc=000&amp;hp=20&amp;vp=8&amp;c=5&amp;bgt=unicolored&amp;bgc=e11d53\" style=\"width: 313px; height: 40px;\"></a><br><br>\r\nAfter 11 October, campaigning will begin. We’ll invite each of the candidates to promote themselves and the issues that matter to them. You can follow this using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23EuropeanaElects&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">#EuropeanaElects</a>.<br><br>\r\nVoting will then begin on 8 November during the meeting of the General Assembly at the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/save-the-date-europeana-network-association-agm-2016-set-for-8-9-november\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana AGM</a>. You’ll have a week from then to vote for up to three candidates. Voting is, of course, entirely anonymous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During that week, you’ll also have the opportunity to make your voice heard on other Association decisional matters. We will ask you to approve several Network Association documents such as the policy and budget for the coming year, the 2015 and 2016 annual reports, as well as important changes to the Association’s Statutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voting and elections procedures will be overseen by a Voting Committee consisting of Councillors Laura Carletti, Emmanuelle Bermès, and myself. I’ll keep guiding you through the elections right up until we announce results towards the end of November. Stay tuned for more updates, and get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu\">network@europeana.eu</a> if you have any questions.<br><br>\r\nWe look forward to your candidate profiles and your general engagement with Europeana!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>We are happy to announce the launch of the recently developed Europeana 1914-1918 transcription tool at the upcoming <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016\" target=\"_blank\">AGM in Riga</a>. Here the tool will be introduced along with the new concept of Transcribathon competitions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>What is a Transcribathon?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A Transcribathon is a competition where teams compete with each other to transcribe handwritten texts online. Each team works together on the transcription of a source from Europeana 1914-1918 (for example a diary). A jury will award points for the quantity and quality of the transcription and the presentation of the result, with a prize awarded to the winning team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first international Transcribathon will run during the course of the AGM. It will start on <strong>Monday 7 November at 2pm</strong>. Teams from the Europeana Network will have an opportunity to experience the tool hands-on in competition with teams from Latvia. <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/transcribing-europeana-1914-1918-tickets-27875173394\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Come and join a Europeana Network team by registering on Eventbrite</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Some background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Europeana1914-1918.eu</strong></a> is a unique digital archive of the First World War. In collaboration with the Europeana Foundation, the University of Oxford, Facts &amp; Files, and various other European partners, the project organises collection days and digitises and exhibits personal records of the war from all over Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first collection days were held in Germany in 2011, and over 150 such events have taken in place in more than 22 countries across Europe. The first collection days in Latvia will take place on<strong> Sunday 6 and Monday 7 November from 10am to 6pm at the National Library in Riga</strong>. All are invited to digitise and share their family memorabilia on Europeana 1914-1918. If you have never participated in a collection day, now it is your chance. Submissions to the collection can be made throughout the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association AGM 2016</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past five years, Europeana 1914-1918 has assembled almost 200,000 digital documents from all parts of Europe, ranging from postcards and uniforms to jewellery and sketchbooks. These items are only available and the metadata is relatively limited. The texts are predominantly handwritten and indexed by a summary description and keywords. Until now, users have only been able to decipher the texts of the diaries, field post cards and certificates by sight. In order to make better use of these documents a new transcription tool will be introduced: <a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.transcribathon.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea behind the tool is to utilise the sources in a better way by deciphering and transcribing the texts and linking them to an image. In this way, they can be effectively used for education, research and publications. In recent years, a number of citizen science projects have been developed as crowdsourcing campaigns intended to recruit volunteers to transcribe large numbers of historical documents. This is the first time that an initiative has been launched to transcribe sources from a pan-European project, such as Europeana 1914-1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funded by the German Federal Commissioner for Culture and the Media, a prototype test application of a transcription tool was developed in 2014. Based on this experience the team of Facts &amp; Files and Olaf Baldini developed Europeana transcribe as an enrichment tool especially custom made for the transcription, annotation and geo-tagging of sources from Europeana 1914-1918. At a later stage it could also be used for other sources from Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/student-working-an-a-transcription-using-the-online-tool.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Student working on a transcription using the online tool CC-BY-SA Facts &amp; Files</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Online campaign</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An online campaign will be initiated via social media and other platforms in order to build a community to carry out the transcriptions. The first step is to engage some of the 15.000+ contributors to Europeana 1914-1918, who so far have been directly addressed by quarterly newsletters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Information events and workshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This project provides a chance to be truly cross-generational. Young and old people can work together and contribute their specific abilities. In order to encourage participation in the Transcribathon, information events and workshops shall be organised at schools, libraries, universities and older people’s community associations. The idea is to spark an interest, especially in students, of working with handwritten historical sources. The involvement of older people makes it possible to benefit from their knowledge of older handwriting techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015 and 2016, historical media workshops were organised by Facts &amp; Files and Europeana at the Primo Levi Gymnasium (high school), Berlin-Weißensee. The aim of the workshops was to teach students a variety of media skills combining the use of modern technology and original historical documents. During the workshops, the students were able to experience the entire process of working with historical documents in an interactive way by conducting research, digitising, transcribing and evaluating the sources. Original documents collected and digitised during the collection days of the Europeana 1914-1918 project served as helpful demonstration material. More information about the workshops and a video can be found here. <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/news/workshops/\" target=\"_blank\">http://transcribathon.eu/en/news/workshops/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming years, a number of important WWI anniversaries will generate renewed interest among the media and public. These waves of interest should be maximised for the transcription campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2016-09/trying-to-get-acquainted-with-handwriting-specifics.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 305px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Trying to get acquainted with old-German handwriting specifics, CC-BY-SA Facts &amp; Files</em></p>\r\n"

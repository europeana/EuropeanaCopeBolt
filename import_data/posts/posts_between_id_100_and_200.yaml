        body: "<p>Continuing our theme of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PublicDomainMonth?src=hash&amp;lang=en\">#PublicDomainMonth</a>, at this week´s <a href=\"http://2014.okfestival.org/\">Open Knowledge Festival</a>, Europeana together with the <a href=\"http://openglam.org\">OpenGLAM initiative</a> and Dutch think tank <a href=\"http://kl.nl\">Kennisland</a> ran a workshop to discuss how to maintain a healthy and thriving public domain of cultural heritage. The festival ran from 15-16 July in Berlin, and was attended by more than 1000 people from all over the world who gathered to talk about open data, transparency, development and many other topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/92060e66-9ec7-4fea-83b4-edf1f126a60d.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 471px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image: <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/search/objecten?q=onnozelen&amp;p=1&amp;ps=12&amp;ii=7#/RP-P-2008-530,7\">Schilderkunst achtervolgd door onnozelen, anonymus, 1700 - 1800. </a>Rijksmuseum. public domain.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The principles of a healthy and thriving Public Domain are established in the Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d542819d-d169-4240-9247-f96749113eaa&amp;groupId=10602\">Public Domain Charter</a>, as essential to the social and economic wellbeing of society.(<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/public-domain-charter-101?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1\">You can read our Introduction to this here</a>). During this workshop we explored how cultural institutions can work towards maintaining the public domain as a valuable source of knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The session started with Kennisland’s <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/about-kennisland/people/paul-keller%20\">Paul Keller</a> presenting the difficulties for institutions to define if an object is in the public domain or not. Thanks to complex international, European and national copyright laws, calculating when an object is in the public domain ranges from simple to the complex. Cultural heritage institutions, who are required to make decisions based on copyright, do not typically employ copyright law experts. This lack of clarity combined with lack of very specific expertise can often result in an organisational policy, which restricts the use of digital objects by incorrectly claiming copyright allows them to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we stick with the strict interpretation of law, we run the risk of losing access to valuable cultural heritage material. So when should exceptions be ok? Paul went on to present a number of case studies where it is debatable whether this type of organisational policy is acceptable or not, such as the recent release from the Wellcome Library, where <a href=\"http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2014/01/thousands-of-years-of-visual-culture-made-free-through-wellcome-images/\">over 100.000 images </a>were made available in high quality using the<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"> Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a>. While on the one hand it is applauded that these images are made available for anyone to use <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org\">in an open way</a>, it does not acknowledge that the material is out of copyright, and therefore cannot be made available under a copyright licence. For more details see the presentation slides below.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"356\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/37076756\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"427\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/paulkeller/140716ok-fest-publicdomain\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Maintaining a healthy and thriving Public Domain\">Maintaining a healthy and thriving Public Domain</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/paulkeller\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Keller</a></strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we delve deeper into the issues, we turned to look at the application of copyright law itself. <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/staff/margoni.html\">Thomas Margoni</a> from the Institute for Information Law in Amsterdam presented his ongoing research, which queries when a digital reproduction of an existing (protected or unprotected by copyright) object gives rise to a new object that can claim copyright and/or related rights. This research reviews EU laws to address the different ways in which legal exceptions are applied. The preliminary results are available in the slides below.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"356\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/37120545?rel=0\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"427\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/oknf-pres\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ThomasMargoni - Digitizing cultural heritage at OKFestival 2014 in Berlin\">ThomasMargoni - Digitizing cultural heritage at OKFestival 2014 in Berlin</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The many exceptions in the different European Member States make it difficult to come to a common approach. This is a challenge for both the cultural sector, as well as the organisations that work towards more openly available cultural content on the web. Would applying CC-BY licence be acceptable in order to make beautiful material, that was previously unavailable to the public, available online? Or should organisations like Europeana take a firm stand against this? One idea proposed in the workshop was an ‘Open GLAM Scorecard’ for open datasets which can be used to rank the set. This way it can be acknowledged that an institution is doing good work, but it can also be used to point out things that could be done better in order to receive a full green status of ‘open’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This workshop was the kickoff of the broader discussion. In the coming period these ideas will be further explored with the wider GLAM community to see of this would work, and if so, how the ranking should be done.

Highlighting these great images, and increasing their reach by sharing them in as many places as possible reinforces one of our objectives described in <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Strategy 2020</a>; we <em>“want to reach people through the channels that they are already already familiar with such as Wikipedia, Pinterest, and use social media so that our heritage becomes part of popular discourse”</em>.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Best practices for attributing works in the Public Domain\_</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">It is really important when we share these images we attribute the objects correctly to ensure that users know where they originate from. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/pd-usage-guide.html\"><em>Europeana Usage Guidelines for public domain works</em></a> set out eight core values that we follow when sharing works that are in the public domain.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Give credit where credit is due</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Protect the reputation of creators and providers</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Show respect for the original work</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Show respect for the creator</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Share knowledge</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Be culturally aware</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Support efforts to enrich the public domain</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">- Preserve public domain marks and notices</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Our experience and these guidelines have taught us that when possible, for all of the works we share online including those in the public domain, we <strong>credit the institution</strong> (such as the archive, museum or library) that provided the work, <strong>credit the creator</strong> or provider on behalf of the creator, <strong>mention that the work is in the public domain</strong>, and finally provide a <strong>link back to the original source</strong> for the work (usually Europeana).\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">However, we also know that it is not always possible to take a consistent approach to attribution across a large number of platforms. Especially when each platform has its own limitations or methods, for example the limited character length on Twitter. So when all else fails, we provide a link to the original source as the attribution, ensuring that the link provides the user with credits for the institution and creator.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>There are tools that can help\_</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">If you are working in an environment where you have the possibility to include HTML code, such as on a Wordpress blog, there are tools out there that can assist you with using the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain Mark</a> (PDM) in the best possible way. For example, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/choose/mark/\">Creative Commons PDM tool</a> enables you to create a label to assign to the work you are sharing, allowing the work to be easily discovered while at the same time providing valuable information about the work. As with other Creative Commons licenses, the PDM mark is available as a machine readable version, this will include important information on the key freedoms and obligations written into a format that software systems, search engines, and other kinds of technology can understand.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">This article was written as part of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PublicDomainMonth?src=hash\">#PublicDomainMonth</a> - a month dedicated to sharing knowledge, best practices and events all related to the Public Domain.

Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico (Public Domain). <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022701/4912F749E44716948A84F0F5C8FEE3DA6B382DF1.html\">Learn more</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">What is the Public Domain?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Public Domain is a shared resource. It belongs to every member of society. It is the collection of knowledge and information that is no longer protected by copyright, and is free to use without condition or restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintaining a healthy public domain is vital to our well-being, socially and economically. Without it, we limit our ability to learn from past experiences and knowledge, and to share and create new works and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We define the principles for maintaining a healthy and thriving public domain in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Europeana Public Domain Charter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Principles for a healthy public domain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Galleries, libraries and archives are the guardians of our shared knowledge, preserving knowledge and information that is in the public domain for the public good. To make this relevant in the digital world, we define the principles of a healthy public domain as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Copyright protection is temporary - Once copyright expires, the work enters the public domain.</li>\r\n    <li>What is in the public domain, stays in the public domain - The digitisation process should not create any new copyright.</li>\r\n    <li>Digital public domain works should be free to reuse, copy and modify - This right should not be limited through technical or contractual measures.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What else do I need to know?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Public Domain Charter describes the principles. To help us implement these principles we have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Worked with Creative Commons to develop the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain Mark</a> - a human and machine readable declaration making it easier for everyone to see that the work is open to all.</li>\r\n    <li>Developed the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/pd-usage-guide.html\">Public Domain Usage Guidelines</a> to encourage good practice when using Public Domain works: giving credit where credit is due, and other good advice.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>This article was written as part of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PublicDomainMonth?src=hash%20\">#PublicDomainMonth</a> - a month dedicated to sharing knowledge, best practices and events all related to the Public Domain. You can read and share the full <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d542819d-d169-4240-9247-f96749113eaa&amp;groupId=10602\">Public Domain Charter</a>.

        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The development of a successful social media presence to reach new and existing audiences is central to the outreach strategies’ of most memory institutions today, and if it is not, then we think it should be. That is why we will soon be publishing <em>Disrupting History</em>; a publication with the aim of enabling you to get the most out of your social media activities and engage the public more deeply with your collections.</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"Disrupting History\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(20).jpg\" style=\"width: 630px; height: 291px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>1.

As memory institutions we can learn from their approaches that are proving to engage millions, while at the same time do what we do best: add value and context around the collections we decide to surface on social media. These accounts are engaging millions of people with the quirky images that can be found in our museums, libraries and archives, but they are unashamedly stripped of context.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Through <em>Disrupting History</em> we will describe how working together with <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/\">Retronaut</a> - a website that showcases remarkable pictures from the the past - helped Europeana to exponentially increase the reach of partners’ collections on social media. It is easy to see that Retronaut has done a great job of lowering the threshold for users to engage with cultural collections from an enlightening perspective.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">After partners’ collections experienced hundreds of thousands of extra pageviews, quirky reproductions and millions of impressions on social media, an adoptable model developed by Europeana and Retronaut to achieve this will be discussed in the <em>Disrupting History</em> publication. It will enable you to identify the pieces in your collection that have the ingredients to go viral and generate unprecedented interest in your institution and the collections that you hold.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\n<em>Disrupting History</em> is written by <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about/staff\">Neil Bates</a> (Europeana) and <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/the-team/chris-wild/\">Chris Wild</a> (Retronaut) and will be published on August 21.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Subscribe here to be notified once the publication is available for download:</strong></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n<!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form -->\r\n#mc_embed_signup{\r\n  background:#fff;\r\n  clear:left;\r\n  font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;\r\n  width:630px;\r\n}\r\n  /* Add your own MailChimp form style overrides in your site stylesheet or in this style block.\r\n  We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file. */\r\n<div id=\"mc_embed_signup\">\r\n<!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups--><div style=\"position: absolute; left: -5000px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<!--End mc_embed_signup-->\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        body: "<p>Nick Poole answers questions about the <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Strategic Plan 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/50a9a96c-654d-4c8c-adc7-338cb22ea520.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image: Nick Poole,\_<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your view on strategy?\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, a vision is a picture of the world as it could be and a strategy is how a group of people organise themselves to get there. Europeana’s vision is a bold and important one. We are all in the business of transforming the world with culture and Europeana gives shape and momentum to this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/#\">Strategic Plan 2020</a> isn’t really about the document. It’s about bringing together a diverse and creative community, shaping a common language for us to express our hopes and ambitions and providing a way of organising ourselves to achieve them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy isn’t about telling people what to do, it’s about giving expression and shape to our shared goals and then enabling us to make decisions at an individual and collective level that help us to achieve them. As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Mintzberg\">Mintzberg</a> says, ‘strategy is a pattern in a stream of decisions’. With so many people in so many countries involved in the work of opening up cultural heritage, we really need those organising principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How has this strategic plan been constructed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Strategic Plan is a document of a conversation that has taken place in meeting rooms and conferences and bars and restaurants all over Europe over the past 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the product of Powerpoints and Post-its, champions and critics sitting across tables from each other and discussions long into the evening in many languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wherever it happens, the conversation follows similar lines - how are digital consumers changing, how can we adapt our services to meet their needs and how can we raise our voices together for the value and impact of experiencing culture online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana isn’t an office of 50 people, it’s a network of 5,000 and I am really pleased that this Strategic Plan has been developed from the ground up by engaging with the hopes and ideas of that network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the most important take-aways of this strategic plan for Europeana Network members?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it’s important to note how far Europeana has come. This Strategic Plan really represents the culmination of the learning of the last 5 years. It shows Europeana as a confident, networked organisation that understands who its audiences are and what they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, I think the most important message for Network members to take away from this Strategic Plan is that Europeana delivers, and with your support it has the ambition to deliver so much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has always had different stakeholders with different needs and expectations. This Strategic Plan shows how Europeana is reconciling those needs to create sustainable flows of value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those flows of value are critical for every part of the Europeana ecosystem. Cultural heritage and knowledge institutions need to know that if they share more, better-quality content with their audiences through Europeana, they will reap the rewards in terms of visibility, attention and reputation. That is critical, not just to the future success of Europeana, but to the future prosperity of our industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the success of this Strategic Plan depends on people standing up and getting involved. We hope that as many librarians, curators, open data activists, experts, enthusiasts, Wikipedians and makers will see it as their opportunity to join the network and share their insights and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope everyone will download and share this Strategic Plan, and get busy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllezCulture/\">transforming the world with culture!</a></p>"

        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/ac8aafea-e00a-45fb-8147-98802b5ceb99.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 292px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>‘Bestraffing van de lasteraar’ by \_Jan Brandes (1777). Rijksmuseum (Public Domain). <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1m1J9IN%20\">Learn more</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at Europeana, we talk about the Public Domain a lot. Do you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know by now that we care about sharing the metadata and objects that you have carefully digitised. We have great ambition for how this data can be shared with and used by others, how it can be used in schools, in apps and to share memories with your loved ones. We also believe that where possible, the fewest restrictions should be put in place for those sharing and using your great, rich and colourful data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what has this got to do with the Public Domain? Why do we talk about it every day in the office here in The Hague? Why should you be talking about it? Well, making cultural heritage available to everyone is our business. One of our fundamental principles is that works that are in the public domain before they are digitised, should remain in the public domain (i.e. free from copyright) once they are digitised. With 7,607,443 objects available via Europeana declared to be in the public domain, we think this is also really important to cultural heritage institutions and we want to share with you a few tips and tricks on how to apply the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d542819d-d169-4240-9247-f96749113eaa&amp;groupId=10602\">Public Domain Mark</a>. What better way to do this than to pack all of this into one month, dedicated to the Public Domain?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this month, we will be publishing blogposts from the team at Europeana, along with our long serving partners at <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/\">Kennisland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uva.nl/en\">University of Amsterdam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bnl.public.lu/\">National Library of Luxembourg</a> to share our knowledge with you in digestible portions. We’ll be telling you about a few upcoming events as well as sharing facts in 140 character via our new Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaIPR\">@EuropeanaIPR</a>, dedicated to sharing IPR information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you get involved? \_Keep an eye out for updates posted via Twitter and follow the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=PublicDomainMonth&amp;src=typd%20\">#PublicDomainMonth</a> hashtag or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaeu\">@Europeanaeu</a> to stay up to date on the campaign, and of course check our Pro website for lots of great new articles each week. Also don´t forget to follow Europeana on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/europeana%20\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/europeana\">Pinterest</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+europeana/posts\">Google+</a> where we regularly curate stunning Public Domain collections that have been made available via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Public Domain Month!</p>"

        title: 'Results of the Europeana User Survey 2014'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Earlier this year we were all ears with the launch of our biennial user survey, which was answered by over 2,000 users of the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana.eu</a> website. Every two years, we conduct such a survey to better understand what our users do when they arrive on Europeana.eu and how they feel about using the website to search, browse and share Europe’s cultural collections.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"Europeana User Survey 2014\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana-2014-Survey.jpg\" style=\"width: 1000px; height: 488px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The feedback that we receive from these user surveys has been integral in the continued development of the Europeana.eu website and related services, it also helps us grasp who our users are, how they generally rate our service and how they think Europeana.eu compares with other services on the web. In the five years that Europeana has existed, we have conducted three user surveys, the previous two being in 2009 and 2011.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Our last user survey, which was launched in Q1 of 2014, was a collaborative effort between a number of teams in Europeana together with <a href=\"http://uservision.co.uk/\">User Vision</a> - a UK based usability and accessibility design consultancy. They helped us define the questions we wanted to ask, formulate the survey and then analyse and report on the results. The survey was made available in 6 languages; English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Polish. All versions of the survey were promoted heavily via the Europeana.eu website and pushed out via Europeana’s extensive social media presence.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Exploration trumps searching</span></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Shortly after closing the survey and starting with the analysis of the results, it quickly became evident that there is a clear trend with the behavior of users on the Europeana.eu website. Based on the results of the survey, the majority of users arrive on Europeana.eu with the aim of browsing within themes and topics rather than searching. For Europeana, this has reinforced the need for prominent and explicit thematic links to support this behaviour. Art, photography and maps were the most popular genres of content for users - this obviously provides a good starting point when it comes to including \_themeatic entry points on Europeana.eu in the future.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Some other interesting findings include;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The majority of users reported overall experience of the website as 'Good':</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"//dw-europeana.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/YXpEM/1/\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The most common reason for the last visit to the Europeana.eu website is 'exploration within a topic':</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"//dw-europeana.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jqSiC/1/\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Users who download digital objects from the Europeana.eu website do so mostly for inspiration and academic research:</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"500\" src=\"//dw-europeana.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/04Si1/1/\" width=\"630\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">To learn more about our findings and conclusions you can read, download and share the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-user-survey-2014-report\">Europeana User Survey 2014 Report</a>:</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"486\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/36427011?rel=0\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"597\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Expand on the report</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">As always, we are eager for others to expand on our findings.

        body: "<p>We firmly believe that we are only as strong as the members that make up the Europeana Network. Together we have been able to achieve a terrific amount over the past five years. We want to build on those achievements by enabling a stronger and more representative network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will hear more about our visions for the future next week, when we launch our Strategy 2020. Today, we want to tell you about our ambition to firmly integrate members of the network into the structure that governs Europeana, which will ultimately deliver the Strategy 2020. To do this, we need to explain what we want to achieve and what we think we need to change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are immensely proud of the diversity of the members of our network, from cultural heritage institutions through to technology partners and the creative industries. We believe that our network will be stronger if we welcome those who share our beliefs and our values. We want to grow our network; valuing our current members and welcoming new partners who can enrich our network with new disciplines, knowledge and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an increase in the diversity of the network members, comes a need to ensure that diversity is recognised and clearly represented. But our ambition goes further than this, to the core of our vision. We want every member to have an equal voice within the network and at every level through to the governing board. We want to do this by greatly expanding the role and number of Network Officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that we have established a need for change and identified how we need to respond. We have developed a proposal that we think will help us achieve greater levels of democracy through wider participation and representation. Before we share that with you, and seek agreement on the principles, we would like to share our vision for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will send further details to network members on 4 July 2014. In the meantime, if you have any questions please email me at <a href=\"MAILTO:Julia.Fallon@europeana.eu\">Julia.Fallon@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>Every month we present one of the Europeana partners to the wider Network. This month Astrid Müller from the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek tells us about the history of the project, what they do and their plans for the future.</em></p>\n<p><strong>What it is?</strong></p>\n<p>The Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is dedicated to establishing free online access to Germany’s cultural and scientific heritage.</p>\n<p>The portal, completely organised and funded by the public sector, has the ongoing aim of linking up the digitised inventories of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions and making them available, free of charge, to the public. Millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music, sound documents and films, are being brought together and cross-referenced for unrestricted viewing on a central online portal. The DDB is also the national data aggregator for Europeana.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, the DDB is a network of cultural and scientific institutions in Germany. It enables and encourages them to cooperate, to develop and use together services and innovative tools. A map showing a constantly increasing number of organisations and institutions (already more than 2,100 in June 2014) provides an unique overview of Germany’s cultural and scientific landscape.</p>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 387px;\" src=\"https://georgebrine.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/map-institutions.png\"></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image: <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/about-us/institutions#map\">DDB</a><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>What is offered in the DDB?</strong></p>\n<p>More than 100 institutions are currently offering unrestricted access via the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek to almost 8 million records. The material includes digitised collections and indexing information from cultural and scientific institutions such as archives, libraries, museums, monuments offices, media libraries, universities and other research organisations.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 258px;\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/6a9d5e36-9cd3-4cbb-a529-f1b560cc40a8\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>Adidas 'Argentina' shoe; 5th FIFA World Cup 1954, Switzerland (Deutsches Sport &amp; Olympia Museum) <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">CC-BY-NC-SA</a></em></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>\n<p>The Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek is a network of expertise: 13 cultural and academic institutions of all cultural domains, sponsored by the Federal German government, the German States governments and local authorities. These institutions manage and oversee the development and expansion of the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/competence-network/%20\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a>.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Our history in brief</strong></p>\n<p>The decision to set up the DDB was taken in 2009 by the Federal Cabinet and at the conference of regional First Ministers. Set up in 2010, the first beta version of the online portal was launched in 2012, allowing users to research and view digitised material already totalling several million items.</p>\n<p>In 2013 the service centre and several domain-specific service desks were set up. They function as contact points and give advice and practical support for interested institutions, on how to get their material into the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek – from the first enquiry through the process of data clearance to the final publishing of <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/contact/ddb-team#servicestelle\">content on the platform</a>.</p>\n<p>In November 2013 the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/news/2013-11-04-001\">introduced its API</a>, going one step further towards providing online access to digitised cultural and scientific content and making it compatible with the Semantic Web.</p>\n<p>In March 2014 we unveiled the first full version in Berlin. The public event was the largest event organised by the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek on its own account so far. More than 300 of Germany’s culture and media professionals, policy-makers and representatives from scientific institutions met at the Gemäldegalerie (Gallery of Old Masters) to learn about the current state of development of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek. The launch was also a chance for project managers, supporters and associates of the DDB to exchange information and ideas.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/news/2014-04-10-001?lang=en\">Watch the video</a></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/news/2014-04-10-001?lang=en\"><img alt=\"\" style=\"height: 250px;\" src=\"https://georgebrine.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/video.png\"></a><p>\_</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>DDB <a href=\"http://%20http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY SA</a></em></div>\n<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>\n<p>Ongoing improvements to the individual DDB components, especially regarding the portal itself and the quality of data, are planned for 2014/2015. The next enhancements are likely to involve discovery functions, the cross-referencing of objects and semantic links, and further improvements to the search function. More virtual exhibitions, curated by content experts, will clearly show the richness and diversity of the material made available via the DDB.</p>\n<p><strong>What happens now?</strong></p>\n<p>Parallel to its work to expand the portal, the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek is an active participant in the multifaceted discourse about digital access to cultural heritage. Further essential activities are issues relating to copyrights and licences, and e.g. the creation of frameworks for cultural memory in an age of digital and networked media – a focus of the newly established ‘Digital Culture Memory’ think tank.</p>\n<p>The DDB is also involved in congresses, partnerships and events relating to digitised cultural and scientific heritage. One of the various initiatives is the first German culture hackathon, organised jointly by the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek together with its partners. Under the slogan ‘Coding da Vinci’, for the first time in Germany, programmers, designers and gamers liaised with cultural institutions during a hackathon to develop digital applications based on cultural information.</p>\n<p>Everyone is invited to attend the presentation of results and the public awards ceremony on 6 July in Berlin.

        body: "<p><em>Guest post by Laura Miles, Collections Trust</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/5a4f6634-2573-487d-a8f8-992aa9570221\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Culture_Grid_PP0023_KS01.html?start=2&amp;query=*%3A*+memorial+gate&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Partage+Plus%22&amp;rows=24%20\">Queen Alexandra Memorial, Marlborough Gate, London. Albert Gilbert</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC BY</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission funded Partage Plus project ran for 24 months, and has now reached its successful conclusion. The Partage Plus consortium comprised 25 different partner institutions, all of which shared the common aim to digitise Art Nouveau collections and make them accessible through Europeana. Over 78,000 records have been uploaded to Europeana through the project, which includes Art Nouveau architecture, artworks, posters, museum objects as well as 3D scans. Multilingual terminologies have also been used throughout the project. The University of Marburg have ensured that the multilingual vocabularies (which have been translated into the languages of all partners) enable a multilingual search in Europeana. Authority lists have also been created for the project, which has ensured continuity and consistency in the records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to providing digital images and information for 75,000 objects, the project also created over 2000 3D models of Art Nouveau museum objects, which were selected from the collection of 17 different partner museums. The 3D scanning was carried out by Steinbichler from Germany and the 3D models are available via Europeana in the form of 3D PDF files. The potential applications of such 3D models, such as potential commercial applications, have also been explored in the framework of the project, and a number of recommendations were made for the wider use of these results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as the foreseen outcomes of the project, there have been many unforeseen benefits for all of the partners who have taken part in the project. It has demonstrated the difference that European Commission funding can make to an organisation beyond the lifetime of the project. \_The Museum for Applied Arts in Vienna were able to create a permanent exhibition for their collection through the project. Furthermore, different museum departments worked collaboratively in a more intensive and effective way than previously, which will hopefully continue after the project. The Museum of Arts and Crafts in Zagreb worked hard to collaborate with cultural heritage professionals and national institutions. This resulted in representation from all over Croatia, including 64 museums, thus creating a valuable network. Partage Plus allowed the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague to put their collections online for the first time and they were able to contribute to the Czech Museums Portal, which showed 3D digital content for the first time thanks to the project. These are just a few examples from a large number of benefits. \_All of this shows that the project enabled a creation of networks, new permanent exhibitions and putting collections online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Partage Plus there are plenty more high quality Art Nouveau records available through Europeana. \_These could form the basis of future research and can be freely accessed by everyone.<br></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Guest post by Maria Drabczyk, <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/nina\">National Audiovisual Institute</a>, Poland\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Video Remix competition has just come to an end. It was a pilotconducted by the National Audiovisual Institute of Poland within the Europeana Awareness project. Its aim was to investigate whether teenagers, with a special focus on the Polish ones, know how to navigate through archives available online and how to re-use them. Do they see Europeana and related \_websites as a friendly and interesting environment? And last but not least, how much do they know about licences, Creative Commons included.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/VVaQk8hmD1Q\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Credit: Bartosz Aziewicz, Kuba Kalcowski, Magdalena Ludwicka, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Licence – what is that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the pilot competition as well as the questions asked by participants while it was running, proved that teenagers find juggling various types of licences difficult. They willingly access, search and creatively play with the content, but still are rather inattentive when it comes to taking into account legal terms of the archives’ re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lady Gaga or Coldplay tracks used as a background music – why not? It occurred quite often that authors distilled from their favourite artists’ creations without asking for their permission. The attraction of having a music hit included in one’s own work proved much stronger than maintaining legal correctness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the competition also threw up amazing stories that showed conscious and clever use of the archives is possible. \_For instance, one young artist started his remixing adventure by asking his favourite music band for permission to use their music in the background. He received a positive reply and based the whole remix on the music track. You can watch the video <a href=\"http://videoremix.europeana.eu/the-price-of-a-mile/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lessons learnt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adolescents, very strongly linked to the online world, tend to voraciously explore its content, sometimes neglecting the general rules of use. Often, this is because they are not aware of these rules. A bigger focus on education on IPR, Creative Commons and public domain licences would be advisable when considering future actions targeted at young European adolescents. There is still a great deal of work to be done in order to build consciousness on IPR among the younger generation. Wrapping it all in engaging competitions or a workshop is the right way to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results of the competition, as well as links to the winning remixes are available on the <a href=\"http://videoremix.europeana.eu/en\">Europeana Video Remix website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/nina\">National Audiovisual Institute</a> (NInA) \_is a Polish cultural institution in charge of digital preservation and dissemination of <a href=\"http://www.ninateka.pl/%20\">Polish audiovisual heritage</a>. NInA acts as curator, producer and co-producer of important cultural events and a publisher of audiovisual and audio collections. The activity abroad and on the national level involves audiovisual co-productions as well as participation in networks and hosting events in the fields of new media education, digitisation, archiving, dissemination of audiovisual content and web culture.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana V3.0 launch at Eremo'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/defdfb6f-0751-4485-acba-d91a5f26d9df.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Participants at the Europeana V3.0 kickoff. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana </a><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, we didn’t propel a new kind of rocket into space; Europeana V3.0 is just the name of the recently started core project that forms the basis of Europeana. As the successor to Europeana V2, the project aims to provide Europeana and its key partners with a framework that defines the core functions of the organisation: aggregation, facilitation, innovation and policy, distribution and engagement, network and sustainability, technology, corporate communications and management and finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Europeana V3 officially started on 1 June 2014 and will last exactly one year. To make sure that everyone is on the same page and knows what the project is about and what is expected from Europeana’s teams and partners, a kick-off meeting was organised 5-6 June at the very special venue of Eremo, a former hermitage located just outside of Ancona, Italy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">For hundreds of years, this place was inhabited by monks that led a life of penance and prayer. In recent times, the Hermitage of the White Friars of Cupramontana tried to save it from disappearing from the face of the earth, as it was falling into disrepair after being abandoned by the hermits. The remoteness and isolation of the hermitage makes it an excellent place for meetings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the kick-off, many important events that will take place this year were discussed, such as the Greek and Italian Presidency, the EuropeanaTECH conference, the Projects Group Assembly and the Annual General Meeting. More technical issues were discussed during breakout sessions, such as ‘roundtripping provider data’, which should provide the mechanisms to accommodate user-generated content in such a way that it enriches institutional metadata and can be ‘brought back’ to providers of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all of this has to be aligned with the Business Plan 2014 and the new Strategic Plan. Therefore the work package leaders were asked to present the planned activities in V3.0 and highlight connections and overlaps with other Europeana projects, such as Food and Drink, Sounds, eCloud and Space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/v3-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 800px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em style=\"text-align: center;\">Participants do some spadework at the Europeana V3.0 kickoff.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana\_</a><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not only mental work; the participants were asked to do some do some hard manual labour. Old sewages were cleaned, floors were swept and the old bell towers and their surrounding terraces were cleared. We all work in cultural heritage, but for many of us this was the first time we were actually in physical contact with ancient culture!</p>"

In the lifetime of\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">its existence, companies may have changed hands and contracts may have been lost or been unclear from the beginning. Or perhaps the product was never\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">intended for use in a digital environment. EUscreenXL is a network of audiovisual archives and public broadcasters all around Europe. Their mutual goal\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">is to explore the different ways in which archives can make their holdings accessible. Recently, copyright lawyer and fervent\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">\_<a href=\"http://ipkitten.blogspot.nl/p/the-ipkat-team.html%20\">blogger Eleonora Rosati</a> was the guest of honour at a project workshop that explored how the network\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">could contribute to copyright debates and improve the accessibility of audiovisual heritage materials online.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen portal</a> makes accessible a number of film and video content that covers a range of events, culture,\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">folklore, everyday life and news items from Europe’s history. The project explores new ways of contextualising historical film and video. It provides\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">them with unified and clear background information and makes them appealing to various kinds of users: researchers, educators, web surfers and the\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">creative industries. The project also aims to bring broadcasters and audiovisual collections closer to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/foundation\">Europeana</a> by\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">promoting the platform and <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/join-us\">growing the network</a>.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Access in Europe</strong></div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Moving images are a massively important source for the way we see ourselves and our history. US-based librarian Marion Stokes understood this when she\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">decided to dedicate a big part of her life to</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">\_<a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3022022/the-incredible-story-of-marion-stokes-who-single-handedly-taped-35-years-of-tv-news\">videotaping all 24-hour news channels</a> from her own home. Broadcasters and archives have also come to learn the value of their archival\_</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">holdings. Audiovisual archives store moving materials from different times and ages, a careful undertaking that requires precise and safe storage\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">conditions and up-to-speed digitisation methods. Once digitised, it’s an archive’s task to bring the content back to life by making them accessible to\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">the public. Inherently, that undertaking involves the possibility of overstepping the boundaries of copyright law.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">EUscreenXL is funded by the European Commission and one of the tasks of this network, covering close to every EU member state, is to explore how we can\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">increase and beef up the availability of audiovisual heritage resources on the World Wide Web. An estimated 11,4 million hours of moving image\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">materials[1] are kept safely in vaults. Many of these have been digitised over the past decade, but this task is far from complete. Even fewer are\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">accessible for general audiences. Initiatives pile up: the EUscreen portal, the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/\">European Film Gateway</a>, archives such as Italian Cinecittá Luce that \_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CinecittaLuce\">experiment with YouTube channels</a>. The workshop focused on the question: what can we, as a mixed group of rights holders, heritage keepers, and public\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">media participants, do to propagate a wider availability of audiovisual materials online? And why is so little of our audiovisual heritage findable\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">online for users and creative industries?</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">There are a number of ongoing activities at the EU level that are of importance for archives across the continent. EUscreenXL\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"><a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/archives/4096%20\">reported on the final licences for Europe</a>, which had mixed outcomes for the audiovisual sector. The consortium\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">also <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/archives/4782\">formulated a response</a> to the recent EC’s consultation on copyright. EUscreenXL consists of a wide range of\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">stakeholders that share a public mission: to inform and entertain the public of their respective nations. Yet all of them increasingly have to find ways\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">to fund their production or preservation activities by making use of the assets that their archives hold. For some, this means that copyrights contribute to\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">part of their income, and free access can be a potential danger to their livelihoods. Questions such as how long after an author’s death copyright\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">should stay in place thus strike a nerve. As <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EUscreen/20140513-euscreenxl-iprworkshopcabrera\">presenter Francisco Cabrera</a> reminded us: the stakes for copyright are all a matter of perspective. The\_</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">outlook always depends on who you ask, and from which angle you approach. For instance, the discussion about the extension of terms.\_</span>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"><img alt=\"\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 405px;\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/d71480a8-d17a-4705-9c4a-1f4f5fc51ec5\"></span></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The EUscreenXL Strategic Workshop on IPR Regulations for Audiovisual Heritage.

Europe, with its fragmented character, is tricky terrain to explore for archives in the digital realm. What is allowed in country A oversteps the rules of country B and so forth. The workshop participants enthusiastically embraced the image she borrowed from <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/publications/hugenholtz/Intellectual_Property_and%20Innovation_Lisbon_Council.pdf\">Prof. Bernt Hugenholtz</a>\_ that Article 5 of the InfoSoc directive serves as a sort of ´shopping list´ of exceptions member states can choose from. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EUscreen/20140513-euscreenxl-iprworkshoprozgonyi\">Krisztina Rozgonyi presented </a>a solution on a national level that led to the creation of Hungary’s national audiovisual archive, thanks to a media law policy developed over 10 years ago. By means of secure VPN connections and established entry points in combination with a legal deposit regulation, it allows audiovisual archives to give unlimited, certified access to the nations’ television and film history to schools and educators.</div>\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n<div><strong>To harmonise or not to harmonise?</strong></div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The workshop gave the participants a chance to discuss the parameters that could or should be moved to make this navigating a more manageable task, and who should provoke and guide the change. Discussing solutions resulted in various approaches. Some participants firmly believe in extending the country of origin principle.[2] Coming from the broadcast world, where the satellite directive has been a starting point for discussions about cross-domain access, the European Broadcasting Union’s advocacy group firmly stands for the clarity of this sort of ruling. It is wary of the possibility that a full harmonisation could lead to a common law that is the narrowest of possible understandings, instead of taking up the widest understanding, and prefers that every member state is left to their own, more or less liberal, rulings. On the broad, general question as to whether or not a new copyright declaration should be pushed for, the general answer was that such an undertaking would at least take us 20 –30 years, well beyond the project term of EUscreenXL.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">It may well be beyond our project horizon, but the material once carefully crafted by AV professionals and now responsibly taken care of by archive specialists, might still benefit. After all, this is what we hope to keep alive for 30, or 100, or 500 years from now. So we’ll continue the discussion on how this network and the audiovisual archives in it can improve access to their collections while balancing the needs of creators, the billing departments and the audience.</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">1.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>According to a 2008 study: Klijn, Edwin, and Yola de Lusenet.

        title: 'Outcomes from Europeana Aggregator Forum in the Hague'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 22-23 May 2014, the Annual Aggregator Forum was organised again at the Royal Library in the Hague. During these two\_days, over 35 representatives from 24 countries joined to discuss the future of Europeana and the aggregation landscape. They also discussed how Europeana can work in partnership with aggregators to add mutual value, and experiences and use cases. Read about the event.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The event started with a number of presentations about the current status of Europeana, and where we will be heading as a network-driven organisation. After a round of introductions, deputy director Harry Verwayen <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-strategic-plan-europeana-aggregator-forum\">gave an update about the strategic plans of Europeana going forward to 2020</a>. One thing is clear and that is that the world has radically changed since Europeana was founded in 2008. In the average person’s pocket sits a device that is far more powerful than the desktop computers we used a few decades ago, and technology keeps improving in exponential ways. This also requires cultural institutions to move forward quickly in order to stay relevant for the user. Europeana wants to help the sector in this process by providing a platform of knowledge, a network and a set of standards and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana advisor Els Jacobs continued with a summary of the current funding situation and how this will look in the future. The ICT-PSP programme from the European Commission that funded a lot of Europeana-related projects has come to an end and the situation for the next five\_years will look quite different.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest part of the forum was not filled with plenary presentations, but three rounds with a total of 6 workshops where participants could choose their topic and engage in the discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Metadata Quality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marie-Claire Dangerfield presented the results of the metadata quality task force that produced some good results in the last two\_months. With the data providers, we reviewed what good quality actually means and why good quality data is important to make the most out of connecting it with other datasets from institutions all over Europe. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-metadata-quality-task-force\">Find out more about the Metadata Quality Task Force.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aggregation workflow</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dimitra Atsidis worked with the participants through the aggregation workflow of Europeana and worked together with them to find out how this can be improved. The workshop offered room for many questions and the opportunity to put issues on the table.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia Fallon used her drawing skills to illustrate the experiences of the aggregators while helping the institutions with the correct labelling of their material. For many cultural institutions, it is hard to allocate dedicated resources to rights clearance and especially smaller and mid-size institutions do not have a legal expert as part of their staff. Europeana and the aggregators can help here by providing guidance to pick the right license and highlight benefits to opening up a collection. Here, case studies that aggregators bring to the institutions are very much appreciated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Value with partners</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I presented the strategy to provide more value to aggregators and data providers. This presentation also tied in with the discussion about metadata quality. What do institutions get in return when they put effort into making available higher quality data and content? In an open discussion, the aggregators could indicate what they would see as added value and why. One thing that clearly came out of this workshop is the need for examples and case studies where institutions benefited from opening up their collection. For this reason, Europeana aims to publish a number of papers on this topic in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Content re-use</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins worked with the participants on the first requirements of a content re-use policy. Europeana and the cultural heritage sector are connecting and collaborating more and more with all kinds of users such as scholars and creative industries. These user groups have different kinds of requirements when looking for content online. A certain degree of quality is required for them to do something meaningful with it. At the same time, institutions are hesitant to make this material openly available online. Europeana will therefore work to show the benefits for both the users as well as the institutions to open up collections of high quality content and how to do this in the best possible way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Cloud</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alastair Dunning from the European Library ran a workshop on the Europeana Cloud project. The main goal of this workshop was to find out how the cloud project could support the work of the aggregators and where they could foresee issues. Aggregators see much benefit in Europeana Cloud, particularly in terms of storage, making the workflow easier and the 'publish once, disseminate many times' model it underpins. At the moment, much more information is required on the costs and the data access policy. The project will work on answering these question in the coming period.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was great to have all these people from a wide variety of partners in one room to work on common issues and decide how to move the European digital cultural heritage landscape forward. All discussions, notes and outcomes will be taken into account when deciding on Europeana’s aggregation strategy going forward. We would like to thank everybody for attending and look forward to working with each other in the next couple of years.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Merkel talks about importance of Europeana''s WWI project'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>On Saturday in her weekly podcast, German Chancellor Angela Merkel talked to historian <a href=\"http://www.factsandfiles.com/index.php?id=34&amp;L=1\">Frank Drauschke</a> about the Europeana Awareness First World War-related project <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>. In the interview, she discussed the importance of such projects that invite people to participate in Europe´s history. They serve as a reminder that it would be 'better to negotiate 20 hours longer and talk' than ever return to such a situation of war in Europe, said Merkel. Below is the interview in German.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2fhYBWb1sdQ\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Credit: <a href=\"http://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/Webs/BKin/DE/Mediathek/mediathek_node.html?cat=videos&amp;id=872382\">Die Bundeskanzlerin</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An excerpt from the interview:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Frank Drauschke:\_</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>Ordinary, everyday testimonies of war, such as diaries, field mail and photos are preserved in Europeana as common cultural heritage across all borders and former trenches. They show clearly that the individual suffering and horror of the war were the same on all sides. What contribution does this form of applied history hold for the further integration and development of Europe?</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Chancellor Merkel:\_</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">It shows how great the suffering was. I was once invited to one of the commemorations in France, in Paris, by the former president Sarkozy. And I looked into the eyes of the elderly who were still shaped by the idea of traditional enmities and an alleged insuperability of the trenches. All of a sudden, we are reminded again of the terrors of this war by such a project and our present-day living together. We are reminded that everywhere the casualties were the sons of mothers and fathers and that they were young men who were mourned by their wives. This also shows once again, how much effort we must invest to ensure that such a thing will never happen again. Rather negotiate 20 hours longer and talk, than ever return to such a situation in the middle of Europe.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To read the full interview in English, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/7b2af04c-8207-4650-9e4f-5269c88cabe7\">click here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the German transcript, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/92b0cecd-c107-4e24-bde7-af3e476ba01f\">click here</a>.\_<br></p>"

        title: 'Rights Labelling Campaign reaches its final phase'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>At Europeana we are constantly working with the data providers, aggregators and institutions to improve the database in order to provide the best experience to the user. In order to achieve that goal, we have to give clear legal information about the digital object so the user knows what can and cannot be done with the material from the cultural heritage institutions. Throughout 2013, we have been spending a fair amount of time on improving the rights statements. This process has led to a significant reduction of the share of digital objects without any rights statements. However as outlined <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-digital-objects-to-have-valid-rights-statement-by-july\">in this recent blogpost</a>, we have not yet achieved our goal to have a rights label for all digital objects available via Europeana. In this blogpost, we would like to update you about the progress that has been made so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-launches-rights-labelling-campaign\">rights labelling campaign</a> started in 2013, \_more than 50% of all the material in Europeana did not include a rights statement even though rights labels have been mandatory since 2012. After a year of work, about 25% (roughly 8 million records) still did not include any information about the rights. In the past few months, a couple of big data providers have included rights labels. In addition, a lot of smaller institutions have done great work to add this information to their metadata. At the time of writing, only 4.5 million records are still unlabelled (14%). The Aggregation team is now making a final effort to address these collections as well. We are working with the partners and their aggregators/projects to assist them in this transition. The objective is to have no more unlabelled material by summer in the Europeana database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having good quality rights information about the objects that are available through Europeana is essential to be able to communicate to end-users if and how they can re-use the material that is being aggregated and published. Teachers need to know if they can use material they find via Europeana in the classroom or in readers. Publishers need this information if they wish to re-publish material they find via Europeana, and app developers and third-party services need rights information to ensure that services they build using the Europeana API do not infringe copyright. At the same time, good quality rights metadata improves the overall quality of the metadata and makes it a more valuable resource for all data providers and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that by implementing these changes regarding rights statements, it will be easier for end-users to make the most of the wonderful collections and objects available via Europeana. If you have any questions on this matter or want further information about Europeana’s rights statements, please check <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">here</a> or contact <a href=\"MAILTO:content@europeana.eu\">content@europeana.eu</a>.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

Europeana <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>On 16 May, students from some Bucharest colleges met with the Europeana 1914-1918 team at the Ion Neculce National College, where they received diplomas for the best First World War-related essays. This meeting was part of a series of workshops and meetings that took place in Bucharest during the ´School Otherwise Week´ (7-11 April 2014).\_<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">During this week, all Romanian schools organised extracurricular, educational activities as part of the educational programme ´To Know More, to be Better´, a non-formal national educational project. It was the perfect occasion to organise some workshops and educational activities involving pupils from grades three to 12 grade (10-18 years old) and the Europeana 1914-1918 resources.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three major colleges from Bucharest - I.Neculce, Gh. Lazar and I.L. Caragiale and the Titu Maiorescu Secondary school took part in these activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students from higher grades (9-12) wrote interesting essays and made presentations mainly using the Europeana 1914 -1918 Romanian resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The French and English teachers together with their students found inspirational resources among the impressive French and English archives of Europeana 1914-1918. Some of the themes of the children's essays were about children in war, Queen Maria of Romania and WWI and the support of the home families for the soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essays were presented during work sessions where the high school students were grouped into three teams - representing terrestrial, aerial and naval warfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Romania2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 666px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Results of the teamwork by \_Terrestrial, Aerian and Naval Warfare. Europeana <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<p>As stories were presented, the students tried to build mental images of the war from the point of view of the stories. They discussed why it was important for them to keep alive these experiences and images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the sessions, each participant had to write three words associated with war and one phrase describing their experience with the Europeana 1914-1918 resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the younger children, a different approach was chosen: The work sessions began with a presentation of images from the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/teaching-resources\">WWI British Library educational site</a> and from the Europeana 1914-1918 Romanian archive, illustrating distinct features of WWI: gas masks, battles in the night, the first ever army tanks and machine guns in war etc. In this manner, the children received important information about WWI: the date of the outbreak of WWI in Europe, the date of Romania’s entry into the war and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were invited to choose three pictures that impressed them the most, explain their choice and write three things that could best describe the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are 2 of the images (both from the British Library’ s educational website)\_that most impressed the children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Romania5.jpg\" style=\"width: 608px; height: 342px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/mother-child-gas-masks\">A mother and a child </a>wear their gas masks while cooking. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a> by Bibliothéque Nationale de France</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Romania7.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 337px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>A <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/british-soldier-makes-toilet\">British soldier is washing</a> in the stagnant water that has collected in a shell crater. <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a> Bibliotheque Nationale de France</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The children’s choices showed how moved they were about the difficult war conditions faced by ordinary people and soldiers in their daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The activities developed during the School Otherwise Week were highly appreciated both by teachers and students, who expressed the wish to continue this partnership with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Rodica Tudorica, teacher of History at the Ion Neculce College said about the Europeana 1914-1918 website:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>´It is all about a lived history, where scientific information goes hand-in-hand with the feeling; the sense with the sensibility and emotion. Every piece of historical information is filtered by \_the personal experience \_of the storyteller, so that subjective and objective, general and specific are melting together in a comprehensive and multifaceted view.’</p>"

In March 2013, the team started its work to facilitate aggregation of digital resources from small and medium local cultural institutions.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Content from local museums, archives, libraries, archaeological sites, and other similar institutions is still underrepresented in Europeana and, in general, on the internet. Cloud-based technology offers an affordable and user-friendly solution for making their content available online. This recently published video explains the project aims and how it can help smaller and mid-size institutions to get their collections on the web.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Vyo7Z4KCIow\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><em><a href=\"http://www.locloud.eu/\">LoCloud</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>LoCloud is developing a cloud-based technology infrastructure for aggregating local content. It will also provide a number of micro-services offering geo-location and metadata enrichment, multilingual vocabularies for local history and archaeology, a historical place name gazetteer and a Wikimedia application to handle relevant ‘crowd-sourced’ content. Moreover, the project is working on the implementation of a lightweight digital library software for deployment in a cloud environment, compatible with Europeana requirements. This will benefit those data providers requiring a user-friendly, scalable system for cataloguing their digital content and metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LoCloud relies on a large group of technical partners, content providers, aggregating services and partners with specific expertise which make together a very strong consortium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contacts:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"MAILTO:gunurt@arkivverket.no\">Gunnar Urtegaard</a></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">National Archive Norway/Riksarkivet<br>\n</div>"

        title: 'Keeping audiovisual content alive'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Guest blog by Marius Snyders (Managing Director of PrestoCentre and Manager International Relations at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision) on some of the key challenges that cultural heritage organisations face on digital audiovisual preservation, the work of the Presto Centre and the Presto4U project.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/5e7e4803-b515-448c-8006-04ccc1e8514e.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 300px;\"></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe world of audiovisual media is rapidly changing and the preservation of the audiovisual record is no longer the exclusive preserve of memory institutions, but an opportunity for many thousands of organisations and millions of people worldwide: recording and digitisation tools have become widely affordable, and sharing and storage platforms online are easily accessible and robust. At the same time, many of the organisations, companies and individuals producing digital audiovisual content have little (if any) idea of the sustainability issues and are severely limited in terms of resource, capacity and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the PrestoCentre, an international membership organisation and European competence centre, is to identify useful research outcomes about digital audiovisual preservation and to raise awareness and improve the adoption of these both by technology and service providers as well as media owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>Presto4U: EU Support Action for Media Archives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While digitisation spending has been on the increase in most member states, various EU-funded projects are helping to improve the framework conditions for digitisation and digital preservation, encouraging national digitisation programmes to show awareness of actions in other countries and tie in with common policies, standards and best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital preservation is the first essential step in a chain of activities that runs through cataloguing, restoration, and access to exploitation. It is also increasingly understood that the nature, volume, complexity and mutability of digital audiovisual media present a series of particularly complex challenges. In the year 2000 or so, there was a widespread assumption that digitisation would solve most media preservation problems by making perfect digital copies onto new carriers as the need arose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it has become clear that this is not the case and that digital preservation requires the indefinite error-free storage of information, together with the means for its retrieval and interpretation, irrespective of changes in technologies, support and data formats, or changes in the requirements of the user community. Copying or migrating media content to a new format is not a full solution. Technical obsolescence, transcoding, reformatting, data movement, bit loss and the physical deterioration of the support medium all constitute risks of loss of quality and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge has emerged with the rise of consumer digital media technologies, broadband networks and inexpensive data storage. Individuals ― most of them amateurs ― are producing an increasingly important volume of media, much of which is shared over social networks, which have been in existence for only a few years. User generated content is at particular risk since most of its creators are neither particularly concerned nor knowledgeable about preservation and cataloguing. Few, if any, memory institutions have the resources to take on the digital preservation of personal archives: instead, most of the work of preservation will have to be pushed back to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Presto4U2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 752px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A common digital ingest backlog: a major problem with moving audiovisual content off commercial disks and onto a preservation medium is not technical but has to do with rights clearance and the costs involved. Much of the current technological effort in reducing the obstacle of rights clearance involves codifying and automating (so far as is possible) the clearance process.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an example where Europe comes in, with a part to play that does not usurp the functions of the member states but is nevertheless fundamental. Contributing to the achievement of a Digital Single Market, the European Commission — through FP7, Horizon2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility — supports the emergence of solutions for cross-border access to and re-use of digital cultural material as well as new business models for Europe’s creative industries. There is a continuing need for coordination of policies, investments and research, the creation and use of common standards, and cooperation between media institutions, researchers, industry and governments in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Presto4U project is run by a core group of 14 PrestoCentre member organisations. The two-year project that was launched in January 2013, recently successfully completed its mid-term project review by the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project receives funding from the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme. It will deliver new tools and services to connect the different constituencies involved in digital audiovisual media preservation: expert users, who understand the problems and require technological solutions; researchers who can develop the fundamental knowledge; and technology providers who can commercialise research results as sustainable tools and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Presto4U2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 752px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Technology transfer: the scale of the technical challenges faced by audiovisual archives is large and permanent, but the number of players is relatively small and their budgets cyclical. Making the transition from late stage applied research to a commercially viable product is often the hardest part. Vendors need to know whether there is a market and who in that market might buy a new product or service, how many customers there may be, and what would they pay.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential impact of this project on society, industry and business is enormous. Applications of audiovisual include environmental monitoring, earth observation, video surveillance, corporate training, advertising and product support, voice and video call recording, medical imaging, and many more. PrestoCentre is well placed to promote the results of the project to this broad market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem of audiovisual media preservation is European in scale, and requires European-level responses, as opposed to national or local responses that run the risk of increasing the already dangerous level of fragmentation. The PrestoCentre aims to raise awareness and improve the production and adoption of audiovisual preservation tools and technologies, both by service providers and media owners, and with a particular emphasis on meeting the needs of smaller collections, media businesses and new stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information: http://www.prestocentre.org, http://www.presto4u.

People can apply from 30 April until 30 May 2014 and there are <strong>€20,000</strong> worth of prizes on offer in two dedicated tracks:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Open track</strong>: for projects that either use open content, open data or open source tools to further humanities teaching and research</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>DM2E track</strong>: for projects that build upon the research, tools and data of the <a href=\"http://www.dm2e.eu\">DM2E project</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you’re interested in patterns of allusion in Aristotle, networks of correspondence in the Jewish Enlightenment or digitising public domain editions of Dante, we’d love to hear about the kinds of open projects that could support your interest!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Why are we running these Awards?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Humanities research is based on the interpretation and analysis of a wide variety of cultural artefacts including texts, images and audiovisual material. Much of this material is now freely and openly available on the internet, enabling people to discover, connect and contextualise cultural artefacts in ways previously very difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to make the most of this new opportunity by encouraging budding developers and humanities researchers to collaborate and start new projects that use this open content and data, paving the way for a vibrant cultural and research commons to emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, the <a href=\"http://www.dm2e.eu\">DM2E project</a> has developed tools to support Digital Humanities research, such as Pundit (a semantic web annotation tool), and delivered several interesting datasets from various content providers around Europe. The project is now inviting all researchers to submit a project building on this DM2E research in a special DM2E track.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Who can apply?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The awards are open to any citizen of the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What do we want to see?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://maphub.github.io\"><img alt=\"maphub_oa_comment.png\" height=\"411px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ai5TC-4Yf1f_B7kETt5zVDe17oErQkp2RjVgz7XZqgUKx8SpKqM-RiAPWMekbBJ5qHG-J0A9kDDE1hNbcy60QJsV8x6o0ljU5T87FnZPJ--8PI6JmPDjbbdeAqMm1ILkDw\" width=\"624px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Maphub, an open source Web application for annotating digitised historical maps, was one of the winners of the first round of the Open Humanities awards</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the <strong>Open track</strong>, we are challenging humanities researchers, designers and developers to create innovative projects open content, open data or open source to further teaching or research in the humanities. For example you might want to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Start a project to collaboratively transcribe, annotate, or translate public domain texts</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Explore patterns of citation, allusion and influence using bibliographic metadata or textmining</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Analyse and/or visually represent complex networks or hidden patterns in collections of texts</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Use computational tools to generate new insights into collections of public domain images, audio or texts</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You could start a project from scratch or build on an existing project. For inspiration you can have a look at the final results of our first round winners: <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/open-humanities-awards-joined-up-early-modern-diplomacy-final-update/\">Joined Up Early Modern Democracy</a> and <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/open-humanities-awards-maphub-final-update/\">Maphub</a>, or check out the <a href=\"http://openglam.org/culture-labs\">open-source tools the Open Knowledge Foundation has developed</a> for use with cultural resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As long as your project involves open content, open data or open source tools and makes a contribution to humanities research, the choice is yours!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the <strong>DM2E track</strong>, we invite you to submit a project building on the DM2E research: information, code and documentation on the DM2E tools is available through our <a href=\"http://wiki.dm2e.eu/Main_Page\">DM2E wiki</a>, the data is at <a href=\"http://data.dm2e.eu\">http://data.dm2e.eu</a>.

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Social media has been buzzing with comments on a draft version of the European Commission’s impact assessment on copyright reform that is circulating online. Europeana has made its position on copyright reform clear via <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/eac4c7ef-dd8a-4dfe-a243-815a5d62e34d\">its response to a public consultation</a> on the review of the EU copyright rules. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/71ef8cf9-7768-4a5d-97a8-74988afb6f17\">A summary of it is available online</a>. We know that copyright reform is a topic of great interest to members of the Europeana Network, so whilst we wait for the final report to be published, Paul Keller, Vice Chair of Kennisland shares his thoughts. This post first appeared on <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/opinies/copyright-reform-assessing-the-impact-for-cultural-heritage-insti\">Kennisland.nl</a>:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Barnier <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbarniereu/status/430618637121359872\">has promised a white paper </a>to outline the general approach to EU copyright reform that the current Commission will recommend to the next elected Commission. In the meantime, we may learn something from a draft version of the impact assessment that has leaked via <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/\">statewatch.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of writing, there are five parts to the document, marked as a ‘draft to be finalised in the light of the responses to the public consultation’. Dated mid-February of this year, it has the following sections: <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/eu-com-ia-value-tree.pdf\">The introduction</a>, <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/eu-com-copyright-ia-draft.pdf\">a section on user-generated content</a>, <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-tdm.pdf\">a section on Text and Data Mining</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-disabilities.pdf\">section on Disabilities</a> and <a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-legislative-intervention.pdf\">a section assessing the impact of legislative intervention</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is an impact assessment?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impact assessments are documents that need to be produced as part of any legislative proposal in the European Commission. They are produced by working groups from all affected Directorate Generals, and as such tend to reflect the position of the Commission as a whole. Generally these documents attempt to assess the impact of a number of policy options ranging from ‘do nothing’ to a complete overhaul of the system in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The draft impact assessment <a href=\"http://ipkitten.blogspot.nl/2014/04/breaking-news-draft-impact-assessment.html\">lists four possible policy options</a>: (1) Rely on the market to improve the availability of content online, (2) Commission guidance to member states and market players, (3) legislative intervention, and (4) the development of a European copyright code. Of these four options 1 and 2 are variations of ‘do nothing’, option 4 seems unrealistic in the current climate, leaving option 3 which is by far the most interesting. In the rest of this post, we will take a closer look at how the impact assessment deals with option 3 and more specifically what it has to say about expanding exceptions that would benefit cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making more room for cultural heritage institutions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The draft impact assessment identifies two sub-options of policy - option 3; options 3a and 3b. Option 3a can best be described as harmonisation of the European legal framework with minimal expansion of exceptions. The alternative, option 3b, can best be described as harmonisation plus substantial expansion of exceptions. Here is how these policy options are worked out with regards to exceptions benefitting cultural heritage institutions (<a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-legislative-intervention.pdf\">page 62</a>):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Libraries and archives: This option [Legislative Intervention] would harmonise and make mandatory the implementation in national legislation of exceptions for preservation, for remote access for the purpose of research and private study, and for e-lending. As to the scope of the exception, two solutions can be envisaged:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:37.8pt;\">•       <em>Alternative a: The preservation exception would apply to all works including those born digital, and include format shifting. An exception for remote (off-premise) online consultation for purposes of research and private study would apply to those works to which no terms and conditions apply at the time of purchase, as long as a secure network can be assured. The e-lending exception would apply in a manner that would be functionally equivalent to physical lending and include conditions to make it compatible with the three step test. In addition, mass digitisation would be promoted through giving cross-border effect to Member States’ legislation underpinning voluntary agreements for the making available of out-of-commerce works.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:37.8pt;\">•       <em>Alternative b: The preservation exception would be extended to enable restoration and mass digitisation of all works in libraries’ collections (including all legal deposit materials) whether or not in commerce. Remote access would be extended to cover the same works.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When comparing these two sub options with the responses to the Public Consultation on EU Copyright Rules from cultural heritage institutions (such as<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-finalises-and-submits-response-to-public-consultation-on-eu-copyright-rules\">Europeana</a>or<a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/uploads/fckconnector/3db3468b-06dd-4a2a-b647-91689fb53ed9\">Dutch cultural heritage institutions</a>) it becomes clear that the needs of the cultural heritage institutions falls between the two. The Commission can (and as I explain below, should) revise these options in line with responses put forward by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enabling online access to collections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe’s cultural heritage institutions have argued that the ‘<em>most urgent issue confronting cultural heritage institutions today [is the question of] providing online access to works in their collections</em>’. Europeana and others have put forward a nuanced proposal in their response to the Public Consultation on EU Copyright Rules that seeks to expand institutions’ ability to make their collections available online while at the same time meeting the requirements of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berne_three-step_test\">three-step test</a> that mandates that exceptions are only allowed ‘<em>in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author</em>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically cultural heritage institutions propose an exception allowing online access to works in their collections as long as these works are not in commercial circulation anymore, and as long as rights holders have not rejected making them available. This proposal is more permissive than sub option a, which limits access to access via a ‘secure network’ but is more restrictive than sub option b which would allow for remote access of all works in the collections of these institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this is only a draft, this structure seems highly problematic when seen in the light of the analysis of both options further down in the document:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the assessment of the impact of sub option 3a is overwhelmingly positive (<a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-legislative-intervention.pdf\">page 67</a>)…</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.75pt;\"><em>Greater accessibility to and preservation of heritage materials, taken together with the preservation of incentives to create would contribute positively to cultural diversity. The harmonisation of exceptions for persons with a disability and for UGC would improve the balance between the fundamental right to property on the one hand, and on the other, fundamental rights such as the rights of disabled persons or the freedom of expression.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>… the possible impact of sub option 3b is painted in a very negative light (<a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-legislative-intervention.pdf\">page 69</a>):</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.75pt;\"><em>On the other hand, Option 3b proposes in some cases a scope for exceptions that could go beyond the minimum necessary to facilitate access and to reduce transaction costs, going in some cases as far as to enable non-commercial services to compete with licensed services on the basis of an exception (rather than on the basis of authorisations as it is the case with licensed commercial services) For example the expansion of the exception to enable libraries and archives to make available protected content that is otherwise distributed online by rights holders would expand significantly the opportunities for cultural heritage institutions to make their collections available to the public. However the option risks undermining competition by enabling them to compete on an uneven footing with commercial services, undermining normal commercial channels, and therefore risking incentives to create and produce.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Argumentum ad consequentiam</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does this mean for the position put forward by cultural heritage institutions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having outlined a sub option 3b that clearly does not meet the conditions of the three-step test, the impact assessment can easily dismiss this option as undesirable for enabling unfair competition with commercial services. Sub option 3a, which fails to address the crucial issue of online accessibility of collections in a meaningful way is presented as the more reasonable approach to legislative intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By incorrectly summarising the position of those in favour of meaningful expansion of exceptions and limitations, the draft impact assessment ends up favouring a rather meaningless legislative intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This draft version of the impact assessment circulating online is dated February while the consultation ended in early March, I’d hope that the final version would be updated in the light of all responses to the consultation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to the limitations benefitting cultural heritage institutions, such an update must take into account the nuanced position brought forward by many of these same organisations, That nuanced position does not map onto any of the two pre-constructed sub options in this draft of the impact assessment. This can be done in at least two ways;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way would be for the description of sub option ‘a’ to reflect the actual responses by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other way would be to define conditions that expanded exceptions would need to meet to be acceptable instead of presenting two sub options. Interestingly the passage assessing sub options contains language that can easily be used for this purpose;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27.75pt;\"><em>The interests of rights holders are not expected to be prejudiced by making compulsory of the existing exceptions (providing that a good solution is found for the issue of fair compensation when relevant) as long as specific conditions to ensure compliance with the three step test are maintained or clarified. The same respect of the three step test should be assured for new exceptions (</em><a href=\"http://www.statewatch.org/news/2014/apr/copyright-ia-legislative-intervention.pdf\"><em>page 67</em></a><em>).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying this line of reasoning to the position put forward by Europeana and others would underline that this position does not prejudice the interests of rights holders while at the same time massively improves access to cultural heritage for the citizens of Europe. It would be good if the same conclusion was arrived at in the final version of the impact assessment.<br>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/af0f9ec1-793f-418a-bd28-ac422096088a\">Annual Report and Accounts for 2013</a> is published today. As always, we hold publication until the Foundation’s accounts have been externally audited and formally signed off to the satisfaction of the Board and the Commission. Now we can communicate how we did on our performance indicators and what our highlights were over the course of last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/makingconnections.jpeg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 424px;\"><br>\r\nDownload the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/af0f9ec1-793f-418a-bd28-ac422096088a\">Europeana\_Annual Report &amp; Accounts 2013</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Report, called ‘Making Connections’ includes the stories of\_ the <a href=\"http://europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989</a> family history roadshows and the opening of our new <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> site. Now, in 2014, Europe is beginning the commemoration of the War’s centenary and the 25th anniversary of the revolution that brought down the Iron Curtain. Europeana has documented those two transforming events - the breakdown of Europe and its reunification – and made connections between the peoples of Europe and our common heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Report shows that we can collect the cultural heritage, from people themselves and from institutions, on a huge scale – 30 million items in the month we celebrated our fifth anniversary. The next question is can we find innovative ways to get it out to people? The Report shows the scale of the response when we put quantities of content on Wikimedia, Pinterest and Retronaut. It looks at how the search widget and the API are being used in a range of innovative contexts, including our own app, Europeana Open Culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of last year and into this we have been very focused on our strategy for 2015-2020. Our visionary plans and our forward thinking are important, but we have to demonstrate that year by year we get the results. If we don’t prove that, then all our visions are mirages. The Annual Report for 2013 shows what a solid year’s work the Europeana teams achieved, and the good progress that was made. \_\_</p>\r\n"

This broadcast was made in June 1940, only a couple of months after German soldiers had invaded Norway. Here speaking with an air of joviality on his efforts following the recapture of Norwegian costal municipality Narvik, Job is oblivious to the fact that the war was only just beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=COUNTRY%3Anorway&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen\">This is but one of 1,3 million digitised objects from Norway’s cultural heritage available on Europeana.eu</a>.

As part of the national celebrations, the Arts Council Norway plans to launch a campaign to raise awareness of Europeana that encourages people to explore and learn about one of the particularly important periods of Norway’s history in the past two hundred years – the Second World War. The aim of the campaign is to use Europeana to reveal the untold stories of this time, and bring to light information that will help fill in the gaps in Norway’s history. <o:p> </o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Norwegian public will be invited to help tell these untold stories of the war through the creation of digital stories by using material available via Europeana from Norway and from sources in other countries in Europe. <o:p> </o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022608/FMU_FMU_402764.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/jump.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 411px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Image: Norwegian paratroopers during training in Woodhaven, Scotland, 1942.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;start=601&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Forsvarets+museer%22\">Forsvarets Museer</a> (CC0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What was it like for the Norwegian paratroopers training with Scottish allies in Woodhaven, Scotland?

The aim is to &nbsp;will stimulate a ‘treasure hunt’ in the archives of Europe via Europeana, and encourage the contribution and production of new material. The activities will focus on finding and generating knowledge about the more sparsely documented events surrounding burnings and evacuations of Northern Troms and Finmark, and the role of the Sami peoples in Norway’s war effort. &nbsp;All of which aims to contribute to and help convey the nuances of our common European memory.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further information on the planned the open workshops in Troms and Nordland, and the Open Archives Day to be held in June, will be made available shortly.</p>"

        title: 'Promoting Interoperability: Working on Rights'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This article originally appeared on the DPLA <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/2014/03/03/promoting-interoperability-working-on-rights/\">website</a>. \_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When new Hubs become a part of the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), they understand that their relationship with DPLA is not only about sharing data but also about improving data quality over time. As an aggregator of metadata from 20 Hubs and over 1,100 partners, DPLA is in a unique position to help our partners recognise and manage data quality issues. Data improvement happens locally in a number of ways including running scripts to make data more consistent and manual improvement over time of specific fields by partners, and on an international scale through collaboration to promote interoperability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, DPLA teamed up with our colleagues and friends at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en\">Kennisland</a> to promote global interoperability of our metadata, and specifically our Rights Statement fields. In October 2013, Europeana and the DPLA organised a first joint rights management workshop to explore this possibility in Boston, Massachusetts. While the workshop mainly focused on sharing experiences between the two projects, it also reinforced the intention to explore a closer collaboration in the field of rights labeling. As a result of further discussions between the DPLA and Europeana, a small joint working group to explore the possibilities for concrete collaborations in more detail has been established and will be led by Paul Keller, Europeana/Kennisland and Emily Gore, DPLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This important work will, above all, make rights clear to the end user and provide a framework for aggregators and our partners. With the creation and standardisation of actionable rights statements, users will know when a work is in the Public Domain, covered under a Creative Commons licence or is Rights Restricted, among other possible labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Copyright is an important topic and an enormous challenge for digital library initiatives. While there are many issues related to copyright and digitisation projects, the DPLA-Europeana Rights Labelling working group will focus on the specific needs of digital heritage aggregators, such as Europeana and the Digital Public Library of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The working group will be tasked with developing a proposal for a joint rights labelling infrastructure that would include at the minimum the following elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>A proposal for the technical infrastructure. The existing Europeana Licensing Framework offers rights statements provided by third parties (the Creative Commons licenses and Public Domain Tools) and rights statements that have been developed by Europeana that are hosted on the Europeana portal. In order to provide rights statements that can be used by others it appears desirable to provide all rights statements from a ‘neutral’ namespace.</li>\r\n    <li>An initial list of rights statements. The working group should propose an initial list of rights statements that meets the needs of Europeana and the DPLA (as well as any other partners that have been identified by the working group).</li>\r\n    <li>A proposal for a governance structure. Digital heritage aggregators operate in a dynamic environment. As a result the rights statements will likely need to be updated/changed in order to meet the needs of the digital heritage aggregators. This means that both the infrastructure and the list of available rights statements need to be actively maintained. The working group should propose a governance structure that ensures the continued maintenance of the rights statements and the related infrastructure.</li>\r\n    <li>A proposal for sustaining the operation of the rights labeling infrastructure. It is assumed that initially the rights management infrastructure will be set up by Europeana and the DPLA and that the costs for setting up this infrastructure (which should be minimal) will be borne by both partners. The working group should propose a model for sustaining the continued operation of the rights management infrastructure once it is operational.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Working group members include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Keller (working group co-chair, Kennisland, Coordinator Europeana Licensing Framework)</li>\r\n    <li>Emily Gore (working group co-chair, DPLA, Director of Content)</li>\r\n    <li>Julia Fallon (Europeana, IPR and Policy Advisor)</li>\r\n    <li>Patrick Peiffer (Bibliotheque Nationale de Luxembourg)</li>\r\n    <li>Antoine Isaac (Europeana, Scientific Coordinator)</li>\r\n    <li>Lucie Guibault (Institute for Information Law)</li>\r\n    <li>Maarten Zeinstra (Kennisland, technical coordinator Europeana Licensing Framework)</li>\r\n    <li>Melissa Levine (U of Michigan, Lead Copyright Officer)</li>\r\n    <li>Greg Cram (NYPL, Assoc. Director of Copyright &amp; IP)</li>\r\n    <li>Mark Matienzo (DPLA, Director of Technology)</li>\r\n    <li>Dave Hansen (University of North Carolina, Reference Librarian &amp; J.D.)</li>\r\n    <li>Richard Urban (Florida State University, Asst. Professor)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The working group will hold our first meeting in April and is expected to conclude our initial work and release our findings and proposal for sustaining the rights labeling infrastructure by the fall of 2014.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><i>Guest post by Maria Drabczyk, National Audiovisual Institute, Poland</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pilot competition for the best remix of Europeana’s content was launched recently. The organiser National Audiovisual Institute of Poland invites students between 13-19 years and their schools to participate and submit their videos by 25 May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/8e53c5db-716c-46db-affa-f2e7c102a47c.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 225px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image: Europeana Video Remix&nbsp;<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why do we do it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Video Remix is an attempt to make the digital resources of Europeana appeal to the youth and to comprehend their understanding and use of the various IPR licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How does it work? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task is to select one of the four themes of competition, match them with relevant archives available on the portals associated with Europeana (images, pictures, sounds, videos, as well as other digital objects) and compile a remix out of them. Participants may download the historical content available in the public domain or under Creative Commons for creative re-use. Submitted videos may be entirely or only partly based on the sources found in Europeana and related websites. All kinds of artistic forms - animation, graphics, samples, fragments of own videos and private images - are very welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final outcome should be made available on a platform such as youtube.com, vimeo.com, dailymotion.com and submitted through Europeana Video Remix website (videoremix.europeana.eu). Each participant may submit up to four works - one for each of the topics of competition, which are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>100 Anniversary of World War I</li>\r\n    <li>25 anniversary of transformation in Central and Eastern Europe</li>\r\n    <li>History of fashion and style</li>\r\n    <li>History of technology and media</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Who decides and what are the prizes? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Submitted videos will be evaluated by an international jury including representatives of the Europeana Foundation, the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and the National Audiovisual Institute of Poland. The jury will select and award top three remixes submitted individually or as a group work. Each of the authors of the winning remixes will be rewarded with a Fuji Instax mini camera with additional film packs. The most active school, whose students send most videos, will be rewarded with a Panasonic HC-V110 camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Video Remix is a pilot competition run mostly in Poland. It is however also open to young, international participants who are willing to devote their time and creativity to the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition is organised within the framework of the Europeana Awareness project co-financed by the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its organiser, the <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/en/nina\">National Audiovisual Institute</a> (NInA) is a Polish cultural institution in charge of digital preservation and dissemination of <a href=\"http://www.ninateka.pl/\">Polish audiovisual heritage</a>. NInA acts as curator, producer and co-producer of important cultural events and publisher of audiovisual and audio collections. The activity abroad and on the national level involves audiovisual co-productions as well as participation in networks and hosting events in the fields of new media education, digitisation, archiving, dissemination of audiovisual content and web culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Would you like to know more? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information please visit the competition’s website <a href=\"http://videoremix.europeana.eu\">http://videoremix.europeana.eu</a> orcontact us directly via <a href=\"mailto:europeanaremix@nina.gov.pl\">europeanaremix@nina.gov.pl</a></p>"

The theme is ´The Useful Heritage - Efficiency and excellence in the public memory sector´. Various organisations and institutions working with heritage (museums, conservation, libraries, archives etc.) continue to demonstrate a constant convergence of their practices and theories. This implies a need for a new, common science, so expert authors are invited to contribute to defining excellence and social efficiency of public memory domain.

        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Gregory Markus, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/105720f6-b747-4942-80cb-89b52b2a0b95.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An editathon in progress.\_Image by Sebastiaan ter Burg, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an effort to improve fashion knowledge on the web, <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion</a> has organised a series of editathons with <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.org/\">Wikimedia volunteers</a> and fashion institutions around Europe. The experience and knowledge gained from these events are now compiled in one handbook, <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%20GLAMs.pdf\">The Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon Handbook for GLAMs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/FashionEditathon.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 564px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The cover of the handbook, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion and fashion history are undoubtedly significant cultural media. Whether we realise it or not, the clothes we choose to wear every day have historical roots and contemporary meaning. The blue jeans, the t-shirt, the sneaker or a shirt with a button-down collar all have an interesting history, which most of us seldom consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If someone did want to learn about fashion history, their first stop would most likely be Wikipedia. As fashion is under-represented in the online encyclopedia, their search may lead to disappointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving Fashion Knowledge Europeana Fashion aims not only to gather hundreds of thousands of digitised fashion objects, but also to increase the amount of fashion knowledge on the web and make it more visible. We try to accomplish this by organising <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-%0D%0A%0D%0Ablog/-/blogs/1842398\">Wikipedia edit-a-thons</a>. An editathon is an event where people get together to edit Wikipedia, usually focusing on a specific topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/FashionEditathon2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>An editathon in progress.\_Image by Sebastiaan ter Burg, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with Wikimedia and having editathons benefits all parties involved:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>They help spread the word about the work Europeana Fashion is doing;</li>\r\n    <li>They improve public knowledge about fashion history on Wikipedia;</li>\r\n    <li>They provide contextualisation to the beautiful material Europeana Fashion puts online;</li>\r\n    <li>They connect different communities, bring them together around a shared passion and offer professionals in the field an opportunity to network;</li>\r\n    <li>They stimulate participating partners to reflect on ways to make their collections accessible.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>The Handbook</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These benefits, along with guidelines and tips on how to organise an editathon, are listed in the handbook. Loads of experiences, expertise, and research made this handbook possible. So far, Europeana Fashion has coordinated editathons at institutions in Israel, Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Sweden and Italy. Members from these participating institutions, along with Wikimedians from across Europe, assisted and reviewed the work done by the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, which oversee Europeana Fashion’s collaboration with Wikimedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the handbook, any GLAM (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) can find all the basics to host an editathon, including an overview of Wikimedia, Wikipedia and Wikimedians, ways to ensure a successful editathon, how to measure success, tips for getting content on Wikimedia, event promotion, as well as a suggested day programme, a 3-month preparation agenda, and an abundance of relevant links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikimedia and GLAMs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This handbook comes at a crucial time for GLAMs and Wikimedia. Recently, there has been a surge of institutions that are looking to become more open and make their collections more accessible to the public online. The handbook is not Europeana’s first collaboration with Wikimedia. There is also the <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMwiki_Toolset_Project\">GLAMwiki Toolset Project</a>, which strives to make it easier for institutions to batch upload content to Wikimedia Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikimedia is perhaps the most widely known organisation in the world that strives to make information more ‘open’. <a href=\"http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/FAQ/en\">In the words of founder Jimmy Wales</a>, ‘Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge’. Europeana Fashion shares this goal with a specific focus on fashion objects, making Europeana Fashion the perfect intermediary between fashion institutions and Wikimedia, two bodies that rarely meet. The editathons offer fashion institutions the opportunity to get comfortable working with Wikimedians and vice-versa, to learn about opening up their collections and to give the public a participatory opportunity to help make cultural heritage more inclusive and raise ‘open’ awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This handbook will help any GLAM (not just fashion institutions) organise a successful editathon and make Wikipedia richer. We hope that by increasing the publicity of these editathons, more GLAMs will follow suit, causing a domino effect. You can download it <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Fashion%20Edit-a-thon%20Handbook%20for%0D%0A%0D%0A%20GLAMs.pdf\">here</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Nearly 200 Spanish libraries adopt Europeana search widget'

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>By María Luisa Martinez-Conde, Unit for Library Coordination at the Spanish Ministry</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the objective of providing easy access to the over 31 million digital objects Europeana provides access to, about 190 public libraries in Spain have implemented the Europeana search widget and there are a growing number of libraries interested in doing the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish libraries actively contribute to Europeana as evidenced by the large number of content providers aggregated by Hispana, the Spanish national aggregator. It is maintained by Spain’s Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD), which channels to Europeana more than 2,1 million records. Among the Spanish libraries contributing to Europeana, public libraries make a significant contribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because many Spanish public libraries, especially provincial public libraries, hold an important part of the Spanish bibliographic heritage. They have been participating for more than 10 years in different cooperative ongoing digitisation projects carried out by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport. This includes the Digital Library of Historical Newspapers that gathers more than 6,5 million pages of local newspapers, and/or regional ones as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these reasons, the Spanish public libraries made a major contribution through EuropeanaLocal. This contribution has not stopped growing since then, so that more than 70% of the content channelled by Hispana, i.e. more tha 1,5 million records, come from public libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/e553850e-db58-4808-bdaa-6246d6a8b6f5.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 381px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For implementation of the Europeana search widget, crucial support was given to the Ministry by regional library services. For instance, in the case of <a href=\"http://www.bibliotecaspublicas.es/oviedo/\">Asturias</a>, a regional library, whose digital library has been part of Europeana from the beginning of the EuropeanaLocal project, it made the first implementation of the Europeana search widget. It then helped the Ministry to implement the same in 31 public libraries belonging to the network of public libraries of Asturias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana_widget1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 689px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">One of the more recent implementations was made by the </span><a href=\"http://www.bibliotecapalma.com/index.php/es/\" style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"> Public Library of Palma de Mallorca</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"> that holds an important collection of manuscripts and rare books. It has also been a contributor to Europeana for many years by digitising and granting access to projects of the Ministry. As users find the Europeana widget very helpful, the MECD, counting on the support of regions, expects to achieve 200 implementations in the next few weeks.</span></p>"

Minelli <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CCBY-SA</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2014, the AthenaPlus project co-financed by the European Commission, reached a major project milestone: More than 800.000 metadata records were successfully uploaded using the MINT ingestion platform. Launched in March 2013, the AthenaPlus project set out to make cultural heritage more widely accessible through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The achievement means a huge step towards realising an important project aim: contributing 3.6 million metadata records to Europeana. If this alone isn’t a good enough reason to raise your glasses, in March the AthenaPlus project celebrated its one-year anniversary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AthenaPlus is a Best Practice Network with one of the main objectives being to improve the quality of metadata. By sharing experience from hundreds of experts from all over Europe, the project supports the development of new applications for digital heritage. Project partners develop innovative tools, e.g. for creating digital exhibitions. Its 40 partners from 21 EU member state countries contribute content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project also looks into the development of cultural tourist-route applications. An educational toolbox is planned to enable experimentation for the tourism sector and the education market. Apart from that, project partners also organise workshops and trainings to support museums and other cultural heritage institutions in their work to make their rich digital content accessible to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can keep up-to-date with our news on the <a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/index.php?en/1/home\">AthenaPlus website</a>, on <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/AthenaPlus-Coordination-standards-technologies-enrichment-4943167?home=&amp;gid=4943167&amp;trk=anet_ug_hm\">LinkedIn</a>, and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AthenaPlusEU\"> Twitter</a>.</p>"

It opens in Pisa on April 11 at the Palazzo Lanfranchi, and will be on till June 2, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 120 photographs of the exhibition are a collective effort from all the partners of the Europeana Photography consortium and 2 associate partners (SC Bali from Kiev and CUT from Cyprus).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Our Yesterdays is divided into different ´chapters´ and sub-themes, featuring photos of everyday life of people in the streets of cities, in the countryside and village life etc. The photos were selected based on their testimonial power and photographic value. They are images that inspire empathy and appeal to historical consciousness, and most of all, they are images that tell a story. The content providers were extremely responsive and enthusiastic about this task, and came up with a very large number of proposed images. A poll was then organised and coordinated by KU Leuven, asking all the partners to vote for their favorite images among the wider selection. These ‘best of the best’ images have been selected for printing and framing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in preparation for this exhibition, there was a lot of work to do for the Content Committee, in order to develop an attractive narrative for the exhibition. Project coordinator KU Leuven and technical coordinator Promoter\_played an important role to bring the exhibition to fruition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leuven will also host this exhibition in January 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more on <a href=\"http://www.earlyphotography.eu/\">Early Photography</a>.

        body: "<p>Europeana’s main ambition is to make cultural heritage available to all and facilitate re-use of this material as much as possible. For this reason, a great amount of effort is put into making sure the user knows what legally can and cannot be done with the material found on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, a large rights labelling campaign was organised to make sure all material in Europeana was provided with a correct rights statement about the legal status of the work. However, there is still work to be done<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-digital-objects-to-have-valid-rights-statement-by-july-2014-1\"> as our recent blogpost describes.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/635bd7f2-dee4-4437-bf59-c2a039c5d3f2.jpg\" style=\"width: 462px; height: 539px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Newspaper image.<a href=\"europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>PD</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are therefore very happy to announce that Europeana now includes more than one million newspaper articles from the Spanish aggregator <a href=\"http://hispana.mcu.es/\"> Hispana</a> that are correctly labelled as being in the Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">These newspapers were digitised and made available as part of the </span><a href=\"http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/\" style=\"line-height: 1.48;\"> Virtual Library of Historical Newspapers project</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">. The aim of the project is not only to preserve widely used material that is in a poor state of conservation, but to give access to bibliographic material that in many cases is unique and, therefore, not easily accessible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Hispana2.jpg\" style=\"width: 538px; height: 417px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Newspaper image. <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> PD</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project started in 2003 and includes more than 6,5 million pages of historical newspapers coming from 81 public and private institutions. Many of them come from provincial public libraries, but from 2005, the Ministry started to sign agreements with publishers and private institutes. Because of this, there are also universities, municipalities, private foundations, athenaeums, some archives and publishers of newspapers and magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the newspapers are local and cover a wide historical period dating back to the late eighteenth century, and therefore fall in the public domain. All of them have been digitised with public funding. This is why they remain in the public domain after their digitisation, with the aim of make them as widely available as possible for access and re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that this material in Europeana is now provided with a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">public domain mark</a> makes it absolutely clear to the users that they can use the digitised historical newspapers as they wish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana congratulates Hispana with this great move towards making Europe’s heritage available to all without any restrictions. To see the newspapers in the Europeana portal, <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_collectionName:20227*&amp;qf=TYPE:TEXT&amp;qf=RIGHTS:http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/*&amp;rows=24\"> click here</a>.</p>"

        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">We are very happy to announce that the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/MultilingualSemanticEnrichment//Multilingual%20Semantic%20Enrichment%20report.pdf\">report</a> <span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">from the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/taskforce/multilingual-and-semantic-enrichment-strategy\">Task Force on multilingual and semantic enrichment strategy</a> </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">is now published. The Task Force set out to find solutions to prevent enrichment errors and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">flaws that decrease the overall quality of the metadata in Europeana. To achieve this, we </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">analysed six collections in detail. On the one hand, we wanted to discover problems in </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">enrichments that were executed and on the other hand find out the reason for objects not being </span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">enriched. But let’s first look at enrichments and their influence on the objects in Europeana.</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">A semantic enrichment is additional information that is added to the data about certain </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">resources. Semantic enrichments can be interpreted by the system and should be also understood </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">by users. Different disciplines value semantic enrichments for various reasons. For example, in </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">the Linked Data context, semantic enrichments chiefly refer to the creation of new links </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">between the enriched resources and other reference datasets greatly contributing to the vision </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">of the Semantic Web. For information retrieval or search purposes, an enrichment means adding </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">new terms to a query or document, making it therefore more likely to be found with a given </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">query. </span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">In Europeana, enrichments are visible in the portal display, as shown in the object below, and </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">can be identified as links in certain metadata fields (1) and the foldout field ´Auto-generated </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">tags´ (2). </span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/de656511-365b-481c-9bb6-4fd83a4dbbcb.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 488px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>Image credit: View the image (warning: Europeana has changed since then!) at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048415/item_YRYHNWCUHSLTMWX3BS45OJJTNGMUESW2.html\">Europeana</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Clicking on “Auto-generated tags” reveals the matched label (3) and its broader label (4).</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/A%20Multilingual%20and%20Semantic%20Enrichment%20Strategy2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 417px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<em>Image credit (</em><em><em>warning: Europeana has changed since then!)</em>: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048415/item_YRYHNWCUHSLTMWX3BS45OJJTNGMUESW2.html\">Europeana</a> <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Currently, the Europeana development team is working on improving both the display of the <span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">semantic enrichments and the contextual entities provided by our partners.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">The enrichment process can be subsumed under two main steps: </span></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">1. Matching the metadata of Europeana objects to external semantic data results in links <span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">between these objects and resources from external datasets. The example record shows that the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">objects was automatically enriched with the concept of '<a href=\"http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/13123\">photography</a>' </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">(3) in the GEMET thesaurus:.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">2. The exploitation of these links by adding translated labels and broader labels. In the <span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">example given above, this means that the record is supplemented with all the translated labels </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">of the GEMET concept (e.g., 'fotografi' in Swedish), as well as with a link to the broader </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">concept in GEMET and all its translated labels (e.g., '<a href=\"http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept/4257\">industrial product</a>'</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">)(4).</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">During a one-day workshop in Berlin, the task force analysed six very different datasets in </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Europeana and found that enrichment flaws can be caused during one of the five stages that the </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">metadata undergoes before it is displayed in Europeana:</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">1.

        body: "<p>The consortium of Europeana Sounds* – a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/building-a-jukebox-for-europe?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_count%3D1%26_115_advancedSearch%3Dfalse%26_115_keywords%3D%26_115_delta%3D5%26_115_cur%3D5%26_115_struts_action%3D%252Fblogs_aggregator%252Fview%26_115_andOperator%3Dtrue%20%E2%80%93\">brand new</a> Europeana project came together for the first time in London on 17-18 February. Hosted by the coordinator of this three-year project, the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a>, this meeting was a good first opportunity to finally put faces to the names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/afa80b32-b934-4c2d-9c85-0f8914ed190c.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 394px;\"><br>\r\nPhoto credit:<em> Elizabeth Hunter, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Sounds aims to significantly increase audio and audio-related content accessible through Europeana, mainly classical, traditional and folk music, natural sounds and oral memory. Through crowdsourcing, it will also provide semantic enrichment of existing metadata. The project should make it easier to access unavailable works and develop the possibilities of re-use by the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over these two days, many discussions took place among the enthusiastic delegates of the 24 partner organisations coming from 12 different countries. This provided a good start to the project. The presentation of the aggregation work package proved to be of particular interest specifically for each content provider with discussions on how to select the documents to reach a critical mass; how to adapt the EDM format; what ontology system to adopt; and with discussions also on legal aspects and the issue of licensing material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Sounds6.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 363px;\"><br><em>Photo credit: Elizabeth Hunter, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two concert sessions also allowed all the participants to discover and enjoy a selection of <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/sound-and-vision/2014/02/europeana-sounds-gets-underway.html\">sound and video recordings</a> before returning home to carry on the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many thanks to the British Library for their flawless organisation and warm welcome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow the project on Twitter: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/eu_sounds\">https://twitter.com/eu_sounds</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Europeana Sounds is funded by the European Union under its ICT Policy Support Programme as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Les premiers pas d’Europeana Sounds</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Le consortium d’un tout nouveau projet européen, Europeana Sounds*, s’est réuni pour la première fois à Londres les 17 et 18 février dernier. Organisée par la British Library, coordinateur de ce projet de trois ans, cette rencontre a constitué une première opportunité pour mettre enfin des visages sur des noms désormais familiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/afa80b32-b934-4c2d-9c85-0f8914ed190c.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 394px;\"><br><em>Photo credit: Elizabeth Hunter, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Sounds vise à accroître considérablement le contenu audio accessible via Europeana, principalement de la musique classique, traditionnelle et folklorique, des enregistrements faits en milieu naturel et des archives de la parole. Ce projet permettra un enrichissement sémantique des métadonnées grâce au crowdsourcing; et devrait également faciliter l'accès à des œuvres actuellement en accès limité et développer les possibilités de réutilisation par les industries créatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Au cours de ces deux jours, les nombreuses discussions entre les délégués enthousiastes des 24 membres du consortium provenant de 12 pays différents a permis au projet de débuter sur les chapeaux de roues. La présentation portant sur l’agrégation a suscité un intérêt particulier chez chaque fournisseur de contenu: comment sélectionner les documents pour atteindre une masse critique? Comment adapter le format EDM? Quel système d’ontologies adopter? Sans oublier, bien sûr, les aspects juridiques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Sounds6.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 363px;\"><br>\r\nPhoto credit: Elizabeth Hunter, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a><a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deux sessions acoustiques ont permis aux participants de découvrir et d’apprécier une sélection d’enregistrements audio et vidéo, avant de regagner leurs institutions pour poursuivre le travail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tous nos remerciements à la British Library pour son organisation sans faille et son accueil chaleureux!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suivez le projet sur Twitter : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eu_sounds\">https://twitter.com/eu_sounds</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>Today we published our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f19cc4ff-56a3-422c-83d9-f156ecc9b4ca\">annual business plan</a>. This plan guides our day-to-day work at the Europeana office, and is based on extensive input from our community. Harry Verwayen, Europeana´s Business Development Director answers questions about it:</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana BP2014.jpg\" style=\"width: 279px; height: 400px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>The Business Plan 2014. A French and a German version will &nbsp;be published shortly.</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>&nbsp;</em></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>How do you decide what ends up in the Europeana Business Plan, and what does not?&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">A lot of the work that we do is part of the various projects we are involved in. So this is already committed to in the descriptions of work. &nbsp;This business plan is largely based on the nine projects that the Europeana Foundation either leads (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v2.0\">Europeana Version 2</a>, Europeana Version 3 and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a>) or is a partner in (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a>, Europeana Food &amp; Drink, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">Europeana Inside</a>, <a href=\"http://www.appsforeurope.eu/ \">Apps 4 Europe</a>&nbsp;and Europeana Sounds). Within this framework, we then identify synergies and allocate the work to our internal teams. You will see for example that both Europeana Creative and Europeana Food &amp; Drink need a technical infrastructure to surface re-usable content for the creative industries. Developing this infrastructure is therefore a primary focus of our product development team this year.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>How do you define what the priorities are for the year?&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">With all the commitments, milestones and deliverables that we all need to produce, it is essential to define guiding principles to establish what the priorities are so that we actually deliver value for our partners, instead of just ‘ticking the boxes’. &nbsp;Besides the nine projects in which we are active partners, there are a number of other projects, such as Europeana Space and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeanaphotography\">Europeana Photography</a> who contribute greatly to our ambitions to make as much heritage as possible available and re-usable. So of course we want to accommodate them. Each year, we do an extensive consultation with our network to establish these priorities. This year is a bit special because we are also developing our long-term strategy in parallel with the business plan (which covers one calendar year). We organised a total of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/strategy-engine-room\">6 workshops</a> &nbsp;where we asked our members what they would like to see addressed. &nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Four priorities</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The consultation led to a number of clear priorities that we believe Europeana should focus on: &nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">1.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Shift from portal to platform</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Tim Sherrat from <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a> has expressed the difference between the two very well: ‘Portals are for visiting, platforms are for building upon’. We want Europeana to be much more than a place for people to view what has happened in the past. We want them to find the stuff they are interested in, and be inspired to share it with their friends, perhaps add information to it and, who knows, build an app! (Check this recent one that connects trending topics on social media with trends from the past, which we came across recently during a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/facebook-awards-history-app-that-will-use-europeana%E2%80%99s-collections-1?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fhome%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-2%26p_p_col_pos%3D4%26p_p_col_count%3D6\">Facebook hackathon</a> in Berlin.) This year, we will start making that shift by developing clear value propositions for the 3 market segments that Europeana will cater to.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/BPpic2.jpg\" style=\"width: 538px; height: 512px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>&nbsp;</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">2.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Focus on quality</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Changing the way we distribute our heritage is of course directly related to the quality of the material we make available. While we continue to collect all the material that partners make available, we will focus strongly on improving the quality of that data, which will in turn improve its re-use and discoverability potential wherever the cultural heritage institution wishes to expose their data. We aim for all data in Europeana to have relevant descriptions, previews of reasonable sizes, accurate geo-location data, clear and correct rights statements (preferably to allow re-use) and persistent direct links to the objects themselves.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">3.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Value for partners</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">We are very aware that our partners have invested heavily over the years to make their holding available through Europeana. That is not an easy task. We want to make sure that all partners feel their relationship with Europeana is worthwhile. We will therefore continue to increase the visibility of the data and content in every imaginable place. Last year, we were able to generate over 31 million impressions on the portal, social media and increasingly on sites such as Pinterest and Wikipedia. We intend to do better this year.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">4.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"> </span>Become a fully networked organisation</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Over the past four years, Europeana has developed from a project to a network organisation. This includes over 800 members of the Europeana Network, more than 2,300 content-contributing partners, a Europeana Tech community of over 75, some 25 EU-funded projects, a Board of 20 European associations of content holders, a Member State Expert Group representing all the EU Member States and an office of 50 full-time employees. &nbsp;Together we believe that we can power the world with European culture, and that this is vitally important because culture has the ability to transform lives. This year we will get together to discuss the things that matter to us during a number of very promising events such as the Annual General Meeting &nbsp;at the Prado in Madrid in October and the Europeana Tech event at the <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">Bibliotheque Nationale</a> in Paris in December . We look forward to seeing you there and wish you a fantastic and successful year!&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/BPpic3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 412px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><em>Events overview 2014.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a>&nbsp;</em></div>"

The first day started with a welcome by Prof. Dr. Klaus Siebenhaar, Director of Berlin Media Professional School and Sir Richard Allan,Chief of Public Policy Facebook Europe to more than 70 attendees, including policy makers, cultural and educational professionals, researchers, students, journalists and media producers. The participants then split into four workshops on the themes of <em>100 years war and peace in Europe</em>, <em>European identity</em>, <em>Curating Europe </em>and <em>Debating Europe</em>. They discussed relevant concepts and developed possible product ideas for the hackathon the following night.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The first panel on <em>100 years war and peace in Europe</em> linked warfare memories from the 20th century with the current conflicts in Ukraine and Syria and focused on lessons learned, social issues (stereotypes, identity) and information needs around war and peace. Frank Drauschke, Fact &amp; Files, Germany, made a valuable contribution to the discussions on the personal experiences of war and political change in Europe by presenting <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en \">Europeana 1914 – 1918</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">Europeana 1989</a> projects.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/BerlinPicture1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The War and Peace workshop in progress.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157641854472235/\">Europeana Flickr&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">All workshop outcomes were fed into the brainstorming session from 19:00-21:00 for the hackathon attendees. In addition to panel product ideas, the briefing included external resources. I highlighted Europeana collections (including 1914-1918) as possible inspiration and content sources for developers and introduced Europeana API as a useful tool for their creative projects. Finally, I outlined Europeana business incubation projects as a growth opportunity for the hackathon prototypes with a clear business model. (Here is the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/sls2014-berlinmilena-popova \">presentation in German</a>)</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The night-long hacking resulted in five prototypes (produced by five teams) ranging from games to news and educational apps. All prototypes were evaluated by a professional jury panel and voted for by participants. The history app Traces developed by the team <a href=\"http://www.zeitfenster-app.de/\"><em>Zeitfenster</em> </a>(Time Window) received both the judges’ and audience award and won the big prize – a trip to the Facebook office in California and participation in the Facebook app-development competition.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/BerlinPicture3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 331px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The winning team ‘Zeitfenster’.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157641854472235/\">Europeana Flickr</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a></em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Traces lists current European issues and trends in social networks like Facebook or Twitter and traces them back to already existing historically rich information from other sources and databases on the web, such as Wikipedia and Europeana, to their informational origins.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Based on a timeline, the application shows users relevant multimedia contents related to the historical course of a topic each day. Thus Traces changes the cultural and historical awareness of current issues and provides access to a better understanding of ongoing debates, discussions and opinions in Europe.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">See more event photos on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157641854472235/\">Europeana Flickr&nbsp;</a>.</div>"

Have you? \_You have one week - until 5 March - left to submit your organisations’ response, or to get in touch with the association that represents your organisation to find out what they have done on your behalf, and what you can do to help. We've been a working with associations such as <a href=\"http://web3.nlib.ee/cenl/\">CENL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/\">CERL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fep-fee.eu/\">FEP</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumforum.info/emf.html\">EMF</a>, <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php\">EUROCLIO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ica.org/2247/about-european-regional-branch-eurbica/about-eurbica.html%20\">EURBICA</a>\_and <a href=\"http://www.iasa-web.org/\">IASA</a>\_and we know that they are either currently preparing their statements or they have already submitted theirs.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Throughout 2013, we spent a fair amount of time looking at how to improve the quality and presence of rights statements. While this process has led to a significant reduction of the share of digital objects without a rights statements, we have not yet achieved our objective to have all digital objects available via Europeana carry a rights label. In addition, we have undertaken a review of the Europeana Licensing Framework. Part of the outcomes of this review are a small number of changes to the rights statements that are available, such as the introduction of a new rights statement for Orphan Works. This blog post explains the progress made in the past year, how we plan to deal with the remaining legacy of unlabelled objects, the changes to the existing rights statements and what all of this will mean in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Progress made with rights statements, more work to be done</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rights statement associated with each digital object available via Europeana indicates to the end-user how a digital object can be accessed and re-used. Their quality and presence form an important part of making high quality, relevant content available via Europeana. They allow end-users and users of the Europeana API to clearly identify which digital objects can be re-used under which conditions, but they also clearly signal which works may not be re-used without asking for permission from copyright holders. Given the importance of this, it is essential that they are applied consistently across datasets ingested into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013 Europeana, together with<a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\"> Kennisland</a>, set out on an extensive <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1494947\">Rights Labelling Campaign</a> to ensure that digital objects available via Europeana are labelled with correct <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1494947\">rights statements</a>. With the help of our partners, we managed to increase the number of digital objects that can be re-used (an increase of 3.2 million since december 2012), and to reduce the percentage of unlabelled objects (a reduction from 34% to 25% of the total since December 2012). However, our work is not completed in this regard, and we are making a concerted effort to have all digital objects available via Europeana labelled with a valid rights statement by July 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/1b7b794b-0011-48b8-9fe8-1583a66b91d3.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 452px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 600;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Image credit:\_<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC-BY-SA</a><a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en\">Kennisland</a></span></span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Resolving the unlabelled legacy in the Europeana Portal.\_</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having rights labels for all digital objects is an essential step towards stimulating re-use of the material available via Europeana. Without a rights label attached to it, end-users and API users have no information on whether a digital object can be used or not. To meet our target of having all objects labelled with rights statements by July 2014, we will be approaching partners via their aggregators/projects with options regarding unlabelled collections. If you are a data provider and you have digital objects that do not currently have rights statements attached, please contact <a href=\"mailto:content@europeana.eu\">content@europeana.eu</a>, and we will assist you in this transition. Alternatively, Europeana’s aggregation team will contact you shortly to help you with your options, which may include the temporary removal of digital objects while you decide on the correct rights statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Improving the rights statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things we learnt over the last two years is that we need to make choosing an appropriate right statement easier for aggregators and data providers, and easier for the end-user to understand. A review of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a> undertaken during the summer of 2013 recommended a number of changes to the rights statements currently available to express the copyright status of digital objects available via Europeana. These recommendations include the addition of two new rights statements, the removal of one existing rights statement and small adjustments to three others. We believe that these changes, outlined below, ensure that the rights statements are better suited to the needs of our partners, and easier to understand for the users of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two new rights statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective today we have added two new rights statements to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">list of available rights statements</a> that can be used with edm:rights:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/orphan-work-eu.html\">The Orphan Works</a> statement is intended for use with digital objects where the copyright holder cannot be identified after a diligent search in accordance with the rules established by the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm\">EU directive on certain permitted uses of Orphan Works</a>. Data providers should be aware that the directive has not been implemented in all member states yet and that it does not apply to all types of works (most notably it does not apply to standalone photography). The rights statement informs users of the Orphan Works status of the digital object and that they are free to carry out any of the acts permitted by their national copyright and related rights act, including browsing, printing and making copies for their own personal purposes.</li>\r\n    <li>The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/out-of-copyright-non-commercial.html\">Out of copyright - non commercial reuse</a> statement is intended for use with public domain works that were digitised as part of a public-private partnership. It may only be applied where the conditions of the agreement of the public/private partnership limit the commercial use of the digital object by the public. The rights statement acknowledges that the work is out of copyright and stipulates that the digital object may not be used for commercial purposes by third parties.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Updated rights statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective today we have also made small changes to three of the existing rights statements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Following the introduction of the Orphan Works rights statement, it was necessary to update the wording for the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/unknown.html\">Unknown rights</a> statement to avoid confusion between the two. Europeana will contact partners via their aggregators/projects who have submitted material using the previous Unknown rights statement to ensure this is the appropriate rights statement for the collection.</li>\r\n    <li>Rights Reserved - Free Access has been renamed ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/rr-f.html\">Free Access - No Re-use</a>’ to emphasise the fact that end-users may freely access the associated digital objects but that they do not have permission to re-use them for anything other than personal use.</li>\r\n    <li>Rights Reserved - Paid Access has been renamed ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/rr-p.html\">Paid Access - No Re-use</a>’ to highlight the fact that the end-user must pay for access to the digital object, which may only be used personally.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Removing the Rights Reserved - Restricted Access statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rights Reserved Restricted Access will be retired in mid-2014 (since December 2013 we have stopped accepting new digital objects with this statement). The review of the licensing framework had concluded that only a small fraction of all digital objects carrying this rights statement were in fact restricted access and that as a result, this rights statement should not be offered anymore. Partners who have previously submitted material with this statement will be contacted via their aggregators/projects in order to choose new rights statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that by implementing these changes regarding rights statements, it will be easier for partners to select the correct rights statement for their digital objects, and for end-users to make the most of the wonderful collections and objects available via Europeana. If you have any questions on this matter or want further information about Europeana’s rights statements, please check <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">here</a><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/available-rights-statements\"> </a>or contact <a href=\"mailto:content@europeana.eu\">content@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The PATHS to improved user experience'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In collections where content is aggregated from many institutions (such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>), creating metadata using diverse cataloguing systems compounds these issues.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><i>By Jill Griffiths, MDR</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">This blog is written as the PATHS project draws to a close. We started our work three years ago in the context of the significant amounts of cultural heritage material that have been made available through online digital library portals as a result of digitisation initiatives in recent years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/75346331-1a5e-4683-8222-c94239c1f87f.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 432px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>PATHS on the desktop</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such large collections can be difficult to navigate for many users, especially those who lack specialist knowledge about the content or structure of the collection. The metadata that is available can limit the information retrieval that cultural institutions are able to offer their users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In collections where content is aggregated from many institutions (such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>), creating metadata using diverse cataloguing systems compounds these issues. PATHS aimed to demonstrate the potential for improving users’ experience of exploration and discovery within cultural heritage collections by exploiting natural language processing to enrich metadata and by implementing state-of-the-art systems in user-driven information access.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">One of the major achievements of the PATHS project has been to demonstrate the practical benefits and technical feasibility of enriching the metadata for cultural heritage collections as a means of improving content retrieval, supporting innovative discovery and exploitation. \_This addresses a critical issue for cultural heritage institutions across Europe who hold vast quantities of quality content in digital libraries that are currently never found unless explicitly sought. The initial deployment of PATHS focussed on browser-based applications on desktops. To demonstrate the flexibility of the PATHS API, the project developed a version of the application for use on iPADs.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/PATHS2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 449px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em style=\"text-align: center;\">PATHS on an iPad</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Positive feedback from users involved in the evaluation of the PATHS prototypes confirmed that the project achieved its objective of developing tools that add value to digital libraries and enrich user experiences. The interactivity offered by PATHS tools and the potential for expert and non-expert users to use content to create narratives, tell stories and make personal collections has the potential to have real impact on the development of the next generation of cultural heritage services.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The project has provided an important test bed for Europeana content and the Europeana Data Model (EDM) making recommendations on extensions to the EDM schema to manage semantically enriched content. PATHS also made a significant contribution to research into the application of semantic enrichment techniques to cultural heritage content, demonstrating the potential to enrich the simple content metadata to enable novel browsing and information discovery. The techniques used enriched items with links to similar content, created links to related Wikipedia articles, and enabled the collections to be thematically organised into a semi-automatically created hierarchical structure. We explored the potential of generating personalised recommendations based on user profiles, query logs and the similarity of content items, contributing to research in this important area. \_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Additionally, the knowledge developed through the project with regard to information retrieval, indexing and Web APIs have been invaluable to the development of the next generation of portals. \_A prototype content enrichment web service was released and has been adopted for development by the LoCloud project. \_The next generation of Avinet's map portal, ADAPTIVE, is being built exploiting PATHS technology in its search engine and is a first step on the way towards commercial exploitation of PATHS products.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/PATHS3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 338px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Users within cultural heritage organisations</em></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Throughout the project PATHS has researched, developed and evaluated techniques to improve the presentation of digital library content to end users. \_Using a robust and holistic requirement and evaluation programme, we developed an understanding of user profiles, needs and requirements and brought this user focus into the development cycle. \_Our research activities have led to scientific publications, and the project results form a core technology with expectations for further exploitation in the Cultural Heritage domain. We hope that the knowledge developed through the project will be invaluable in the development of the next generation of portals.\_</div>"

        body: "<p><em>By Helene Hahn and Anja Jentzsch, Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">In project month 6, Work Package 3 officially submitted one of its major deliverables, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/1915215/D3.1+Personas%2C+scenarios+and+use+cases\">D3.1, the Personas, Scenarios and Use Cases</a></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work Package 3 aims to develop services and tools that leverage Europeana content over the Europeana Cloud to be used by researchers. This deliverable focusses on the first step before the development of the tools, which is to understand and analyse the user needs by developing personas, scenarios and use cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">A persona is a description of a representative user, a pretend person who represents a type of or a group of users. Based on the personas and their daily work life, scenarios can be determined. Scenarios describe a persona’s typical workflow.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">This work has been undertaken in close alignment with the tasks in Work Package 1 and in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\">DM2E project </a></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">and more specifically <a href=\"http://wab.uib.no/\">the Wittgenstein archives</a> at the University of Bergen </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">and with the <a href=\"http://axiom.vu.nl/cmspeople.html\">Axiom philosophy group</a> at the VU University Amsterdam</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">For our target community of humanities researchers who work with Europeana content, three core problems have been identified through the personas and scenarios:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>problems with navigating and identifying relevant (digital) content and problems with building corpora;</li>\r\n    <li>a lack of user-friendly tools for conducting fine-grained textual research;</li>\r\n    <li>and a lack of appropriate tools and infrastructure that allow members of research groups to work collaboratively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Having the scenarios and personas at hand, we evaluated tools to support their workflow. Thus we were able to compile a catalogue of tools that should be adjusted to and integrated in the Europeana Research Platform.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">One of our personas is Hein, a post-doctoral researcher in the Axiom philosophy group at the VU University Amsterdam working on the history of philosophy, the history of biology and their interplay. In particular, he is interested in 18th century philosophical ideals of science and their influence on 18th century life sciences.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Hein participates in a group of post-doctoral researchers and academics interested in the history and philosophy of logic, semantics and axiomatics. This group explores ideas coming from philosophers like Bolzano and Tarski against classical models of science.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">A typical workflow for these tools is:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hein (or any humanities researcher) wants to find more about ‘Bolzano and Tarski’, and uses the <a href=\"http://ariadne.cs.kuleuven.be/finder/ariadne/\"><strong>ARIADNE Finder</strong></a> to get content from Europeana or other sources to be studied. After that, he tries to visualise them on a timeline or uses an interactive map on <a href=\"http://timemapper.okfnlabs.org\"><strong>TimeMapper</strong></a>&nbsp;to further filter the content and get a better overview of the different resources found on Europeana. After selecting the most interesting resources, they can be annotated using <a href=\"http://annotateit.org\"><strong>Annotator</strong></a>. Finally, all the different actions taken in this process (search, visualise, explore, annotate, download) are captured and presented via <strong>Activity Streams</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">Deliverable D3.1 presents a variety of different existing tools that can be combined, enhanced, and integrated to cover the needs of researchers. In addition, it introduces the process to be followed in order to connect the scenarios with the tools’ development.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">The figure below depicts the integration of services and tools inside the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud-shared-infrastructure-for-european-cultural-content\">Europeana Cloud system</a></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/4ec69b55-aa7b-4f16-802a-6bd0fe11eb7a.jpg\" style=\"width: 592px; height: 409px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next phase, Work Package 3 will address the core problems by integrating and adapting search, visualisation, annotation, and awareness tools to the future Europeana Research Platform.&nbsp;</p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/8ff5df9c-6b87-4584-bb09-56f4dd59529e.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i style=\"text-align: center;\">Participants at the CCtoolkits Poland event</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This weekend on 22 February, the international <a href=\"http://www.epsiplatform.eu/content/how-will-you-celebrate-year%E2%80%99s-open-data-day\">Open Data Day</a> is celebrated again. On this day, various initiatives relating to open data are organised to bring programmers, data journalists, designers and statisticians from around the world together to create applications, open up data, create visualisations and publish research conducted using open public data. To find an event near you, see their <a href=\"http://wiki.opendataday.org/2014/City_Events\">wiki page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open Data Day was first organised a couple of years ago, and the organising groups focussed mainly on data from governments. In the years after that, more and more topics were discussed and addressed such as scientific data, spending data and cultural heritage. In recent years, the realisation that the data and content from publicly funded memory institutions have to be made available to the public without any restrictions has found common ground in the entire cultural sector. We see more and more institutions that digitise their material, making their collection available under an open licence. But why do they do that? What are the benefits of sharing your carefully maintained collection with the world?Just to mention a few:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fulfill your public mission </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every publicly funded institution has the mission to serve the public as best as they possibly can. By making their collections openly available, they can reach a massive new audience and fulfill their mission as best as possible. Institutions that publish their material in an open way have seen it being re-used in a variety of new places such as Wikipedia, educational apps and websites, or innovative new apps by the creative industry. This has resulted in millions more views of their collection and not only benefitted the public, but also has resulted in more recognition for the providing institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Open Data Day Poland3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana members help create a Creative Commons toolkit&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">for cultural institutions</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connect and contextualise your collection and let people do the same</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural objects travel around the world. It is impossible to ever get all of Van Gogh’s paintings in one room. But with the use of the internet, it is possible to bring all the artworks from all over the world together and allow the public to explore and study the material. Curators can help the audience to find the most relevant material and let the audience use it in ways you as an institution would never think of. It allows scholars, historians, artlovers and anybody else to find new connections between artworks, bring them into new contexts and tell new stories about their heritage, and that of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana’s support for Open Data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since the start of Europeana, the foundation has endorsed the principles of open data and encouraged cultural institutions to adopt open licences, or make clear to the audience that the artwork is out of copyright because of its age. In the Europeana whitepaper <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/2cbf1f78-e036-4088-af25-94684ff90dc5\">‘The Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid,’</a> more arguments are being presented to institutions for opening up their collections. We therefore provide consultancy and documentation such as the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d542819d-d169-4240-9247-f96749113eaa&amp;groupId=10602\">Public Domain Charter</a> and a clear explanation about how institutions can <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/licensing\">license their material</a>. For the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative/challenges\">Europeana Creative Challenge</a>,&nbsp;a couple of pilot projects were created to show the potential of bringing material from a variety of sources together. The Challenge themes include history education and natural history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">CCtoolkits</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the run-up to the Open Data Day, Europeana members participated in the creation of a <a href=\"http://cctoolkits.com/en/\">Creative Commons toolkit</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">&nbsp;for cultural institutions. The&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">event, organised by Creative Commons Poland, aims to provide institutions with a set of&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">documentation, arguments, presentations and case studies that show the benefits of open data&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">for cultural institutions. For more information about the project see: <a href=\"http://cctoolkits.com/en/\">http://cctoolkits.com/</a>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">or follow the hashtag #cctoolkits on Twitter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know more about the benefits and potential, but also the issues and concerns of&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">open data, or simply need more information as to whether you can publish your data open and the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">best way possible to do so, feel free to get in touch with us. Please email <a href=\"MAILTO:joris.pekel@europeana.eu\">Joris Pekel</a> with your enquiries and comments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Images by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mik_krakow/\">Mik Krakow</a>&nbsp;CC-BY-SA)</p>"

        title: 'The Physics of Europeana'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">I was surprised when physics came up at the '<a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/unlocking-sources/conference \">Unlocking Sources-Europeana and the First World War Online' </a>in Berlin. Keynote speaker Sönke Neitzel called Europeana 'exothermic' and he’s right. It is. And one could feel the much-needed heat in freezing Berlin coming from the bustling <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/unlocking-sources/unlocking-sourcescollection-day/\">Europeana 1914-1918 family history roadshow</a> taking place in tandem with the conference. &nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/58b21979-402a-4c7c-9957-3d7508830ee4.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 161px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">These roadshows were developed as part of Europeana Awareness WP2, which Beeld en Geluid leads. It provides members of the public the opportunity to have their historical memorabilia, stories and documents digitised and made available on the new Europeana 1914-1918 platform, which was the reason for the Unlocking Sources conference.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">So I, feeding off the energy in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin like an endothermic animal asked myself, 'What else is part of the physics of Europeana?' It has many of the necessary variables, work, energy, time, speed, friction, even mass if we consider cultural content or number of partners as mass.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Putting on my physicist’s cap, I started to analyse the Europeana 1914-1918 roadshow and the conference themes in a new way. How can the rules and theorems of physics describe or help us understand Europeana?</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Potential Energy: PE=mgh</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">'Potential' was a common word at the Unlocking Sources conference; the potential of the portal, of Europeana, of everyone involved. Potential energy can be calculated in many ways but in physics it helps best to visualise something. So visualise a snowball sitting at the bottom of a snowy hill. It has to be pushed up, so work has to be done to it, but for work to be done we need energy. This energy comes from awareness.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Sönke stressed how the centennial of World War 1 was a catalyst for governments and the media to become aware and start thinking of ways to mark the beginning of the war. This awareness caused energy and money to be contributed for research initiatives, outreach/awareness, and aggregation projects like <a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ww1lit/gwa/\">The Great War Archive</a>, European Film Gateway, and Europeana 1914-1918. So the snowball was pushed up the hill, growing bigger (more content, more partners) and going higher (larger outreach, greater awareness) than before.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Since potential energy is measured by mass x gravitational force x height, the higher Europeana is pushed and the larger it grows, the more potential energy it will have at the top.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Kinetic Energy: KE=1/2mv^2&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">Now that all this work and energy has been applied to getting the Europeana snowball to the top of the hill, let’s give it a push, or in other words, launch it. As it sets off, the potential energy is released in the form of kinetic energy and Europeana and partners speed along. It is no longer a static network but an interactive, energetic being that engages communities, gathers user-generated content, and interacts with the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-mentions \">media</a> and universities - all of which were visible in Berlin.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Newton.jpg\" style=\"width: 578px; height: 805px;\" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Sir Isaac Newton. Line engraving by A. M. Monsaldi after E. Seeman, 1726 Provider: The Wellcome Library, data provider: The European Library: CC-BY-NC</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"><strong>Friction</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>But if the snowball is to roll faster, then friction has to be decreased. This is another point that Sönke, along with a group of students from Humboldt University Berlin, addressed. Broken links, poor metadata, and badly organised content slows down end-user use and re-use. However, once this friction is diminished, then even with no hills or inclines we can assume, using Newton’s First Law that Europeana will keep rolling.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newton’s First Law: An object in motion stays in motion.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustainability is incredibly important for Europeana and its partners. We strive to make sure that everything we have worked on will continue to grow and be used in the future. We want that snowball to keep on rolling, but is this possible for such a time-bound project like Europeana 1914-1918?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to project partner <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/unlocking-sources/abstracts/#lindsay_abstract \">Kate Lindsay</a> from <a href=\"http://projects.oucs.ox.ac.uk/runcoco/ \">RunCoco</a> and <a href=\"http://www.it.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford University</a>, it is. If we raise public awareness and engage people - as these roadshows already do - in addition to providing an online platform, not just a portal, for users to engage and interact with - like Europeana plans to do - then the ball should, according to Newton, keep rolling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate’s example came from The Great War Archive which was a qualitative success, and remained active on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/groups/greatwararchive/ \">Flickr</a> even after the project had ended; communities and users continued to engage one another, sharing information, stories, and images freely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Newton’s Third Law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If something is 'exothermic', it releases heat, which is a transfer of energy. By co-organising these roadshows and actively engaging communities, Europeana acts like the sun, a constant centre that all Network members, researchers, and governments can revolve around and feed off. But while the sun pulls on the orbiting planets, the orbiting planets also pull on the sun. There is a mutually interactive connectedness. Awareness and communication are these tugs and pushes that keep Europeana, the Network, and the public from growing too far apart and keep the channels for energy exchange open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The physics of Europeana is simple and obvious. Energy goes in, work goes in, energy comes out, work comes out. The more force that is put behind it, the more momentum it will carry; the more streamlined it is, the less friction it will incur. The more we interact with the public, the more reactive they will be and the more we work with one another, the more open our network flows will be. Share information, communicate, and engage; spread more awareness and ensure Europeana continues to roll on.</p>"

        body: "<p><i>By Jon Purday, Head of Communications at Europeana.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a German version of this blog, please scroll down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was huge media interest in the launch of the new <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918 site</a> in Berlin on 29 January. All the main German news programmes, including Tagesschau and <a href=\"http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/europeana102.html\">Tagesthemen</a>, ran features which were seen by more than 12 million people. The national newspapers followed up the next morning, and over the first 48 hours the new site had 70,000 visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berlin State Library hosted the launch, and the formal introduction to the site was given by the new Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media, Monika Grütters, who gave a very <a href=\"http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Rede/2014/01/2014-02-06-gruetters-europeana.html?nn=402618\">supportive and thoughtful speech</a>. Ms Grütters said, 'A project such as Europeana 1914-1918 touches a nerve. It illuminates this time of darkness and destruction by giving access to hundreds of thousands of documents and objects from all over Europe - from a private photo to a documentary film shot. [...] Europeana is a great bridge builder. In a wonderful way it is founding connections between cultural institutions across Europe. It is making an important contribution to European cooperation and understanding across borders and the battlelines of history.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/680f9566-c42d-4e39-9728-8897a5cc7fc3.jpg\" style=\"width: 589px; height: 552px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Federal Commissioner for Culture and Media, Monika Grütters</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event also marked the opening of the conference <a href=\"http://www.unlocking-sources.eu\">'Unlocking Sources: the First World War Online</a>', hosted by the Berlin State Library, an opportunity for historians, educators, curators and digital developers to hear about online resources for learning and research into the conflict as the centenary of its outbreak begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 1914-1918 site brings together three sets of content from 20 countries in Europe – 400,000 items digitised by national libraries as part of<a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu\"> Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>, 660 hours of film digitised by <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu\">EFG14</a>, and 90,000 images of First World War family papers and memorabilia. This last set of material has primarily been digitised during Europeana’s family history roadshows. These have been taking place around Europe over the past 3 years, and ran in parallel to the conference at the Berlin State Library on 30 and 31 January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the publicity, the Berlin roadshows – also known as collection days – were very busy: 350 visitors came along and 11,500 digital images were taken. We had great support from the company <a href=\"http://www.imageaccess.de/?page=index&amp;lang=en\">Image Access</a> who provided Bookeye scanners and other professional equipment, with their operators, on both days. The teams from the State Library, <a href=\"http://factsandfiles.com/\">Facts &amp; Files</a> and volunteers from Oxford University did a splendid job of scanning, interviewing and processing the remarkable range of memorabilia that people brought along. The collection days, co-ordinated by Frank Drauschke of Facts and Files in Berlin, were among our most successful ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/20140130_conferenceday1 (23).jpg\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 394px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow gets underway</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/20140130_conferenceday1 (40).jpg\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 419px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>An album of fundraising ribbons gets some media attention</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 also brings in related information from America, Australia and New Zealand through APIs. Conversely, Europeana’s API, which gives access to the pan-European, openly-licensed dataset of First World War material, is available for organisations or developers to use to incorporate Europeana’s data into their site, web services or apps. Already, <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/14-18-collections-de\">a new exhibition</a>, and two sites for learning are being developed using the source material. One, from the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one\">British Library</a>, is already live; the other, from the Association of European History Teachers, EUROCLIO, will launch shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Berlin: Europeana 1914-1918</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><i>von Jon Purday, Head of Communications, Europeana.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Freischaltung der neuen <a href=\"www.europeana1914-1918.eu/de\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> Website in Berlin am 29. Januar rief ein beeindruckendes Medienecho hervor. Alle wichtigen deutschen Medien, einschließlich <a href=\"http://www.ard.de/home/ard/23116/index.html?q=europeana\">Tagesschau und Tagesthemen</a>, berichteten darüber. Die Fernsehbeiträge wurden von mehr als 12 Millionen Menschen gesehen. Im Laufe der ersten 48 Stunden besuchten 70.000 Internetnutzer die neue Seite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin war Gastgeberin der Vorstellung der neuen Website und Prof. Monika Grütters, die neue Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien, hielt eine sehr <a href=\"http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Rede/2014/01/2014-02-06-gruetters-europeana.html?nn=402618\">anregende Laudatio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frau Grütters sagte: \"Ein Projekt wie Europeana 1914-1918 trifft genau diesen Nerv. Es bringt Licht in diese Zeit der Dunkelheit und der Zerstörung, indem es Hunderttausende von Dokumenten und Objekten aus ganz Europa erschließt – vom privaten Erinnerungsfoto bis zur dokumentarischen Filmaufnahme. [...] Die Europeana ist in diesem Sinne eine große Brückenbauerin. Sie stiftet auf wunderbare Art Verbindungen zwischen Kultureinrichtungen in ganz Europa und leistet dabei einen wichtigen Beitrag zur europäischen Zusammenarbeit und Verständigung über Grenzen und über die Gräben der Geschichte hinweg. \"</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/680f9566-c42d-4e39-9728-8897a5cc7fc3.jpg\" style=\"width: 589px; height: 552px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Kulturstaatsministerin Monika Grütters </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Veranstaltung war gleichzeitig auch der Auftakt der ebenfalls in der Staatsbibliothek stattfindenden Konferenz \"<a href=\"http://www.unlocking-sources.eu\">Unlocking Sources: Der Erste Weltkrieg online</a>\", bei der Historiker, Pädagogen, Kuratoren und digitale Entwickler die Chance hatten, über Online- Ressourcen in Lehre und Forschung zum ersten Weltkrieg zu diskutieren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Die Europeana 1914-1918 Website vereinigt Materialien aus 20 Ländern Europas, aus drei großen Digitalisierungsprojekten - 400.000 Objekte aus Nationalbibliotheken von <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>, 660 Stunden digitalisierte Filmaufnahmen von <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu\">EFG14</a> und über 90.000 Bilder und Erinnerungsstücke die von Privatpersonen beigetragen wurden. Letztgenanntes Material wurde vor allem während der Europeana Aktionstage digitalisiert. Aktionstage haben in den letzten 3 Jahren in ganz Europa und ebenso parallel zur Konferenz in der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin am 30. und 31. Januar stattgefunden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Durch die umfangreiche Berichterstattung waren die Aktionstage sehr gut besucht: Es kamen 350 Besucher und 11.500 digitale Aufnahmen und Scans wurden gemacht. Die Firma <a href=\"http://www.imageaccess.de\">ImageAccess</a> unterstützte uns großartig, indem sie mehrere Bookeye Scanner an beiden Tagen zur Verfügung stellte. Die Mitarbeiter der Staatsbibliothek, von <a href=\"http://www.factsandfiles.com\">Facts &amp; Files</a> und Freiwillige der Universität Oxford haben eine hervorragende Arbeit geleistet, indem sie die mitgebrachten Erinnerungsstücke digitalisiert und mit den Besuchern Interviews geführt haben. Diese Aktionstage, die von Frank Drauschke von Facts &amp; Files aus Berlin koordiniert wurden, gehören zu unseren erfolgreichsten überhaupt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/20140130_conferenceday1 (23).jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Startschuss für die Europeana 1914-1918 Aktionstage in der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/20140130_conferenceday1 (40).jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Ein Album mit Vivat-Bändern bekommt die Aufmerksamkeit der Medien</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 ermöglicht mit Hilfe von APIs auch die Suche nach ähnlichen Daten und Objekten zum Ersten Weltkrieg aus den USA, Australien und Neuseeland.

        title: 'Building a jukebox for Europe'
        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Guest blog by Richard Ranft from The British Library. This article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/sound-and-vision/2014/02/building-a-jukebox-for-europe.html\">The British Library website</a> on 1 February 2014.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"entry-body\">\r\n<p>We’re thrilled to announce the start this month of a new project: <em>Europeana Sounds</em>. This project will bring together online, for public access, over a million sound and associated digitised items from leading audio archives and libraries across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shall double the number of sound tracks that can be discovered through Europeana, improve descriptions for two million sounds, music scores and associated items to make them easier to find, and we’ll create new thematic ‘channels’ on Europeana that bring related objects together in a coordinated way. The sounds will encompass not just musics of different genres – classical, pop and rock, traditional and folk - but also languages and dialects, oral memories, nature and environmental sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Sounds will be accessed through Europeana, the portal to Europe’s digitised heritage. Through a multi-lingual interface supporting 31 languages, Europeana already connects a mind-boggling 30 million books, paintings, photographs, sounds, films, museum and archival objects from collections held by 2,200 source institutions. Sound recordings are one of the most popular media types, although representing just 2% of Europeana’s content. And while many of Europe’s leading cultural heritage institutions have large, high-quality audio collections that have great public appeal and are valued for research and for creative use, access to them is fragmented and constrained. Europeana Sounds will make audio content from memory institutions easily accessible - a much-needed gateway to Europe’s incomparably rich sound and music collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coordinated by the British Library, this three-year project is led by a network of 24 European organisations: innovative digital technology organisations and leading library and archive collections of sounds and related materials. We will also collaborate with three digital distribution platforms, Historypin, Spotify and SoundCloud and their existing global online communities, to extend the public reach of Europeana’s sound recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project will additionally test innovative ways to enrich metadata by crowdsourcing and by using automated machine-driven categorisation and cross-media linking. It will align different kinds of objects from different collections:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Blackbird (Turdus merula) singing.

        title: 'Report on EDM mappings, refinements and extensions'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Valentine Charles (Europeana Foundation) and Marlies Olensky (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force working on Europeana Data Model (EDM) mappings, refinements and extensions is pleased to announce that its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/468623/bca65b72-fb8f-4b4f-802d-1072690ae33a\">report</a> is now available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Data Model (EDM) plays an important role in Europeana's network of projects and providers. The number of contributing data providers is steadily increasing within this network and with this, the number and variety of metadata formats, schemas, etc. that Europeana has to integrate. Many projects and partners have been working on mappings as a way to enable metadata interoperability with other Europeana metadata, making decisions based on domain-specific requirements and possibilities offered by the EDM model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the creation of the EDM, Europeana data providers have carried out many mappings and defined necessary refinements or extensions. During the past six months, the Task Force has collected all of these in order to create a complete overview of how EDM interoperates with data providers’ metadata schemas. We have divided the contributions into the following categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Mapping to EDM: Any kind of specification (e.g., a concordance table) of relationships and equivalences between two metadata formats or models, i.e. in our case between EDM and another metadata schema.</li>\r\n    <li>Refinement of EDM or EDM application profile: Any kind of specialisation of EDM to meet the specific needs of a data provider.</li>\r\n    <li>Extension to EDM: Required when existing EDM classes and properties cannot represent the semantics of providers’ metadata with sufficient details.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech/-/wiki/Main/Task+force+on+EDM+mappings+refinements+and+extensions\">View all contributions</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/66e1d7ad-0e46-4bfd-8eb7-bb5250c4dcff.png\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 549px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of metadata in Carare's system to be ingested into Europeana</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey run by the Task Force highlighted some particular issues that data providers have to cope with while defining mappings from their metadata formats to EDM. This mapping exercise can be translated into a series of decisions made at various levels in the metadata records (e.g. creation of identifiers, creation of rich contextual resources). The Task Force has detailed these cases in the report based on examples provided by its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force hopes that its work will benefit the different actors contributing metadata to Europeana. Sharing and documenting the mappings, refinements and extensions within the Europeana Network should guarantee a good interoperability of metadata and a high-level of metadata quality in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/468623/bca65b72-fb8f-4b4f-802d-1072690ae33a\">Download the Task Force’s full report</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thank all the members of the Task Force for their contributions to this report:<br>\r\nAlessia Bardi (HOPE), Amy Rudersdorf (DPLA), Antoine Isaac (Europeana Foundation), Erik Mannens (DCA), Esther Guggenheim (Judaica and DM2E), Eva Coudyzer (Linked Heritage and AthenaPlus), Gerda Koch ( OpenUp!), Henk Vanstappen (Europeana Fashion), Jean-Pierre Evain (EUScreen), Kate Fernie (CARARE and 3DIcon), Kerstin Arnold (APEx), Marko Knepper (Judaica and DM2E), Pierfrancesco Bellini (ECLAP), Rodolphe Bailly (MIMO), Regine Stein (Linked Heritage, Partage Plus, Europeana Inside and AthenaPlus), Sam Coppens (DCA), Stefanie Ruehle (German Digital Library and Europeana Libraries), Stefanie Gehrke (Europeana Regia), Steffen Hennicke (DM2E).</p>"

        title: 'Europeana meets the internet of things in meSch – Material EncounterS with digital Cultural Heritage'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Monika Lechner and Marloes Scholtens from the meSch project.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wealth of digital cultural heritage online is vast and steadily growing, while the modes to access and engage with it are limited and rather static. What if we could connect the digital with the physical, in ways that foster interaction between visitors, objects and the environment they are in? The meSch project - <a href=\"http://mesch-project.eu/\">Material EncounterS with digital Cultural Heritage</a> - will bridge the gap between visitors’ cultural heritage experience onsite and online by providing a platform for the creation of tangible smart exhibits. Personalisation technology will help to create a personally meaningful, rich, sensorial and socially expanded visitor experience through tangible, embedded and embodied interaction with digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A platform to create interactive smart objects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage professionals, like curators and exhibition designers, will be able to create interactive smart objects and compose the narratives to be embedded within them without the need for specialised technical knowledge. To compose these narratives, cultural heritage professionals will be able to choose existing digital content from their own institutions (their collection databases or exhibition texts) , as well as openly available digital heritage content, add new content and edit these via the same platform. Europeana will be one of the most important sources that will be available via the meSch platform. Technical partners in the consortium are currently experimenting with the Europeana API and are looking into the Europeana Data Model for the data integration component of the <a href=\"http://mesch-project.eu/an-update-about-the-mesch-server-architecture/\">system architecture</a> of the meSch platform. This component supports a mediator architecture approach which allows querying multiple repositories using a common query language. Therefore adapters for data integration are being developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=23f95160-da90-4dc5-98cc-868fc85f73db&amp;groupId=858566&amp;t=1391082150522\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"MeSch diagram\" src=\"/files/blogimages/interaction.png\" style=\"width: 1191px; height: 841px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The workflow of creating narratives composed of internal and external digital repositories (right), smart objects and their sensorial interaction modes (left),and the logging of user behaviour to extend the visitor experience at home by recommendation services which will lead to new (user-generated) content that might be re-used later. Credit: meSch</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Co-design: Users as designers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The meSch approach is grounded on principles of co-design: the participation of designers, developers and cultural heritage stakeholders in the process of creation and evaluation as equal partners, and with a do-it-yourself philosophy of making and experimenting. In practice, this results in three large-scale case studies in the three museums that are part of the consortium. There, a real-world evaluation of meSch technology with the public and cultural heritage stakeholders will take place. Museums and heritage sites outside of the consortium are also regularly visited, consulted and used for smaller case studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exploratory prototypes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploratory prototypes for smart exhibits were developed during the first project year and are currently being evaluated. There is, for instance, the <a href=\"http://mesch-project.eu/co-designing-tangible-interactions-at-sheffield-general-cemetery/\">Companion Novel</a>, an interactive book-like device developed for visitors to carry with them during their visits to the historic Sheffield General Cemetery. By selecting a particular page of the book through a specially designed bookmark, a visitor may select a narrative theme around the cemetery. Audio information played at hotspots is adapted to the theme the visitor has chosen.

This prototype consists essentially of a wooden frame with a smartphone hidden in it. It aims to help visitors navigate through a museum on the one hand, and add contextual layers to an exhibition on the other. Results from these explorations will form the base for further development in year two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/mesch magnifying glass.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 456px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>One of the exploratory prototypes of interactive smart objects: the interactive magnifying glass.

        title: 'The First World War Centenary: the site that brings all sides together launches in Berlin'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">www.europeana1914-1918.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Deputy Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and Media, Günter Winands, today launched Europeana 1914-1918, an online resource that opens up hidden stories of the First World War and shows the tragedy that shaped Europe from different sides of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/493bfb44-6dee-4ab3-bc55-f5c7f576afc8.png\" style=\"width: 457px; height: 718px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 is the most important pan-European collection of original First World War source material. It is the result of three years of work by 20 European countries and will include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>400,000 rare documents digitised by 10 state libraries and two other partners in Europe</li>\r\n    <li>660 hours of unique film material digitised by audiovisual archives</li>\r\n    <li>90,000 personal papers and memorabilia of some 7,000 people involved in the war, held by their families and digitised at special events in 12 countries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/screenshot browse.png\" style=\"width: 572px; height: 386px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Minister of Culture, Monika Grütters, said on the occasion of the launch:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Among the numerous projects the Federal Government of Germany is initiating and financially supporting during the current Centenary 2014, Europeana 1914-1918 is a highlight due to its pan-European dimension. It shows the stark difference between the European disruptions of that time and our way of cooperating nowadays. It is vital for the Government to point out, especially to young people, that today’s Europe is a union based on shared values, policies and justice. That’s the best way to avoid the wars, terror and fragmentation that Europe suffered in the 20th century. We don’t just want to show historical events, we want to use them for the present and the future. The Europeana project will help shape our views of that time and it will make a great contribution to the mutual understanding of the European people, despite the conflicts of history.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Hermann Parzinger, the President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation to which the Berlin State Library belongs, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The launch of the Europeana 1914-1918 is a visionary start to the commemoration year \"1914.Aufbruch.Weltbruch\" run by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and all its related institutions. The outcomes of the new website will be of long-lasting value. The worldwide access to this tremendous collection of highly relevant documents from the First World War offers a great basis for researchers and the general public to understand the events one hundred years ago.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 1914-1918 is full of original source material – digitised photographs, maps, diaries, newspapers, letters, drawings and other content that can be used by teachers, historians, journalists, students and interest groups to create new resources. Already, the site is providing content for a new exhibition called <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/14-18-collections-de\">The First World War: Places of transition</a> and a new multilingual <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/world-war-one\">educational site</a> developed by the British Library in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'It's a unique collection of raw materials – rare, fragile and hardly seen before. We’re encouraging everyone - history teachers, Wikipedians, apps developers - to use it in new ways. Most of the content is under an open licence, because we want people to re-use it to help broaden everyone’s understanding of our European past.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch marks the beginning of an important programme of events to open this Centenary year:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>30/31 January – two family digitisation days at the Berlin State Library, 10.00 – 18.00.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anybody with family papers and memorabilia from the First World War can bring them along to be photographed and put online. The family digitisation days are from 10.00 to 18.00 on Thursday 30 and Friday 31 January at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on the 30-31 January, the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin is running the <b>Unlocking Sources conference</b>. It will be attended by 300 experts from across Europe. At the conference they will reflect on how online resources can add to our understanding of the conflict – including a session on whether video games harm or help our interpretation of the tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barbara Schneider-Kempf, the Director General of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Our partner libraries have provided a rich mix of materials, showing different sides of the historic conflict and never before seen together. This raw material will allow historians, curators, teachers, researchers and digital developers to shape new interpretations of the experiences of 1914-1918. Our Unlocking Sources conference is their first introduction to Europeana 1914-1918 and the opportunities it will offer them.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the major War Collection of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, the <b>exhibition Unlocking Sources 1914-1918 – The Making Of </b>shows how a cultural institution digitises their hidden resources and presents them online so everyone has access and can find new ways to use and share them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the exhibition, a specially made short film tells the story of the war writer Walter Flex, author of the acclaimed Wanderer zwischen beiden Welten (The Wanderer between Two Worlds), whose personal documents, including a bullet-holed map, letters, manuscripts and photographs, are preserved in the Staatsbibliothek.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The First World War on Film</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the evening of 30 January, delegates at the conference will have a special showing of selected films from the period, accompanied by the renowned pianist Eunice Martins in the Zeughaus Cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These films, together with a further 660 hours of moving images, have been contributed to Europeana 1914-1918 by 21 European film archives under the direction of the Deutsches Filminstitut [DIF]. Director of the DIF Claudia Dillmann, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The contribution that film makes to our understanding of the period is immense. Barely 20% of the silent film produced at the time has survived and most of the newsreels, documentaries, fiction and propaganda that we have put online have not been seen by the public for a century. We have also digitised anti-war films that reflect on the catastrophe at first hand.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please see our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pressrelease/29jan\">press release</a></p>"

        title: 'Copyright Public Consultation:  Europeana responds, have you?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><strong>** The deadline for submitting a response extended: 5 March 2014 **</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, we told you about the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\">Public Consultation on Copyright Rules</a> that was launched by the European Commission. Because this public consultation contains a number of questions that are highly relevant to cultural heritage institutions and how they can operate in the digital environment, Europeana has developed a consensus-driven collective response. We hope that our response to the consultation will contribute to a meaningful conversation on how to craft copyright rules that ensure that Europeana and the Network can fulfil their objectives in the digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This consultation offers a unique opportunity to provide input into a discussion that will shape the future rules by which cultural heritage institutions in Europe will have to play. It is clear that the current rules limit what we can achieve by leveraging digital technologies and as far as we are concerned, that means that the rules have to change! But this will only happen if cultural heritage institutions all across Europe make their voice heard!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">response</a> is outlined below, along with information on how we achieved consensus and how you can participate in the public consultation, as well as share your views with us and the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A consensus-driven collective response</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve consensus, Europeana formed the ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/eu-copyright-review\">Copyright reform working group</a>’, consisting of members from the organisations that are represented on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/about/europeana-foundation/board\">the Board</a> of the Europeana Foundation. We have asked each member of the group and the Network to share their positions and opinions on the consultation. Chaired by <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/about-kennisland/people/paul-keller\">Kennisland's Paul Keller</a>, a collective response has been documented, debated and agreed with members of the group, including noting dissent where this is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To complete the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/advocacy-framework\">process for securing a mandate</a> from the Europeana Network, this <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">paper</a> has been circulated to all Europeana Network members. Each member is asked to support this response, but also to inform us where their views differ and if they do not wish their organisation to be represented in this response so that this can be clearly noted (any further changes to the response will be published in the '<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/advocacy\">Advocacy</a>' section of Europeana Pro). In addition, our Network members are asked to support the public consultation by submitting their response - more on how you can do this below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A summary of Europeana's response</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the 80 questions posed, the working group agreed that 28 were directly relevant to Europeana and our Network and it is these that form the basis of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">Europeana response</a>. The answers to those questions are based on the following objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Europeana stresses the importance of a unified legal environment that ensures that cultural heritage institutions across Europe have to deal with identical copyright rules (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">see questions 8, 21 and 22</a>).</li>\r\n    <li>We argue for a reduction of the term of copyright protection (50 years after the death of the author instead of 70 years) and for a registration system for protected works. Both measures are intended to reduce the amount of works that are still in copyright but cannot be used because the rights holders have stopped exercising their rights (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">see questions 15 - 20</a>).</li>\r\n    <li>We further argue for the introduction of more flexibility in the European copyright system to ensure that copyright adapts to changes in technology and to ensure that European cultural heritage institutions are awarded the same flexibility as our partners in countries that have more flexible copyright systems such as the US (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">see questions 24 and 25</a>).</li>\r\n    <li>A large proportion of our answers deal with the copyright exceptions that should benefit cultural heritage institutions. Under the current EU copyright rules there are two of these: an exception that allows institutions to make copies of works in their collection for preservation purposes and an exception that allows them to make works in their collection available to the public via dedicated terminals on the premises of the institution. We argue that these exceptions are too limited and that they should be expanded. Cultural heritage institutions should have the right to digitise all works in their collections and they should be allowed to make those works that are not in commercial circulation anymore available online for non-commercial purposes. In addition, libraries should have the right to engage in electronic lending of all works in their collections (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">see questions 21-41</a>).</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, we are also arguing for a strengthening of the exception that allows educational use of protected works so that it covers a broad range of educational activities including the creation of online educational resources. Educational use of materials made available via Europeana is one of Europeana's key objectives (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">see questions 42-44</a>).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Responding to the public consultation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadline for submitting a response to the public consultation is fast approaching: 5 March. If you haven’t done so already, Europeana encourages all members of the Europeana Network to submit their own response to the EU consultation. You can use <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f633a395-4d4e-4951-a0f1-cdddbee32598\">our response</a> as guidance when formulating your own reply - picking out answers that represent your institutional views, or using the whole response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also a number of other tools and resources that can help you formulate a response - for example, if you can contact your representative organisation such as <a href=\"http://www.iasa-web.org/\">IASA</a>, <a href=\"http://fep-fee.eu/\">FEP</a>, <a href=\"http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php\">EUROCLIO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu/2\">EMA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oapen.org/home\">OAPEN</a> and the many others that are represented on the Europeana Board. You can also use an online tool to help you formulate a response: visit <a href=\"http://youcan.fixcopyright.eu/?librarian\">youcan.fixcopyright.eu</a> where you can find a selection of questions relevant for cultural heritage professionals with explanations for each question. These responses are based on a <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/153088/model_response_cultural_heritage.pdf\">model response</a> prepared by <a href=\"http://www.kl.nl/\">Kennisland</a> for Dutch cultural heritage institutions which broadly follows the same objectives as those outlined above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However you choose to respond, we’d be really pleased to hear about your response, so let us know by contacting <a href=\"mailto:julia.fallon@europeana.eu\">julia.fallon@europeana.eu</a>!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Food for thought: the Ambrosia Europe Food and Drink project kicks off'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Blog by Katie Smith, Projects and Programme Manager at Collections Trust.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it that every European (hopefully) does at least three times a day? You probably guessed it: eat and drink. Buying, preparing and consuming food and drink is probably the thing that we spend most of our free time on. It is also something that connects us on a very basic level - it is no wonder that it is in the base of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslov's pyramid of needs</a>. Without food and drink, there would be no society, no safety, no social ties and no culture. It is not surprising then that throughout history, food and drink have inspired numerous artists and companies to produce cultural content around their consumption - whether it's in paintings, photos, commercial ads or on television and radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/b27344a9-d377-4ad2-a698-f52b8861d543.jpg\" style=\"width: 447px; height: 349px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2022085/10622_FCB51026_E84F_4585_8F45_5DC19B31A3BA.html\">Het is met groote heeren slecht aardappelen eten. </a>', Persmuseum, public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make Europe's digital cultural heritage regarding food and drink available to citizens all over the world, a large network of 29 organisations has just kicked off the Ambrosia Europe project. Ambrosia, of course, meaning the food or drink of the gods in Greek mythology. Ambrosia is a 30-month project that revolves around the collection and dissemination of food and drink-related content. The idea is to create a number of products, such as physical and virtual exhibitions, games, apps and books, which feature food and drink-related content aimed at specific audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Amdbrosia_kickoff.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 367px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Ambrosia Europe project team at the kick-off in London</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to do this, the consortium will first of all look into market needs and demands by trying to answer some important questions. What kind of information and cultural artefacts are people actually looking for or interested in? What are creative industries doing in the field of food and drink, and what kind of re-usable content do they need in order to create exciting products? Which well-known consumer brands might be interested in exploring their own heritage and telling their customers about it? What kind of virtual and physical exhibitions are museums in the field of, for example, agriculture, interested in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/SK-A-2962-small.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 412px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/collectie_SK_A_2962.html\">Keukenstuk (bodegón)</a>', Rijksmuseum, public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the project scope is incredibly broad, it is important to include organisations and experts from very different fields of knowledge and culture. When you look at Ambrosia's organisation, you will notice that both cultural and academic institutions are included, as well as app developers and commercial organisations. During a two-day kick-off session in London, the team discussed how to move forward within the framework of the official project proposal, which was submitted to the European Commission in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can you expect? Hopefully, in the course of 2014-2016, you can visit exciting new websites to do with food and drink-related cultural heritage. Or maybe you will see historical photos of ingredients on modern day food packaging. How about a book on recipes from the past? Or a Twitter account that provides you with a daily painting in which food and drink is presented somehow? Until then, we will present the findings of our market research and an overview of business models to serve as a foundation for the forthcoming products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3-Chocolat-Carpentier.jpg\" style=\"width: 462px; height: 650px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/ark__12148_btv1b9005573g.html\">Chocolat Carpentier</a>', French National Library, public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is obvious that there are a lot of questions that need answering, and this is all due to the unique nature of this project. Project members are excited to find out more and will be putting real users and consumers in the driving seat to decide what Ambrosia will deliver. The project is able to provide the tools and platform to ingest thousands of cultural artefacts, but really meeting market demand is what we will need to focus on and put at the core of this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to find out more about Ambrosia, go to <a href=\"http://www.ambrosia-europe.eu\">www.ambrosia-europe.eu</a> and sign up to receive updates - the main site will be going live over the next few weeks - or follow the project via Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/ambrosia_eu\">@ambrosia_eu</a>. We want to hear from you, so if you have any comments or want to get involved now is the time to make yourself heard!</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Antoine Isaac, Europeana's Scientific Coordinator, has collaborated on the production of a new book on the semantic web for libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/lewebsemantique.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 588px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book, written in French, presents the different technological components that make up the semantic web. It explains what makes this technology relevant for libraries, especially in terms of interoperability, openness, and the way existing practices and data can be made to serve new usage scenarios and services for these institutions. The book is illustrated by a series of use cases: publishing RDF data, enriching web pages with semantic mark-up, and aggregating data on the Linked Open Data cloud or in a Linked Enterprise Data setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antoine says, 'The book builds on a range of implementation and training activities that we've carried out mainly in France, as well as many seminars, papers and projects that we have put together over time. Emanuelle Bermès was the lead author and myself and Gautier Poupeau were co-authors under her supervision. I am extremely happy to have taken part of this project as I've been working for quite a while with the community that tries to apply semantic web technology in the library area. More precisely, I've been involved at <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\">W3C</a> in the making of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/\">SKOS</a>, which is a piece of technology that is quite important for what we want to do. I've also been co-chairing the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/\">W3C Incubator Group on Library Linked Data</a> with Emanuelle.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested? You can buy the book in hard copy or ebook from <a href=\"http://www.electrelaboutique.com/ProduitECL.aspx?ean=9782765414179#!\">Electre La Boutique</a>.</p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>The news of Europeana's virtual reality museum prompted today's guest bloggers to think about how culture can be used to sculpt the European narrative, particularly about how the EU can use culture in its communications with the rest of the world. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Guest blog by Klaus Bondam, Director of the Danish Cultural Institute, Brussels and Maiken Høj, Communications officer, Preparatory Action Culture in EU external relations.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month, Europeana launched the idea of an <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/tag/euseum/\">online virtual museum</a>, cleverly called 'EUseum', which makes the European Museum one step closer to reality. The potential is for EUseum to promote cultural exchange and transnational exhibitions, which might, ultimately, succeed in enhancing cultural integration within the borders of the EU. The instant sharing of cultural heritage and online access to the comprehensive cultural collection which Europe has developed over ‘la longue durée’ is inevitable. But there might be even more to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/euseum.jpeg\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The EUseum virtual reality demonstration</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is on-going reflection about the need for a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/debate-future-europe/new-narrative/index_en.htm\">new narrative for Europe</a>. We believe that these discussions and initiatives like the Preparatory Action ‘<a href=\"http://cultureinexternalrelations.eu/ \">Culture in EU external relations</a>’ point in the same direction as Europeana: by culturally re-arming Europe, our united powers can create (re)actions within the EU and a stronger sense of being European, in whatever sense that might be appropriate for each individual. But we also believe thast the potential might expand to even wider success – outside the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/euseum2.jpeg\" style=\"width: 601px; height: 149px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Re-arming culturally</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What third countries, by which we mean non-EU states, often point out when accessing the EU - in search of cooperation, strategic partnership or other engagement - is a lack of unity. For them, the EU’s motto of ‘unity in diversity’ is not easy to implement in a business plan as there are many different agendas and cultures at stake. So instead, they access each individual member state separately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this perspective, an online European museum is more than an advanced technical achievement, it is more than just opening the cultural sources of Europe to the public and most importantly it goes beyond the traditional culture schemes of Europe by setting up intercultural dialogue. It involves Europe as a whole. 'EUseum’ and Europeana could be the gate through which the world accesses the cultural sector of Europe, and the meeting point where the national museums and institutions start sharing collections and exhibitions as <i>Europeans</i> and not exclusively as <i>nations</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paradigm shift followed by the launch of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/debate-future-europe/new-narrative/index_en.htm\">new narrative for Europe</a> and related initiatives has a clear importance for public diplomacy, intercultural dialogue and the empowerment of citizens in articulating the European story and identity in the year 2014. There is a clear bottom-up strategy, in which the narrative of the EU is given voice by Europeans’ own tongues – not just that of Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Culture in external relations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The before mentioned Preparatory Action <a href=\"http://cultureinexternalrelations.eu/ \">Culture in EU external relations</a> was launched by the European Commission with the purpose of making recommendations on how to strengthen the role of culture in the external relations of the European Union. The action is executed by a consortium of eight member institutions led by the Goethe Institute and followed by BOZAR, British Council, Danish Cultural Institute, ECF, IFA, Institut francais and KEA European Affairs. The agenda is not to seek any mandate from the member states but to facilitate and support an on-going process of research, and an exchange of knowledge and public debate about the role of culture in the EU’s external relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When reflecting on the potential of both Europeana and ‘EUseum’ through the lens of the Preparatory Action, we see initiatives that could trigger more ‘Europeanisation’ of the national museum institutions and their exhibitions. The ambition is to present a much more identifiable face of the EU towards the strategic partners and third countries in our external relations. The use of cultural dialogue arms the EU to enter the international arena without military power or economic superiority and to build up external relations on the basis of mutual understanding, intercultural dialogue and cultural attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about <a href=\"http://cultureinexternalrelations.eu/ \">Culture in EU external relations</a> by visiting the website or following the action on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cultureinexternalrelations\">Facebook</a> or Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/cultextrel\">@CultExtRel</a>.</p>"

        title: 'New features for Europeana'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>We’re prolonging the season for giving and are pleased to present three new features on Europeana for you to make use of in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>‘Can I use it?’</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Items in Europeana come with a rights statement that specifies whether and how you can use them. Perhaps you want to include an image in your school work, or to create a logo for your company, or incorporate a video into an app you’re designing – before doing any of these things you should check the licence to see if you can legally use it the way you wish. We’ve always showed you copyright information using the ‘By Copyright’ filter, but we’ve just made it a lot easier to understand with a new ‘Can I use it?’ feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/3c76b8ab-dcd4-4ce5-b350-eff3b7b52bfc.png\" style=\"width: 486px; height: 346px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When looking at your search results, check the ‘Can I use it?’ filter. There are three options:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, with attribution – this means you can freely use the item but you should include details so that others know what the item is and where it is from. Give credit where credit is due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, with restrictions – this means you need to check the individual rights statement closely. It might be that the item you want can be used freely for non-commercial purposes but you need permission if you want to use it commercially, or that it can be used whole but cannot be amended (e.g. cropped, coloured or mixed with other resources).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only with permission – this means that in order to use an item, you must have explicit permission from the rights holder. A good place to start here is to follow the link to the provider’s website and contact them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Play videos and sound</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can now access a range of videos and sound files directly from within Europeana, rather than following a link through to the provider’s own website. To do this, when looking at a search result, click on the thumbnail image/icon (where it says ‘Play’) and a media player will open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/play.png\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 422px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This feature works for items that come from organisations who upload their videos to Vimeo or their audio to SoundCloud. The partners we’re piloting this with are the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=DATA_PROVIDER:%22Nederlands+Instituut+voor+Beeld+en+Geluid%22&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22Digitale+Collectie%22\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sound and Vision\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=DATA_PROVIDER:%22Deutsche+Kinemathek%22&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22EFG+-+The+European+Film+Gateway%22\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Deutsche Kinemathek\">Deutsche Kinemathek</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=DATA_PROVIDER:%22%C3%96sterreichisches+Filmmuseum%22&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22EFG+-+The+European+Film+Gateway%22\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Austrian Film Museum\">Austrian Film Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of our favourite video/audio clips that you can play directly from Europeana:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08621/1037479000000208077.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Austro-Hungarian Navy\">Insights into the Austrian Imperial Navy of WWI</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/08617/1037479000000096003.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sci-fi film\">The Airship Destroyer – a sci-fi short film predicting the horrors of ‘strategic’ bombing by air</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021613/tracks_47961046.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bells\">The sounds of the bells of Utrecht cathedral</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021613/tracks_43574102.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cat\">The sound of a cat purring and miaowing</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to add more collections so if you work for an organisation that provides video or audio to Europeana, please get in touch with us as you'll need to make sure your metadata is provided to us in a particular way. Please also get in touch if you use other services (like YouTube or DailyMotion) for your audiovisual content and we can investigate displaying them in the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>New search widget</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Got your own blog or website and want to include a Europeana search box? We’ve just improved our search widget. It’s really easy to configure – just follow the steps in the wizard. You could allow your users to search all of Europeana or a sub-section of results such as only results from within Public Domain or Creative Commons, or only licensed images from a specific country, or only videos on a topic related to your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can choose black or white styles and either a simple search box or a search with a results preview. Once you’ve made your selections, simply copy and paste the code provided into your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/search-widget.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 239px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The widget works on any site or CMS you host yourself and with hosted Blogger, Blogspot and Tumblr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/usingeuropeana_searchwidget.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Search widget instructions\">Full instructions on configuring your search widget</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/widget/editor.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Configure your search widget\">Configure your search widget now</a>!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.de/e/conference-unlocking-sources-the-first-world-war-online-and-europeana-registration-8207297247\">Register now</a> for 'Unlocking Sources - the First World War Online and Europeana' - a great event for anyone interested in the First World War. The event takes place on 30-31 January at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/36260a2f-8504-49c8-bbec-9ae5425db646.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 161px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as a two-day international conference, the event also includes: the launch of the new-look Europeana 1914-1918 website along with an educational site and a virtual exhibition; two family history roadshows - bring your family's memorabilia to be digitised and added to the pan-European WWI online archive; and an exhibition showing how a cultural institution goes about digitising its collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new version of the <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918 website</a> brings the public's previously untold stories of the First World War together with official histories from national libraries and film footage of the era. It also incorporates collections from outside Europe - search the Digitial Public Library of America, Australia's Trove and Digital New Zealand. Discover the First World War from all angles and all perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Krieg1914_11820_Die_Kriegsfürsorge_Abbildung_Künstliche_Gliedmaßen.jpg\" style=\"width: 459px; height: 671px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Image from Europeana Collections 1914-1918</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference itself focuses on how the digitised holdings of Europeana can be re-used, for example in research or in history lessons at school. How do digitised holdings fit into research and teaching and the transfer of knowledge in the classroom? What can different online activities contribute to the 'Digital Humanities'? Which ideas can be developed regarding the mediation of history in museums and which media can be developed for this purpose? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the existing and the newly created online offerings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition 'Unlocking Sources: Europeana 1914-1918 – The Making Of' runs from 30 January to 8 February 2014 and presents outstanding holdings from the Staatsbibliothek's own collections related to the First World War. The interactive exhibition illustrates the many ways in which a library collection can be used and combined with other internet offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unlocking-sources.eu/\">More information</a> and or <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.de/e/conference-unlocking-sources-the-first-world-war-online-and-europeana-registration-8207297247\">register now</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/bf71113d-da4a-4ff2-be88-e322c423a114\">Download the event flyer (in German)</a></p>"

        title: 'The right stuff: Europeana Fashion publishes ‘best practice’ intellectual property guidelines'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Roxanne Peters, Intellectual Property Manager at the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/portal/home.html\">Europeana Fashion</a> partner.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do Chanel’s interlocking Cs, Laboutin’s red sole and David Bowie’s stage costumes have in common? The answer is they are all protected by intellectual property (IP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like physical property, IP can be sold, bought, inherited or otherwise transferred. It is a valuable asset and whether you are a creator, consumer or custodian of someone else’s work, it is important to understand your rights and respect the rights of others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for a cultural heritage organisation which may be creators, owners, users, managers and providers of content, IP can become a potential minefield as well as its greatest asset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e68ade20-24ec-48ba-a1fa-ebc91c61de47.png\" style=\"width: 396px; height: 555px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Read the <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Europeana%20Fashion%20IPR%20Guidelines.pdf\">Europeana Fashion IP Guidelines</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changes in IP legislation, expectations to make more content available for free online, anonymous works as well as institutional financial and operational challenges can make the demands of dealing with IP seem overwhelming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Victoria and Albert Museum’s (V&amp;A) Intellectual Property Manager, I am often faced with unravelling the IP conundrums surrounding the museum’s wonderful collection of fashion, including issues around ownership, permissions and what is protected by IP, where there is, largely speaking, little guidance out there for those managing fashion collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is there no clear guidance currently available? This may be due in part to the subjective nature of fashion. As a cultural heritage organisation, fashion garments may be acquired as expressions of art as well as for any social and cultural considerations. Legally, fashion has been seen in the UK as serving purely functional purposes, whilst the law varies in other parts of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/IPR1.png\" style=\"width: 468px; height: 333px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">An example from the IPR Guidelines</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to ask questions such as has this dress been mass-produced? Did the creator intend this hat to be a work of art? What was the agreement made between the three designers who collaborated on this range of textiles? Do we need to seek permission from both creators of this work? The list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the absence of authoritative legislation, I firmly believe that – whilst it is important to understand the legal principles – success hinges on being able to apply law in practice. For example, what is the real risk in publishing an image of a mass-produced fashion garment on the museum’s award-winning '<a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/\">Search the Collections</a>' site? Was the anonymous work created with any commercial intent?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For day-to-day management of our collections, we have seen a shift from curating and providing access to fashion solely in a physical space, to exploring new and innovative ways to reach audiences virtually. The recent groundbreaking shows '<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/\">Hollywood Costume</a>' and '<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/david-bowie-is/\">David Bowie Is</a>' have reinforced the importance and value in seeking permission for using fashion content both on site and online. Working collaboratively with creators and designers achieves the best outcome for public access and enjoyment and builds good relationships with rights holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The V&amp;A is delighted to be one of 22 partners of the Europeana Fashion project, a 3-year project which aims to provide online access to over 700,000 items of outstanding fashion content from Europe’s leading museums and private fashion archives. We have written <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Europeana%20Fashion%20IPR%20Guidelines.pdf\">‘best practice’ IPR guidelines</a> to support partners when selecting content to make available online. These have been developed with project partners and are based on our experiences in managing fashion content (including 2D and multimedia works). They combine key IP principles with ‘best practice’ flowcharts and useful documents to use when seeking permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://blog.europeanafashion.eu/download/Europeana%20Fashion%20IPR%20Guidelines.pdf\">guidelines</a> have been designed principally to address the challenges facing cultural institutions when managing rights in fashion content. However, they also provide a good pragmatic approach to managing rights more generally and we are pleased to share them with all Europeana partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these guidelines do not constitute legal advice and simplify a complex subject, we hope they go some way to reassuring you that by combining a little bit of law, logic and experience, you are on your way to getting it right!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fashion is as important as any other creative process; whether you protect your work to establish a distinctive brand identity like Chanel or commission emerging designers to create an iconic wardrobe like Bowie's, cultural institutions have a responsibility to pursue best practice, give credit where credit is due and educate others in a virtual world. Getting it right at the start of any Europeana project will ensure that the long-term ambitions to create a more open and accessible source of European's cultural heritage are realised.</p>"

        body: "<p><i>By Kristine Hoff Meyer, Danish Agency for Culture</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many advantages to cloud computing which could possibly be taken advantage of by cultural and heritage institutions. Cost-effectiveness and access to resources beyond the abilities of the individual institutions are among the primary advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/01838216-1f9d-430a-a721-36e9ef356b53.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 434px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A cloudy scene at a Carmelite convent in Elsinore, Denmark. The Danish Agency for Culture, CC BY.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This assumption is the basis for the <a href=\"http://locloud.eu\">LoCloud project</a>, which aims to make local cultural heritage information available on Europeana by taking advantage of cloud computing. LoCloud will support small and medium-sized institutions in aggregating their content, by using the cloud to provide services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first deliverable in the LoCloud project is a report on the state of the art of cloud services in the cultural heritage sector. The first section of the report offers a general description of cloud computing. The second section presents an introduction to the uptake of cloud computing by small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU. In the third and final section, special attention is paid to the needs of small and medium-sized cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though cloud computing is still emerging, a stamp of approval is that The European Commission has adopted a cloud computing strategy based on the reports from expert working groups and open consultations. It was adopted in September 2012 and is part of the 'Digital Agenda for Europe.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LoCloudPlenary.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 392px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The LoCloud Plenary meeting</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is high awareness and willingness to participate in cloud-based development from the heritage institutions and agencies voicing their opinion in this report. The barriers to participating cited are mainly lack of knowledge and skills, trust and legal issues. The main legal obstacle is the fact that many institutions are charged with the governance of their data and there will often be restrictions as to where that data may be placed and to whom it may be given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of Saas (Software as a service) providers for the cultural sector. Some of the commercial vendors of collections management systems offer cloud-based versions of their software, and in the library domain the <a href=\"http://oclc.org/home.en.html\">OCLC</a> offers a number of relevant services. However, none of these come with plug-in aggregation tools for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is still a need for online tools with a very low barrier to entry which are suited to the needs (and budgets) of smaller local and community museums. This is the window of opportunity for the LoCloud project. The LoCloud project will also cooperate with other Europeana related projects especially <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud/home\">Europeana Cloud.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report has been prepared by a working group lead by <a href=\"http://www.kulturstyrelsen.dk/english/\">The Danish Agency for Culture</a>. The report is available on the <a href=\" http://locloud.eu/Resources/Deliverables \">LoCloud website.</a></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Extended blog post by Paul Keller, Kennisland.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 5 December, the European Commission launched its much anticipated public consultation on the review of the EU copyright rules. This blog summarises the key points of the consultation and asks all memory institutions to comment on the consultation - more details at the end of the post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/038c4ead-b20a-4967-8039-4887f47835db.png\" style=\"height: 377px; width: 353px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">This consultation is the first visible sign of the second track of the Commission’s attempt to modernise the EU rules (the first track consisted of the Licences for Europe stakeholder dialogue). According to the Commission the focus of this effort is on:</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\">'<span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">… ensuring that the EU copyright regulatory framework stays fit for purpose in the digital environment to support creation and innovation, tap the full potential of the Single Market, foster growth and investment in our economy and promote cultural diversity.'</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">For many memory institutions, it has been obvious for a long time that the current EU copyright framework is not </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">fit for purpose</span><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"> for these organisations to fulfil their missions in the digital environment. The problems related to copyright have been frequently discussed in the the context of Europeana and other digitisation efforts. While there has been some progress (most notably the 2012 EU directive on certain permitted uses of Orphan Works), it is clear that there are still huge barriers facing memory institutions wanting to operate in the digital environment.</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">From the perspective of memory institutions, it is therefore very welcome that the European Commission is now reviewing the EU copyright rules and that issues related to memory institutions are part of this review. This gives these institutions the opportunity to draw attention to the problems they are facing and to express the policy outcomes that would support them in fulfilling their public missions.</span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Pauls%20mashup.jpg\" style=\"width: 596px; height: 388px;\"></span></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\"><em>Mash-up using a public domain work by Paul Keller. Based on </em></a><i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Anatomy_Lesson.jpg\">The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</a> by Rembrandt.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:19px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">The consultation</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">The </span><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/docs/consultation-document_en.pdf\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;\">consultation document</span></a><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"> (pdf) covers a wide range of issues from the functioning of the single market for copyrighted works, to linking and browsing, copyright term duration, registration of copyrighted works and exceptions and limitations for memory institutions, education, research, persons with disabilities and ‘user generated content’. In addition, there are questions about private copying and levies, the fair remuneration of authors and performers, respect for rights and the possibility of a single EU copyright title. Finally, there is an open question that allows respondents to flag issues that the Commission is not explicitly asking about.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this comes in the form of a 37-page document that contains 80 questions. The size and thematic breadth of this document may be intimidating at first sight, but the Commission explicitly mentions that respondents to the consultation can focus on a subset of the questions. The consultation contains a number of sections that are relevant to the work of memory institutions. The first of these are in the section on ‘Rights and the functioning of the Single Market’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:19px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">Registration and term duration</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Question 15–18 on page 14 deal with the registration of works and other subject matter. In the discussion about orphan works, a general registration system has been suggested as one way to prevent future orphan works, so this section may be of interest to memory institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Question 20 on page 16 deals with the duration of copyright protection. The Commission wants to know if the current term of protection is still appropriate in the digital environment or if it should be shorter or longer. Memory institutions frequently argue that the current term of protection (life of the author plus 70 years) is too long when compared with the commercial life of many of the objects that can be found in the collections of these institutions. This prevents them from making works in their collections available online for a disproportionate amount of time, resulting in much of the 20th-century material that is held by institutions being currently unavailable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Limitations and exceptions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next section of the consultation focuses on limitations and exceptions in the single market. Exceptions and limitations are an essential part of the European copyright system that ensures user rights that create a balance to the exclusive right of creators. The existing copyright directive contains a list of 21 exceptions and limitations that may be implemented by national legislators. Of these 21 exceptions and limitations, one (the exception for temporary copies), is mandatory and all the other ones are optional. The member states have chosen to implement these exceptions to varying degrees, which means that users (such as memory institutions) in one member state may be allowed to make certain uses without permission from rights holders while the same type of user may not have the right to do so in another member state. Questions 21 22, 26 and 27 focus on this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/copyright-infso/index_en.htm\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">From the perspective of memory institutions who are increasingly cooperating across member state borders (via Europeana or otherwise), a level playing field would be desirable. In addition, this section contains questions dealing with more flexibility when it comes to exceptions and limitations (questions 24, 25 and 26). Some memory institutions have argued that a more flexible system, such as fair use, would provide them with more room to operate in the digital environment. This argument has gained credibility by the recent</span></a><a href=\"http://www.ala.org/news/node/9704\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\"> </span><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#1155cc;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:baseline;\">judgement in the Google Books case in the US</span></a><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">, that allows Google and their library partners to digitise in-copyright books without having to obtain permission from the rights holders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:19px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">Libraries, Archives and Museums</span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">The next section specifically deals with the scope of the exceptions benefitting memory institutions. While the consultation only mentions libraries and archives in the text of the questions, it is important to point out that the copyright directive explicitly refers to ‘publicly accessible libraries, educational establishments or museums, or archives’ (in article 5(2)c). Given this, museums should also answer these questions as they are equally relevant for them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">The first two sets of questions (28 - 35) deal with existing exceptions for preservation and archiving and the consultation of digitised works via dedicated terminals on the premises of establishments. Many memory organisations have argued that the existing limitations and exceptions, where they are implemented, are too restrictive. The making of preservation and/or archive copies should be allowed without restrictions and that memory institutions should be allowed to provide access to their collections via electronic means also from outside of their premises. Expanding both of these exceptions and making them mandatory would allow memory institutions to better leverage the opportunities created by digitisation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:15px;font-family:'Helvetica Neue';color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;\">The next set of questions (36–39) deals with e-lending.

The two questions asked (40 and 41) present institutions with an opportunity to point out the shortcomings of both the Orphan Works Directive and the MOU on Out of Commerce works.

This consultation provides a unique opportunity for memory institutions to make their position on copyright rules in the digital environment heard. For this position to be clearly heard, it is important that as many institutions as possible react to the consultation highlighting the concerns of the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give strength to the viewpoint of our memory institutions and to highlight the particular issues it faces in areas such as cross border access and non commercial access to collections, the Europeana Foundation is therefore proposing to coordinate a consensus-driven collective response. Europeana is asking its Board and Network for a mandate to lead such a joint, coordinated response for its members as well as actively encouraging member associations and individual organisations to complete the questionnaire and participate in developing such a coordinated, consensual position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information on helping develop this can be found in the Advocacy section of Europeana Professional. We would like associations and individuals to send their positions vis-a-vis the public consultation, to give us copies of their completed questionnaires, to participate in a copyright review working group and express their opinions by commenting on this blog.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The fourth and final strategy workshop of the Europeana Network took place on 26 November. During this workshop we set ourselves the daunting task of ‘synthesising’ everything we learned from the previous workshops and bringing it all together into a coherent vision for the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We kicked the morning off by presenting the main findings of the previous meetings. We first looked in depth at what were perceived to be the main strengths and weaknesses of Europeana and checked if this group agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/0c58be2d-6a24-49af-81b7-454bb62f14a2.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 382px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most participants agreed that first and foremost, success has been achieved in the development of a strong Network founded on a very powerful idea: to make our heritage available, for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best examples of this successful cooperation are our ability to bring together an enormous amount of very diverse material from every member state in Europe, across every domain. Not only that, we have been able to standardise the data model (Europeana Data Model) through which we make it available so that it all becomes interoperable. Some noted that the model is still quite complicated, but all agreed that it is good to have our data modelled in ‘the grain of the web’ and available without any restrictions (CC0 - Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication).&nbsp; And that is what was mentioned as the biggest strength of Europeana: the capability to organise change in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussion also highlighted a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed. In particular the lack of focus that comes with a high degree of different expectations: the European Commission, the contributing institutions, end-users and creative industries all have their own wishes and these need to be harmonised into one single value proposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the day was spent on defining what that value proposition should be. We looked at Europeana from the perspective of all the stakeholders until a clear picture started to emerge. We concluded the meeting with a feeling that although there would never be agreement on every single aspect of the plan, there is confidence that the Europeana Foundation and the Network will continue to achieve real, meaningful change together in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcomes of this meeting were discussed internally at the Europeana Foundation and presented during the Annual General Meeting on 2 December in Rotterdam.&nbsp; See the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/strategy-2020-transcript-europeana-network-agm-harry-verwayen-2-december-2013?from_search=3\">presentation and full transcript</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>These are the main strategic lines: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Shift from Portal to Platform: 'Portals are for visiting, platforms are for building on'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means less focus on inviting individuals to explore their heritage in a pre-defined way on the europeana.eu portal, and much more on developing communities who re-use the data, content, knowledge and technology that Europeana and its partners make available for them. This shift is essential to enable a future that will be read-write, where you will be able to take, and give back, to your community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Improve Data Quality</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Changing the way we distribute our heritage is of course directly related to the quality of the material that we make available for distribution. While we will continue to collect all the material that partners make available, the Europeana Foundation will focus strongly on the quality of that data. This means all data in Europeana should have relevant descriptions, previews of reasonable sizes, accurate geo-location data, clear rights statements (preferably to allow re-use) and persistent direct links to the objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Support the Public Domain: 'What is in the Public Domain should stay in the Public Domain.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will continue to work with our contributing partners and other stakeholders to ensure that all digitised Public Domain material is freely available for re-use without any restrictions. In order to achieve this goal, the principles established by the Europeana Public Domain Charter and the New Renaissance report should be applied to all publicly funded digitisation projects in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Increase the amount of re-usable content: 'Open unless policies'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana will work with contributing partners on increasing the amount of material that is made available for re-use. We will work with these partners on promoting ‘open unless’ policies in the cultural heritage sector that ensure that digital content that is not subject to third party rights is made available under conditions that allow re-use. We will also work with distributing partners on making sure these conditions are not violated. We want to be a voice for the interests of publicly accessible libraries, museums and archives and their users and make sure they are properly represented on the European level during the upcoming copyright framework review. Our goal here is to keep the idea of shaping copyright agenda for the public good at the top of the policy agenda. This should allow provisions for non-commercial use, for example in education, and easier cross-border access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Improve discoverability: 'ensure that you can discover my culture in your language'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know that we won’t solve the problems of seamless multilingual access on our own. What we must strive for is that solutions are found which are sufficiently open source to serve civic society in the long run. We must not look just for short-term solutions. Again, this must be about the Europeana Network acting in concert to make sure that this perspective is widely understood in the public debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next steps </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these 5 recommendations were widely adopted by the Network, there remain two areas of work to be investigated before we can finalise this plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first one is about impact. What are the desired areas of impact of Europeana as a ‘catalyst of change’? While under the current strategic plan we are looking mostly at measurable outputs such as the amount of objects in the database, or the number of visits to the portal, this should change in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When can we say Europeana has made a meaningful contribution to the cultural heritage field? During the meeting, four areas of impact were suggested that require deeper analysis: our ability to innovate and standardise, the improvements in quality, our ability to reduce costs for institutions and our ability to change the distribution mechanisms in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, we need to gain a better understanding of how to capitalise on these services, in a way that is native to our business model, so that Europeana becomes less dependent from central EU funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you all to comment on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/your-opinions-needed-on-europeana-business-plan-2014\">our plans</a> and give your feedback. This will be taken into account when we start writing the final strategic plan for Europeana for 2015-2020.</p>"

Your ideas and concerns have all helped to shape the direction of discussions for the Strategic Plan 2015-2020 and for the first draft of Europeana’s Business Plan for 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would now like to ask you to review the Business Plan for 2014, as presented in the slideshow below, and to give us your feedback. Next year is an important one, it's a year of transition as we move from our existing strategic plan to a new one. Is there anything major missing? Do you agree with the direction we're taking, moving from a portal to a platform, and from a focus on aggregation to distribution? Do you agree with our 12 objectives for 2014? Do our Key Performance Indicators make sense to you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever your thoughts, positive or negative, please let us know by 17 December.

        posttype: Blog

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The third strategy workshop for the Europeana Network took place on 21 November. After workshops on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/who-should-europeana-be-serving-in-2020-and-how?\">Distribution</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/what-will-europeana-aggregation-look-like-in-2020?\">Aggregation</a>, it was ‘Facilitation’ that was on the agenda this time. What do we mean by 'Facilitation'? Well, it's everything between aggregation - the process of bringing material in - and distribution - the various ways of getting it out. This is quite broad so we started off by defining what the Facilitation team of Europeana does by looking at its successes and weaknesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/ecc2f853-ef46-4172-b5a1-0a794d38e378.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Discussions at one of the strategy workshops. Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe major success that attendees mentioned was last year's switch of all Europeana's metadata to the CC0 Public Domain Dedication Waiver last year. This was a big step for open cultural data in Europe and managed to set a standard for many institutions and other large initiatives like the Digital Public Library of America. This work has been essential in pushing the cultural heritage sector forward to where it is now.<br><br>\r\nDiscussing this move, it was clear that the shift has been of high importance, but has also taken an incredible amount of work to convince institutions that this was the right decision, and some institutions have become less willing to provide high quality data. There was also the question of sustainability and scalability. How can the best practices that Europeana sets be picked up by others and replicated?<br><br>\r\nThe second half of the workshop tried to answer the question, 'What should Europeana focus on in the next few years?' The participants agreed that Europeana should increase its policy work on a European level to push for copyright reform. This is still the main issue that concerns Europeana partners when deciding whether and how to make their data available online. The European copyright landscape is completely scattered and it is almost impossible to give 100% clarity on copyright-related issues. Other goals mentioned were: to make sure that material in the public domain remains in the public domain after it is digitised; and changing the mentality of institutions towards open access to their collections.<br><br>\r\nKnowledge sharing was also mentioned a lot during the day. Europeana is a pioneer and setting many good examples. However, these are not always shared in the best possible way with the Network. In almost all institutions, the same major issues occur when it comes to making their collections available. By sharing examples and solutions better, we can work more closely together and make sure the wheel is not reinvented over and over again. For this reason, we should look at sharing not only information generated by Europeana, but also at becoming a hub for other institutions to share their information, solutions and opinions for others to build on.<br><br>\r\nThe Facilitation workshop was the third workshop in a series of four. Although some clear directions for Europeana were drawn, no conclusions have yet been taken. We will look at the results of all our consultations and then define our goals for 2020 and our routes to achieving them. Stay tuned!<br></p>"

        title: 'Europeana celebrates 5 years and 30 million objects'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>This November, Europeana - Europe's digital library, archive and museum - celebrates two significant milestones - its fifth birthday and the arrival of its 30 millionth cultural object, two years ahead of the 2015 target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today Europeana brings together the online collections of 2,300 galleries, libraries, museums and archives from across Europe, through both its website and an API. This means that anyone anywhere from members of the public to those working in the creative industries can explore Europe's cultural heritage and build their own services, apps or games with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it isn't just about historical documents and old masters - the 30 millionth item to be available via Europeana is a delightful animation that won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2012. <i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026012/submission_2012_CA_43428_.html\">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a></i> is a story of people who devote their lives to books and books that return the favour. Morris Lessmore is a poignant, humorous allegory about the curative powers of story. The film comes to Europeana through Ars Electronica, an Austrian organisation that brings together art, science and technology, Kulturpool, the Austrian national aggregator, and the Digitising Contemporary Art project. Unusually for a contemporary film, the animation is available under a Creative Commons licence which means that it can be used and shared legally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?img_id=1973768&amp;t=1385393957244\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"City Map Item\" src=\"/files/blogimages/flying.png\" style=\"width: 702px; height: 398px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2026012/submission_2012_CA_43428_.html\">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a>’, Moonbot Studios, William Joyce, Brandon Oldenburg, made available to Europeana through Ars Electronica and Kulturpool, CC BY-NC-ND<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://archive.aec.at/#43428\">Watch the animation</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past five years, Europeana has become a driving force in the world of digital cultural heritage. The Europeana model was adopted by the Digital Public Library of America, and the organisation has become a global leader in areas such as open access. In 2012, Europeana created a watershed moment in open access when it released its entire dataset, 20 million items at the time, under a CC0 dedication, making all of its metadata freely available for use by all and reinforcing the importance of public domain for creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has also helped shaped how members of the public interact with their heritage online. Through the Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989 projects, thousands of people in 17 countries have been able to share more than 60,000 of their family items and stories online, creating unique pan-European perspectives of these two significant periods in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana's Executive Director, says,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><em>'Reaching our fifth birthday and the 30 million mark in the same month is really something to celebrate. We are at a turning point and hope to start to reap the rewards of the hard work that has gone into Europeana – thousands of organisations across Europe work together on everything from developing new content and technology to making sure that digital collections can be made available in a useful and uniform way. The Europeana Open Culture app shows what is possible with openly accessible, correctly labelled data. We are looking for more such creative uses of our cultural heritage. Our task now is to move from being an online portal to a global platform where anyone can use the data for their own developments and projects.’</em>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</blockquote>"

        title: 'Europeana signs Memorandum of Understanding with the BBC'

        intro: null
        body: "<p>On Monday 25 November, Europeana signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the BBC in London, UK. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/ca8d498e-a160-4804-a161-17e98e4454a8\">Read the MoU</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BBC signed four MoUs supporting free and open internet technologies with the Europeana Foundation, the Open Data Institute, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These agreements will enable closer collaboration between the BBC and each of the four organisations on a range of mutual interests, including the release of structured open data and the use of open standards in web development. One aim of this agreement is to give clear technical standards and models to organisations who want to work with the BBC and give those using the internet a deeper understanding of the technologies involved. The MoUs also bring together several existing areas of research and provide a framework to explore future opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach encourages greater collaboration with the wider industry and the development of new technologies and digital services that can bring additional benefits to audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is at the forefront of the open data movement. In 2012, Europeana created a watershed moment in open access when it released its entire dataset, 20 million items at the time, under a CC0 dedication, making all of its metadata freely available for use by all and reinforcing the importance of the public domain for creativity. This database has since grown to 30 million as the galleries, libraries, museums and archives continue to make their material more openly accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana’s Executive Director, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>‘Signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the world’s most respected broadcaster alongside the Open Data Institute, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation will help us all work to the common goal of opening up and standardising access to data, be it government, public archive or cultural heritage. We certainly want more people across Europe, indeed the world, to know about, work with and play with the contents of Europe’s museums, galleries and archives that are available online through Europeana. We are very much looking forward to working with the BBC to help achieve this.’</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>James Purnell, Director, Strategy &amp; Digital, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>‘Like Europeana, the BBC believes that online access to digitised cultural assets will become more and more important, and today’s MoU will provide a useful forum for an ongoing conversation about our ambitions in the digital space and I look forward to seeing the results.’</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>And like Europeana, the BBC has been publishing linked open data for some time, most notably as part of the /programmes service where machine-readable information about the programme schedule is made available online, or the successful Olympics Data Service which underpinned 10,490 athlete pages on the BBC sport website during the 2012 Olympics. Europeana’s linked open dataset can be found at <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu\">data.europeana.eu</a></p>"

        body: "<p>If you're involved in providing data to Europeana, or working with any of the Europeana projects, you've probably had to deal with documents and conversations full of terms that took a while to understand. We're surrounded by metadata, data models, APIs, end-users, data providers, the list goes on... But what do all these things actually mean?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, to help, we've put together a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/glossary\">glossary of agreed meanings</a> in conjunction with <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en\">Kennisland</a>. Please feel free to consult it, bookmark the page, or print it out and stick it on your wall, and please do use the terms as they are defined in the glossary. If everyone uses the same terms to mean the same things, then we're onto a winner! And don't worry, it's a fairly short list, not the Oxford English Dictionary (which contains approximately 230,000 words!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/glossary\">Go to the Glossary.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of dictionaries and the like, here's a fantastic illustration from Rev.

        intro: "<p>As an initiative of the Europeana Aggregation team,\_December 2013 will see the start of a Metadata Quality Task Force aiming to improve the quality of the metadata found in Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We at Europeana love metadata! It is our lifeblood, and we are proud to contain so many wonderful records from thousands of institutions across Europe. We love seeing our content used in lots of different ways from social media sharing to API calls to hackathons. None of this is possible without great metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good metadata tells us everything we need to know about a digital object, what it is, where it comes from, what it looks like, where it's housed, who gave it to us, how you can use the object, and more Everything you need to know for research or cultural window-shopping! And it looks a little something like this…</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?img_id=1970031&amp;t=1385036034209\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"City Map Item\" src=\"/files/blogimages/puckfair.png\" style=\"width: 1127px; height: 906px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of good metadata from RTÉ Archives and EUscreen. <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/09212/8B3B366338B97F1A6033208C0AEB8C0F71764DB0.html%20\">View the record on Europeana</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been a lot of work done over the last few years on a theoretical and technical level about metadata and Europeana, and we recently changed over to a whole new data model (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">EDM</a>) with metadata standards which allow our providers to give so much more to our audience! However, we believe that we should now look at the practical implementation and submission of good metadata quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an initiative of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-europeanas-aggregation-team\">Europeana Aggregation team</a>\_December will see the start of a Metadata Quality Task Force aiming to improve the quality of the metadata found in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregation is operation through which we harvest, process and publish all of Europeana’s data. We already provide lots of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/provide-data\">documentation</a> on what we require from our data providers. We ingest new records on a monthly basis and this number keeps on growing and growing. During the last five years, we’ve seen millions of records pass though our hands and uncovered more than a wide variety digital treasure. However, as the number of records increases it becomes more difficult for users to find a single individual record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solution to this is to improve the quality of the metadata submitted to Europeana. Meaningful titles and meaningful descriptions mean that a specific item is easier to locate, and that’s just the start of the improvements. The Metadata Quality Task Force aims to create a set of best practice guidelines for the creation of good metadata and to look at the restrictions facing institutions in the provision of this kind of material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll be inviting participants to join the Task Force shortly but if you have experience working with data providers and submitting metadata to Europeana, we’d love to hear from you!

        body: "<p>From 12 November-12 December, Europeana Fashion is hosting the online Europeana Fashion Challenge on Wikipedia. During this month-long challenge, participants are invited to edit articles related to fashion on Wikipedia with a chance of winning some great prizes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e8653071-b327-479e-8d1f-22106491ef9b.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>On a tour of the Nordiska Museet, venue for a Europeana Fashion edit-a-thon earlier this year. Photo Erwin Verbruggen, CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge welcomes both new and experienced writers to create, edit or improve as many fashion-related articles on Wikipedia as possible. As a source of inspiration and to enrich the articles with illustrations, writers can use contemporary and historical fashion images and videos from the collections of Europeana Fashion partners on <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion?uselang=nl\">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants receive points for creating new articles and expanding existing articles that contain one or more Europeana Fashion images. The prizes for the most studious participants are fashion books donated by Europeana Fashion partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Fashion%20challenge%202.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Editing Wikipedia articles. Photo by Erwin Verbruggen, CC BY-SA.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To kick off the challenge, three fashion edit-a-thons have been held around Europe: in Sweden, Italy and Israel. During these events, attendees were taught how to edit on Wikipedia. But you don't need to have attended one of these edit-a-thons to take part in the challenge - just sign up and start editing from wherever you are!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Fashion challenge is organised by Europeana Fashion, Europeana Awareness, Wikimedia Sweden, Wikimedia Italy and Wikimedia Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana_Fashion_edit-a-thons/Europeana_Fashion_Challenge/Participants\">Sign up for the Europeana Fashion Challenge</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing\">Learn how to edit on Wikipedia</a></p>"

        intro: "<p>There are many opportunities to learn and one of the most exciting is our workshop on 'How to make an app in an hour'.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Paul Manwaring from Glimworm IT BV.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 2 December 2013 in Rotterdam is about sharing achievements and expertise, discussing future strategies and developing new partnerships. There are many opportunities to learn and one of the most exciting is our workshop on 'How to make an app in an hour'. Glimworm is an award-winning web services provider - we developed an open source software platform - MUSE - and built the Europeana Open Culture app on it. We have also recently created the world's first open source Content Management System that publishes native iOS and Anroid apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/4cbaa53f-4325-4bd9-a1a3-41055722c92b.jpg\" style=\"width: 365px; height: 410px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our co-founders Jonathan Carter and Paul Manwaring will be on hand to demonstrate the rapid publication of digital content (apps) for tablets/smartphones. Using our software combined with the Europeana API, we'll show you how to 'do it yourself' and publish your own content or collection quickly and easily. If you have a WordPress website or blog we will even help you install Push2Press as a plug-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/P2P-graphic.jpg\" style=\"width: 446px; height: 503px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn about the potential of interactive apps and engaging audiences using best practices, open source software, open APIs, open data, crowd-sourcing, social validation, sharing, data enrichment and the power of 'Culture Connect' combining the Europeana API with node databases and other APIs such as WikiDB, Linkedin and Pinterest. If you don't feel brave enough or have the time to build apps yourself, you can also ask us for a quote to publish for you, provide training or conduct a workshop for your organisation tailored for your specific needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don't need to be a programmer or spend a lot of time or money to publish apps. Learn how to do it by confirming your workshop attendance to Gina.vanderLinden@kb.nl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to welcoming you on 2 December in Rotterdam.</p>"

        title: 'What will Europeana aggregation look like in 2020?'
        posttype: Blog

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On Thursday 14 November, the Europeana Network came together for the second of four workshops about the future of Europeana. This time we addressed the topic of aggregation of cultural data and content - that is, how Europeana collects and presents the vast amount of information that comes from thousands of Europeana heritage organisations. If we do it right, so our participants told us, we could even envisage a scenario in which we make it possible to 3D-print the Elgin Marbles so the originals can be sent back to Greece! Who was there? We welcomed national aggregators such as the German Digital Library and Erfgoedplus.be, domain aggregators such as APEx and EUscreenXL, and aggregation technology experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana today</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked the group to tell us what they think Europeana’s strengths and weaknesses are. Here are the top responses when it comes to aggregation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The amount of data</li>\r\n    <li>The network of cultural heritage institutions</li>\r\n    <li>The work on standardisation on a technical and legal level</li>\r\n    <li>The diversity of the available data.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Average quality of the metadata and therefore the discoverability of the content</li>\r\n    <li>Too much focus on quantity</li>\r\n    <li>No clear value for cultural institutions</li>\r\n    <li>No direct access to content</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>So that's Europeana now, but how do we want it to look in future? One thing was clear for all participants - in order to become the number one place for trusted cultural heritage, metadata quality needs to improve. By adding thumbnails, persistent links, good descriptions and clear rights statements, the end-user experience will improve drastically.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Four potential aggregation models</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Four different scenarios were created with various roles for Europeana. <img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/3d8dc669-9777-4a38-bf95-8d122162e1f8.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">Each scenario - Exclusive, Inclusive, National Aggregator Only and Cloud - is deliberately quite extreme to force people to think about both positive and negative aspects of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"line-height:1.15;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">In the ‘Inclusive’ model, everybody with a collection, European or not, would be able to submit data to Europeana. This model looks the most like the way we are working today. By lowering the barriers for joining, every institution, big or small, can benefit from the European infrastructure and connections. However, it also leads to many low quality datasets, which doesn't help the user experience.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">The ‘Exclusive' model only accepts institutions and data if they meet high quality standards. This would lead to a much easier to use database of content and data, but the down side is that many institutions cannot meet very high standards. The process of digitisation and making your collection available for the digital world is a difficult one, and by excluding the ones that still have a long way to go, you risk helping the ‘rich get richer, and the poor get poorer’.</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"cke_pastebin\">In the ‘National Aggregator only’ model, Europeana would cut down the number of data providers (currently around 150) and only work with a national aggregator in each European country. Every institution that then wants to publish their data on a European level would do so via their own national body. This would simplify the aggregation structure a lot, however, it would exclude some of the participating institutions, and also destroy the Europeana Network, which is one of the key assets of Europeana.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nIn the 'Cloud' model, Europeana would get rid of aggregators as we know them today, and focus only on connecting institutions to a cloud based infrastructure. This would make the process of publishing and updating data a lot easier and quicker. Once the infrastructure is up, it wouldbe fairly cheap to maintain and Europeana would help institutions convert their data to linked data to easily connect them with others. However, getting to this model will require huge investment and there are still many uncertainties. Also, National Aggregators currently do more than just aggregate. They are key in understanding the local situation and making connections with the cultural institutions. This is something Europeana would never be able to do on its own.<img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Workshop218Nov.jpg\" style=\"width: 592px; height: 740px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Concluding remarks</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The aggregation infrastructure is one of the most difficult, but also one of the most essential, things to do right. Before Europeana can bring the material of more than 2,000 institutions to a wider audience, the data must be of high quality so the material can actually be found and used for meaningful purposes. The aggregation model as it is now has worked reasonably well, but it is difficult to scale up. So how do we grow without sacrificing quality? This is something we'll be thinking about over the next few months as we work on the Europeana Strategic Plan 2015-2020. We have two more workshops to go, so stay tuned. And have a look at the Strategy Engine Room for more results and outcomes. We very much invite you to join the discussion and help us set the route to 2020. Allez!</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Rebecca Grant, <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/\">Digital Repository of Ireland</a> and Nuno Lopes, <a href=\"http://www.insight-centre.org/\">INSIGHT@NUIGalway</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Logainm.ie, the bilingual database of Irish place names has recently been enhanced by the Linked Logainm project by incorporating Linked Data. The newly available Linked Logainm dataset provides Irish place name data in structured, computer-readable formats for use by web developers, computer scientists, the heritage community, information professionals and more. The linked dataset is now ready for use by Irish information professionals in the library, museum and archives domains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project was undertaken collaboratively by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI), INSIGHT@NUIGalway (formerly the Digital Enterprise Research Institute), Fiontar at Dublin City University, the National Library of Ireland and the Placenames Branch of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht of the Irish Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as transforming the geographic Logainm dataset to Linked Data, the project team also developed the demonstrator website, <a href=\"http://apps.dri.ie/locationLODer/locationLODer\">Location LODer</a>. Location LODer is built on the Linked Logainm dataset and a map interface, allowing users to explore content and digital resources relating to locations across Ireland. Selecting a place name on the map loads the available content, sourced from logainm.ie, DBpedia, the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Maps collection, the Irish Historic Towns Atlas project and Europeana. Location LODer aims to demonstrate how Linked Data technologies can enhance the catalogues of Irish cultural institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of the Location LOder\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Location_LODer_cropped.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 589px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Europeana results in the Location LODer</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Location LODer gathers information using different SPARQL and Linked Open Data endpoints where available - namely Europeana and DBpedia. The <a href=\"http://europeana.ontotext.com/sparql\">Europeana SPARQL endpoint</a> is used to retrieve objects that might relate to Irish place names. When a specific place name is selected in Location LODer, the Europeana SPARQL endpoint is queried for any objects that contain both the selected place name and its county name as a ‘dc:subject’ and a ‘spatial’ property of ‘Ireland’. Results are retrieved in JSON format to be rendered in the appropriate section of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A similar approach is applied to the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/sparql/\">DBpedia endpoint</a>, however for this endpoint we rely on previously determined links that are included in the Logainm dataset. The MARC records for the National Library of Ireland’s Longfield Map Collection were enhanced to include links to the newly created Linked Logainm URIs, and this information is used to retrieve the maps relevant to the place name the user has selected. See our <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/nunoalexandrelopes/presentation-26782239)\">short presentation on the process of creating the Linked Logainm dataset</a> and the enhancing of the MARC records, which was presented at the First Workshop on Linking and Contextualizing Publications and Datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://data.logainm.ie/sparql\">Linked Logainm dataset</a> and <a href=\"http://apps.dri.ie/locationLODer/\">Location LODer website</a> were launched on 10 September 2013 by Jimmy Deenihan, TD, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht at the National Library of Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of the Linked Logainm team\" src=\"/files/blogimages/logainm2_cropper.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 266px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>L-R: Séamus Mac Giolla Chomhaill (Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht), Micheál Ó Conaire (the Placenames Branch), Dr. Sandra Collins (DRI), Fiona Ross (NLI), Jimmy Deenihan TD, at the launch of Linked Logainm.</i></p>"

        body: "<p>Only 17 days to go until the Europeana Annual General Meeting and Digital Strategies for Heritage conference (DISH2013) in Rotterdam (2-3 December)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agenda for the Europeana AGM has now been set. The day includes chance for existing Task Forces to get together, then for everyone to meet up to discuss the Network's progress this year and to brainstorm ideas for where we hope to be in 2020. There are also two inspiring lunchtime sessions: one thinks about a strategy for Europeana to positively impact education; the other teaches participants how to build an app in an hour - no technical experience necessary! <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/44e8d5ab-89e2-45ab-8fbd-8e54c66ebf6d\">Download the AGM agenda.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aimed at heritage professionals, DISH2013 is a lively and internationally-oriented conference focusing on three key themes: Active Audiences, Business for Creative Industries and New Competencies. The two-day event will consist of small-scale interactive sessions interspersed with inspiring keynote talks. The speakers and full programme can be found on <a href=\"http://www.dish2013.nl\">www.dish2013.nl</a>. The DISH conference also incorporates the Annual General Meeting for the Europeana Network, for which the agenda has now been announced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historian and filmmaker Jason Scott, Retronaut founder Chris Wild, publishing and media entrepreneur Mitchell Davis and head of Rijksmuseum Collections Taco Dibbits will be the keynote speakers at DISH2013 amidst a programme filled with workshops on topics like crowdsourcing for cultural heritage and social media for museums. There will also be a series of round table sessions called 'Chefs’ tables'. ‘The pain and pleasure of making interactive experiences’, ‘How to start wiki-related projects once you've convinced your staff’, ‘How to build a GLAM community’ and ‘How to survive as a 21st century photo agency’ are just some of the themes that will bring DISH2013 to life. The bi-annual conference is aimed at decision makers and key stakeholders in the field of digital heritage, but also at creative industry professionals wanting to learn more about the possibilities of digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Workshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 1 of DISH2013 will start with the Annual General Meeting for members of the Europeana Network. In the afternoon, four high profile open for all workshops will take place. The first session will address questions such as what new skills are necessary for creating innovative (digital) cultural and creative products and services based on Creative Heritage resources and what is the required mix of expertise in arts and humanities, technical applications and business development for this. The second workshop will focus on the Modeling Crowdsourcing for Cultural Heritage (MOCCA) project that aims to steer more effective crowdsourcing projects for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Two more workshops will focus on social media and creating an in-house lab for digital development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Image of happy Europeana Network members\" src=\"/files/blogimages/AGMforNovblog.jpg\" style=\"width: 376px; height: 500px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Participants in a workshop at the Europeana Network AGM 2012, Europeana, CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Chefs’ tables</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as keynote speeches and workshops, DISH2013 will introduce 15 ‘Chefs’ tables’ - round table discussions on various topics related to the three conference themes. The Chefs’ tables offer a platform for active sharing of ideas, an opportunity to openly discuss processes, collaboration, successes, problems, failures and learning points. This format encourages increased sharing of ideas, networking and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The discussions at the Chefs’ tables are led by 'digital heroes', people from within or outside the heritage sector with a distinctive track record in relation to (one of) the three themes. The atmosphere at the tables is open and relaxed, offering an opportunity to just listen or to actively engage in discussion on strategic choices in relation to digital heritage. The main points from the sessions will be shared via the social media, video, and live blogging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conference Venue</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>DISH2013 and takes place on 2-3 December 2013 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with the Europeana AGM hon 2 December. The conference venue is <a href=\"http://www.dedoelen.nl/nl/congressen/\">De Doelen</a>, close to Rotterdam Central Station. For more information and registration visit the website: <a href=\"http://www.dish2013.nl\">www.dish2013.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to The New Institute (Pepijn Lemmers) for this information about DISH2013.</p>"

        title: 'Who should Europeana be serving in 2020? And how?'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Blog by Wiebe de Jager, Europeana Marketing Manager.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The best way to predict the future is to invent it’, said Alan Kay in 1971. We agree and so we’re running four workshops to help define Europeana’s strategy for the period 2015-2020. Rather than passively reacting to the changing environment we’re all in, we want to proactively discuss and shape the future with our most important stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll try to define where Europeana is right now, where we will be in 2020, and how we get there from the present. There is no single right answer or route, so we’ll come up with different scenarios that bring together the various value chains, content strategies and business goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcomes of the workshops – one for Distribution &amp; Engagement, one for Aggregation, one for Facilitation, and a finalizing Synthesis session – should provide us with a shared vision for Europeana in 2020, something on which we can base the Europeana 2015-2010 Strategic Plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Sketch of Europeana strategic transformation 2015-2020\" src=\"/files/blogimages/9a4f5c21-1e2a-4556-833d-6e2d93483908.png\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 443px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Illustration by Business Models, Inc.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>First workshop: Distribution and Engagement – 7 November</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We started by asking participants to define Europeana’s strengths and weaknesses, and there was plenty of positive things to say: the Network has grown quite strong over the past few years; we’ve seen great results in setting standards for open data and licences for re-use; and the original vision behind Europeana – to get all of Europe’s cultural heritage online – still appeals to many people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are weaknesses too. Europeana’s brand recognition is quite low. The foundation suffers from a lack of focus, the quality of our data – our core product – is not always high. And the way Europeana is funded – mostly by projects – makes it difficult to initiate long-term change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Diagram of strategic activities of Europeana\" src=\"/files/blogimages/WiebeNov2.png\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 376px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Illustration by Business Models, Inc.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are ‘distribution’ and ‘engagement’ anyway?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To talk about distribution and engagement in a meaningful way, we all need to use the terms the same way. Participants were asked to write down what <em>to distribute</em> means to them in the Europeana context. Responses included ‘Getting stuff out’, ‘Enabling re-use for large and diverse audiences’, and the broader ‘Access to heritage for all’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding <em>engagement</em>, comments focused around what should happen once content is available: ‘make people click, share and comment on stuff’, ‘empower creative professionals’, ‘create the circumstances for meaningful audience involvement’ or simply ‘community’ and ‘participation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Vision for Europeana 2020</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants were then asked to create their own magazine for Europeana in 2020. What would be the cover story? And the big headlines? What would you read in the ‘financial’ and ‘interviews’ sections of the magazine?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This assignment really unleashed our creative potential. We saw headlines like ‘Europeana as a money maker for startups!’ ‘Access to global digital heritage through 4-dimensional APIs and augmented reality!’ ‘A unified Europe, thanks to Europeana!’ ‘A new ‘Europeana’ channel from Discovery!’ ‘Europeana providing cultural content to game developers!’ ‘The first really personal EUseum!’ ‘We opened up our content, and no one died!’ ‘Millions of volunteers, and a stable income from crowdfunding!’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Four scenarios for the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With 2020 in mind, next we came up with four business models that might work for Europeana: business to business (B2B), business to consumer (B2C), Europeana as an incubator, and a hybrid model. For each model, we highlighted the main value propositions, key activities, key partners, customer segments, customer relationships and channels, along with financials such as costs, resources and revenue streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the incubator and B2B business models, Europeana would become a platform for other parties to build applications and websites on, and in the case of the incubator provide those external business with the necessary content, tools and funding. Revenue streams might come from licensing deals, affiliate marketing or pay per use. However, creating a strong brand was considered more difficult in these models, and Network partners might not like the idea of Europeana making money from content deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The B2C model is the only one in which Europeana focuses only on end users, providing them with the portal and with apps and dedicated websites. In the hybrid model, Europeana would still serve end-users, but would also cater to the needs of other businesses or institutions, for example by providing a well-documented API as well as some inspiring examples of what can be done with Europeana’s content and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then went on to define the unique selling points and gaps that might help or hinder Europeana. The business models were positioned on a quadrant with one axis representing the ‘businesses’ or ‘customers’ continuum, and the other representing ‘building’ and ‘facilitating’:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Wiebe3.png\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 541px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image<em> by Business Models, Inc.</em></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Concluding remarks</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do we have the answer to where Europeana is heading? Not yet. No decisions were made and we weren’t asked to indicate which business model appealed most or seemed most realistic, and of course, we still have three workshops to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it’s interesting to see that three out of the four business models discussed focus more on ‘facilitation’ and ‘B2B’ than we do right now. Today, Europeana sits in the middle of the quadrant. So perhaps a move to more facilitation could be the direction we’ll need to take in the years to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See more pictures from this workshop and find out more about our strategy workshop series on our new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/strategy-engine-room\">Strategy Engine Room</a> page.</p>"

        body: "<p><i>We recently reported on the Digital Agenda's news that <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1937602\">getting more women into IT could boost Europe's economy by 9 billion euros</a>. Today, we're continuing that theme by introducing you to three of the women in technical roles within the Europeana Network - we asked them what they do and how they got there. Please share their stories to show more women that they can follow in their footsteps!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>First up, Vivien Petras, a Europeana Network member:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of Vivien Petras\" src=\"/files/blogimages/627116e6-6d6c-46e1-91f8-2a28452b9aab.jpg\" style=\"float: left; width: 99px; height: 137px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your job and what does it involve?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a professor for Information Retrieval at the Berlin School for Library and Information Science, <a href=\"http://www.hu-berlin.de/\">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>, Germany. My job involves researching aspects of multilingual access and interactions in information systems and their evaluation. I also teach and supervise students at Bachelor, Master and PhD levels in pursuing degrees (and then jobs!) in the field of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Did you always want to work in the digital world?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. When I got started, the World Wide Web was just becoming popular. I wanted to be not only a part of this environment, but also somebody who knows how to organise and manage information in all its forms. These days, that means working in and with digital technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you come to be working where you are now?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving my PhD in Information Management and Systems, I worked in a public service and research institution developing and evaluating portals for social scientists before becoming a professor. Working on applied problems as opposed to basic research shapes my research agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you have any advice for girls who are thinking about a job in the digital sector?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do it! It's one of the most exciting sectors to work in. Don't be afraid to not know something, you can learn it. Developments in the digital world are moving so rapidly, everyone has to learn new things and adapt constantly. That's the fun part. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Next up, Kerstin Arnold, Europeana Network member:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Kerstin%20Arnold.jpg\" style=\"width: 99px; height: 141px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your job and what does it involve?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I work on the Archives Portal Europe network of excellence (APEx) which builds on, expands and enhances the <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net\">Archives Portal Europe</a>. I am basically involved in most project activities from project management to technical planning and testing to standards definition as well as dissemination and training activities. This also enables me to act as the project's Technical Coordinator, as this requires having a solid overview of what is happening and what is planned in the different work packages of the project in order to best align these with the overall project plan. In addition, I am also leading one of the work packages that ensures that the Archives Portal Europe can act as a domain aggregrator for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Did you always want to work in the digital world?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first master's degree was in Communication Sciences, Theatre and Literature and the initial plan, if you want to call it that, wasto become a classic newspaper editor in the cultural sector. So, I started out with different jobs in Public Relations and online editing as a freelance. After some years, I decided to do some more studying, this time in Library and Information Management, which also included some general courses on HTMLand online publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you come to be working where you are now?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As my second masters degree was part-time, I had time to experiment with new domains for future working opportunities. One was at the Federal Archives of Germany, where I am now working for the APEx project, in publishing the commented minutes of the German Federal Cabinet meetings. This was my entry into the archives world and when I finished my studies, I simply got lucky that the Federal Archive had a new project starting at that exact time. That project dealt with a regional and thematic portal, but also used the international XML standards that the Archives Portal Europe is based on. The day-to-day work with these standards and the direct interaction with the software company, which at that time did the technical development, gave me the solid knowledge base that now forms the main part of my job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you have any advice for girls who are thinking about a job in the digital sector?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital sector is a broad field allowing for all different kinds of jobs and specialisations. Therefore, I think my main advice would be try to get some hands-on experience allowing you to get an overview as well as a look at the details to see whether your interest lies in technical aspects, in research and development, in dissemination of digital and digitised material, in supporting and training institutions on their way to the digital sector or in a combination of these. Although they only have a short lifespan, geting involved in a project with give you the best experience, in my opinion, because they usually combine so many tasks that it is possible to get a bit of everything, which might help in defining one's field of specialisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>And finally, we go back to the Europeana Office to meet Valentine Charles:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Valentine.jpg\" style=\"width: 99px; height: 149px; float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your job and what does it involve?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm working as a Data Research and Development coordinator at the Europeana Foundation. My role involves advising, sharing knowledge and communicating Europeana’s scientific coordination and R&amp;D activities to the network. I'm also more specifically coordinating the further development and adoption of the Europeana Data Model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Did you always want to work in the digital world?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No. When I started my studies, my initial wish was to work with cultural heritage as a librarian or archivist. I was really intimidated by technology and thought it was not for me. During my studies I got more and more familiar with various technologies and saw how they could be applied to the cultural heritage domain, which was my specialty, and how they could bring solutions to problems which couldn't be resolve in a more 'physical' environment</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you come to be working at Europeana?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first 'met' Europeana during an internship I was doing for one of Europeana’s sister projects, The European Library. I was then hired directly by Europeana after the completion of my masters degree, which was in 'New Technologies applied to History'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you have any advice for girls who are thinking about a job in the digital sector?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can only recommend it. I have seem schoolmates doing studies in humanities and then being afraid to switch to the digital sector. On the contrary, I think the combination of skills can be a real asset. It is a way to approach some more traditional sectors such as cultural heritage from a different angle. It is also a very dynamic environment which always brings new ideas, new challenges, nothing to get tired of!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>If this blog has inspired you to get involved in the digital world, check out <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/about/current-openings\">Europeana's current vacancies!</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Show your support for more women in digital jobs by tweeting with the following hashtags: #girlsinict, #girlsdigital, #womendigital </em></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Network coming of age'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i style=\"line-height: 1.48;\">By Henning Scholz, Europeana Network Coordinator.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since it first came into being, Europeana has sought to represent the views of its members. The first members’ grouping was called Thematic Network Members. In October 2009, the Council of Content Providers and Aggregators (CCPA) was formed to represent the voice of all institutions providing data to Europeana. Six members of this council were elected to the Europeana Foundation Board to represent the main cultural domains contributing to Europeana. In its first two years, the CCPA grew to include representatives of about 250 contributors to Europeana, not just content providers and aggregators. To accommodate these changes, the CCPA was transformed into the Europeana Network during the Annual General Meeting in December 2011 in Rotterdam. Since then, the Network has grown significantly, both in quantity and scope of sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have now reached a total of 800 Europeana Network members, achieving the goal set out in the Europeana Business Plan 2013 two months early. This great success is not just about numbers: the Europeana Network includes a growing number of active members that are engaged in Task Forces, the Aggregator Forum or the Europeana Tech community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Tech community is a very good example of the extension of the Network, taking it beyond content providers and aggregators while operating for their benefit. About 20% of the entire Network are scientists and researchers that collaborate with data providers, for example in Task Forces. The display of hierarchical objects in Europeana was designed in just such a Task Force, based on the needs of data providers. This new feature is now due to be implemented in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the increasing representation of the creative industries in the Europeana Network is becoming more and more important and demonstrates the value of content providers and aggregators opening up their data. The Open Culture app is a good showcase of this and more examples of creative use of the dataset are currently being developed in the Europeana Creative project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of participants at the 2012 AGM in Berlin\" src=\"/files/blogimages/9711e718-94ea-4fbb-a590-151cd3b71f51.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Network at the last AGM in Berlin (November 2012)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, the Europeana Network played a very important role in supporting the future funding for Europeana. The first part of the #AllezCulture campaign before summer 2013 was a great success. The petition launched on 21 June closed a month later with more than 7,000 signatures. On Twitter, we reached over 9 million accounts with about 4,000 tweets for #AllezCulture. This demonstrates the huge support Europeana has outside the office in The Hague. This also demonstrates that it is possible to raise your voice and make it heard, to shape the future of the sector – one of the main reasons to engage with the Network. One of the most recent members of the Europeana Network is Cosmina Berta from the German Digital Library who recognises the Europeana Network as ‘the perfect platform to share information and develop synergies and also to voice your views in a constructive way’. If you haven’t yet joined the Network, signing up is very easy, just fill in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/apply\">registration form on Europeana Professional</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/AGM2Oct.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Network at the last AGM in Berlin (November 2012)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now getting prepared to set the future strategies and plans of the Europeana Network in the Europeana Business Plan 2014 and the Europeana Strategic Plan 2015-2020. We have some ideas but need your opinions and suggestions. Let us know your thoughts by joining the discussion at our upcoming strategy workshops or by attending the Europeana Network AGM on 2 December in Rotterdam: <a href=\"http://dish2013.eventbrite.nl/\">http://dish2013.eventbrite.nl/.</a></p>"

In a short space of time, the Flanders Heritage Library developed into a respected supporting organisation. It succeeds in having highly different types of libraries (in museums, archives, monasteries, universities, public libraries...) work together. The communication is dynamic and uses the new media in an intelligent manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2012, the Flanders Heritage Library launched the user-friendly portal site <a href=\"http://mailings.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/t/r-l-ntidrkk-tydujihjlk-c/\">Flandrica.be*</a> with digitised materials from Flemish heritage libraries. It includes a fifteenth century red leather volume of mystical love poetry by Hadewijch, a first edition of Reynard the Fox and a collection of poems from 1981 by (then very young) Flemish writer Tom Lanoye. The site truly is a treasury, presenting valuable manuscripts or works by literary giants, but also song lyrics, cookery books and other everyday documents. By means of Flandrica.be, the organisation attracts attention to the added value and significance of digitisation, one of the great challenges for the entire cultural heritage sector. Making materials accessible in a digital form ensures that everyone, without limitations, can become acquainted with magnificent works from our history. In addition, it benefits the conservation of the original documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another commendable initiative is <a href=\"http://mailings.vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheek.be/t/r-l-ntidrkk-tydujihjlk-q/\">Boekensteun*</a> ('book support' or 'adopt-a-book'), a pioneering pilot project in which the Flanders Heritage Library, together with a number of partners, explores the possibilities of external fund-raising ('crowdfunding') in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Culture Awards Flanders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A jury of experts pays tribute to individuals or an organisation that in the course of the past season made a notable contribution to cultural life in Flanders. A cash prize of €12,500 is connected to the Culture Award. Each laureate receives the bronze statuette 'La ultima isla' by Philip Aguirre.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana used in Massive Open Online Course on Metadata'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>The School of Information and Library Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has recently run a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) called '<a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/metadata\">Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information</a>'. Several Europeana staff members from a range of teams were amongst more than 26,000 students to take this free course and were delighted to see Europeana used as an example by course leader, <a href=\"http://jeffrey.pomerantz.name/cv/\">Dr Jeffrey Pomerantz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henning Scholz, Europeana Network Coordinator, took the course and says 'It's great to see Europeana used in this way. The course has global coverage and to see Europeana held up as an example and used as an educational resource really reflects all the hard work that we and the Europeana Network have done in establishing the Europeana metadata repository.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Screenshot from the MOOC displaying the Europeana portal\" src=\"/files/blogimages/d7958073-88c8-47e3-ac2a-9e41333f73d8.jpg\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 406px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Jeff introduces students to the Europeana portal</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've been in touch with Jeff to find out how he came into contact with Europeana and why he thinks Europeana is a good resource for this kind of information science education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first things first, what's this course all about? As the course overview says, 'Metadata is an unsung hero of the modern world, the plumbing that makes the information age possible. This course describes how Metadata is used as an information tool for the Web, for databases, and for the software and computing applications around us.' The 8-week course used videos and demos to cover topics such as organising metadata, metadata schemas, Dublin Core, metadata for the web and for networks, and how to create and evaluate metadata. A great overview then for anyone working with digital cultural heritage!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now to meet the man behind the course, Dr Jeff Pomerantz. Jeff has a Masters in Library &amp; Information Science from Simmons College, Boston, and did a PhD at Syracuse University. He's been working at UNC Chapel Hill for 10 years. He has done research into digital referencing and digital libraries, so he's well positioned to teach people about metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how did he discover Europeana? Jeff says, 'Several years ago, I worked on a project to develop curriculum materials for teaching digital library-related topics, that could be used in both information science and computer science programmes. The Bologna Process was under way when that project was wrapping up, and some European colleagues and I thought that we should extend that curriculum work to span US and European programmes. Europeana was just getting started at that time, and some of my European colleagues were involved in it. From my early work with scholarly publishing - and from later experience of publishing under the US copyright regime - I was very interested in the idea of enabling access to cultural heritage on a large scale. Then the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) started up in the US, and I followed that work very closely, and of course the DPLA has modelled some of its operations on Europeana.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of an item in the Europeana portal\" src=\"/files/blogimages/course%20Europeana%20example.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 410px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A Europeana record used as a metadata example</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why you think it’s important to teach people about metadata? Jeff says, 'In the modern world, metadata is all around us, all the time, but we usually don't see it and most of the time, we aren't even aware that it's there. There's a lot of discussion (at least in the US) that programming should be a core skill that's taught in schools much younger, because so much of the modern world runs on code. I agree with that, and I feel the same way about information science: understanding how information moves is empowering. And metadata is foundational to information science, so I thought it should be offered as a MOOC, to introduce the subject to a wide general audience.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Screenshot of a quiz in the MOOC\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Course%20quiz%20q.jpg\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 401px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A quiz question using a Europeana and British Library record as an example</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why did you chose Europeana as an example? Jeff says, 'I used examples from both Europeana and the DPLA, first, because it allowed me to show 2 metadata records for the same resource: one from Europeana/DPLA and one from the owning institution. The Europeana records tend to be richer - that is, they have more elements with richer values provided. So metadata records from Europeana were very useful as examples, they allowed me to talk about things like metadata schemas, controlled vocabularies, and manually-created vs automatically-created metadata.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this course is now over, if you're interested in taking it, you can <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/metadata\">sign up to find out about future dates</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a></p>"

        title: 'Women could bring 9bn boost to Europe'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>A <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-905_en.htm?locale=en\">European Commission survey</a> on the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) industry says that getting more women into digital jobs would bring a 9 billion euro boost to European GDP as well as benefiting the industry and women themselves. But at present, out of 1,000 women with a degree, only 29 hold a degree in ICT (as compared to 95 men), and only 4 in 1,000 women will eventually work in the ICT sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron, wrote the first ever computer program in 1842 - even though the machine that could process it hadn't been built then! <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/a-day-to-remember-the-first-computer-programmer-was-a-woman\">Read a recent NY Times blog on Ada and women in programming.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her blog on International Women's Day earlier this year, Commissioner Neelie Kroes said that 'less than 30% of the ICT workforce are women! We should be doing everything we can to change that, and to encourage more women to access those opportunities. It's not just good for equal rights – it's essential to our competitiveness.' And in October this year, following the EC's survey, she said, 'We now know, beyond doubt, that more women in a business mean a healthier business. It is high time the IT sector realised this and allowed women a chance to help the sector and Europe's economy benefit from their enormous potential'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we couldn't agree more. And with a workforce that's just about 50:50 men to women, and with a woman as Executive Director, we believe there are great benefits to a well-balanced workforce. So, over the course of two blogs, we'll be introducing you to some of the women in technical roles who help make Europeana and its ecosystem run smoothly. Please share our blogs with your own teams and your younger sisters, cousins and friends. Let's show them that working with technology isn't just a job for the boys!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, let's meet Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana, Europe's digital library, museum and archive...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of Jill Cousins\" src=\"/files/blogimages/0ee99e0e-09ad-4c81-928b-5d25ba7c08db.jpg\" style=\"width: 596px; height: 368px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Have you always been interested in technology? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill: Yes, I think so. I breathed a sigh of relief when In the early '80s I could use a PC to create an MS Dos database to hold 4,000 Arabic and Turkish place names for my thesis on 16th Century Arabic and Turkish Seacharts. It meant I didn't have to re-type a whole page if I made a typo and I could start to make connections more easily. Since then, other than a brief sojourn as a Map Researcher for the UK Ministry of Defence, where things had to be handwritten in my already illegible hieroglyphics, I have always worked with computers and online communications tools. I am not interested in technology per se, I avoid gadgets and hate Tom Toms but I do like what it opens up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you get into working in the digital world?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill: Well, I've been working with digital technology almost all my working life. The Ministry of Defence more or less kicked me out because I was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and so I got a job as an 'Information Specialist' for a US Management Consultancy. They were involved in some very large-scale acquisitions and this was at the beginning of Dialogue, Datastar and Lexis Nexis - online databases giving you access to legal, financial and scientific texts and newspapers. So I acquired the 'skills' and left to set up my own research company delivering online research to those who couldn't search in these mysterious, keyword, set-combining, Boolean-logic-driven databases. I sold this company then to Disclosure, a UK branch of the US SEC filings delivery company. From here, I went to work in Oxford for the company behind Online Information where we acquired the rights to stage Internet World in Europe and from there into web publishing with VNU and then the Oxford Academic publishers (all web and online) before setting up The European Library and then Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why is it important to Europeana to have a good balance of men and women?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill: I think it's useful to have different ways of looking at the world in an organisation. I think it strengthens your understanding. I do know, although the mix was not the result of a conscious decision, that you have very different dynamics in predominantly male or female workplaces. The whole atmosphere can be different. I like the mix and I think it serves us well. I would like to see some more girl hackers and programmers - we've had a couple over the last 5 years, including my very first hire into The European Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Show your support for more women in digital jobs by tweeting with the following hashtags: #girlsinict, #girlsdigital, #womendigital </b></p>"

        title: 'Raising awareness of Europeana in Malta'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>By Annalise Duca, AcrossLimits Malta.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and PR agency, AcrossLimits, are running a campaign under the Europeana Awareness project in Malta. The main aim of this campaign is to invite the general public, as well as cultural and educational organisations and policy-makers to explore, learn about and use Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's how we engaged the Maltese general public...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media was thought to be an effective and relevant way to generate interest in Europeana in advance of and then alongside a more traditional media campaign. A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaMalta\">Facebook page</a> was launched as the start of the campaign. This page lets the public know what they can find on Europeana. Updates are posted daily and highlight resources found on Europeana. AcrossLimits contacted all key stakeholders on the island to inform them of the Facebook page and to ask them to join it and publicise it to their networks. More than 400 people are now following the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook page was also used to promote a campaign competition. The competition enouraged people to explore Europeana by asking them to find an image that means something to them and expresses our theme – 'Malta’s European Cultural Heritage'. The competition allows people to explore Europeana and to find out what types of resources they can find there. Image nominations are now closed and the next stage is for people to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaMalta/app_451684954848385\">vote for their favourite image</a>. Over 350 votes have already been cast and voting closes at the start of next week. The person who nominated the winning image will win a tablet and the image will be recreated by the public on a huge canvas at the Malta National Book Fair next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/b99d9f4e-106e-41b5-b0f4-40679c1765cb.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 234px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>One of the competition entries. The reason the nominee gave for choosing it was: 'This image shows the true colours of Malta, expressing a peace and tranquility that we transmit in our island.' © Heritage Malta</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside this social media campaign, a traditional media campaign has run in the press, explaining what Europeana is and promoting the competition and all other key factors of the campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campaign also took advantage of one of Malta’s key cultural events to promote Europeana and the competition elements of the campaign. On Saturday 5 October, AcrossLimits/Europeana had a stand at an event called the Notte Bianca. This event attracted 70,000 people and was a celebration of culture and the arts so it was a great opportunity to encourage the public to participate in the campaign, either by uploading their favourite Europeana image or by voting. As well as a huge turnout from the public, we also invited ministers and other key stakeholders to visit the Europeana stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Maltaevent.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 445px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Visitors to the Europeana stand at Notte Bianca</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another element of the campaign has focused on schools, allowing us not only to reach young people but more importantly to make schools and teachers aware of Europeana as a resource. We are running a separate competition for school students who are in Form 1 &amp; Form 2 (12 and 13-year-olds). Students are encouraged to find an image from Europeana and to write a short story about it. 20 stories will be chosen and will be part of an eBook to be launched at Malta’s National Book Fair later this year. The writer of the best overall story will also win a tablet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Maltastorycomp.png\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 422px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The banner used to promote the schools competition</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition was promoted to all schools in Malta through a key stakeholder, the Ministry of Education, as well as being publicised in a national school magazine aimed at this age group. Not only does this give the campaign and competition credibility for teachers, it raises awareness of Europeana with key policy-makers. Schools were provided with supporting information and publicity material as well as clear instructions on how to participate. Entries are now coming in and we look forward to the final e-book!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our work with schools encourages teachers and students to explore and use Euroepana as a tool for schools – however, since youngsters have always been exposed to Google, the way that Europeana works might be unfamiliar and even daunting to them. We hope that the competition might change their perspective and bring the younger generation and Europeana closer together!</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Saucy Salamander, the new version of the Ubuntu operating system (OS), will be released this week and includes the ability to search Europeana straight from the OS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until now, there has been a feature called 'Ubuntu Dash', which allowed users to search for things like applications, files and settings. This is now extended by the 'Smart Scopes' feature which broadens the search to include 100 external services. So now, users can search places like Amazon, Wikipedia, Flickr... and Europeana simultaneously. The user enters a keyword which Ubuntu uses to search all of these sources via a series of APIs. It then returns the results from all sources to the user as one results feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Screenshot from Ubuntu\" src=\"/files/blogimages/2025d171-ca84-46eb-bf6d-83f1bd155318.png\" style=\"width: 590px; height: 364px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To tailor the service to their own tastes, users can enable or disable each of the 100 services, filter the results by categories and even search only for Europeana results by using the prefix 'Europeana:'. If you want more information about a Europeana result (Ubuntu shows you the title, image and data provider's name), just click on it to go to the full item page on the Europeana portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Ubuntu2.png\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Péter Király, one of the developers responsible for the Europeana API, says, 'It's a really big thing for us that Ubuntu has included Europeana in its top 100 sources. And from a personal perspective, it's really exciting - this is the first time an operating system has contained my own handiwork!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more about Europeana and Ubuntu on <a href=\"http://kirunews.blog.hu/2013/10/03/europeana_in_ubuntu_13\">Péter's blog</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're a Ubuntu user and you have feedback on this development, you can provide it on <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/unity-scope-europeana\">the project's Launchpad page</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Hearing what project coordinators have to say'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>With 30+ projects going on at any one time involving thousands of people from hundreds of partner organisations across the whole of Europe, not to mention all the activity that goes on at Europeana HQ, it's sometimes hard to get a grasp on exactly who's doing what, where and more importantly, why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's why once a year we organise a meeting and invite project coordinators from all the Europeana-related projects. We call this get-together the 'Project Group Assembly'. The idea is that, rather than acting in individual silos, we share what each organisation/project is working on, and discuss how each can support the other as well as where our experiences, views and priorities come together or differ. It's also an opportunity to present useful tools, services and resources and to talk about where and how Europeana should be focusing its attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of Harry Verwayen demonstrating his skillz\" src=\"/files/blogimages/a3cce545-825b-4b63-9e4d-802a5eecb76f.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Harry Verwayen shows off his footballing skills during the get-to-know-you ice-breaker game!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Project Group Assembly 2013 took place on September 25-26 in The Hague with 50 representatives from Europeana and projects attending. Discussions and presentations were wide-ranging, from Europeana's future funding and strategy, working with creative industries and building a cloud infrastructure, to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>, intellectual property rights, sustainability and engaging audiences. The programme was interspersed with 16 five-minute project updates on topics like <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech\">Europeana Tech</a>, <a href=\"http://www.89Voices.eu\">89 Voices</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dca-project.eu/\">Digitising Contemporary Art</a> and <a href=\"http://www.daguerreobase.org/\">Daguerreobase</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what came out of these discussions? Firstly, the fact that the Europeana Network is an asset; between us, we have created a Europe-wide network that spans all the cultural heritage sectors, it's valuable and we should take advantage of it. Secondly, that Europeana can contribute to the visibility of cultural heritage in the cultural, education, tourism and gaming sectors. The group also saw opportunities and benefits for continued work on the aggregation infrastructure, data models and licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Project%20Group%20Meeting%202013.jpg\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Project Group Assembly in action.

We must work together as a network, support each other, talk to each other and make sure the network remains active and lively. That's how we create something sustainable. That's how we make Europeana an accelerator for the re-use of cultural heritage - a value proposition that will secure all of our futures in the face of funding changes ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>, <a href=\"http://www.project.efg1914.eu\">EFG1914</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dca-project.eu/\">Digitising Contemporary Art</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dca-project.eu/\">Linked Heritage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/\">AthenaPlus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.locloud.eu/\">LoCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/\">EAGLE</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu\">Europeana Fashion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-photography.eu\">Europeana Photography</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.daguerreobase.org/\">Daguerreobase</a>,<a href=\"https://www.prestocentre.org/4u\">Presto4U</a>, <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUScreenXL</a> and <a href=\"http://www.partage-plus.eu/\">PartagePlus</a> for your project presentations!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/europeana\">View all the meeting's presentations on SlideShare</a></p>"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Earlier this month, we welcomed Wiebe de Jager to Europeana in the role of Marketing Manager. In today's blog, Wiebe introduces himself...</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Photograph of Wiebe\" src=\"/files/blogimages/c9293715-c48c-45a1-9d2c-7148fcc1a2a2.jpg\" style=\"width: 470px; height: 470px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past eight years, I have been publisher and director of <a href=\"http://www.eburon.nl\">Eburon Academic Publishers</a>. During my time as a publisher, I developed a great interest in digital publishing, and in 2007 I started up <a href=\"http://www.eReaders.nl\">eReaders.nl</a> - a website about digital reading, attracting over 1.5 million users annually. Later on, I co-founded <a href=\"http://www.eLinea.nl\">eLinea.nl</a>, a ‘Spotify for newspaper and magazine articles’, which (re)launched on 24 September 2013. I also blog (in Dutch) for <a href=\"http://www.wrbl.nl\">Wearable</a> technology magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My educational background is in technology (electronics and mechanical engineering) and business administration. My hobbies are writing/blogging, tinkering with computers and high-end audio, and photography. I am also a bit of a social media aficionado, you can follow me on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wdejager\">@wdejager</a> or join my network on <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/wiebedejager\">LinkedIn</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that there are many opportunities for further distributing Europeana’s content from the various partners in innovative and engaging ways. The diversity of the content you can find on Europeana is really amazing, and I can think of numerous applications that could make use of this content, both in commercial and non-profit contexts. I look forward to working with the network to help Europeana evolve from portal to platform, thereby creating a sustainable ecosystem for the digital dissemination of our cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"oip_media\">\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"license\"><a href=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/media/22691\">Arnhem can telephone automaticly again</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/users/beeldengeluid\">Polygoon-Profilti (producer) / Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (curator)</a>, is licensed under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">Creative Commons – Attribution-Share Alike</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The video above is a news item called '<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021601/192F2D0D88F138C0ECB1E8A56A398E9F6A137E2A.html\">Arnhem kan weer automatisch telefoneren</a>' (1947). I like it because it perfectly displays how communication technology has evolved over the past decades. The switchboard and electronics your see on the still would now fit on a chip smaller than your fingernail. The impact of this kind of technology on society is enormous, and the speed of innovation only increases, so it will be interesting to see what will happen in the years ahead.</p>"

Wayne Clough, the Smithsonian’s 12th Secretary, surveys the efforts of many world-class institutions, including his own, to use technology to open their collections and programs to the world. He asks a fundamental question: 'How can we prepare ourselves to reach the generation of digital natives who bring a huge appetite-and aptitude-for the digital world?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secretary Clough’s thoughtful perspective as a museum leader, educator, and enthusiast provides invaluable insight into how digital technologies will radically alter our existing institutions, make access to their embedded knowledge widely available, and enable learning and research anytime, anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this introductory video about the book, Secretary Wayne Clough explores the Smithsonian’s digital journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GWvpBXoDN64\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find the book on the <a href=\"http://www.si.edu/bestofbothworlds\">Smithsonian website</a>.

        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana-photography.eu/\">EuropeanaPhotography</a> is a digitisation project playing a key role in ensuring that digital content related to early photography is accessible in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, Europeana has an impressive number of images mostly representing cultural objects while photographic images, the early ones in particular, are underrepresented. EuropeanaPhotography is filling this gap by providing the finest examples of 100 years of photography from 1839, with the first images from Fox Talbot and Daguerre, to the beginning of the Second World War (1939).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/698af99e-45a7-40db-865b-85a74badfdc2.png\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 383px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project runs for 36 months from 1 February 2012 to 31 January 2015. The project has now passed its midway point and to date has concentrated on content selection, digitisation and indexing. The next big milestone is to deliver more than 100,000 images with associated metadata to Europeana by the end of January 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/photographgun.png.jpg\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 423px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Armed Civil Guard in the street preventing a public transport strike (Plaça Espanya, Barcelona), Spain, 1933, by Brangulí, © ANC </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the project, it is hoped that half a million photographs will have been digitised and added to Europeana. All metadata describing the images will be translated into the 11 languages spoken among the partner countries; this enhances the visibility of the photographic collections supplied by the content providers. The content selection is done with the highest curatorial and management standards. Images will illustrate the history, people, and landscapes of European life in the 19th and 20th centuries, focusing on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Places: see the world as cities rapidly transformed in the 19th and 20th centuries and where time stands still in the records of geographical exploration.</li>\r\n    <li>People: the royal, the common, the famous, preserved in all aspects of life with details that had never seemed so real before photography.</li>\r\n    <li>Events: political, social, and conflict. Photography is now the key medium for communication.</li>\r\n    <li>Trends and movements: industrial revolution and invention, women’s emancipation and social change, artistic movements are all captured before, during and immediately after.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To support the consortium and to develop a safe and valuable environment for both public and private bodies, the project foresees very strong functions related to IPR issues and sustainability. Within the project, moreover, the commercial benefits of working with Europeana will be highlighted and clarified, in order to attract new content providers including those from the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/photography car.png.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 443px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>British racing driver John Cobb in his Railton Special racing-car.

The meeting was the occasion for partners to meet and discuss current hot topics that affect progression towards the project's second year objectives. The intermediate objective is to deliver a huge number of metadata records to Europeana, in order to publish a first batch of images that bear witness to the history of Europe and the art of photography in the period 1839-1939. To achieve this by early 2014, EuropeanaPhotography content providers are working closely to the technical deadlines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/photography people.png.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 473px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The EuropeanaPhotography partners in Vilnius, September 2013, photo by Vaidotas Aukštaitis</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Vilnius meeting was also an opportunity for partners to attend a training session on the use of the EuropeanaPhotography <a href=\"http://mint.image.ece.ntua.gr/redmine/projects/mint/wiki/Projects\">MINT tool</a> and the integrated multilingual vocabulary. Another strand of discussion was on the project's communication strategy and an exciting final event - a travelling exhibition to showcase recent history, art and photographic techniques, using masterpieces of photography from all over Europe, carefully selected to amaze the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more about the <a href=\"http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/vilnius-europeanaphotography-meeting/\">EuropeanaPhotography Plenary in Vilnius.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next calendar date for EuropeanaPhotography partners and followers, professionals and researchers is 14-15 November when a focused workshop about IPR will be held in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on the project, go to <a href=\"http://www.europeana-photography.eu/\">www.europeana-photography.eu</a> and follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EurPhoto\">@EurPhoto</a> on Twitter.</p>"

        body: "<p><i>Blog by Friedel Grant, Communications Officer, LIBER.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few months, the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a> project has been working to build an online browser that will display digital versions of historic newspapers. This tool aims to provide a simple yet effective way to search the 18 million digital newspaper pages that Europeana Newspapers will make available through <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ae680a25-0d82-49f2-80ee-e4ff1bde8101.png\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 626px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Screenshot from The European Library's newspaper browser - currently in development</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usability testing is obviously a key part of this work. That’s why the most recent <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/amsterdam-workshop-report/\">Europeana Newspapers workshop</a> in Amsterdam (held as part of <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a>’s annual conference) focused on what works and what doesn’t when presenting newspaper content online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The session started with an overview of some key usability principles, as outlined by Channa Veldhuijsen, a specialist in usability testing for the <a href=\"http://kb.nl/\">National Library of the Netherlands</a>. Her presentation emphasised the need for repeated user testing, since designers are often unable to spot problems with their own designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Channa said: 'All websites have problems and most problems are easy to find, if you try. If you don’t try, your users will tell you about these problems once you have launched the website. It is much easier to fix problems in the early stages of a project and it’s certainly better for your reputation.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/NewspapersTimarit.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 450px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Timarit, the newspaper browser from the National and University Library of Iceland, being presented.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To illustrate various usability principles, the session then turned to the new browser being developed by The European Library and the existing newspaper browsers of several major libraries across Europe:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ddr-presse/\">DDR Presse</a> (Berlin State Library)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/\">British Newspaper Archive</a> (British Library)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://dlib.si/browse/besedila\">dLib.si</a> (National and University Library of Slovenia)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://timarit.is/\">Timarit.is</a> (National and University Library of Iceland)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.eluxemburgensia.lu/R/RN=341843100&amp;local_base=SERIALS\">eLuxemburgensia</a> (National Library of Luxembourg)</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://kramerius-info.nkp.cz/\">Kramerius 3</a> (National Library of Czech Republic)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Newspapersbrowser2.png\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 419px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Screenshot from The European Library's newspaper browser - currently in development</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These sites were presented by the libraries, and then analysed by <a href=\"http://deanbirkett.name/\">Dean Birkett</a>, a User Experience Designer at <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about/staff\">Europeana</a>. His main points included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Choose a large font: 16px is the recommended size</li>\r\n    <li>Be careful of colours. Some online newspaper sites use red to highlight important information but red tends to be associated with warning signals and errors in the user’s mind</li>\r\n    <li>Similarly, some colour combinations do not provide enough contrast for those suffering from colour-blindness</li>\r\n    <li>Use words to indicate language choices (e.g. ‘English’, ‘Français’) not flags. The Spanish flag won’t necessarily be interpreted to mean ‘click here for Spanish’ if the user is from Mexico</li>\r\n    <li>Cut down on unnecessary text. Make it easy for users to skim (e.g. through the use of bullet points)</li>\r\n    <li>Be aware of jargon that makes it more difficult for users to understand how something works. If you run a site where users have to pay to view newspapers, for example, don’t refer to ‘credits’ without explaining what a ‘credit’ costs or how many ‘credits’ you need to view one paper.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about the work of Europeana Newspapers, and to see all the presentations and videos from the workshop, please visit the project website: <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">www.europeana-newspapers.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Guest blog by Nikolaos Marianos.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of September, the Natural Europe (NE) project will come to an end. The project, which started in October 2010, is a 3 year project co-funded by the European Commission under the ICT-PSP Programme. It aims to place museum visitors in the centre of an exhibition that is both physical and virtual. Using technology, services and learning content, the project provides personalised, appealing educational experiences, changing the way museum education is perceived and conducted worldwide!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During its lifetime, the NE project created a number of products to help achieve its aims. Its educational activities resulted in multilingual educational and cultural materials that can be used in educational pathways, reflecting the connection between formal and non-formal learning, and digital educational resources. Tools for the creation, annotation and publication of the educational pathways and the import, organisation and description of digital collections were developed and will continue to be available even after the end of the project. The Natural Europe project has made available around 120 educational pathways and 15,000 cultural resources, in 7 different languages. The resources come with enhanced high quality metadata available through 6 repositories, all of which are connected with Europeana and the Ariadne federation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img p=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/891ead85-1415-4f27-b9df-2cd6bf29899f.jpg\" style=\"width: 448px; height: 277px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Natural Europe project team. Photo: copyright Natural Europe</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NE also created educators’ handbooks to guide people through the implementation of the Natural Europe educational scenarios. The handbooks demonstrate how to search and retrieve digital library objects related to Natural History, Environmental Education, and Biological Sciences, and to provide educators with the necessary software tools to design innovative online pathways using digital collections of natural history museums (NHMs). It also helps them to encourage visitors to follow educational pathways and exploit high-quality digital content available in NHMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Websites of the participating NHMs were enhanced by 'discovery microsites', powered by cultural and educational content (e.g. the <a href=\"http://greenlearningnetwork.com/estonian-nhm/cultural/index.html\">Estonian Museum of Natural History cultural finder</a> and the <a href=\"http://greenlearningnetwork.org/natural-history-museum/edu/index.html\">Natural History Museum of Crete educational finder</a>). These microsites allow users to search and navigate through different digital cultural collections or educational resources and pathways through specially designed interactive interfaces. In addition, search widgets for both Natural Europe (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Natural-Europe-Project-Natural-History/108519365896509?ref=ts&amp;id=108519365896509&amp;sk=app_208195102528120\">Natural Europe widget</a>) and Europeana (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Natural-Europe-Project-Natural-History/108519365896509?ref=ts&amp;id=108519365896509&amp;sk=app_137541772984354\">Europeana widget</a>) have been created, both of which can be embedded in websites, social media, moodle installations, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/nh app.jpg\" style=\"width: 375px; height: 500px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A Natural Europe app in use. Photo: copyright Natural Europe</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the above, interactive installations were set up in museums as a means to enrich the visitor’s experience. These installations offer an enhanced virtual navigation through the museum’s collections. To this end, the interactive installations explore the local collection of the museum as well as the contents of the federated repositories and Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/nh int.jpg\" style=\"width: 375px; height: 500px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A Natural Europe interactive installation.

A series of dynamic and interactive creativity workshops and events, based on the Creativity Acceleration Platform, has been developed within the project, aiming at spurring creativity and fostering innovation on educational activities carried out within natural history museums. These workshops have been used to help both teachers and museum educators design their own educational pathways within natural history museums. The workshops also help families to define their educational needs within a natural history museum with the help of museum’s educators and to design their preferred educational activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Natural Europe project closes its life circle and leaves behind a legacy of tools, knowledge and educational experiences that will continue to provide new ways to explore museums.

        body: "<p>Last time we heard from the <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1542961\">EAGLE project on this blog</a>, they were just getting started. Six months in, we find out what progress they've made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EAGLE is a best practice network that brings together the most prominent European institutions and archives in the field of Classical Latin and Greek epigraphy (epigraphy = the study of inscriptions/epigraphs), to provide Europeana with a comprehensive collection of unique historical sources which constitute a veritable pillar of European culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3abd7c95-6570-410a-8a07-ea64d93f6ae8.png\" style=\"width: 377px; height: 231px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First things first, the project has a new logo. Put together with much thought, the logo represents, 'the plethora of inscribed material to be found among the digital content provided by the project partners' and 'strives to conjugate aesthetic beauty with a precise conceptual line'. The images used in the logo include Sappho, and Latin and Greek inscriptions. Find out more about the stories behind the imagery <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/the-eagle-logo/\">on EAGLE's blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/egl_logocontents.png\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 298px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the great new logo, EAGLE have also <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/eagle-website-debuted-in-tandem-with-the-project-tagline-a-digital-bridge-to-the-ancient-world/\">launched their website and project tagline</a> - 'A digital bridge to the ancient world'. The rich, detailed and intuitive website (<a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu\">www.eagle-network.eu</a>) contains all the information relevant to the project, including contact information, upcoming events and schedules, and a detailed description of partner institutions and their contributions. The tagline summarises the project’s ‘brand personality’ in a way that is aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may have seen several posts on this blog about 'Wiki Loves' photography competitions - Europeana has been involved with these contests for the past few years. EAGLE is now joining in too and is offering a special prize for the best photography of ancient inscriptions within the <a href=\"http://www.wikilovesmonuments.it/\">Wiki Loves Monuments Italia</a> contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roman cities were literally strewn with written messages of the most varied nature: monumental inscriptions resulting from an intervention by the central power to propagate a certain image of itself; inscriptions posted by private parties reflecting religious convictions, professional activities, and familial ties; graffiti and occasional writings, too often ignored by history books, which stand as testimony to the nature of everyday life in its humblest and most popular aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special EAGLE prize for Wiki Loves Monuments Italia seeks to promote the intrinsic testimonial value of inscriptions and to do so in such a way that this patrimony, which exists right before our eyes but often goes unnoticed, emerges and gains the visibility that it deserves. Find out <a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu/special-eagle-prize-for-wikilovesmonuments-italy/\">more about EAGLE and Wiki Loves Monuments Italia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, EAGLE is now active on social media so please follow them on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Eagle-Project/368159833278789\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eagle_Project\">Twitter (@Eagle_Project)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&amp;gid=4721635\">LinkedIn </a>and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/100976832846535223203/about\">Google Plus</a>.</p>"

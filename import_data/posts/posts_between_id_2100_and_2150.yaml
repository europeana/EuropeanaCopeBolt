                body: "<h3><strong>What is a GLAM Lab? &nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2006, Gregory Crane, an avid explorer of the ways humanities scholarship benefits from large scale digital libraries, asked the question <a href=\"http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march06/crane/03crane.html\">What Do You Do with a Million Books?</a> The expectation was that in the future, intelligent tools would transform the use of digitised materials by analysing and combining different objects for a reader’s benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With more experimentation with digital objects than ever before taking place in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAM) labs, we are now closer to this vision. Labs with various names (innovation labs, data labs, or simply labs), have started to appear across multiple GLAM institutions to meet the demands of digital content users.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The recently published book <em>Open a GLAM Lab</em>, introduced in this post for Europeana Pro, defines a GLAM Lab as ‘a place for experimenting with digital collections and data. It is where researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, educators and the interested public can collaborate with an engaged group of partners to create new collections, tools, and services that will help transform the future ways in which knowledge and culture are disseminated.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The word lab assumes that we have ingredients and tools which we use to experiment with different processes, and in doing this, create something new. It seems a bizarre metaphor for the GLAM setting where the ingredients are different digital objects, in many cases carefully and painstakingly curated. However, GLAM Labs are living up to their name. They use digital ‘ingredients’ (the objects) and the most advanced technological tools they can identify (or in some case develop) to distil the essence of digital content which the users of today are seeking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each lab is unique because the ingredients and interests of the users of digital content in different institutions are unique. However, these labs are also similar in their role as drivers of experimentation, innovation and digital transformation in their organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to aggregation projects, GLAM labs are another way that institutions can facilitate the reuse of large digital collections. Both of these approaches experiment with innovative delivery of content from large-scale heterogeneous collections but unlike the GLAM Labs, aggregators do not always offer physical space and dedicated staff to work on specific projects alongside users. However, they both address the issues around access to very large collections and suggest solutions to the 'million book' challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The GLAM Lab book&nbsp;</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The growing <a href=\"https://glamlabs.io/\">International GLAM Labs Community</a> is seeking ways to share experiences and support individuals new to the datafication of collections. The book <em>Open a GLAM Lab</em> was created following an innovative, five day <a href=\"https://www.booksprints.net/\">booksprint</a> with 16 experts. The event was co-hosted and financed by UCL Qatar and the Library of the University of Qatar with additional financial support from the British Library, the Library of Congress and Booksprints Ltd.</p>\r\n"

In this post, task force leader Kate Fernie shares the results of the year long project and the recent task force report. This post anticipates a series exploring 3D in the cultural heritage sector on Europeana Pro news starting in March and a focus issue of Europeana Tech Insight in the spring.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>3D content and Europeana&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Online, easily accessible 3D cultural heritage content is still less abundant than other media formats.&nbsp; Relatively little 3D content is currently accessible through Europeana. The aim of the 3D task force was to change this. We began by surveying the scene.&nbsp; Our first step was to carry out a review of the means that are currently available for accessing and sharing 3D content online. Next, we reviewed the current state-of-play amongst both Europeana data partners and more broadly in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We found that there is a good deal of interest in 3D but considerable variation in knowledge and experience. One of the challenges is that 3D is suitable for a wide range of different applications (from buildings and museum objects to works of art and gaming applications) for different audiences and a mixture of technical and audience factors need to be taken into consideration.&nbsp; The survey of Europeana data partners shows that there’s a definite need for training in this field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Adapting to a changing landscape</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 3D landscape is continuously evolving. More than 50 different file formats are currently in use for cultural heritage content. Amongst these, some are no longer current or not fully supported by their developers. The small group of international standard and de facto industry standard formats are the most relevant for Europeana and cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp; These formats are more suitable for archiving and are also easier to make accessible online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Formats are not the end of the story when it comes to making 3D content accessible online.&nbsp; Technical considerations about the hardware, processing power and software available to different audiences are important when deciding how to provide access to 3D content.&nbsp;Direct access to a downloadable file may not be the best solution. Visualising the content in a viewer or via an online service can offer end users a more satisfying experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently there are a small number of service providers offering hosting and visualisation services for 3D.&nbsp;Sketchfab has a reasonably large community of users and offers access to content via an embeddable viewer which is supported in Europeana Collections. Identifying similar hosting solutions and viewing software which large communities of use, and exploring ways of integrating these in Europeana Collections is a logical next step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Working collaboratively</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 3D task force built a network of contacts among 3D specialists, projects and initiatives working in this area.&nbsp; Our task force made a number of recommendations for Europeana in our report. One of the most important is a recommendation for this community to continue working collaboratively to improve standardisation, description, accessibility and interoperability of 3D content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Finally</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a brief summary of the work carried out by the 3D task force, and my impressions of areas where changes are coming.&nbsp; During 2020 I hope that we will begin to see new 3D content being made available to Europeana’s users and new initiatives sharing and exchanging knowledge about this exciting technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Rosy Wertheim&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the women represented on Europeana whose work enters the public domain this year is the Dutch composer&nbsp;Rosy Wertheim, who is known for her cheerful, playful songs. Wertheim taught at the Amsterdam Music Lyceum, but also worked, learned and taught in Paris, Vienna, and New York. During the Second World War, Wertheim moved back to Amsterdam and held secret concerts containing music from banned Jewish composers. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm6mbOLsxPg\">Explore Wertheim's compositions on YouTube</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/people/38003-rosy-wertheim.html\">learn more about her music on Europeana.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The structural bias towards male accomplishments throughout history has an impact on the content of our archives, our museums and our digital repositories of cultural heritage. Europeana, alongside other online repositories, and cultural heritage institutions who recognise this bias have been putting in work over the past few years to increase the visibility of female cultural heritage online - explore the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women\">WikiProject Women</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/womens-season\">Europeana's Women's Season</a> as examples!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. Stanley Kirkby</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our last public domain day highlight comes from the UK, from the spellbinding voice of Stanley Kirkby. Kirkby was a baritone singer who between 1900 and 1930 produced more records in Britain than any other artist. Many of his recordings have been digitised and can be listened to on Europeana, including the well-known tune of ‘<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2059203/data_sounds_532_1264_1191_1172_f_tmp.html\">It's a Long way to Tipperary</a>’. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/explore/people/31226-stanley-kirkby.html\">Find many more digitised </a>Stanley Kirkby records on Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did this inclusivity and diversity session go for you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tola Dabiri - It was an extremely good session with a very receptive audience. I had been quite concerned about how the session would be received as I believe I was one of only two people of colour at the conference. But it was great and I believe that there is a lot of enthusiasm to widen the network and meet the challenges that may arise from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Larissa Borck - I think the first big step was in fact that we had such a session at Europeana’s annual conference. This shows that there is a significant number of people interested in having this conversation - and the second big step was that participants actually showed up for the session and joined the discussion. So that was already a first success. The session was a starting point so that we strive towards a more inclusive and diverse Europeana community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the most important issue you think the session tackled?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TD -&nbsp; I hope that I managed to communicate that projects and reports alone will not increase diversity and inclusion, but that it is important to work with diverse communities so that barriers to access and participation can be identified and removed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LB - In my view, Tola and I had a lot of common points in our talks, especially when talking about potential hurdles for people to join networks such as Europeana. In order to lower the barriers in the way to become an active member of ENA, we have to identify the blind spots: who is not yet joining our discussions? Who do we leave out? We have to open spaces for these groups and listen to them in order to find out how the network might be exclusive to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>From your own experience, what would you recommend to continue this conversation?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TD - I think that it would be good to undertake a mapping exercise to understand the many ways that diversity is identified and described by Europeana members in different nations, and what work to increase diversity and inclusion has already taken place. I believe that this would lead to the development of a shared understanding across the network. I also agree with Larissa that this should involve diverse communities who are not currently engaged with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LB - It is a great first step to have a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">task force on new professionals</a> now, because it enables us to work on this topic. But it is equally important that this is not just the work of the few members of the group, but that we gather many different perspectives in order to not only include our experiences, but also those of a diverse range of people from outside of the network. If we just talk to those who are already members of our community, we will not be able to make our network better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What changes would you like to see addressed before the next Europeana 2020 conference?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TD - I would definitely like to see greater diversity, either from within Europe or from greater interaction with other international networks from across South America, Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, if this can be done in a sustainable, cost effective and eco-friendly way!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LB - Conferences can be a great way to get to know people who can help you on your transition from university to the workforce, but they tend to be expensive in terms of fees and travel costs. And when you’re there, it can be very hard to actually get in touch with the right people, because you might not know anyone. Europeana 2020 should therefore create possibilities for students and new professionals to take part; for example as a helping hand in exchange for free access to the conference or with a scholarship. The next point is helping them to get to know the community - having a conference buddy for example can help or creating a space dedicated for people to get to know each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more and get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of this Europeana 2019 conference session, we know that many of you want to continue to talk about inclusivity and diversity; explore what it means to develop an open, safe and accessible space to work; and share knowledge within the Europeana Network Association and its Communities. If you would like to shape these discussions, provide feedback, or tell us about your experiences, please join the <a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/4181566/join/pUNsw4GFxtv5\">Inclusivity and Diversity</a> community or <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu\">email your feedback to Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n"

Each event had its own unique way of engaging with communities, showcasing works and sharing knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many institutions worked directly with public domain content by releasing new works online or updating the online rights statement of works that entered the public domain; the <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/events/release-of-299-public-domain-works-by-the-german-national-library/\">National Library of Germany</a>.provides a good example. Some institutions organised remix workshops, and there were many social media campaigns around the importance of posting public domain works, such as this example from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23publicdomain(from%3AWikimediaPL)%20until%3A2020-01-31%20since%3A2020-01-01&amp;src=typed_query\">Wikimedia Poland</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other events included <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Women_in_the_public_domain\">Wikipedia</a> and <a href=\"http://sadik.goifnetwork.org/2019/public-domain-day-celebration-in-ghana\">Wikidata</a> edit-a-thons, conferences and presentations, <a href=\"http://publiekdomeindag.nl/\">as in this example from in The Netherlands.</a> A <a href=\"https://sadik.goifnetwork.org/\">photowalk in Ghana</a> where people took photos of buildings whose designs are in the public domain, was another innovative way to celebrate the public domain! We also saw <a href=\"https://www.wikimedia.at/ausgezeichnet-freies-wissen-hat-seinen-preis/\">award ceremonies</a> which recognised people who have contributed to improving access to open information and public domain material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Dutch example: a step-by-step guide</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Public Domain Day in the Netherlands is organised by a <a href=\"https://www.opennederland.nl/OpenProjecten/werkgroep-publiek-domein/\">working group</a>, which is already looking ahead to 2021. Our year-round activities, which start in the spring, go through several steps to help GLAMs identify works in their collections that enter the public domain in the upcoming year. They also help us to plan a celebration of the public domain in January. If you work in the cultural heritage sector and would like to work to make your public domain collections available, or organise an event to celebrate the public domain, the model provided below is a great place to start!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spring</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the spring, we begin by looking for potential makers and authors whose works might be about to enter the public domain. We work with institutions to help analyse their archives and look through their collections for artists who fit this criteria. <a href=\"https://w.wiki/GRu\">Wikidata</a> queries is especially useful for this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Once we have selected the artist we want to explore, we review their Wikipedia page. Wikidata can be used in other ways too - Belgium has made a query to search for the locations of artworks from a single artist, in this case James Ensor. <a href=\"https://w.wiki/3T9\">Try the query yourself</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To raise the understanding of the public domain among GLAM professionals, we also organise a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/344968880\">public domain masterclass</a>, where we look at the basics of copyright, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-examples/\">creative Commons</a> licenses and <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/en/\">rights statements</a>. We conduct a <a href=\"http://diligentsearch.eu/diligent-search-tool/\">diligent search</a> of rights holders and start to determine the entry into the public domain of certain works using a <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/documentation/\">template </a>created by <a href=\"https://www.opennederland.nl/\">Open Nederland</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Summer</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In the summer we dig deeper to identify the works we will focus on. At Open Nederland we have developed a <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/documentation/\">public domain determination template</a> for The Netherlands. The National Institute for Sound and Vision uses its own <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/kennis/kennisthemas/gebruikers/auteursrecht/stroomschema\">flowchart</a> too, which is available in Dutch.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We also use the summer period to contact institutions that have artworks which will enter the public domain and organise speakers for our January event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

We consider the following aspects: is there someone that is knowledgeable enough to talk about the artist and/or the works? How big has the impact been in the past of the artist and/or his works? Why is it important that these works will be in the public domain and what is their relevance today?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We start promoting our January event through social media, newsletters&nbsp;and communities from other organisations. The hashtags #PublicDomain and #PublicDomainday have been an effective way to share information internationally.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We organise a masterclass to showcase and teach institutions different sharing strategies. We talk about updating metadata and rights statements on collection websites, mass uploads to Wikimedia commons and the use of commercial content platforms like Flickr, Youtube, Vimeo andSoundcloud.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Winter</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We support institutions in their last preparations before the artworks are shared in the first week of January and finalise preparations ahead of our event, which attracts around 60 to 70 visitors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">After the event we put together the photos and presentations of that day (see <a href=\"http://publiekdomeindag.nl/2020/programma/\">2020</a>). We also do a quick review - what went well, what could be improved, what is the measurable and immeasurable impact that we’ve made in the entire process? This information is then used to make new plans for the upcoming year.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Marking the end of the first year of the Time Machine project, a conference in Brussels last week outlined the exciting potential for the future of the initiative.

        body: "<p>Last week in Brussels, project partners and policymakers from across Europe gathered\_ for the final conference of the first phase of the <a href=\"https://www.timemachine.eu/\">Time Machine project</a>. Time Machine is a large-scale research initiative using the big data of the past to create a huge distributed digital information system mapping Europe’s social, cultural and geographical evolution across time.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been a partner in the Time Machine Project since its beginning. The data models, licensing, quality and impact frameworks which Europeana has developed over the last decade have provided an invaluable basis for the Time Machine Project to build on.\_Meanwhile, the research and development capacity of Time Machine will open up an exciting new phase in how Europeana can develop applications for heritage data. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gail Kent, Director of Data at the European Commission, opened the conference. She says, ‘The relationship of cooperation and complementarity between Europeana and Time Machine, as expressed in the statement of collaboration signed last year, will be beneficial for the future of both projects and ultimately for the future of the whole European cultural heritage sector.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Europeana’s\_ Executive Director and Vice President of the Time Machine Organisation, also highlighted the importance of the collaborative nature of the project in his presentation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He says: ‘Europeana and Time Machine share a vision of how the data that we have gathered about our shared cultural heritage over generations can be used to aid future research and innovation for the good of society. This project combines the very best of our knowledge and expertise to help make that happen.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference looked at the potential for Time Machine to result in innovative new applications of digital cultural heritage. For example, how new technologies will make it possible to engage students with cross-reality applications which deepen their understanding of historical events and help develop their critical thinking.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the conference on 17 February marked the end of the first phase of the Time Machine, it also looked forward to the future of the project and set out a 10-year roadmap\_ to achieve its goals. A key step is the founding of the Time Machine Organisation, a governing initiative to drive forward the project and ensure its sustainability through continued collaboration and dedicated projects in EU funding programmes, such as Horizon Europe. Over 500 institutions have now come together to form the Time Machine Organisation and <a href=\"https://www.timemachine.eu/membership-overview/\">institutions can continue to join</a>.</p>\r\n"

For example, how new technologies will make it possible to engage students with cross-reality applications which deepen their understanding of historical events and help develop their critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the conference on 17 February marked the end of the first phase of the Time Machine, it also looked forward to the future of the project and set out a 10-year roadmap&nbsp; to achieve its goals. A key step is the founding of the Time Machine Organisation, a governing initiative to drive forward the project and ensure its sustainability through continued collaboration and dedicated projects in EU funding programmes, such as Horizon Europe. Over 500 institutions have now come together to form the Time Machine Organisation and <a href=\"https://www.timemachine.eu/membership-overview/\">institutions can continue to join</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This post for Europeana Pro is a wake-up call to custodians of cultural heritage to think about the next platform – the 3D and 4D experiences of the nascent Mirrorworld. Built upon the first generations of online experience (the sprawling communication platform of the World Wide Web), and driven by the ubiquitous reach of social networks and online gaming such as Fortnite, the Mirrorworld will breach the glass ceiling of 2D experiences to draw us into a fully functioning 3D environment. Public institutions that manage cultural heritage for visitors, such as galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMS), are ideally placed to seed the spatial communications network that will drive the new platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a piece for WIRED, Kevin Kelly writes that,&nbsp;‘The mirrorworld doesn’t yet fully exist, but it is coming. Someday soon, every place and thing in the real world - every street, lamppost, building and room - will have its full-size digital twin in the mirrorworld. For now, only tiny patches of the mirrorworld are visible through AR headsets. Piece by piece, these virtual fragments are being stitched together to form a shared, persistent place that will parallel the real world’ (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/\">Kevin Kelly, ‘AR Will Spark the Next Big Tech Platform - Call It Mirrorworld’, Wired, 12 February 2019</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fascinating? Yes. Scary? Very. But what will this virtual global patchwork of human creativity mean for custodians of cultural heritage, the thousands of institutions scattered around the globe who together hold disconnected slivers of our shared history and globally distributed traces of our common artistic endeavor? How will all these fragments come together and be accessible through the looking glass?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Clearly for the Mirrorworld to ripen to its full potential there are several significant challenges to be surmounted. Ideally we will need digital prosthetics that offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/12702/six-degrees-of-freedom-6dof\">six degrees of freedom</a>&nbsp;(6DoF) which allow the body to freely move in three-dimensional space along the X, Y and Z axes as well as to change orientation between those axes though rotation usually called pitch, yaw and roll. Somebody has to model the world in 3D and&nbsp;every object in this world will need a digital twin. Will consumers be doing this themselves with tiny head-mounted, phone-equipped, or street embedded cameras, or will the data be flooding in from the long-established, world-wide commercial pixel-pushers, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Ingress, Facebook and other global giants? What role will the custodians of culture be playing in this evolving matrix, and what will their responsibilities be to the public?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the Mirrorworld, Kelly writes,&nbsp;‘History will be a verb. With a swipe of your hand, you will be able to go back in time, at any location, and see what came before. You will be able to lay a reconstructed 19th-century view right over the present reality. To visit an earlier time at a location, you simply revert to a previous version kept in the log. The entire mirror-world will be like a Word or Photoshop file that you can keep “undoing”. Or you’ll scroll in the other direction: forward. Artists might create future versions of a place, in place. The verisimilitude of such crafty world-building will be revolutionary. These scroll-forward scenarios will have the heft of reality because they will be derived from a full-scale present world. In this way, the mirrorworld may be best referred to as a 4D world’ (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/\">Kevin Kelly, ‘AR Will Spark the Next Big Tech Platform - Call It Mirrorworld’, Wired, 12 February 2019</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once these technologies have ripened, GLAMs can play an active role in perpetuating narratives of cultural heritage through digital enterprise. Leaders such as Europeana have already been promoting these kinds of initiatives. Despite the formidable challenges to be surmounted, it is up to custodians of cultural heritage to become proactive in building the Mirrorworld rather than to wait for third party actors to advance commercial interests with imitation culture, simulated histories, or made-up stories. As gatekeepers of cultural artifacts, GLAMs have the capability, the experience, and even the responsibility to tell their stories forcefully, accurately and in fully-functioning 4D.</p>\r\n"

As part of the project, DRI have been working to re-establish a national Europeana aggregator for Ireland, which was achieved in October 2019 by reaching<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/digital-repository-of-ireland\"> accredited aggregator status</a> at the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum meeting in Stockholm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the Europeana 2019: Connect Communities Conference, Executive Director Harry Verwayen’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-QHb7hkps\">keynote</a> celebrated the impact of the DRI as the new national aggregator working with the Europeana Network Association to improve capabilities in Ireland. He emphasised the importance of having, at national level, 'an organisation that unites all the energy that is in that country through the Europeana Network and how much that means to a country.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jacob’s Biscuit Factory Photographic Collection</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DRI has committed to adding 25,000 new objects to Europeana over the course of the project. Dublin City Library and Archives’ Jacob’s Biscuit Factory Photographic Collection became the first collection to be aggregated to Europeana from the DRI. Jacob’s Biscuits is one of Ireland’s most recognisable brands, with over 150 years of history in Dublin. The Jacob’s photographic collection of <a href=\"https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/7079jp801\">3,227</a> images provides glimpses into the working lives of Jacob’s employees in Dublin from the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. It also includes images of factory machinery, advertising displays and corporate events.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Any regular visitors to Europeana Pro will notice that it looks a little different today. That’s right - we’ve revamped our website and in this post you can find out all about the process we’ve been through, decisions we’ve made and what you can expect to find in the new Europeana Pro.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Why we’ve revamped Pro</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make it easy for busy professionals working in and around cultural heritage to find the information, tools and services most important to them. Europeana Pro makes it possible to do this and we are continually working to improve your experience on the website. In the new Pro, we have aimed to make it easier for you to:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Understand how and why you should share your collection data with Europeana</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Discover best practices and standards to improve the quality of your digital collections, making it easier for your audiences to use and reuse your content</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Find tools and services to support your work and digital skills</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Find out about and get involved with the amazing initiatives of the Europeana Network Association and its communities.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What we’ve done</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The changes that we have made to the website come from you - our website users and stakeholders. In early 2019 we met with colleagues from both inside and outside the Europeana Foundation to find out what kind of information you need in order to work with us. We created an information architecture that addresses these needs and tested it with key audiences. We have also updated the content and grouped it in ways that make it easier for you to find what you need and explore new resources.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How you can find the information that’s most important to you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Europeana Pro home page you’ll see three links at the top which take to you to three new areas of the site:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"/share-your-data/process\">‘Share your data’</a> provides five steps to help you prepare for sharing data with Europeana and\_find an aggregator to work with through this process. In this section you can also find information, guidance and case studies around our work on metadata, copyright, media policies and enrichment.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The <a href=\"/about-us/mission\">‘About us’</a> section provides information about our mission and the three expert organisations that make up the Europeana Initiative. This section points you to tools and services to support digital transformation in your organisation, regardless of whether you work in a museum, library, university, school or start-up. You can also find out about the projects and partnerships Europeana is involved in, explore selected events from the sector and find information on our governance, staff and careers.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The <a href=\"/network-association/sign-up\">‘Join us’</a> section tells you how and why to join the Europeana Network Association, a movement of over 2,700 cultural heritage professionals working together to transform our sector and meet the challenges of the 21st century. You can explore the Network’s expert communities, search and filter network members to find new contacts, and meet the Network Association Members Council and Management Board. Finally, you can view the Network’s Task Forces and Working groups and keep up to date with news and activities through the Documentation page.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of this new Europeana Pro is not the end of a process, but the beginning. We’ll work throughout 2020 and beyond to improve how we present our processes on the website. We’ll look to create and curate relevant tools and services which support cultural heritage professionals and institutions in their digital transformation. We’ll also work with the Europeana Network Association to improve the experience of our network and community members and with the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum to make it easier and more rewarding to share data with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Explore the new Pro</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe our revamped website will make your experience a better one, and we’ll continue working hard to make sure it is always improving. If you do have any comments let us know and we will aim to get back to you as soon as we can!\_<a href=\"mailto:nicholas.jarrett@europeana.eu\">Get in touch</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy browsing!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">In response to growing concerns about COVID-19, and to comply with recommendations from the Dutch authorities, the Europeana Foundation office at the National Library of the Netherlands in The Hague is currently closed. As an organisation that champions digital and a collaborative, networked approach, we’re making these elements the building blocks of our response to our changed working environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Working from home</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All Europeana Foundation staff are now working from home until at least 1 January 2021.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the majority of Europeana Foundation staff usually work from our office in The Hague, some work remotely from other countries, and we all work collaboratively with partners across Europe and beyond. So remote working, online communications and virtual meetings are all familiar practices to us. As far as possible, our operations will continue as normal but with staff working remotely rather than from a central office. Please continue to contact us using our online <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/office-employees\">contact details</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These unprecedented circumstances will of course challenge our working practices. We cannot copy everything we do in the office online and will need to be smart and creative in how we engage with each other while remaining socially responsible. As we explore new approaches to working remotely, we think it’s important to share best practices with our community and partners, and to learn from others too.&nbsp; You can look into our approach below or <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2020/03/13/advice-on-working-from-home/\">check out tips for working from home from Creative Commons</a>&nbsp;- a fully remote working organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Coordination</strong>: We have established a small team that coordinates messages to staff. We meet three times a week to evaluate the situation and draft communications.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Communication</strong>: For important all-staff messages, we use email. We are already used to video conferencing using Google Hangouts but are aware that long video meetings are exhausting so we will develop protocols and practices to run these better (e.g. by managing Q&amp;A sheets).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Socialising</strong>: The most obvious thing we won’t be doing in the next couple of weeks is dropping by each other’s offices or chatting at the coffee machine. We are thinking of new ways to socialise in the age of social distancing so we might<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-quarantine-socializing/608020/\"> take lessons from this article from The Atlantic</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>No work-related travel for meetings and events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have taken the decision to cancel our attendance at all physical events and meetings between now and September, and will not travel by plane until the end of September, including the Europeana Presidency event that was due to take place in April in Zagreb, Croatia. To minimise disruption to our partners and to our workflow, where appropriate we will conduct meetings virtually and hope to reschedule other events at a later date.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’re investigating new approaches that are less dependent on all being together in a physical place. Some of the things that we like to do, such as running workshops that use whiteboards and post-its to creatively think through challenges, might be hard to do online. But we welcome the idea that other possibilities such as running webinars, developing explanation sessions and using video means we can still be creative and collaborative. Who knows, some of these may even create new ways of working together for the future?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Coming together as sector - online</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we increasingly see the cancellation of festivals and events and cultural heritage institutions temporarily closing their doors, we need to do what we can to support each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, digital cultural heritage can play an important role. The cultural sector is a creative one and around the world, organisations are already finding ways to bring their collections and activities to people - wherever they are - via social media. For example, using the hashtags #MuseumFromHome, #MuseumMomentofZen, and #MuseumOnline. This <a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/leisure-in-times-of-quarantine-45325ae58bc3\">recent article from the Statens Museum for Kunst</a> provides some great inspiration! And of course, here at Europeana, we’ll continue to share our news and collections on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s support our sector by sharing these types of hashtags and activities with the Europeana Network Association via the #europeanacommunities hashtag.&nbsp;Together, we can help bring a little bit of culture into people’s lives in this challenging time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are monitoring advice from the authorities closely and will respond accordingly as the situation progresses. Any updates will be added to this post and clearly marked with the date of any change in procedure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming weeks we will also be collecting, curating and sharing knowledge and best practice for the sector - and how Europeana can support it&nbsp;- on Europeana Pro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course - we must all take every opportunity to look after ourselves and those members of our families, friends and communities who may need more protection and care than ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Climate change and cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All over Europe, people working in and around cultural heritage are aching under a new pressure: climate change. Rising temperatures challenge wooden panels as they shrink quicker than paint in drier air. Baroque artworks such as <a href=\"https://www.mdr.de/kultur/klimawandel-denkmalschutz-100.html\">the Altar of Cranach in Weimar</a>, which survived World War II, are now severely cracked. Pollution from traffic and industry causes acid damage to historic sites like the <a href=\"https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/20-global-landmarks-that-climate-change-may-destroy/65789\">Acropolis</a>, etching into sculptures and pillars which have stood for 2,500 years. Rising sea levels threaten to flood towns like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/11/17/venice-floods-threaten-priceless-artwork-history-unique-way-life/\">Venice</a>, endangering its artworks and architecture. Increased rainfall and rising ground water threaten <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/story/7wXhCxUFzBCsUw\">Edinburgh Castle</a>. Art managers, staff in museums, libraries and archives, scientists and cultural heritage lovers around Europe cannot but feel called to action against climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has the Europeana Network Association been addressing this issue?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In response to the threat climate change poses to cultural heritage and following an <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-transform-world-culture-barbara-fischer/?trackingId=S2ggqKgHR8Cod8%2BYsTV9Wg%3D%3D\">initial call to action</a> from Europeana Members Councillor Barbara Fischer, a climate call for action, supported by the Europeana Foundation, was realised at the Europeana 2019 Conference. It instigated breakout sessions to consider how best to pursue meaningful action and support a global paradigm shift to avert climate crisis.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana 2019 we also developed ideas for a social media campaign to reach out to Network members - and beyond - to call for the fulfilment of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement\">Paris Agreement</a>, to meet <a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\">UN </a>Sustainable Development Goals and demand immediate climate action from our governments, our institutions and of course from ourselves. Look out for this <a href=\"https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/q43dL11ynpHF9s6S2sYryXME\">campaign</a> &nbsp;- we hope to start in April but are mindful of the need to plan for changes to our schedule and people's priorities due to the spread of COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have also been working to develop a <a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/4181566/join/hKtDhbNYscVY\">platform</a> through which members of the Europeana Network Association can share information, agree on coordinated action and empower themselves to address this issue. We have begun a group on the web-based collaboration tool Basecamp which offers a space to chat and debate, share initiatives and collaborate. The first thing we achieved together was a practical guide to arranging events in ways that minimise their carbon footprint, reduce waste and raise awareness of climate change among their attendees. Find our <a href=\"https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/KAVuGhxGd1m9eq49p6ttAaZB\">green event tips</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming months we would like to work with you on a Europeana Network Association manifesto for climate action. We want this to be signed and shared by as many individuals and institutions as possible and handed over to the EU presidency of Portugal in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana has been supporting discussion and research on climate action, exploring the relationship between people and the natural world. Published contributions include a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/pollution-an-industrial-legacy\">gallery on pollution</a>, articles on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mixing-sustainability-and-cultural-heritage-with-tueuropeana\">sustainability</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/heritage-at-risk\">heritage at-risk</a>, and research on Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-s-carbon-footprint\">carbon footprint</a> and event sustainability at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2019-building-a-sustainable-event\">Europeana 2019 conference</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'ScannerBox: a free resource for 3D scanning'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The advent of 3D technology is bringing new opportunities for the cultural heritage sector, offering innovative ways to provide access to heritage for education, tourism, research and enjoyment. However, it also throws up new challenges - how best to embrace 3D given access to new technologies and the speed of technological change? In this post\_Dimitrios Darzentas, Research Fellow at the Mixed Reality Lab of the University of Nottingham, tells us about the\_3D ScannerBox, which was developed as part of the GIFT project and\_aims to provide a free resource for 3D scanning.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>3D scanning in cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation of content and artefacts is a key topic for the cultural heritage sector, whether for long-term preservation or to increase engagement and accessibility through the use of new mediums such as interactive and online exhibits.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D scanning is increasingly becoming a mainstay of major preservation and research efforts to support this drive. Scanning processes can use several different technologies, including laser sensing, structured light projection, or computer vision-driven photogrammetry to generate highly accurate 3D models of real-world objects. These 3D models can then be used for archiving, research and in engaging interactive exhibits. Disciplines such as archaeology have employed them successfully for decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, current 3D scanning technologies are often costly, both in terms of hardware and software investment and in time and skill requirements. This limits their use to those organisations that have the resources to obtain and maintain their own equipment and trained personnel or outsource the task to third parties.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ScannerBox aims to revolutionise this landscape by providing a free resource for individuals and organisations who are interested in employing 3D scanning for their own goals. The tool was developed as part of the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/\">GIFT project</a>, a Horizon 2020 project that brought together internationally renowned artists, designers, museum professionals and researchers to help museums create hybrid experiences. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/gift-project\">Read more about the GIFT Project on Europeana Pro.</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How ScannerBox works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ScannerBox uses the 3D scanning technique of photogrammetry. This technique uses photographs of real objects to generate photorealistic 3D models and as such does not require any hardware other than a camera – and any camera will do! In essence the process involves taking pictures of an object or environment from all possible (and feasible) angles, and then using photogrammetry software to generate the 3D models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While photogrammetry sounds simple, the knowledge and methodical use of appropriate photographical tools can make the process easier, scalable and much more effective for creative and professional applications. With that in mind, <a href=\"http://www.mixedrealitystorytelling.net/scannerbox/\">ScannerBox</a> offers essentially a workflow that, with a particular emphasis on the cultural heritage domain, aims to introduce readers to photogrammetry and guide them through all the necessary stages.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a one-stop resource that breaks down the necessary skills, demystifies the more esoteric computer vision aspects, outlines recommended equipment and software, and presents several successful case studies where the workflow was applied. The aim is to share the accumulated knowledge we have gained from using photogrammetry in several creative projects and endeavours and popularise the use of the technique by self-reliant individuals and organisations.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Introducing Europeana XX - Century of Change'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In this post, we explore Europeana XX, a new Generic Services project focused on the 20th century and its social, political and economical changes as documented in photographs, videos, and works of art.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Kicking off Europeana XX</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In early March, Europeana aggregators, cultural heritage institutions, technology companies, academics and researchers gathered for the official kick-off of a new project funded by the EU in the scope of the Connecting Europe Facilities program: ‘Europeana XX Century of Change.’ Representatives of 17 partner organisations from across Europe attended the meeting, hosted at the premises of the Project Coordinador <a href=\"https://beeldengeluid.nl/en\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> in Hilversum. During the sessions, participants had the opportunity to get to know each other, exchange ideas on the project activities and discuss the workflow and desired outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>About the project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX Century of Change</a> is conceived as a thematic initiative to explore the major factors which led to social change in Europe during the 20th century, by examining the relation of society with the state, private lives of individuals and technological advances.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By enriching Europeana with high-quality 20th-century content, the project aims to expand the range of 20th century content available on Europeana. Semantic enrichment and automated translation will also make the content more accessible and discoverable for all audiences. Editorials addressing a wide range of 20th century phenomena will be highlighted, showcasing compelling stories and unique heritage treasures in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this purpose, five experienced aggregators have joined forces for the project: EUscreen, European Film Gateway, Photoconsortium, Europeana Fashion and Judaica Europeana. Having provided more than 3.8 million records to Europeana so far, these aggregators and their networks of cultural heritage institutions represent Europeana’s largest sources of 20th century content. This project will add another 100,000 images and videos to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides enriching Europeana’s online collections, Europeana XX intends to foster dialogue and reflection by organising four ‘subtitle-a-thons’ and four pop-up exhibitions. These activities will address the topic of societal change in various contexts and with different focal points. They will reach out to a diversified audience of cultural heritage institutions, educators and researchers in the creative industries, as well as every European citizen with an interest in history and culture.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What’s next?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A team of heritage professionals and experienced storytellers will prepare Europeana XX-themed content for publication on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">europeana.eu</a>. Furthermore, several on-site activities are set to take place in the next 18 months around different venues in European countries. Keep up to date on the project through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Europeana Pro news</a> and through the communication channels of the project’s partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're interested in finding out more about the project please email Project Coordinator Johan Oomen at\_<a href=\"mailto:joomen@beeldengeluid.nl\">joomen@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month Dafydd Tudur, Head of Access and Public Programmes at The National Library of Wales, discusses the importance of understanding users, change at the Library and getting involved in Europeana initiatives.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your job?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was love that brought me into this profession! I had completed my doctoral research and wanted to live nearer my girlfriend, Elin (we’re now married and have three children). I saw a post advertised for the role of Project Officer and Editor to work on digitisation projects at the National Library of Wales. The first project that I worked on just happened to be on an aspect of my PhD thesis: the story of the Welsh communities established in Patagonia during the nineteenth century. I already had a passion for history, but this role opened my eyes to the way digital technologies could be used to share the collections of libraries, archives and museums, and how they can connect people with each other and the past.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I was recently appointed Head of Access and Public Programmes (January 2020), which extends my responsibilities to include the development of the National Library of Wales’s on-site and outreach services and programmes as well as digital access to the collections. The Library is going through a great deal of change as I step into the role. There has been extensive renovation work in the building over the past year and we’re now embarking on a project to establish a National Broadcast Archive for Wales. We’re also in the early stages of planning our next strategy, so it’s a particularly good time to be sharing new ideas and approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>How people create, access and use information has changed so much. For me, the challenge in terms of access and public programmes is to ensure that we continue to meet the needs of core and target users, while also pushing boundaries in engaging ways. The key is to build our understanding of those user groups, and for the flow of feedback and insight to drive a process of continuous improvement. Making these improvements can lead to a number of other challenges - technological, financial, cultural - but it is essentially about delivering value to users. Closely related is the challenge of articulating this value to stakeholders, and embedding impact practice into our work. As well as exploring ways of bringing this change to the Library, my favourite elements are meeting with users and hearing what they’ve discovered in the collections, and also sharing ideas and experiences with other organisations and cultural heritage professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I still feel quite new to Europeana Network Association. My first experience of Europeana came from leading The National Library of Wales’s contribution to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy project</a>, which began in September 2017. I remember feeling inspired at the project’s kick-off meeting at the Europeana office in The Hague, meeting the project’s other partners and learning about their collections, their cultures and their ways of working. I realised that Europeana is as much about community as it is about collections.\_I soon became involved in other Europeana initiatives: the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Impact Playbook</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-celebrates-european-heritage-by-collecting-family-migration-stories-all-over-europe\">Europeana Migration Collection Days</a>. Putting my name forward for election to the Members Council at the end of 2018 felt like a natural step for me - a great opportunity to become even more involved in this community, representing the Network’s members and continuing to contribute to Europeana’s initiatives.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am pleased to be co-chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community Steering Group</a> and much of my work as a Members Councillor will focus on the development of this community. Cultural heritage can make a difference to the lives of individuals and communities, and we need to be able to assess and articulate this impact. More generally, I will still be advocating open access and I’m becoming more interested in the work around inclusivity and diversity, while also continuing to promote and celebrate the wonderful range of collections and initiatives that can be found throughout the cultural heritage sector.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Crowdsourcing with Artists4All at the RKD – Netherlands Institute for Art History'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Thanks to crowdsourcing, researchers, experts and cultural heritage professionals from across the globe can now add to RKDartists&amp;, one of the largest art databases in the world. In this post, Edda Japing, Digitisation Process Coordinator at the RKD, tells us about the Artists4All app which makes this possible, and how crowdsourcing can be an important element in research.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>A huge artists database\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The RKD – Netherlands Institute for Art History - is the world’s most important knowledge centre for the study of Dutch art. The RKD collects, catalogues, manages and makes information around the history of art available for heritage, educational and research organisations, auction houses, art dealers and individuals. The RKD’s unique collections and databases are accessible to all via <a href=\"https://rkd.nl/en/\">www.rkd.nl</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RKD manages a number of databases including <a href=\"https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists\">RKDartists&amp;</a>, a repository containing detailed information about more than 350,000 Dutch and Flemish artists of all periods. Started in the 1990s, the database is an internationally recognised resource for art-historical research.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expanding and maintaining RKDartists&amp; up-to-date takes time and expertise, and is a considerable challenge for the RKD. In order to make sure that information is always relevant, new data must be constantly added and the literature section must list recent publications. A solution found by the RKD for this problem has been crowdsourcing, which allows it to benefit from external expertise. To facilitate crowdsourcing for the RKDartists&amp; database, the RKD developed the <a href=\"https://rkd.nl/en/about-the-rkd/coming-soon/news/745-artists4all-new-linked-open-data-application-to-allow-for-online-addition-of-artists-data\">Artists4All</a> app, which was launched in November 2019.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How does Artists4all work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Artists4All is an online application built using Axiell Collections, which permits changes to be made to the RKDartists&amp; database. Collaborators are given an account which allows them to log in to the application. If they use Artists4all to change the record for an artist, or add a new record, this change is visible on the RKD’s website within a quarter of an hour.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to ensure that database fields are used correctly and include proper references, all changes are checked by an editor at the RKD. If the change is approved, the altered record is retained, but if the editor rejects a change, then an archived version of the record is restored. The expert will be informed why the change has been rejected and be assisted with correct data entry, so with experience, collaborators will see fewer interventions from the editorial team. Visitors to the database know if a record has been modified by an external expert as it is specified in the database entry.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because RKD editorial checking concerns the form, not the substance of the data, collaborators have to meet certain criteria. All are experts in their field and employed by research and heritage organisations. Collaborators attend a workshop in advance about entering data into RKDartists&amp; and working with Artists4All.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The RKD manages and monitors, but the database is built up in a collaborative and dynamic way. In the next few years, the number of collaborators will be increased, with the intention that the RKD gradually gains experience with this method of working and the editorial process. Plans are already in place to extend this practice to other databases. This approach to crowdsourcing in research could provide a model to other institutions or projects with the same need to provide reliable information to users.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Linked Open Data</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the development of\_ Artists4All, RKDartists&amp; has also been made available as Linked Open Data via the\_ a service developed by the Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed (Dutch Digital Heritage Network), which is known as Termennetwerk (<a href=\"https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/knowledge-services/usable-digital-heritage/network-of-terms/\">Network of terms</a>). This offers a way for organisations to use data from RKDartists&amp; in their own collection management system.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process thus comes full circle for collaborating experts and heritage organisations. On the RKD website, they can click through directly to Artists4all to add information about an artist. Once changes have been saved and are visible in RKDartists&amp; on the website, the improved data can be used within their own or external systems via the Linked Open Dataset. The first organisation to use this process will be the <a href=\"https://literatuurmuseum.nl\">Literatuurmuseum</a> (Literature Museum) in The Hague.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your organisation is interested in contributing to RKDartists&amp; through Artists4All, or wants to learn more\_ about the set-up and functionality of the application, please send an email to: <a href=\"mailto:japing@rkd.nl\">japing@rkd.nl</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Artists4All has been developed with support from the Dutch Digital Heritage Network and <a href=\"https://www.mondriaanfonds.nl/en/\">Mondriaan Fund</a>.</em></p>\r\n"

Proposals for the call must address both objectives of content aggregation and use of innovative technologies.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the deadline of the\_2020-1 CEF Telecom call\_for all Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs) has been extended to\_<strong>25 June</strong>\_to give more time for applicants to prepare their proposals. The original deadline was 12 May. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/news-events/newsroom/cef-telecom-call-deadline-extended-to-25-june\">Read\_more about the extension.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Content aggregation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to content, applications should foresee aggregation of new, curated, high-quality content and rich metadata that have the potential for high audience engagement. Proposed actions should include the development of curated editorial formats which explore topics of European significance, including exhibitions, galleries and blogs. We recommend that all applicants consider the new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-new-europeana-collections-website\">entity-powered design</a> of the Europeana collections portal which makes it easier than ever to explore, discover and enjoy cultural heritage based on subject interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Innovative technologies</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Proposed actions supported under this call are expected to use innovative technological approaches and tools, such as automation of tasks using Artificial Intelligence (AI), language processing, machine learning, big data-processing, automatic metadata enrichment tools, and tools for regularly translated digital content and its application to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multilinguality and improved user experience of the Europeana collections portal remain a high priority for us. Therefore, we welcome proposals that envisage development of software solutions for detecting the language of either metadata or content for the 27 EU official languages, with particular demand for Czech, Bulgarian, Croatian, Latvian, Gaelic, Maltese. Other areas of interest are solutions for manual or machine assisted translation, validation of automatic translations, and activities targeting the correction of text resulting from OCR.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also interested in proposals that use AI for usage data mining and deliver metadata improvements to enhance the search and browsing experience on the Europeana collections website.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Special focus on 3D</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The call strongly encourages applications with a focus on highly accurate 3D models (such as monuments, buildings and museum objects). Please note that 2D representations (images) of three-dimensional real-world objects and embedding 3D content into PDF documents do not qualify as 3D for the purpose of this call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout last year the Europeana Network Association <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">task force</a> on 3D content explored the challenges and opportunities related to 3D cultural heritage. Take a look at their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/3d-content-in-europeana-task-force-review\">recommendations</a> to understand the current thinking around 3D (these are not a formal call requirement). In line with these recommendations, Europeana Foundation will welcome proposals that envisage collaborations between cultural heritage institutions, Europeana aggregators, projects and developers to identify best practices around 3D content and metadata. This could include proposals to increase standardisation to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of 3D content. Furthermore, we are interested in projects that will develop measures for 3D content quality.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also strongly encourage applications that offer solutions for uniform and consistent display of 3D objects, and recommend that such solutions support most common formats in use for representing 3D (as indicated in the task force recommendations) and allow the content to be streamed directly to a webpage using standard technologies such as WebGL, Javascript and the HTML5 canvas.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Integration with Europeana</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure compliance and the smooth integration of the project results in the Europeana Core Platform Service (CPS), proposals must conform to the relevant Europeana strategies, standards and frameworks including the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Content%20Strategy.pdf\">Content Strategy</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Publishing Framework</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications must ensure that any code proposed to be integrated in the Europeana CSP meets the requirements of the Europeana <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/europeana-dev-guides\">development guidelines</a>. If technology solutions are proposed for inclusion in the CSP and Europeana Foundation support is desired, then it is strongly recommended that all technical and user experience proposals are agreed in advance with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How to apply\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications should be submitted via the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2020-europeana\">European Commission portal</a> until <strong>25 June\_2020</strong>. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/sites/inea/files/cefpub/2020-1_europeana_call_text.pdf\">call text</a> and do <a href=\"mailto:milena.popova@europeana.eu?subject=Generic%20Services%20project\">reach out to us</a> if you would like to discuss a project proposal with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about the call, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-faqs\">please consult our\_list of FAQs.</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This page was edited 6 May 2020 to reflect the extension to the call deadline from 12 May 2020 to 25 June 2020.\_</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Europeana Copyright\_Community is one of the Europeana Network Association's six specialist communities. Explore their work plan for 2020.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Throughout 2020, the copyright community will support cultural heritage professionals navigate copyright in their collections, advocate for adequate institutional support around copyright, and contribute to adequate legal frameworks in their countries. It will do so by gathering and sharing information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/insights-from-the-europeana-copyright-community-survey\">survey</a> conducted at the end of 2019, participants identified “the lack of copyright knowledge among cultural heritage professionals and an absence of training opportunities” as one of their biggest challenges, followed by the “difficulty of identifying the copyright status of collection items”. Other issues raised by respondents were a lack of understanding on the particularities of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market, copyright when applied across-borders, the lack of institutional support in copyright work and a lack of coordination by libraries, archives and museums at national levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, the Copyright Community Steering group has identified three main areas where support for the profession would be welcome:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>When dealing with copyright in practice, for instance by clearing rights or doing the orphan works diligent search</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>When looking to adopt good practices around copyright within an institution, for instance by asking for adequate copyright training for staff or including copyright in internal workflows</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>And when getting involved in legislative and policy changes in their country, for instance throughout the transposition of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout this year, the Copyright Community Steering Group, with the help of the Copyright Community, will mainly focus on gathering relevant information around these areas and disseminating it. By doing so, the copyright community will also contribute to Europeana Foundation’s objectives around copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more by downloading the work plan below, and go to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Copyright Community page</a> to join the community.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>This is a challenging time for our sector. With cultural heritage institutions across the world temporarily shut, organisations are exploring new ways to promote their content in accessible and engaging formats, as people look to enjoy collections from their own homes. In this post we highlight resources, tools and ideas from Europeana and cultural heritage institutions around the world\_ which offer creative ways to share cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We've seen some amazing ideas and activities for getting audiences and peers involved and engaged in digital cultural heritage. The response from the cultural heritage institutions during this difficult time has been inspiring, and we want to share some of the ideas we have seen, along with our own, as suggestions below.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>If you’re looking for ways to engage\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Give audiences the opportunity to enrich your collections.</strong> Asking people to transcribe cultural heritage content offers them both an activity and brings them closer to collections online. For example, <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu/\">Transcribathon</a> is a crowdsourcing platform which encourages people to add transcriptions and tags to historical documents, while The Egypt Centre in Wales is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrKenGriffin/status/1244988890517209089\">looking for volunteers to transcribe auction catalogues</a>.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Encourage people to recreate famous artworks from their own homes.</strong> This has been a call to action from many cultural heritage institutions (check out <a href=\"https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-artworks-recreated-with-household-items-by-creative-geniuses-the-world-over/\">this article</a> from the Getty Museum) and people have been sharing their creations on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TussenKunstenQuarataine&amp;src=typeahead_click\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tussenkunstenquarantaine/\">Instagram</a> using #TussenKunstenQuarantaine and #BetweenArtAndQuarantine. The <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoghYourself Tool</a> helps people to recreate and share images of themselves as famous works of art - a perfect way to contribute to the initiative!\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Ask audiences to contribute their own experience.</strong> The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MuseumOrdinary/status/1240332896386375680\">Museum of Ordinary People</a> in the UK is inviting audiences to share their own experiences of life in the coronavirus crisis, while people can always <a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/\">contribute material from their own lives to Europeana collections</a>.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Offer virtual tours.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/masterpieces-up-close\">The Rijksmuseum</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IcomOfficiel/status/1244996369821110273\">Le Scuderie del Quirinale</a> have shared video tours of their collections, while the <a href=\"https://keukenhof.nl/en/nieuws/keukenhof-virtually-open/\">Keukenhof</a> gardens in the Netherlands are virtually open for exploration.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Our webinar - entitled ‘Europeana at Home’ - intended to bring together ideas, tips and tricks for working from home that had been shared through a dedicated organisational Slack channel. We were also keen to reach out to colleagues that might not be coping as well as others with the change in circumstances and to show they were not alone in finding this challenging. The webinar was curated by a small team at the Europeana Foundation (keep your eye out for an upcoming post to find out more about our work), and you can find out what was shared below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Virtual meeting etiquette</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With&nbsp;all our catch-ups now taking place online, we thought that sharing tips for running virtual meetings was a good place to start. We highlighted the important role that organisers play in online meetings through being an active chair and setting clear goals and structure for the meeting, as well as ensuring that they invite everyone to contribute. Julia, for example, likes to do a roundtable of everyone on a call at least once - to make sure that everyone has a chance to speak up, even if they are not sure when to. Everyone agreed on the importance of keeping virtual meetings shorter than we would in person and scheduling regular breaks in meetings over 60 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also noted that it’s trickier to understand people’s reactions in an online meeting - especially if we have to turn cameras off to improve the audio quality!&nbsp; Our tip; be patient and if in doubt, ask people directly. We can all be proactive checking colleagues who have been quiet for a while - they might be experiencing internet connection problems - and using the chat box to help express yourself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally - for a bit of humour if internet problems do become overwhelming - we referred our watchers to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redpenblackpen/status/1240685233399304193\">Teleconference AV problems bingo</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Working rhythms</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of ways to approach our new working patterns, and in our webinar two of our colleagues shared advice based on their own experiences, from trying to mimic the patterns of a normal working day, to experimenting with the new flexibility that working remotely offers us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gina - who just got back from holiday and had to fit straight into the working from home routine - recommended:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Get up and dress as though you were going to work</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Eat healthy and keep a schedule as usual</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Start early but know when to stop! Set office hours.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Have a hangout call (with video) with someone from the office at least once a day!&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Start free online training if you have a bit of spare time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fiona - who shared her experience from completing her PhD alongside other work- recommended:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Focus on productivity not presence (think achievements rather than time-spent)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Set core hours for work and/or when you won’t work</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Identify a clear goal for a short session (block time in your calendar for an activity if needs be)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Identify what and where works best for you</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Focus on achievements and the to-do list (start small and manageable)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Creating a workspace</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fiona also discussed the importance of creating a workspace at home and we picked up a few of the following tips from colleagues:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use music and sounds to help you to focus - Audible, Spotify, YouTube and Noisli are all great sources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If you have the room, try to assign one space for work and make it an enjoyable place to be. You could put up some inspirational pictures and even include some on your desktop - you can always check out <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">Europeana.eu</a> for inspiration!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">With this in mind - you might have to spend some time cleaning your office, space, or house so you can concentrate better. It’s not always procrastination!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking after your well-being&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also shared tips and tricks for well-being at and after work. These included:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Joining an online yoga class.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Moving around regularly while you’re working and trying to be active every day.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If you have gained extra time previously spent commuting, consider new ways to use this - catch up with family/friends over Skype, read a book, do an online course, cook creatively...</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We recognised the importance of looking after our mental health at this time, and thought that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-anxiety-mental-health-wellbeing\">this Guardian article</a> had lots of good advice.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get inspired by cultural heritage online&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, we shared some examples of inspiring places to find cultural heritage online!</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We would always recommend a browse through <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">Europeana collections</a> - two recent topical galleries on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries/toilet-paper\">toilet paper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries/washing-your-hands\">washing your hands</a> might be of particular interest!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Have a look at how people have recreated famous artworks from their own homes with the Twitter and Instagram hashtags <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GettyMuseum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">#TussenKunstenQuarantaine</a> and #BetweenArtAndQuarantine.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Explore nature through the <a href=\"https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/browse/collections\">Biodiversity Heritage Library Collections</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">And finally, we encouraged everyone to keep sharing tips on Slack, so that we can keep learning from each other.&nbsp; We understand that everyone is experiencing a range of challenges at this time - some may be obvious, and some may not be - so we encouraged everyone to reach out to someone if they were struggling with anything. We want to continue to support each other through the new situation we find ourselves in, and are keen to grow and develop more ways to help our colleagues to manage our changing world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTvhwEQBfpt9xVcKUTNG8fmiG1oeDXcmEyOYRIbMF1_RqwMx4oXpDlfLCDswJujpiKLef6B-vp6t8yZ/pub?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g7f3d578c7a_0_0\">Explore the full presentation</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Coming together in isolation - mobilising digital transformation in the face of COVID-19'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The cultural heritage sector faces an unprecedented challenge in the face of COVID-19. How can Europeana, as the initiative which supports the digital transformation of the sector, help? How can we mobilise our extensive community, put our platform of services to good use and work with partners to make a difference? Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, and\_Georgia Angelaki,\_Europeana Network Association Vice-Chair, share their thoughts.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>The shape of the challenge</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘Humanity needs to make a choice. Will we travel down the route of disunity, or will we adopt the path of global solidarity?'</em>\_<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">Yuval Harari</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epidemics have been a feature of humankind throughout history, radically disrupting the status quo. The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. We are more or less locked down at home, on a new ‘remote-first’ mode via Zoom, Hangouts or Skype. For the first time in a generation we are facing an immediate and almost unprecedented global problem, impacting our everyday lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, history also tells us that the human spirit prevails even in the face of such challenges. Indeed, the story of art and science through the ages provides encouragement as we remember that Shakespeare wrote King Lear and Isaac Newton developed calculus during their periods of isolation from the plague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is not to underestimate the very real challenges that our cultural heritage institutions everywhere are currently facing. Museums, libraries, theatres, cinemas and archives were among the first to close down, being among the most popular places for people to visit en masse, with severe consequences for their operations and income streams.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How we act now will help shape the entire sector’s response to the immediate challenges presented by COVID-19 today, as well as preparing us for the longer-term changes that will inevitably follow to create a ‘new normal’ tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Responding as a sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our individual and collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic will be critically important across the digital cultural landscape. So it is crucial that we work together as a community and with all of our partners across the globe to demonstrate the vital importance of digital culture in the midst of this crisis.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve all enjoyed the unprecedented spur of online creativity and storm of posts about digital heritage and art such as the popular Instagram account <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tussenkunstenquarantaine/?hl=en\">Between Art and Quarantine</a> which encourages people to recreate artworks in their homes (hat-tip to Culture24 who have led<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/vangoghyourself?lang=en\"> a very similar Europeana initiative</a> years ago).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are great initiatives, but behind them lies a serious issue. There is a vast field of untapped potential for digital transformation in our sector and the case for embracing this opportunity has never been clearer than today. However, it will require a strong, collective effort to bring this potential to fruition.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sector is large and diverse and post-crisis its new normal will now undoubtedly include digital practices as never before. We need to ensure that the divide between the digitally adept and the digital novices is not accentuated further during this defining moment.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the globe, institutions and organisations are already rising to the challenge of staying connected to their audiences through digital culture, using creativity and innovation. The Internet Archives’ National Emergency Library is one <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wxeya5/you-can-now-access-14-million-books-for-free-thanks-to-the-internet-archive?utm_content=dmfb\">notable</a> example here.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, there are a host of organisations making a valuable contribution. The Network of European Museum Associations has launched a <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/news/article/nemo/mapping-short-and-long-term-effect-of-covid-19-on-museums.html\">survey on the short and long term effects of the corona crisis </a>for museums - the <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/news/article/nemo/nemo-publishes-results-of-survey-on-the-impact-of-the-corona-crisis-on-museums-in-europe.html\">initial results of the survey have been published</a>, but museums can continue to participate until 17 April. Meanwhile,\_Culture Action Europe has launched a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/actforculture/status/1242813487983644672?s=20\">survey on recovery measures</a> in the sector. The data they will collect will be of vital importance in shaping even more effective support activities in the future.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is against this background that the Europeana Foundation has co-signed <a href=\"https://cultureactioneurope.org/news/effect-of-covid-19-on-creative-europe-and-the-european-ccs/\">a letter to the European Commission</a> with proposals to help cope with the impact of COVID-19 on Creative Europe and the European Cultural and Creative Sectors and we will continue to use our voice to advocate strongly for the sector.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana’s contribution</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that Europeana, whose core mission is to empower the sector in digital change, has a vital contribution to make in response to this current crisis, as well as in the longer term. As a Network, we are at the forefront of technological innovation. We have built close ties and broad expertise over the years in areas of online collaborative working, information sharing and engagement. And we are uniquely well-positioned to respond to the sector’s digital challenges, building on these foundations.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the moment for us to accelerate the digital transformation of the sector, designing sustainable digital strategies that make use of open source technologies, leverage citizen science and participatory approaches across our collections and digital resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the short term, we will support our sector by developing and curating online tools and services that can be of immediate use, such as webinars on topics that support capacity building. Equally, we will promote and contribute to the services offered by others. You may already see some of that activity in action. We will be building on it in the coming weeks.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the medium term, we will pool our resources and develop a comprehensive framework of activities that ensures our work reflects the challenges the sector will face as a result of this crisis. A crisis which has so quickly demonstrated the need for wide online access to culture. We will support institutions as they build their ability to share their collections online. We will showcase the importance and added value of digitisation, adoption of standards, best practice and common solutions that make that possible. We will make the case for open licensing that is so critical to catering for online educational and research needs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, Europeana and its Network will continue to work tirelessly as champions of the digital transformation of our sector, preserving the critical importance of our shared cultural heritage in society.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Working from home: How OF/BY/FOR ALL is helping us adjust our working practices'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We recently shared the results of an internal webinar we ran at Europeana with the aim of supporting organisation-wide remote working. In this post, we also want to share the approach that underpinned this webinar, and how the philosophy of OF/BY/FOR ALL is shaping our approach to supporting staff.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>The challenge</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For some people working from home is difficult; for others, a great opportunity. As offices around the world have been closed, we’ve been reading lots of advice about the best way to work from home, including from our colleagues at Creative Commons and the DPLA, who make working remotely the default.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working remotely requires different practices than working in person and we have been exploring ways to help our colleagues find approaches that work for them, bearing in mind that we are also living through a very challenging period. So at Europeana, we have been sharing tips and tricks for working from home through a dedicated Slack channel, and we wanted to explore other ways that we could come together as an office and share ideas on how to adapt to our new working reality.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our approach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past few months a small team at the Europeana Foundation have been exploring ways to refine and adapt our office-wide working practices and some of the challenges we experience with them. Our team is a small group of colleagues who are keen to explore different working practices and feel empowered to make the time to contribute.\_ We work on the principles of <a href=\"https://www.ofbyforall.org/\">OF/BY/FOR ALL</a>, a movement and non-profit organisation which aims to\_ help civic and cultural institutions around the world become of, by, and for their diverse communities. There are many ways to apply this, but we have started with using it to explore ways to support our own evolving organisational culture from our perspectives as participants, and champion a collaborative approach to developing ideas and addressing issues.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, we trialled a new internal presentation format of 30 minute explainer sessions held before our monthly office drinks. The idea for the session was to dedicate time in our schedules where the office could come together and hear about what our colleagues have been working on. Considering the recent events, our team decided to run an explainer session bringing together formal guidance from our management team with office-sourced tips and tricks on working from home.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\n<strong>Planning the session</strong>\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bearing in mind that what had started out as a format for in-person presentations was now going to be virtual, we set out a few design principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We started by highlighting the guidelines we received from the Senior Management Team, a useful reminder to everyone in our organisation is working to support each other\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We co-curated the slide deck, with everyone drawing a bit from our own experiences, articles we have been reading, and tips shared by our colleagues.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We’d keep it shorter than the scheduled 30 minutes, as we all learned quickly that back-to-back virtual meetings are pretty draining.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We also wanted to make it as easy as possible for colleagues to join the session, so we ran two - one on Friday afternoon, and one the following Monday morning.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What we shared</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindful that everyone is having a different experience, we looked within our team for personal recommendations we could share - reflecting the type of conversations we are used to having in our office. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/working-together-from-home-some-tips-from-the-europeana-foundation\">Explore\_the presentation\_in our article for Europeana Pro</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our learning</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Webinars, online presentations - whatever you want to call them - are new to a lot of us.\_ But we know that our sessions went really smoothly because we prepared; we scheduled a 60 minute run-through so we could agree on content, order and who presents what. We heard what each other would say, checked the logistics of who controls the slides, who documents the questions in the chat screen, and also importantly checked we would keep to time.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were buoyed by the positive feedback we got from our colleagues.\_ We shared the slide deck afterwards and encouraged everyone to keep sharing what they learn with each other through our Slack channel. And finally we thought about how we can share this experience with our Network of partners and professionals. We know that we’re all trying to find different approaches to connecting with each other, and hope that sharing this presentation can support others in doing the same. We’ll be working to refine, develop and grow our ideas on ways of working that are OF, BY and FOR our staff and communities, and hope to share more in the near future!\_\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Kicking off a summer of Europeana Sport'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>2020 was supposed to bring a summer of sport - the Tokyo Olympics, European football championships in cities across Europe, Wimbledon - but all of that is now on hold. But people’s passion for sport remains. And that’s why we bring you Europeana Sport - sharing the story of Europe through our sporting heritage in the past and the present.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana Sport explores how sport shapes our sense of self and our sense of Europe, through a variety of remarkable cultural heritage objects that showcase the geographic and cultural diversity of Europe. All of human emotion is exhibited in sport - pride, elation, despair, frustration. It is never ‘just a game’.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UPDATE 26 MAY 2020</strong>:\_ The Europeana Sports season which had been due to start over the summer will now begin a little later this year. And for good reason - a Europeana Generic Service project will be funded from September onwards, giving us more scope, resource and time, extending what was a summer season to an 18-month project. The new timeframe also means we can align more with sports events that will take place next year. Some of the planned activities will still go ahead this summer and there will be more to follow - keep up-to-date by following our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-sport\">Europeana Pro</a> page and #EuropeanaSport hashtag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to expect</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same way that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-14-18-centenary-tour\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration\">Europeana Migration</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work</a> gathered personal stories from the public, Europeana Sport will gather stories of our personal sporting activities and achievements and bring it together with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/114-sport\">archive material from museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not possible to run our physical collection day events this year, Europeana Sport’s online participation and interactive activities will encourage people to share their stories, memories and ideas about their individual and our collective sporting heritage in exciting ways. Look out for more details at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Sport editorials (blogs, galleries, exhibitions) will illustrate the story of our sporting heritage through a variety of remarkable cultural heritage objects that showcase the geographic and cultural diversity of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>‘Ireland, Ireland, together standing tall’</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's national aggregator for Ireland, The Digital Repository of Ireland, and five\_ partners - EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, European Expo2020, Hunt Museum and University of Limerick Sport - will run an online campaign inviting people across Ireland and beyond to share their sporting memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Be part of our Europeana Sport team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The season presents a wonderful opportunity for you to engage with and expand your audience by getting involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Sport’s collaborative approach helps you to engage with existing and new audiences, highlighting the impact of sport and sporting heritage on the communities, societies and people of Europe. By getting involved, you can empower the digital transformation of your institution.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite Europeana’s network of cultural heritage partners to be part of our season and help bring our shared story to life.

        title: 'A Dutch-language tool for exploring and assessing digital maturity'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In this post, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bart-magnus-557b384\">Bart Magnus</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.meemoo.be/\">meemoo</a> (the Flemish Institute for Archives), explores the concept of digital maturity in cultural heritage organisations and tells us about a tool developed for the Flemish Department for Culture, Youth and Media that helps institutions assess it.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Flemish Department for Culture, Youth and Media asked <a href=\"http://www.meemoo.be/\">meemoo</a> to develop an easy-to-use online tool that Flemish cultural heritage organisations could use to assess their digital maturity. Meemoo, the result of a merger between PACKED (the expertise centre for digital heritage in Flanders), VIAA (the Flemish Institute for Archiving) and Lukas (an online image bank of works of art and heritage from Flemish collections) launched the tool in January 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool is intended for a broad range of cultural organisations from libraries and museums to performing arts organisations, cultural centres or socio-cultural organisations. It was developed to provide cultural organisations with insights into their digital maturity in relation to other organisations’ self-assessments, to prioritise actions towards improving their digital maturity, and to capture information on a sectoral level to feed future Flemish cultural policy actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is digital maturity?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do you define digital maturity? In exploring this field, we came across divergent approaches to deal with the subject. Some focused on the digital skills of individuals, others were more oriented towards the organisation as a whole. Inspired by our research into existing approaches and models, we defined five aspects of digital maturity to take into account in our model:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How do you deal with digital evolutions in your organisational strategy? Do you think strategically about digital aspects within your organisation?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How do you use digital applications to improve the interaction with your target groups?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Can digital products or services provide added value within your organisation? How do you deal with this today?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Digital maturity is not only a matter of tools, but also of people. Do you succeed in getting the right capacities in-house to achieve your objectives?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How do you organise the digital processes within your organisation?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to make clear that being digitally mature does not mean doing everything digitally. A sign of digital maturity could also be when your organisation deals with digital evolutions in a well-considered way and applies them where useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Taking the assessment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool presents 47 statements in five categories that organisations have to rate themselves against.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organisations can either use the tool anonymously or after registering. Registering brings some important advantages, namely that they receive tailor-made explanations that make the statements more concrete - explanations for museums differ from those for orchestras or libraries, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registered users can also make a selective comparison by filtering results according to subsector, FTE, year of foundation and/or yearly budget. At the end of the result page, users are directed to resources that can help them to improve their organisation’s digital maturity.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first year of existence, the website was visited about 1,700 times by 1,275 visitors and 51 accounts were created. Meemoo counted 115 completed sessions (19% by registered users) and 247 partly completed sessions (8% by registered users).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tool is primarily intended for Flemish cultural organisations, but anyone who can speak Dutch can use it. Explore the tool at <a href=\"http://www.digitalematuriteit.be/\">digitalematuriteit.be</a>.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<h3><strong>When, how and why was the Dutch Copyright Working Group created?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A predecessor of the group was created around 2009. It was established to stay up to date with legal developments concerning mass digitisation initiatives by cultural heritage institutions (CHIs). Around that time in the Netherlands, in order to clear copyrighted works to make them available online, digitisation pilot projects were being carried out which made use of new Extended Collective Licensing-like (ECL) contracts with Collective Management Organisations (CMOs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 2011, this predecessor was transformed into a (larger) informal national copyright working group. It now consists of 20 people from CHIs who deal with copyright in their daily work, including several lawyers. They come from archives (including the <a href=\"https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/\">National Archives of the Netherlands</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">Netherlands Institute for Sound &amp; Vision</a>), museums (including <a href=\"https://www.eyefilm.nl/en\">EYE Film Museum</a>) and libraries (<a href=\"https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/\">Leiden University Libraries</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/\">National Library of the Netherlands</a>).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once every two months, we strive to meet face-to-face at a different ‘member’ institution, where we are given an introduction on its copyright matters as a start to the\_meeting.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you find are the benefits of addressing copyright issues across sectors?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries, museums and archives have common interests, and joining forces definitely gives our copyright lobbying more weight. Moreover, European copyright law with its exceptions for cultural heritage institutions also treats us as one group, which makes cooperation logical.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Does the group engage with policy makers?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we do. For public consultations on copyright, our group prepares model submission texts which can then be commonly submitted by umbrella organisations of libraries, museums and archives, and individual CHI’s. Our current efforts are mainly focused on the Dutch implementation of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM) Directive</a>, and when the government published the public consultation on this topic, we followed this process. It helped several institutions feel ready to engage and also submit comments.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us more about discussions on the Directive in the Netherlands.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A subgroup with representatives of umbrella organisations of libraries, museums and archives went to the Ministry of Justice (responsible for copyright and the Directive implementation) and to the Ministry of Culture to discuss the CDSM bill. The consultation submission we prepared was carefully studied by the Ministry of Justice, and several comments were taken on board. CHIs have formally been recognised as one of five stakeholder groups the Ministry of Justice talks to in this process. Thanks to that, we were able to have a say on confidential versions of the implementation bill which the Ministry sent to us.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the most relevant provisions in the Directive, we are also raising themes like the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s Out Of Commerce Works (OOCW) portal, and we are making a plea for Dutch legislation enabling web harvesting to enrich our collections. Libraries, museums and archives will also join upcoming stakeholder dialogues on OOCW and Text and Data Mining (TDM). The Ministry of Justice is now preparing to commission a separate research into our plea for a legislative solution to enable web harvesting of online copyright works to preserve Dutch internet history.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What other activities do you do as a group?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A subgroup of our Working Group is now developing a copyright decision model (for the <a href=\"https://www.netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/en/about-us/\">Dutch Digital Heritage Network</a>) to enable CHIs to assess the copyright status of works in their collections so as to decide whether and how they may be put online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also discuss sensible action in case a CHI receives a copyright claim, and we closely follow copyright lawsuits against CHIs. We share this information in a closed online platform.\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course we strive for a Dutch implementation of the CDSM Directive which optimally benefits libraries, museums and archives.

        title: 'Bringing 3D into Digital Invasions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The advent of 3D technology is bringing new opportunities for the cultural heritage sector, offering innovative ways to provide access to heritage for education, tourism, research and enjoyment. However, it also throws up new challenges - how best to embrace 3D given access to new technologies and the speed of technological change? In this post, we hear about how Invasioni Digitali (Digital Invasions) - a crowdsourcing initiative which aims to promote the value of and engagement with local heritage - has made 3D a feature of ‘invasions.’</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About Digital Invasions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy has 4,908 museums, archaeological areas, monuments and ecomuseums. In one Italian municipality out of three (2,311) there is at least one museum: one for every 50 sq km and one for every six thousand inhabitants. But despite the progressive diffusion and application of digital technologies in the museum world, in Italy only one museum out of ten (10.4%) has created a digital catalogue of their content. Only one third (37.4%) has already completed the digitisation process, while two thirds have begun these activities but have covered about 50% of the goods and collections available\_(Source Istat, ‘L’Italia dei musei 2018’).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.invasionidigitali.it/en/\">Invasioni Digitali</a> was born to respond to such a situation, with our first event taking place in April 2013.\_ Social and digital communication are the key to the invasions: ‘invaders’ are bloggers, amateur archaeologists, artists, photographers, Instagrammers, communication experts and members of the public, all with the same desire to promote their cultural heritage through social media. They support Italy’s cultural institutions by ‘invading’ them with cameras, smartphones and tablets and share their cultural experiences through the web and social media. To date, over 2,500 invasions have been organized - including one at <a href=\"http://mariannamarcucci.com/EN/a-digital-invasion-at-the-europeana-connect-communities-conference.html\">Europeana 2019</a> - and about 50,000 people have been involved across multiple countries. Nearly 52,000 pictures on Instagram and over 100,000 tweets with the tag #invasionidigitali have been shared.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#InvasioniDigitali has become a popular example of users’ involvement and proactive participation in co-creation, sharing and dissemination of cultural content, creating new forms of conversation about arts and culture and helping to make cultural heritage open, welcoming and innovative.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Bringing 3D into Digital Invasions\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The creation of virtual replicas has become an important emerging area within cultural heritage: 3D models can become a bridge between original artwork and people from different backgrounds. They can be particularly valuable for people with visual impairments, allowing a ‘Don’t touch’ sign to be replaced with an invitation to touch the art. 3D technology can help recreate pieces of art to help everyone enjoy them.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D #DigitalInvasions was a pilot experiment that took place in Sicily in 2015. We involved engineering students from Palermo and Catania Universities in planned invasions in the Antonino Salinas Archaeological Museum (Palermo) and the Archaeological and Naturalistic Park of Santa Venera al Pozzo in Acicatena (near Catania). Students created 3D digital replicas of several archaeological works. They used image-based techniques to obtain 3D textured models of an object, sourced from an appropriate photo dataset taken from cameras, smartphones and tablets. The 3D models were then given to the involved public administrations.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During these first two 3D Digital Invasions editions we developed the belief that our approach could also be applied to other sectors of cultural heritage, using technology to spur innovation in museums. We were also interested in exploring how students were able to develop a sense of identity and affiliation to the cultural heritage they worked on. They spent a lot of time capturing the images, giving them the chance to observe, study and understand a piece of art, rather than quickly take a photo and pass to another. This approach aimed to allow them to be personally involved in a specific process to create user generated content and increase an artwork’s cultural value in its own context.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have continued to run 3D digital invasions with a focus on student participation. In early 2019, the Faculty of Architecture of the Sapienza University of Rome also joined the #InvasioniDigitali 3D, and organised a workshop around the theoretical foundations of photography and digital photogrammetry. These techniques were then used for photography of the sculptural collections preserved in the Museum of Classical Art which is part of the University Museum System.\_ The models obtained by students at the Museum of Classical Art, are <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/sofia.menconero/collections/museo-dellarte-classica-sapienza\">available through Sketchfab</a>. We also ran a 3D digital invasion with students from the ‘Automatic Design-Digital Survey’ course from the Faculty of ‘Building Engineering-Architecture’, Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture of the University of Catania later in 2019, and, more recently, in February 2020 a further workshop with students of the Faculty of Architecture of the Sapienza University of Rome.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The importance of a supportive and collaborative cultural heritage network has never been greater. This month in the Europeana Network Association (ENA), we are asking our members to renew their membership by 1 October 2020 in order to remain part of our growing network of over 2,800 professionals in the field of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>What we stand for</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past five years, we’ve built a strong, democratic community of professionals, dedicated to good practice and united by a shared mission to expand and improve access to Europe's cultural heritage. Our goal is to make a cultural impact on Europe – together.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe in creative collaboration and teamwork. We are committed to making, sharing, promoting and repurposing Europe’s digital cultural heritage. To achieve this, we use our individual expertise to encourage innovation and\_ cross-border and cross-domain collaboration.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We develop, validate and implement the standards and frameworks that improve access and discovery. We participate in and influence the governance of the Europeana initiative, and shape the sector through our work with policymakers.

To this end, a total of 93 interviews were conducted in Greece with witnesses of the period, including members of resistance organisations, hidden children, Jewish Shoah survivors, prisoners of concentration camps, witnesses to retaliation, and other individuals who experienced the painful period in various ways. The interviews were digitised and made accessible in a trilingual web portal and are available for research, educational and training purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the methodology you employed while designing and organising the interviews with the survivors?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interviewers follow the biographical-narrative method as described by Dr Alexander von Plato (an internationally recognised authority on oral history and one of Germany’s leading oral historians). The interviewees have the opportunity to tell the story of their whole life without interruptions, setting their own priorities and following an associative or chronological structure as they deem appropriate. This is done in the&nbsp;first (open) stage&nbsp;of the interview, which is introduced with the general question: ‘Could you please tell us the story of your life?’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the primary research interest of the project ‘Memories of the Occupation of Greece’ is the time of the occupation, the interviews that are conducted cover the entire life of the contemporary witnesses. This decision to conduct&nbsp;biographical interviews&nbsp;was made because of the importance of the subject’s character and story prior to the occupation for understanding their behavior and actions during the occupation. Memories of the time after the occupation are important, as the experience has an effect on the entire life of the individual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you describe briefly how the interviews were carried out?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The interviewers prepare themselves thoroughly for the interview. They possess an extensive knowledge of the German occupation of Greece and have been informed about the particular circumstances of the person to be interviewed, allowing them to comprehend each individual life story in its complexity. Furthermore, the interviewers prepare questions to assist in understanding the biography of each individual and the events that occurred during the occupation. As a matter of principle, the interviews are conducted with respect and empathy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Photos, documents or artifacts are examined together in order to bring back memories.&nbsp;After the interview, the interviewer completes a short biography and an interview protocol with a description of the interview situation. The interview subject receives a written copy of the interview.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>What were the main challenges you faced during the interviews and the data collection?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges were many. One important challenge was the conception and creation of the&nbsp;portal with the interviews preserved in their digital format and supplemented with other sources and materials such as keywords, headings, tab and qualitative information and summaries. The creation of an improved search and user functionality was also critical.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you deal with the issues of ethics and privacy that emerge during the interviews?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Those who are interested can get access to the material after registering to the portal. This restricted access is important for safeguarding the personal privacy of the witnesses. The witnesses themselves have also signed a written agreement that they consent to the use of their interviews for educational and historical purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have any insights as to if and how the interviews have been used (for research or other purposes)?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, there have been various presentations of the project to international conferences. The scientific team of the project has published some peer-reviewed articles for international scholarly journals and educational material for schools in Greece and Germany has already been prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think that cultural heritage institutions should approach sharing oral histories?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The practise of oral history in cultural institutions is well established although oral history is marginalised within academia. Museums and cultural institutions include video testimonies at their exhibitions as an effective exhibit tool and are considered now as integral elements in both the narrative and the design of the exhibit.</p>\r\n"

        title: '3D documentation and reuse of data within the cultural heritage sector in Ireland'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A recent edition of the EuropeanaTech Insight online journal invited contributors to the Europeana Task Force on 3D content to discuss their institutions, projects and products related to 3D presentation of digital cultural heritage. In an abridged post for Europeana Pro, we explore one of these articles, looking\_at how data from the 3D-ICONS project in Ireland has continued to be used even after the end of the project, by Anthony Corns and Robert Shaw from The Discovery Programme,\_Centre for Archaeology and Innovation in Ireland.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over the past decade, there has been a growing recognition that 3D digital documentation methods can play an important role in the preservation of cultural heritage structures and objects. This documentation has enabled experts including conservation scientists, archaeologists and historians to gain access to high-resolution data, which in turn allows for the identification of new features and subtleties which are not easily recognised by the naked eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The 3D Icons Project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From 2012-2015, the <a href=\"http://www.discoveryprogramme.ie/\">Discovery Programme</a> participated in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-icons\">3D-ICONS Project</a>, a pilot project funded under the European Commission’s ICT Policy, which established a complete pipeline for the production of 3D replicas of archaeological monuments, historic buildings and artefacts to contribute this content and the associated metadata to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the project, a selection of representative cultural monuments were recorded in Ireland, including the UNESCO world heritage sites of Brú na Bóinne and Skellig Michael. Many of these sites were National Monuments conserved and maintained by the <a href=\"https://www.archaeology.ie/\">National Monuments Service of Ireland</a>, and hugely popular with tourists and visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How the data is being used</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 3D-ICONS project ended in January 2015, but the outputs and legacies of the project are far from over. In addition to the 230 Irish 3D models made available online during the project, the amount of 3D content being created by the Discovery Programme has now reached 400 sites, monuments and artefacts available both through Sketch Fab and Europeana. We have seen reuse of data within several diverse sectors and audiences including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Education: the <a href=\"http://www.3dicons.ie/\">3D-ICONS website</a> is being used as a classroom resource by primary and secondary teachers in local schools including the teaching of History of Art at Leaving Certificate level.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Tourism: Ireland’s attraction to tourists is strongly associated with its wealth of cultural heritage sites. By repurposing the data collected within the 3D-ICONS project and adding additional content, models and visualisations the Office of Public Works (OPW), who manage many sites, has delivered a richer and increasingly interactive tourist experience.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Creative sectors: Through the identification of 3D content through portals such as Europeana and Sketchfab, the Discovery Programme has commercially licensed several 3D datasets to a range of creative sectors for reuse. These include film production companies who have used the 3D models in the pre-production process, for efficient planning at filming locations and post-production in the creation of visual effects.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Recording finite cultural heritage objects in high-resolution 3D data does not only benefit the understanding and management of these resources by professional sectors. Ensuring that this data can be promoted and reused by a wide range of sectors benefits both the wider public in enabling access to their shared heritage and allows the authentic exploitation of our cultural heritage by several industries, as well as the potential for this to partially fund some activities within the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month Killian Downing, Archivist at Dublin City University, discusses the importance of open access, his work with cultural heritage professionals in Ireland, and his involvement with Europeana communities.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About Killian</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Archivists come from weird and wonderful backgrounds. As a music student at Maynooth University, studying musicology and creative music technologies, I worked part-time in Dublin Zoo and Dublin City Public Libraries. Much of this time was spent at the welcoming desk of Dublin City Archives where I was enthralled by vistor’s stories, artefacts, and their desire for sharing and learning about the past. As a career in Dublin Zoo didn’t materialise, I graduated as an archivist and records manager in 2010. Ten years on, I still visit my furry friends in Dublin Zoo.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong>\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve recently been appointed as an archivist in Dublin City University Library and am really excited to be taking up this role. DCU is an internationally renowned university with extensive collections on modern Irish history, politics and society. I’ll be working with the DCU library team to open up its collections, foster new academic and research partnerships, and connect with existing and new communities.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a councillor with Europeana, I’ve been working with a passionate network of professionals in Ireland to develop a collective strategy to support the visibility, usability, and long-term sustainability of digital cultural heritage and consolidate Ireland’s ongoing cooperation with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For GLAMs, one of the biggest challenges and, paradoxically, one of the biggest opportunities, is the way in which rapid technological change is being exacerbated by mis and disinformation online and lazily amplified as ‘alternative facts’. The digital culture heritage sector has huge potential and a responsibility to provide information literacy tools to empower users to evaluate and interrogate information online. Freedom of access to archives, records and information is vital for an open, knowledgeable and democratic society.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now more than ever, GLAMs need to collaborate and develop trusted capabilities to ensure records are preserved, authentic and usable over time. Where traditional values of openness, transparency and accountability are also challenged by rapid technological change, the international movement embracing open access, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/exploring-the-global-picture-of-open-glam\">open GLAM</a> and open cultural heritage is reconciling this trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With many of us in lockdown, a massive challenge for GLAMs and cultural organisations is how to renew their relationship with their audiences. The Europeana Impact Community has been addressing this challenge and provides free <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">tools and resources</a> so cultural institutions can evaluate and articulate their relevance to their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m quite new to Europeana. My first experience was sharing a story about a WW1 memorial plaque dedicated to a HMS Laurentic fireman named <a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/2017/01/lost-ww1-memorial-plaque-of-hms-laurentic-fireman-returned-to-family-thanks-to-europeana-1914-1918/\">Thomas McGarry </a>via Europeana 1914-1918. The story was later discovered by McGarry’s grandchildren on Europeana and the lost plaque was returned to them before the centenary of his death in 2017. The return of this object made me realise how Europeana is a home for our collective memory and shared heritage, allowing us to understand the complexities of our past to make sense of the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in Ireland, I’ve been promoting and coordinating Europeana collection days and engagement events. Thanks to the establishment of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/little-by-little-one-travels-far-europeana-developments-in-ireland\">Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI)</a> as the national aggregator for Ireland, there’s now nearly 100 ENA members across Ireland and ten collection days have occurred. About to kick-off is the Europeana Sport: Ireland’s Stories campaign, to be followed by Europe at Work: Ardnacrusha Memories - Collecting your stories about the Shannon Hydro-Electric Scheme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with Europeana, I’m Chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals\">New Professionals Task Force</a> which aims to better support young and new professionals within Europeana in a time of growing work casualisation and job insecurity. This Task Force will assess the challenges facing emerging professionals and aims to deliver recommendations for a new professionals programme. I’m also co-Chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Community</a> and member of the growing <a href=\"https://3.basecamp.com/4181566/join/hKtDhbNYscVY/accesses/new\">Climate Action Group</a>, which is pursuing collective action within the ENA and wider Europeana community in solidarity with the global climate justice movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being new to the ENA, I never expected to be elected as a councillor in 2018. I would encourage anyone who wants to help shape Europeana and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join a community</a> of passionate, open, and friendly people to put their name forward in the November 2020 Members Council elections.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'European Parliament Archives brings Schuman Declaration to life in new exhibition with Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As the COVID-19 crisis places pressure on the cultural heritage sector, institutions have been rising to the challenge by increasingly using digital means to engage with their audiences and communities. When a long-planned exhibition celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the Schuman Declaration\_could no longer take place in European cities, the European Parliament Archives worked with Europeana to bring the exhibition to life online – in 24 languages. We speak to Ludovic Delepine, Head of Archives at the European Parliament, about how it all came together.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us about your work in the European Parliament Archives? What kind of collections do you have?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The archives store and preserve the historical documents of the European Parliament from 1952 onwards, in formats including paper, electronic, photographic and posters. My collaborators and I are responsible for keeping the evidence of the activity of the European Parliament, preserving the historical memory of the institution and making it accessible to citizens. This covers several areas including the acquisition of documents and stock management, the management of an archive information system, and promoting and sharing our assets through events, studies and exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last activity is an important professional dimension of the archives. Archiving is not only about acquisition, treatment and preservation. It is about contributing to history by facilitating the activities of historians, librarians, researchers, and of course, informing citizens.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us about the exhibition! What material does it incorporate?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition tells the story of the declaration of the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman on 9 May 1950, which marked the beginning of the process of building the European Community; 9 May is now celebrated annually as Europe Day. It incorporates photographs from European Union collections and private collections, many of which have not been publicly shared before; the exhibition is really unique in this way.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge amount of work went into preparing the exhibition, beginning December 2019. It is available in 24 languages, and we intended to share it on printed panels in 14 different cities in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Once it became apparent that the exhibition could not take place physically, what options did you consider?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the disruptions of COVID-19, the premises where we had planned to present the exhibition will be closed to the public on 9 May, so we had to consider using alternative communication channels. The question of how to do this was initially raised by the European Parliament Liaison Office in Strasbourg. We invested a lot of time in the preparation of the exhibition and wanted to share it with European citizens and remind them of the spirit of our ‘founding fathers’ in this important moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we had to reinvent ourselves. Traditionally we have produced physical exhibitions, rarely online exhibitions of this size. This was the perfect moment to ‘move digital’ and to develop new ways of sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Tell us about the process of ‘moving digital.’</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the time left before 9 May, it was evident that we could not develop a professional solution to bring a digital exhibition to life ourselves, so we looked for the opportunity to share it through another platform. The choice of Europeana was simple - an online platform from the European Commission, which supports thousands of cultural heritage organisations in sharing their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I contacted Douglas McCarthy from the Collections Engagement team at Europeana, the co-operation was immediate. The images that were intended for the physical exhibition had already been digitised and we had established the necessary copyright information, as well as captions for the images. Additionally, the format in which we had designed the exhibition, divided up into panels, leant itself well to sharing as online ‘chapters.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Collections Engagement team were able to build the English version of the exhibition online in one day, and the 23 other languages were available in a week. The exhibition curator, Étienne Deschamps, then worked with the team to make minor changes, and the exhibition was ready in 20 calendar days. An exceptional quality of service from the Collections Engagement team–we couldn’t believe it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How do you think that the exhibition being shared digitally will affect the audiences who access it?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/historicalarchives/en/home.html\">website of the Archives for the European Parliament</a> is not visited often, but sharing our archives for education and reminding our citizens of their history is an important driver to sustain our democracies. Presenting the exhibition on Europeana will allow us to reach a wider audience–both online citizens and our peers in cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How do you think that your ‘digital first’ experience of this exhibition will affect your work in the future?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a radical change in our approach. It is now not only about physical exhibitions, but will see digital and physical exhibitions as two complementary streams. With the support of the Collections Engagement team at Europeana, we have demonstrated that this is possible, and this is just the first step opening a long and fruitful collaboration with Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>More generally, what role do you think that cultural heritage can play at this time?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Engaging with our cultural heritage reminds us what it means to be European citizens, and of the importance of solidarity in a crisis. For example, my favourite part of this exhibition focuses on reactions to the Schuman Declaration, because it highlights the support provided by six countries to build a common future. If we draw a parallel with the situation today, this is a kind of spirit we need to promote. Peace, solidarity and togetherness were key values that led to the Schuman Declaration, and we can continue to celebrate them through cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

As an English and History teacher in secondary education, I have been using Europeana collections in my classes for a few years, and created the learning scenario <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/the-great-war-through-childrens-eyes-ls-gr-05/\">The Great War through children's eyes</a> with sources from Europeana (including soldiers' letters, photos, maps, family memorabilia, blog posts and related thematic galleries).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through activities such as this, I am familiar with the collections, blogs, galleries and exhibitions of the Europeana website. However, previously when I looked for specific content on the website I often had to spend time browsing to find material that suited my needs. So I was delighted when I first visited the demo version of the new Europeana collections and spotted <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a>, which features learning scenarios, resources, games, training tools and more.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Providing interconnected content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Classroom is particularly useful in the way that it gathers resources related to featured topics, offering a new, interconnected way of browsing content. For example, if you were to browse the section on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History</a> you will find not only links to galleries but also to Europeana Education learning scenarios and other complementary resources including interviews, tools from Historiana and relevant blog posts.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Training tools and guides for educators\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Classroom also offers a ‘Training Tools’ section which includes a guide for educators (in 12 different languages) introducing\_the basic principles of searching for and using Europeana’s content in education. The Historiana Teacher Training Guide 2020 also contains eLearning Activities (particularly relevant in the current period), MOOCs in five languages and GIF tutorials. Webinars (in 12 languages) which have been recorded by the Europeana Ambassadors are readily available for us all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to training for teachers, there are games for primary school classes (including Art Faces) and competitions such as ‘Transcribathon’ which are suitable for our teenage students. For STEM inquiry-based learning projects, you can watch the videos, made with Europeana, about steam engines and how they work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A new way of exploring the collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The refreshed layout of the main site is also helpful in how it corresponds to thematic areas, which can be associated with a variety of school subjects. When opting to search a collection, I also find the ‘Can I re-use it’ button - which helps you to filter based on the licensing attached to different images - very helpful. My students and I often discuss when, how, and where they can source openly licensed images, and the prominence of these filters will definitely make our lives easier in the classroom!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the simplicity of the new platform\_brings forth the most contemporary and interdisciplinary connections among otherwise scattered material, with a view to becoming a cutting-edge innovation in the field of cultural heritage aggregators and their pedagogical impact. It offers an excellent opportunity to access digitised, authentic, original, multicultural content, which can be a treasure trove of knowledge in any subject, be it language courses or science, technology, social sciences and fine arts.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: '3D models to explore our built cultural heritage: the INCEPTION technologies'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The advent of 3D technology is bringing new opportunities for the cultural heritage sector, offering innovative ways to provide access to heritage for education, tourism, research and enjoyment. However, it also throws up new challenges - how best to embrace 3D given access to new technologies and the speed of technological change? In this post, we explore the INCEPTION project, which creates 3D models of buildings, monuments and sites, accompanied digitally by contextual technical and historical information.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About INCEPTION</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.inception-project.eu/\">INCEPTION project</a> was developed between 2015 and 2019 under the Horizon2020 Framework Program. It uses advanced Building Information Modelling (BIM) techniques to create 3D models (also known as BIM models) of buildings, monuments and sites that are easy-to-access and easy-to-use by different people. These are hosted online on the project’s open standard web platform alongside contextual, technical and historical information which intends to help European citizens engage with their built cultural heritage. But how does the platform work, and how can it be used?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Techniques and technology\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to modelling artifacts such as buildings and monuments, 3D laser scanners and photogrammetry - a technique which uses photographs of real objects to generate photorealistic 3D models -\_ usually provide the initial data sources for BIM models. These models merge\_ geometric and semantic information together. But to make these models easily accessible was a challenge which the INCEPTION project aimed to address.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project achieved this through the development of the\_INCEPTION platform, a\_web platform for BIM models. The site allows people to:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Search\_for models using different devices and apps</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Navigate 3D models, and view them using immersive VR headsets</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Enrich and populate the models and their related information</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Connect the platform to environmental sensors and ‘Internet of Things’ services to enrich models in real-time.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>INCEPTION for content creators</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The INCEPTION platform offers an interface for uploading and sharing BIM models for\_people who create them, including\_ cultural heritage professionals, researchers and ICT experts. All the models can be introduced in the platform as standard files, already embedding both geometrical and semantic data. Once BIM models are uploaded on the platform, they can be enriched by several attachments and external sources.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to buildings, each element or component can tell a story, from the column to the windows, from magnificent frescoes to a small tile. The INCEPTION platform exploits the fact that each element of the building has a URI (Unique Reference Identifier) which allows people to attach pictures, videos, PDF documents, detailed and textured mesh models or resources for people to refer to as they explore these elements.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>INCEPTION for audiences\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From the perspective of citizens, tourists, technicians restoring a building, or even researchers studying it, with a standard web browser everyone can search the <a href=\"http://www.inceptionhbim.eu/platform\">INCEPTION database</a> of models using keywords, as well as spatial and multi-criteria queries. The development of apps or the connection with immersive devices can offer a brand new way to enjoy digital cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even metadata included in each piece of a model can be exploited to offer an engaging navigation experience. The INCEPTION Time Machine is an example of this. The platform automatically interprets the age of single components of the building\_to help recreate its\_ evolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate next step is to exploit the technological core of the platform to digitise a significant number of buildings and sites from European cultural heritage, and to create a new relationship between 3D and all the resources already available on the web. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">3D content in Europeana Task Force</a> has already started to explore such possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://inceptionspinoff.com/\">spin-off company</a>, called INCEPTION s.r.l. incubated at the University of Ferrara, will advance\_ the platform development thanks to agreements with national and European institutions. Among those, the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/pilot-project-italy-create-new-reference-example-3d-digitisation-cultural-heritage\">agreement</a> with the Central Institute for Catalogues and Documentation (ICCD) of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities is worth mentioning. Endorsed by the European Commission, the knowledge made available through this project will contribute to boosting both the number and quality of 3D models of European cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The cultural heritage sector has come under enormous pressure from the impact of COVID-19. But as we outline today in our Europe Day Manifesto -&nbsp;<em>Cultural heritage: a powerful catalyst for the future of Europe</em>, it also offers solutions to the challenges we face in the wake of the pandemic. This manifesto,<em>&nbsp;</em>launched by members of the European Heritage Alliance, an informal platform bringing together 50 European and international networks active in the wider heritage field,&nbsp;sets out the key ways that the cultural heritage sector can contribute to Europe’s recovery, and calls on EU institutions to put the sector at the heart of plans for Europe’s future. Below you can read the statement in full - please read, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRtRs3HOglTH5dJUr9TJMDrijVSVOu9j8Zy_D351YqYUezhQ/viewform\">sign</a>, share and join us as we work to strengthen our sector and Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>On this landmark Europe Day when we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/70th-anniversary-of-the-schuman-declaration\">Schuman </a><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/70th-anniversary-of-the-schuman-declaration\">Declaration</a>, and the launch of the process of European integration;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a time when Europe and the entire planet are struggling to overcome an unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 virus and when we have to define robust policies to reset and rebuild our societies and economies;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having in mind that the vast world of culture and cultural heritage has been heavily and particularly affected by the pandemic, with serious cultural, social, and economic implications for heritage professionals and volunteers;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impressed by the exceptional efforts made by culture and heritage actors to keep people’s spirits up by sharing access to an extraordinarily rich offer of cultural content;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We, representatives of the vast heritage community active across Europe have gathered under the banner of the <a href=\"http://europeanheritagealliance.eu/\">European Heritage Alliance</a>, to convey a strong message of solidarity, hope, and unity to Europe’s leaders and citizens. We are ready to contribute to Europe’s immediate social and economic recovery, as well as to the longer-term advancement of the European project;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by the vision and audacity of Robert Schuman and his peers, 70 years ago, we strongly believe that we must seize the current crisis to put culture and cultural heritage where they belong: at the very heart of Europe’s revival;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As demonstrated during the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\">European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018</a>, there are many ways in which cultural heritage can act as a catalyst for positive change. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In this Manifesto, we highlight 7 interconnected ways in which this is the case:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) HEALING EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In times of health emergencies, cultural heritage plays, and will continue to play, an essential role for the physical and mental wellbeing of every individual and of our societies as a whole. As evidenced by a rich body of literature and increasingly recognised in public decision-making, wellbeing is a holistic concept which encompasses emotional, social, cultural, spiritual and economic needs, which allow individuals to realise their full potential and engage in society to their fullest capacity. Therefore, investing in cultural heritage means investing in public health, wellbeing, and improving the quality of people’s lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) BEING EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a time when the whole world is facing a profound transformation of our way of life, our shared cultural heritage and values constitute a much-needed anchor and compass. They can indeed provide a sense of direction and inspiration to make the right choices ahead of us. Cultural heritage ensures the link between our roots, identities, and traditions and the wider European and global picture. Participation in, and engagement with, cultural heritage also enables us to embrace our diversity and to use it as a source of enrichment and creativity. How European citizens feel and understand their shared heritage, and how this process of heritage interpretation is facilitated, is critical for the future of Europe. This is why greater investment in culture, education, science, and innovation must be at the heart of the promotion of our European way of life - in its full diversity. This is also why in the future, a “European Union of Shared Values” must be as important as Europe’s economic, monetary, or political union.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) DIGITALLY TRANSFORMING EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has underlined the critical importance of digital access to cultural heritage. At a time when people seek to remain closer together while staying physically apart, cultural heritage organisations across Europe have risen to the challenge. Europe already plays a leading role in digital cultural heritage and has the potential to forge ahead with new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning based on humanistic and ethical principles. Now we must work together to accelerate and further improve this digital transformation. At the same time, we must narrow the divide between institutions that are digitally equipped, and those that are not. We need to democratise access to our heritage to support diversity, inclusivity, creativity, and critical engagement in education and knowledge sharing. We need to promote collaborations and experimentations that strengthen our capacity for innovation. And we need to promote the use of digital technology and expertise, to strengthen our cultural institutions’ role in telling our European stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) GREENING EUROPE </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the European Union is working on its historic “European Green Deal”, we must ensure that the cultural dimension of the green transformation of our society and economy is fully taken on board. Our cultural heritage, including cultural landscapes, are severely threatened by climate change. But the cultural world, with its wealth of traditional knowledge and skills, can also be used to further expand on mitigation and adaptation practices which can help achieve the ambitious objectives of the European Green Deal. We strongly support calls for a ‘green recovery’ of Europe after the pandemic and are convinced of the immense potential of cultural heritage to help achieve it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) REGENERATING EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The now landmark study <a href=\"http://blogs.encatc.org/culturalheritagecountsforeurope/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CHCfE_FULL-REPORT_v2.pdf\">Cultural Heritage Counts for Europe</a> provides robust evidence of the clear benefits of heritage investment for the regeneration of cities and regions, both on individual and community levels. Given the prospect of dramatic job losses, we urge EU leaders to invest in heritage-led regeneration of urban and rural areas, enabling and amplifying Europe’s social and economic recovery. In this way, Europe will not only preserve many existing jobs and related skills but also create new rewarding jobs, ranging from specialised crafts to the sophisticated use of digital and other new technologies. Such a “New Deal for Cultural Heritage” will in turn drive social and economic innovation, and contribute to a major improvement of our living environment. The huge potential of heritage-led regeneration in historic cities, villages and the countryside across Europe can indeed become a real 'game-changer' towards a greener and more sustainable Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6) EXPERIENCING EUROPE</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with the catastrophic impact of the pandemic on the tourism industry due to travel and mobility limitations, which puts 13 million European jobs at risk, we fully support the appeal for a major “EU tourism rescue plan”. This plan should include special measures for the revival of cultural tourism, one of the largest and fastest growing tourism segments worldwide which accounts for 40% of all European tourism. Tourism needs cultural heritage and cultural heritage needs tourism. But we recover from this crisis by using it as an opportunity to promote more innovative and sustainable forms of tourism. In doing so, we will deliver lasting benefits for public and private owners of heritage sites and the communities that surround them, generating higher quality experiences and greater enjoyment for visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7) EMBRACING THE WORLD </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, as the current crisis has shown, the clear interconnection and fragility of humanity provides Europe with a unique opportunity to enhance its positive and constructive role in the world. Culture and cultural heritage are key drivers for enhancing respect, understanding, and trust as the prerequisites for the global solidarity and cooperation. Europe should thereby use its rich cultural resources to champion this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In light of the above, we need to urgently and collectively mobilise the transformational power of culture and cultural heritage to provide meaning and inspiration for Europe’s green and inclusive recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. TOGETHER, we can deploy their full potential for a better future for Our Europe.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How can you use Europeana Newspapers?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in 2019, the Europeana Newspapers collection gives access to hundreds of newspaper titles and millions of newspaper pages spanning four centuries and 20 countries from across Europe. It brings together these documents for historians, researchers, culture-lovers and educators alike, with newspapers in the collection dating from 1618 to 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Newspapers allows people to search these newspapers in a number of ways, giving you the opportunity to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>View and browse individual pages from newspapers</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Search the full text of newspapers or search only in the metadata</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Search the collections by date, country of origin, and individual word&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Download the newspaper pages as high resolution images, or their raw data via the API&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Tempted to start browsing? Read our accompanying <a href=\"https://blog.europeana.eu/tag/newspapers/\">series of blogs</a> on newspapers and their role as an important part of our cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What improvements are we working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are constantly working to improve our collections, and have listened to your feedback on Europeana Newspapers. While we weren’t initially able to deploy all of the features we wanted&nbsp;on the website, we are committed to improving the experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next month we will launch a functionality which will help make searching for keywords across the collection more efficient. Currently when you search for a keyword in the collection, the results tell you in which newspapers the word appears, but don’t allow you to browse the individual text of each page to see where the result was found. With this new functionality, you will be able to see on which page the word was found, and also jump straight to that page to see where it appears&nbsp;- something that we hope will make your search experience faster and more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana and IIIF 3D: next steps and added dimensions?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A recent edition of the online journal EuropeanaTech Insight invited contributors to the Europeana Task Force on 3D content to discuss their institutions, projects and products related to 3D presentation of digital cultural heritage. In an abridged\_post\_for Europeana Pro News, we explore one of these articles focusing on some of the challenges the sector faces in the quest for interoperable 3D models, written by Ronald Haynes.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Interoperability and 3D</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If space is the final frontier, then we naturally turn to 3D images and models to help us explore and express that frontier. For the many aspects of space, and of our world, we have widespread options to produce good 3D models which are increasingly available to specialists and the general public alike, including on common devices. However, the many ways people scan, process, adjust, store, present and use those models\_challenges us to readily share them, whether in their present state or sustainably preserved to enable continued sharing well into the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/\">IIIF 3D Community Group</a> (International Image Interoperability Framework 3D group) has been an enthusiastic partner to the work of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">3D content in Europeana Task Force</a>, and is working with many 3D-active groups and developers\_aiming to produce practical and interoperable 3D models, along with 2D (IIIF) image and 3D model integration. But what are some of the challenges they face?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Addressing the challenges of interoperable 3D</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A combination of collaborative casework and community development has helped IIIF to address many of the challenges associated with the co-ordinated use of 2D images, notably in the cultural heritage and GLAM areas. The efforts to extend those developments to be more inclusive of 3D materials does, however, literally add extra dimension and complexity to the mix.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the challenges facing the collaborative community work of the 3D Group, there are key considerations for preservation options. Keeping sight of\_sustainability and long-term usability is a helpful lens through which to focus preservation efforts, including regular reviews of practical approaches to the scanning and capture or construction of models. As part of the process of reducing what is for many an unmangeable number of options and moving towards a more manageable set of formats, it will also\_be important to address the variety of 3D file formats. While niche or specialist file formats may remain for various purposes, improving file conversion options will continue to help in the transition to the more popular and increasingly common formats.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, there are challenges around finding or collectively clarifying the full set of equipment, process, people and capabilities needed for 3D production - ideally in an increasingly interoperable format. We will need to explore options for smaller and less well-funded institutions to access suitable workflow and production options (through better joint funding or other means of ensuring the growth of interoperability).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on open standards for text and 2D images\_and working together to ensure the seamless combination with 3D objects\_should help reduce existing digital divides and increase overall accessibility, by ensuring the broadest overall data interoperability. To adequately attempt to address these challenges we plan to continue to liaise and work with other 3D-active researchers and groups, to build the alliances and collaborative efforts. We are reviving some previously-articulated 3D technical challenges (from a 2017 IIIF meeting at the V&amp;A museum in London) to combine with more recent developments, as well as gathering user needs and stories. We also are planning to organise further events to clarify a set of suitably representative examples and use cases - <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/groups/3d/\">find out more</a>.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As the cultural heritage sector faces unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the question of its digital transformation is more relevant than ever. We are delighted to launch a special series of workshops addressing this topic and exploring capacity building for the cultural heritage sector - find out how you can get involved.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana works to empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation, and the COVID-19 crisis has made the need to embrace this transformation clearer than ever. The relevance of digital platforms, tools and experiences is now at the forefront of public minds and many institutions have increased or moved activities online; a recent <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/news/article/nemo/nemo-publishes-results-of-survey-on-the-impact-of-the-corona-crisis-on-museums-in-europe.html\">NEMO survey</a> found that more than 60% of the museums surveyed have increased their online presence since they were closed due to social distancing measures.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of building that capacity has been reinforced across the Europeana Initiative. During this period, more than ever, we need to collaborate with and support our networks to draw on our collective experience, expertise and perspectives.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to get involved.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning in early June, Europeana is offering selected groups of leaders in the cultural heritage sector the opportunity to participate in a free series of workshops facilitated by noted digital cultural strategists <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-peter-edson-6582291/\">Michael Peter Edson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaspervisser1982/\">Jasper Visser</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops will support participants to:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Develop strategic thinking</strong> around digital transformation that will support work at an institutional level.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Contribute to a broader discussio</strong>n about digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector in a (post-)COVID-19 world.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Generate and share actionable insights</strong> and identify new paths through the COVID-19 crisis for digital culture.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Enhance our mutual capacity for longer-term planning</strong> beyond the immediate crisis.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><strong>Gain new perspectives</strong> from working with your peers and experts in digital cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These workshops form part of an ongoing process from the Europeana Initiative which aims to understand the needs of the cultural heritage sector with regards to capacity building in the context of digital transformation. The insights they provide will help us develop frameworks to address these needs, and we will be sharing the process and outcomes widely to benefit all. There will be further opportunities to contribute and collaborate as we continue on this journey, so please continue to check Europeana Pro news to hear more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How to take part</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops are open to thought leaders and innovators who work in the GLAM sector and GLAM organisations. Spaces are limited, and you must be a Europeana Network Member to participate - if you are not one already, it is free and simple to join, offers many benefits and you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up today</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops consist of three one-hour sessions which are planned over three consecutive weeks from 2 June to 18 June. You will attend one workshop at the same time each week, but you need to confirm that you are available for all the times below. Unfortunately we will not be able to accommodate requests to change times. If selected, you will be notified of your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Weekly on Tuesday 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm CEST</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Weekly on Tuesday 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm CEST</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Weekly on Tuesday 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm CEST</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Weekly on Wednesday 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm CEST</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Weekly on Thursday 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm CEST</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, we ask one volunteer (team captain) from each group to join us for an extra call on Thursday, 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm CEST to contribute to the analysis of the results. This can be one fixed person per group or a revolving role. As a team captain, you get the chance to learn from the other teams while steering the overall direction of the conversation. You can volunteer for this role when you apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Registration for the workshops has now closed, but you can <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=70e7d06bec\">register to hear more about the project</a>.</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Showcasing Europe’s cultural heritage through Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This month on Europeana Pro we’re exploring how the new Europeana website helps audiences explore the wealth of Europe’s cultural heritage. In this post, our Collections Engagement team – who develop editorial and stories from the material published on Europeana – share their favourite aspects of the website, and the different ways that they work to encourage engagement with digital cultural heritage.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Bringing collections together</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s new website brings together blogs, galleries and exhibitions on a diverse range of topics, helping audiences discover new content and showcasing the material shared through the site. Europeana Collections Manager <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/adrian-murphy\">Adrian Murphy</a> sees the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/discovering-europe\">Discovering Europe</a> page as a particularly good example.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘At university I studied geography and I have a huge interest in travel and visiting different places across Europe. On Europeana we’ve published many blogs, galleries and exhibitions which offer portraits of places, so I’m really pleased that we now have <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/european-cities\">one place</a> which brings all these together. We can take virtual trips to cities such as Ravenna and Budapest, towns like Aveiro and Spijkenisse – we can discover the variety and beauty of European places from the comfort of our homes.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/aleksandra-strzelichowska\">Aleks Strzelichowska</a> celebrates the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/womens-history\">Women’s History</a> page: ‘We think that women's history should be visible and celebrated throughout the year, not just during the Women's History Month in March. That's why we created a page dedicated to the stories of remarkable women. You explore all our content celebrating female artists, scientists, politicians, activists in one place.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Supporting the use of cultural heritage in education\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/isabel-crespo\">Isabel Crespo</a>, Europeana’s Business Development coordinator for education, a highlight of the new site is <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroo</a><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/europeana-classroom\">m</a>, a dedicated space for teachers:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Having worked in a contemporary art museum, I know how difficult, and how important, it is for young people to encounter museum collections and their social and historical narratives. Cultural heritage institutions cannot always reach children\_ by themselves, and it is important for educators (working in museums, archives or libraries), school teachers and families work together to create educational experiences with cultural heritage.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘We have listened to communities of teachers to understand their current needs and to help them develop teaching resources with cultural content.\_ I am delighted that the new website\_has a dedicated online space to inspire and engage young learners and support education professionals. Explore <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-new-europeana-collections-from-a-teacher-s-perspective\">what a teacher thinks</a> of the new Europeana website.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Showcasing our seasons</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana website also showcases seasons, which explore a theme related to our shared cultural heritage. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marijke-everts\">Marijke Everts</a> is particularly excited about the upcoming Europeana Sport season. ‘As a child I was always quite competitive at sporting activities in my school, especially running, and I also did horse riding and rhythmic gymnastics. So I am particularly excited about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport</a>, which will highlight Europe’s sporting heritage and encourage everyone to share their own story on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/collections/topic/114-sport\">Europeana</a>, whether it’s from the sidelines or on the field. In collaboration with sporting institutions, the events, shared stories and sporting content on Europeana will also be highlighted to our audiences through our blogs, galleries, and webinars throughout the campaign.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Surfacing new stories\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jolan-wuyts\">Jolan Wuyts</a> highlights, ‘With the relaunch of Europeana's website we now have a much more flexible way of collecting content into different topics for anyone to discover. Browse pages give us the ability to group content in ways we couldn't before. An important part is being able to surface stories and give voice to those that didn't have the privilege to be heard. With the new website we can create new spaces to showcase stories of activism and awareness. For example, the browse page on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/lgbtq\">LGBTQ+</a> is important to me because it highlights stories that I wish I would have read when I was growing up and figuring out my own identity.’\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/malgorzata-szynkielewska\">Maggy Szynkielewska</a> agrees: ‘I am thrilled when our work in Europeana can directly answer the needs of our users, especially those that are underrepresented. My favourite example of that is <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries/disabilities-in-art\">Disabilities in Art</a> which was born as a result of collaborating with #DisabilityHistory Twitter community. They directly shaped the content of the gallery by choosing European artworks which appropriately reflects experiences and treatment of people with disabilities. Thanks to their voices and active participation we accomplished a much more apt and diverse result than by doing it alone.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to explore the editorial highlighted in this post, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">visit the website</a> and browse blogs, galleries and exhibitions.

        intro: "<p>Europeana Members Councillors have diverse jobs and wide experience across the heritage sector, but are united by their passion for digital cultural heritage. In our ‘Professionals in Focus’ series, we speak to our Councillors about their roles, working lives and plans for their time on the Members Council. This month Maria Drabczyk, chief international projects expert at the National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute Poland, discusses encouraging engagement with collections, addressing ‘puzzles’ when sharing cultural heritage, and the importance of understanding impact.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was pure circumstance. I was between jobs, having finished working for a small NGO trying to bridge culture and business, and was searching for a new professional challenge. Before that, I worked for five years for the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage in a team in charge of international cultural policies and collaborations. I am a sociologist by training and as much as I have a passion for policies and strategies (I still do!), I was missing a project-based approach.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A friend tipped me off that there was an opening at the National Audiovisual Institute (now <a href=\"https://fina.gov.pl/\">National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute</a>, in short FINA) for a European project coordinator. The project was called EUscreenXL and they needed someone to lead a work package on dissemination, exploitation and sustainability.\_Six years later I am on the board of the <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/about-5/foundation/\">EUscreen Foundation</a>, a network which facilitates online access to Europe’s audiovisual history through rich and robust digital content and advocates for its use in education, research, media production and public engagement. And the three words that formed the name of my first work package back in 2014 remain the most relevant areas of my work in the archive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are you currently working on?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My current\_role at FINA is built around mostly international initiatives that create online access and encourage use of our archival collections - a task that has gained additional value in the past few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the Europeana context, we are currently working on a number of smaller and bigger projects, including\_ <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-europeana-xx-century-of-change\">Europeana XX </a>, which aims to\_ tell the story of 20th century European societal change. We are also planning a new edition of <a href=\"https://www.nina.gov.pl/projekty/tu-europeana/\">TuEuropeana</a>, a national project we created five years ago to locally promote the use of Europeana collections in education, science and the creative sector. With EUscreen we are finalising our strategic plan for the next few years.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Somehow the challenges are also my favourite elements! Working on a new project or proposal is like starting a new, complex puzzle. At first, the elements don’t seem to match -\_ how can you combine copyright limitations, technical challenges and lack of resources with your wish to make everything as freely accessible as possible and to create an amazing story relevant to your users?\_ However, with time and the right people gathered around the table, you come up with a way to make them all fit in. That’s my favourite moment - the click of the final puzzle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been a relevant part of my professional network since I joined the international archival community. The TuEuropeana project made the connection even stronger and somehow turned me into Europeana’s advocate within the Polish cultural heritage\_community. It’s a role I very much appreciate and genuinely enjoy.\_EUscreen has also always collaborated closely with the Europeana Foundation, and in time I got involved in a number of activities and various task forces focused on improving use of the collections in various contexts. Joining the Members Council seemed like a natural next step, a chance to learn more and to help shape the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I come from an audiovisual background so my natural goal is to put those collections\_in the spotlight of the Europeana ecosystem. I want to support any actions that foster knowledge exchange and development (both technical and curatorial) relevant for the archival audiovisual community.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am also part of the Steering Group of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community</a>.\_I strongly believe in the value of our work, in the stories we tell with our amazing collections and in change we can create in society and in individuals. But as cultural heritage institutions\_we still need to learn how to better understand\_and analyse the impact of our actions. Especially now, when, because of the COVID-19 crisis, we all face the urgent need to redefine our approach, find new ways of remaining connected in dialogue with our audiences and stay professionally alive.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europe-day-manifesto-cultural-heritage-a-powerful-catalyst-for-the-future-of-europe\">Europe Day Manifesto</a>, launched by Members of the European Heritage Alliance and co-signed by Europeana, cultural heritage is a powerful catalyst for the future of Europe. We need to start saying this more often out loud - you can join us by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRtRs3HOglTH5dJUr9TJMDrijVSVOu9j8Zy_D351YqYUezhQ/viewform\">signing the Manifesto today</a>. We also need tools and methodology that will help us hold this conversation in a most efficient way. I want to be part of this conversation.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Share3D - helping the cultural heritage sector to tell stories'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The advent of 3D technology is bringing new opportunities for the cultural heritage sector, offering innovative ways to provide access to heritage for education, tourism, research and enjoyment. However, it also throws up new challenges - how best to embrace 3D given access to new technologies and the speed of technological change? In this post, Kate Fernie and Dimitris Gavrilis tell us about Share3D, a Europeana Generic Services project which uses 3D as a driver to encourage people to explore and re-use cultural heritage content.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>About Share3D</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Share3D (fully titled ‘Sharing New Perspectives: Your 3D View on Europeana’) began as a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-projects\">Europeana Generic Service Project</a> funded under CEF Telecom Programme. It was developed out of an idea to use 3D as a way to encourage people to explore and re-use cultural heritage content. We were aware that increasing numbers of cultural heritage institutions and researchers were uploading 3D content to the 3D modelling platform <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/\">Sketchfab</a> and we wanted to provide a tool to make it easier for them to share this content with Europeana. The project brought this to life through the Share3D Dashboard, and also developed the Share3D Storymaker, which allows users to create stories that incorporate 3D content and other media from Europeana and Sketchfab.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Share3D Dashboard\_</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/dashboard/\">Share3D Dashboard</a> is a cloud-based service that allows users to link their Sketchfab accounts and log in to select published models that they would like to share with Europeana. The Sketchfab metadata are then imported back to the dashboard where users can edit it to add the information needed to conform with Europeana’s specifications. The edited metadata records can then be submitted to Europeana from the Share3D Dashboard via the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/carare\">CARARE aggregator</a>. Find out more about the process through <a href=\"https://share3d.gitbook.io/share-3d-guidelines/\">Share3D’s user guide</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dashboard is ideal for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Cultural heritage institutions who are capturing their collections in 3D.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Researchers (including archaeologists, historic buildings experts, curators) who are capturing monuments, landscapes, excavation findings, historic buildings and urban areas in 3D.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Creators of 3D models that depict cultural heritage objects.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>All those who want to create an XML formatted metadata record that conforms to Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/metadata\">EDM schema</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Share3D Storymaker</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://storymaker.share3d.eu/\">Share3D Storymaker</a> enables users to explore, create and experience 3D objects as stories. The Storymaker allows people to search for content from Sketchfab and Europeana, to upload their own images and to use this content to create stories.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Storymaker is ideal for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Educational purposes: for example, teachers can invite their students to create stories about an aspect of cultural heritage (the arts, history, landscapes) and encourage them to re-use the content that is available on Europeana and Sketchfab.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Tourism: for example, a 3D story of a monument can be used as the basis for a tourist guide, allowing visitors to visualise the monument and its history.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Creative industries: for example, using 3D content to attract a viewers attention in a scene.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Curators who wish to use the objects in their collection to tell a story or to create an interactive resource.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Researchers who wish to use a 3D story to communicate with broad audiences.\_</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We see the Storymaker as an exciting way to trigger people’s curiosity about their own cultural heritage, to explore a protected monument through time, and to explore Europeana and discover the materials that illustrate different aspects of Europe’s history.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about the project and tools you can <a href=\"https://share3d.eu/\">explore the Share3D website</a> or browse the first set of Sketchfab models shared with Europeana through the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Share3D%22&amp;view=grid\">Share3D dashboard</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Understanding digital transformation across the cultural heritage sector'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Last week we invited our networks to take part in a special series of Europeana workshops on ‘Digital Transformation in the time of COVID-19’. In this post, we share other aspects of our ongoing efforts to understand, identify and shape a capacity building framework that meets the needs of the cultural heritage sector. In particular, how we are working with Culture24 to develop a shared understanding of what is happening in our sector to support digital capacity and what terms like ‘digital transformation’ mean in practice for GLAM institutions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana empowers the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation, and our approach sees digital capacity building to support this transformation as a priority. Yet the needs of cultural heritage institutions are many and varied. What does ‘digital transformation’ look like across our diverse sector? By gaining an understanding of what this term, and terms related to digital change, mean in practice for cultural heritage institutions, we can better understand their needs, and develop support for institutions to build capacity for digital.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-transformation-in-the-time-of-covid-19-join-our-workshops\">Digital Transformation workshops</a> will play a key role in this process. As we work and ideate with thought leaders from the sector, we will gain insights into the challenges and needs they face within their institutions, and how we can develop frameworks to support them. But understanding these needs requires a multi-faceted approach, and we are pleased to be able to explore this further through a special report we have commissioned with the organisation <a href=\"https://weareculture24.org.uk/\">Culture24</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report will consider what ‘digital transformation’ and ‘capacity building’ means in practice for GLAM institutions; provide a picture of what ‘state of the art’ looks like for programmes that support digital capacity building in the GLAM sector; and present best practice and insights into this issue from leading experts, practitioners and projects across the GLAM sector internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also explore how terminology related to digital change - including digital transformation, digital literacy, digital skills, digital capabilities and digital leadership - \_is used across the GLAM sector internationally. Insight into how these terms are understood, and even misunderstood, across the sector will help us to demystify their significance and build a shared understanding of their meaning to the sector. This will help identify gaps where knowledge and skills are missing and build capacity in areas of greatest need.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work will build on the recent <a href=\"https://one-by-one.uk/\">One to One multi-partner project</a>, which brings together academic researchers with museums, sector support organisations and policy makers across the UK. The project has helped museums define, improve, measure and embed the digital literacy of their staff and volunteers, and encourages staff at all levels to consider their own digital skills through exploring how they use, understand, manage and create digital. This helps institutions to understand what is needed to create a digitally fluent workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report will also present insights into this terminology through a series of structured interviews with leading experts, practitioners and projects across the international GLAM sector. This will map hot spots of activity by people leading best practice within and beyond the GLAM sector, and contribute towards high-level recommendations of its development.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This research and report, alongside our digital transformation workshops, form the first stage of our phased project to help us understand, identify and shape a capacity building framework that meets the needs of the sector. We will continue to work to gain insight from the experience and expertise of professionals from across the continent, and look forward to sharing our learning widely for the benefit of the sector.

                body: "<p>From 2020 onwards, while safeguarding the core components of the activities that have made Europeana an important agent of change over the past decade, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a> sees Europeana focus on a single task: supporting the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The COVID19 crisis has shown how attached citizens are to their cultural heritage and the importance of making this heritage available online. In these times of accelerated digital transformation,&nbsp; Europeana, as the digital cultural flagship initiative of the European Union, has a key role for bringing the heritage sector into the digital age,’ says&nbsp;Rehana Schwinninger-Ladak, Head of the unit 'Interactive Technologies, Digital for Culture and Education' for the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the full extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic begins to make itself felt, the need to embrace and support the digital transformation of Europe’s cultural heritage sector and to do so in an inclusive way, has never been clearer. The vision of this strategy, a digitally powered cultural heritage sector taking its place at the heart of society, is more important than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A focus on digital transformation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Good digital practices hold the key to many great things for cultural heritage institutions.’ says Harry Verwayen, Europeana Foundation&nbsp;Executive Director. ‘Digital transformation isn’t just about how cultural heritage institutions operate. It's&nbsp;about how they think. It isn’t just about technology and assets. It’s about people and skills. While we will continue doing what Europeana has become known for, like the collections website, we will put more emphasis in the coming years on supporting the sector from within, for example by developing a capacity-building framework that supports professionals in the sector in their development.&nbsp;We see a cultural heritage sector powered by digital contributing to a Europe powered by culture. Europeana’s role in that is to empower digital change in the cultural heritage sector.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the new strategy, all cultural heritage institutions, no matter where they are in their journey, will be supported in their own digital transformation. They will be supported to create good quality digital assets in standardised formats, which in turn enables them to share, explore, interrogate and use their collections in ways that fulfil their own 21st-century missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As both the common multilingual access point to digital European heritage and a powerful platform for storytelling, Europeana will enable cultural heritage institutions to transcend cultural and national borders and place their collections in the European context - to be part of the story of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nThree priorities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy has three priorities, each supported by a set of key objectives. We’ll look at each priority in turn over this series of Europeana Pro News posts, but here’s a quick summary:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Strengthen the infrastructure - The Europeana Initiative will invest in supporting innovation activities that keep the infrastructure aligned with state-of-the-art tech.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Improve data quality - The Europeana Initiative will invest resources in activities related to metadata and content improvement. It will use new technologies like machine-learning algorithms to enrich metadata records.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Build capacity - The Europeana Initiative will support institutions in their digital transformation. It will showcase the importance and added value of digitisation, adoption of standards, best practice and common solutions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How was the strategy developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This strategy was developed following the<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=COM:2018:0612:FIN\"> Report from the European Commission to the Parliament and the Council on the valuation of Europeana and the way forward (COM /2018/612)</a>. It is based on recommendations from the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/expert-group-digital-cultural-heritage-and-europeana-dche\">Expert Group on Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana (DCHE)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The strategy is informed by trends in four main areas: public expectations, market forces, technological innovation and global perspectives. It acknowledges the roles of each body within the Europeana Initiative: the Europeana Foundation, the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum. This collaboration creates a multiplier effect for the Initiative’s many activities at European level. Together with work undertaken at Member State level, this builds a balanced ecosystem to support Member States’ drive for digital transformation across the sector and across Europe.</p>\r\n"

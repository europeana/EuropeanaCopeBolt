                body: "<p>This October, Europeana has marked Black History Month by sharing stories of Black history from the past to the present - find out <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/get-involved-in-black-history-month-2022\">what we planned</a> and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/black-history\">explore our Black History Feature page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also want to explore and share what cultural heritage institutions can do to acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections, all year round. To do this, we posed this question to three expert organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.younghistoriansproject.org/\">The Young Historians Project</a> is an organisation of young historians of African and Caribbean heritage in Britain working on projects often related to overlooked historical moments. <a href=\"https://www.ourgeneticlegacy.org/\">Our Genetic Legacy </a>exposes and publishes lost family legacies of BIPOC Americans to diversify the current history of America to include all Americans. And the <a href=\"https://asalh.org/\">Association for the Study of African American Life &amp; History</a> are the founders of Black History Month in the United States. They disseminate information about Black life, history and culture to the global community. Read their insights below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>'Make histories and collections open and accessible' - Young Historians Project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many institutions, such as the<a href=\"https://blackculturalarchives.org/\"> Black Cultural Archives</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.racearchive.org.uk/\">Ahmed Iqbal Ullah RACE Centre</a>, have paved the way for others to look to house, preserve and celebrate the histories of Black Caribbean and African people in Britain. However, many institutions still gatekeep their collections, with limited access to the public. It is integral to the surfacing of these histories to make these materials and donated ephemera available to the wider public, not merely for academics or senior government officials. As we have seen from the growth of membership in the Young Historians Project, many younger people of Black Caribbean and African descent have a willingness to learn about our history but to be able to do so, these histories must be accessible. It is the mission of YHP to widen the accessibility of this knowledge, and we urge cultural heritage institutions to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Hannah and Ruben, <a href=\"https://www.younghistoriansproject.org/\">Young Historians Project</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>'Integrate technology' - Our Genetic Legacy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of Our Genetic Legacy’s work involves the biological and cultural descendants of the people whose stories we are sharing. I believe that cultural heritage institutions would greatly benefit from a similar approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So much of what is shared about Black history comes from the perspective of white men who inherited the privilege of those who once participated in enslavement. Chinua Achebe wrote, ‘Until the lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter.’ It is time to share the historical perspectives of the descendants. It is time to empower Black voices to tell Black stories by removing the barriers the gatekeepers of history have spent centuries fortifying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steps towards that end should include disbursement of resources from an equity vs equality standpoint. The equitable telling of Black history must include access to advanced technology to recover and scientifically analyse data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My organisation uses both DNA and advanced drone technology to restore and publish lost ancestral legacies. Without the use of technology, these descendants would never know their history beyond the stories of trauma and enslavement that are traditionally presented as a complete history. It is my hope that other institutions will follow the lead of Our Genetic Legacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Shellie Baxter from <a href=\"https://www.ourgeneticlegacy.org/\">Our Genetic Legacy</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Centre the Black experience’ - Association for the Study of African American Life &amp; History</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We must build coalitions among schools, galleries, museums, archives, libraries and other cultural institutions to advance and ‘centre’ the Black experience. These coalitions should be intersectional by design in order to represent the many identities and experiences that make up Blackness. We also have to commit to start our legacy on the continent of Africa taking our narratives beyond the transatlantic slave trade and other migratory events that impacted the descendants of Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also should petition the United Nations to extend the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/observances/decade-people-african-descent\">International Decade for People of African Descent | United Nations</a> another 10 years! We need more time to build alliances throughout the African diaspora.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Omar Eaton-Martínez, Executive Council Member, <a href=\"http://www.asalh.org\">Association for the Study of African American Life &amp; History</a>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>About the Jewish History Tours project</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jewish History Tours aims to engage the public with digitised Jewish heritage materials through self-guided audio-tours in different European cities. The project has brought together partners from the cultural and the tourism sectors, who might not normally work together, in order to promote cultural heritage in tourism in a systematic way. The establishment of connections between these groups of people provides an ecosystem around Jewish cultural travel fuelled by a shared purpose. We wanted to learn more about the process of creating and strengthening this ecosystem, and in doing so, how to make it more impactful in the longer-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we did&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We used the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> as a resource to help steer our conversation about the impact of digital cultural heritage. To investigate what an ecosystem means generally and what it looks like in the project specifically, we set out two core research questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What are the indicators of a (sustainable) digital heritage ecosystem?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">To what extent has the project helped to create or strengthen a sustainable ecosystem?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We interviewed partners, observed project meetings and held a brainstorming exercise with over 50 people. Based on the data we collected, we developed 16 sustainability indicators. Indicators are elements that can be measured to help us demonstrate if change has taken place.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we learned about sustainable ecosystems around digital heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 16 indicators fall into four categories that can help us to plan for and measure a sustainable ecosystem around digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Partner experience</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">An ecosystem is inclusive and partners are positive and proud.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><em>Indicators 1-3:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>Active and enthusiastic participation.</li>\r\n    <li>Members are proud of the result or output.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The ecosystem is inclusive.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Management</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An ecosystem is centrally organised around a common purpose, with plenty of opportunities for formal and informal knowledge sharing as well as moments of serendipity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Indicators 4-6:&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>There is a central organiser.</li>\r\n    <li>There are regular informal opportunities for discussion and knowledge-sharing.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>There is a shared sense of purpose and heritage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Engagement with digital cultural heritage.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The ecosystem results in something that is easy to use, available in multiple languages and that can be further exploited and built on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><em>Indicators 7-11:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>The ecosystem develops something that others can replicate within or outside of the same heritage field.</li>\r\n    <li>There are (digital) results for local communities to exploit.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>There is wider awareness of the heritage.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The created outputs are available in multiple languages and easy to use.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>The project can act as a use case from which to launch discussions with commercial or other partners.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Collaborations and crossovers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are internal and external cross-domain conversations about longer-term action, signs of new collaborations, and discussions about environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Indicators 12-16:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>There is future involvement in EU projects.</li>\r\n    <li>There is continued cooperation as well as new collaborations and planned activities after the project end.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Non-heritage/commercial stakeholders are engaged in discussions about future activities.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Commercial opportunities, non-commercial support and other funding are available.</li>\r\n    <li>Environmental considerations are a part of the longer-term discussion.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can you use these indicators in your work?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, talk with your project partners at an early project stage and plan for your impact. You can map out what you want your project to look like and where you want to be at certain project moments. You can use the indicators to help you create your change pathway (following <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-one\">Phase one</a> of the Impact Playbook).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, assess the impact of your project (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-two\">Phase two</a> of the Impact Playbook). You could add specific measurements (e.g. number and quality of discussions about environmental sustainability) that help you to measure your impact and reflect on your project’s potential sustainability. Here at Europeana we have more work to do to put these indicators into action and we’ll update you when we do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"mailto:info@jhn.ngo\">Reach out to the project</a> if you are interested in building sustainable ecosystems for cultural tourism. For more information about all things impact, join the the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Europeana Impact Community</a> (via the Europeana Network Association).</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! What can you tell us about the Museum Burg Posterstein and its focus on the Duchess of Courland?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The more than 800-year-old castle <a href=\"https://www.burg-posterstein.de/?lang=en\">Burg Posterstein</a> in Thuringia, Germany, houses a Regional History Museum. Only a few kilometres away from Posterstein are the castles of Löbichau and Tannenfeld, which were owned by the Duchess Anna Dorothea of Courland around 200 years ago. The Duchess of Courland knew the most important personalities of her time, and gathered statesmen, artists, citizens and nobility in her castle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Museum Burg Posterstein has been&nbsp;researching the history of the salon of the Duchess of Courland for more than three decades. Not only was she one of the richest women in Europe, she was also smart, politically interested and diplomatically skilled. We explore events that happened in Löbichau in exhibitions and books and put focus on people who were connected to the Duchess and her daughters. This enables us to take an ever more detailed look at Europe at the beginning of the 19th century and make visible the network of people connected to the Duchess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is ‘Salon Europa’?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://salon-europa.eu/en/saloneurope-analog-meets-digital-networking-then-and-now-europe-means-to-me/\">#SalonEurope: analog meets digital Networking then and now – Europe means to me …?\"</a> was a 2018 exhibition which explored the concept of the ‘salon’ in our time, and found success in both analogue and digital form. In several newer projects, we continue this idea. One of them is the ‘<a href=\"https://www.trafo-programm.de/2416_regionen/2583_altenburger-land\">Flying Salon</a>’ project in Altenburg County, funded by the Federal Cultural Foundation within the TRAFO program, where the citizens of the region have the opportunity to interpret the salon culture completely in their own way. Furthermore, the museum wants to establish a new meeting place that brings the historical salon to life in the former north wing of the castle, which is now being rebuilt. In addition, a VR project in cooperation with the University of Erfurt and the Erfurt University of Applied Sciences is intended to make the Löbichau Salon a virtual experience from 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://salon-europa.eu/en/\">website salon-europa.eu</a> provides information about such projects in English, in order to strive for further international networking on the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Some<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=edm_datasetName%3A%20734%2A\"> items from your collections</a> have recently been added to the Europeana website - can you tell us about the items that have been added?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first part of our collection we digitised, is the collection ‘Salon guests’ by Ernst Welker, drawing teacher of the Duchess of Courland’s granddaughters. During his stay at Löbichau Castle in 1819, he portrayed the Duchess and her family as well as other guests as mythical creatures. The collection consists of 47 watercolours with well-known Löbichau guests and two sketches. Ernst Welker is this year the focus of our special exhibition and new book of the same name, ‘Longing Destination Italy - The Painter Ernst Welker Travelling and in the Salon of the Duchess of Courland’ (in German).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why was it important to you to share these items through the Europeana website?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Welker's portraits of Löbichau salon guests reflect not only the freedom and openness but also the international network of the Duchess' salon. The collection touches a huge number of exciting biographies that are worth delving deeper into. The people depicted come from a wide variety of European countries and were already internationally connected during their lifetime. We are convinced that by making the collection visible on Europeana, we can reach a greater, more international audience. We believe that it offers the chance to exchange ideas with other institutions that are researching similar topics and have comparable collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How are you going to engage the public with these collections, online and in person?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We provide regular and detailed information about new research projects in our <a href=\"https://blog.burg-posterstein.de/category/in-english/\">museum blog</a> and on our website, and we also have a German language <a href=\"https://blog.burg-posterstein.de/lesezeit/\">podcast LeseZEIT auf Burg Posterstein</a>. We have taken part in the culture hackathon Coding da Vinci Ost in Leipzig with the Welker Collection, which resulted in the possibility to easily design and print out a Welker cover image for your transparent smartphone case using the <a href=\"https://cover.boutique/\">Cover Boutique web app</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digitised objects from the salon guests collection are also part of the VR salon, the implementation of which is currently in the final phase. In the virtual salon, visitors with VR glasses will be able to see the painter Ernst Welker at work, while his drawing student Emilie von Binzer presents her favourite portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also active on social media, and were delighted to win the DigAMus Award for Social Media in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How does this work fit in with your institution’s wider approach to digital?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We plan all exhibitions and educational projects both digitally and in analogue. We have been sharing our research results for many years now (in addition to analogue museum publications), since 2010, through the museum blog and, since 2021, in our podcast. Researchers benefit from the increased visibility, as does the museum itself, and this has resulted in many fruitful synergies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The salon of the Duchess of Courland is a European topic, which is why we&nbsp; increasingly communicate about it in English. Since 2018, we have worked hard to add our collection of salon guests to Europeana - tirelessly supported by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/peter-soemers\">Peter Soemers</a>, Chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Network Association Communicators Community</a>. Europeana is exactly the right place for this collection and we hope that this will lead to further international networking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You won the DigAMus Award for Social Media in 2021 - how do you think that social media can be used to support engagement with cultural heritage?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With our museum work, we want to show how cultural education can be rethought with the help of the Internet. Cultural education does not only have to take place on site in the museum. We find ourselves in a challenging world. Museums can participate in society with their educational work, they can strengthen the bond between citizens and their region and strengthen social values. For this we need concepts that look beyond the horizon, that break new ground, that encourage people to start talking to each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since the #SalonEuropa 2018 exhibition, we have repeatedly relied on hands-on activities that aim to interact with visitors and communicate knowledge in an entertaining way, both online and on site. Every further action strengthens our network of interested citizens and cultural institutions, which in turn has benefited us many times in our museum work. Our recommendation is therefore: Network, share your content, be communicative and stay open to new things.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Running from March to August 2022, Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/diversity-and-inclusion-task-force\">Diversity and Inclusion Task Force </a>aimed to manage the development of an approach to Diversity and Inclusion at Europeana, through consultation with professionals and peers from across the cultural heritage sector. One of the many valuable outcomes of the brilliant work developed by the Task Force was a roadmap and path to address key questions related to these issues in a clear, practical and efficient way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, before we could produce this, it was necessary to do a brave and honest exercise of self-awareness. As Task Force members, we considered ‘obvious’ aspects such as our privileged position, the certainty that we were missing important views and acknowledging our limitations to address all the issues raised by the community in the report, or the importance to define clearly what we mean when we use words as 'social equity', 'intersectionality'&nbsp;or 'empathy'&nbsp;and 'listening'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This challenging but much-needed work was the foundation for subsequent tasks and discussions. It was a demonstration of how to tackle complex questions while avoiding simplification, easy cliches, and inertia in ways to think about. Stop and think collectively about what seems natural and logical, before acting. This foundational work was pivotal to taking on a&nbsp; set of powerful regenerative actions planned for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a ripple of this work, the organisation I work for, <a href=\"http://thehappening.us/cultural-inquiry/\">Cultural Inquiry</a> initiated by <a href=\"https://thehappening.us/\">Happening Studio</a>, would like to continue the conversation by sharing some practical takeaways excerpted from our everyday practice on diversity and inclusion with different cultural institutions around the world. We use to start with (our or their) questions like:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reframe the frame</strong>: be aware of your ‘own diversity and inclusion glasses’. That doesn’t mean changing them, but considering that your own position is never neutral or unbiased. Be aware of your position in relation to the ‘standard’ dictionary definitions of Diversity and Inclusion. Ask yourself: ‘Who created this definition I am using? With what purpose? What do diversity and inclusion mean to me/to them? Is it the same to talk about Diversity and Inclusion with a Canadian curator as an Indonesian librarian?’ Everything starts with a question. Maybe you need to change the words to talk about the same concept, but it is important to build a basic shared understanding. We have learned a lot of our own biases and misconceptions working with children in our <a href=\"http://thehappening.us/cultural-inquiry/#1\">‘Children's Board’ Project</a>’. They help you to become aware of your point of view and be open to reshaping it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fair Play</strong>: Unconsciously, all of us have preconceptions. Diversity and Inclusion are no exception. Be aware and look inside yourself before identifying and labeling them. Explain to others what Diversity and Inclusion mean for you and why they are important. Spend time and energy to demonstrate the advantages of working from a Diversity and Inclusion perspective. Don’t take anything for granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Language, the big deal</strong>: a good example of this, connected with empathy, is the common phrase for ‘I am hungry’. In Japanese, the expression for this is ‘Stomach is getting empty’.&nbsp;It doesn't specify whose stomach, nor does it signify the singular or plural of a stomach. Ultimately, this phrase in Japanese reaches people’s collective memory (heritage) of what it means to be hungry together since we all have felt hungry before. Words create realities. We need to perceive these subtle universes inside language. If we don't,&nbsp;we miss important nuances. Diversity and Inclusion can be implemented if the use of language is more aware and empathetic of others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Long-term diversity and inclusion</strong>: be ready to, ‘Put on everybody's shoes’ (but first, you need to be barefooted). The best Diversity and Inclusion training is to practice deep listening and empathy to see others as they really are. That’s not easy and immediate. It implies being part of the other one's life in some meaningful way. Think about the story that they are sharing with you, and try to be part of it contributing with something positive: an idea, a different approach, a question, a solution, a skill, a connection. Storytelling (personal stories but also object stories) is an optimal way to work in diversity and inclusion in the long term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Zoom in/Zoom out</strong>: there is no Diversity and Inclusion specific area so don’t seek it. Diversity and Inclusion is everywhere, it permeates the cultural heritage we rummage through; from words to graphic representations, from the fabrication techniques and materials involved in the material production to heritage 'preservation'&nbsp;and communication. Be alert and trained to widen the angle and connect the (apparently) disconnected dots.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion or Inclusion and Diversity</strong>? What’s the 'correct'&nbsp;order? Is there a 'correct'&nbsp;order? Maybe there is no single answer for this because it is contextual and situational. Some realities demand to focus on Inclusion as a condition to reach Diversity creating for example a place where everyone can feel psychologically safe to become themselves. Or just the contrary considering all the identities possible to implement suitable inclusive measures with their own reinforcements. We need to consider social equity as a bridge between both, as the active commitment to justice, fairness, and equality. And we need also to think that social categories are interconnected. Be flexible and be available to work with different scenarios and frames. Focus on the 'How'&nbsp;more than on the 'Why'. Diversity and Inclusion is always a long ongoing journey, not a destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Last but not least, no slogans please but reality</strong>. Diversity and Inclusion are moving fast towards an expanded longer acronym adding terms such as 'Equity', 'Accountability'&nbsp;etc. Capital letters should not skew your perception of reality. Don’t force reality to fit into the schemes and comfort zones. Just connect and flow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about Cultural Inquiry, <a href=\"http://thehappening.us/cultural-inquiry/\">please visit our website</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:hi@thehappening.us\">hi@thehappening.us</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>The challenge of multilingual metadata</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana works with collections described in no less than 37 languages and strives to match them with search terms that may occur in any language. All items in the collections on the Europeana website are described in a set of metadata fields that convey essential information about them, such as their title and creator. This information helps people to discover and understand the objects they are interested in. Currently, the majority of records contain terms in a single language, the data providers’ language. This lack of multilingual metadata hampers Europeana’s goal of offering broad access to its collection across languages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Addressing multilinguality in this respect is quite a challenging endeavour. To begin with, metadata isn’t a natural language with complete sentences and predictable grammar; it is often presented in short phrases or even single words, which means that the context needed for an accurate translation is difficult to find. In addition, the terms used can be very specific; they may look like a general term but have a different meaning when used in a cultural heritage context.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the Greek religious term reflecting the Last Supper could be incorrectly translated as Secret Dinner. The repercussion of this inaccurate translation - or the absence of a translation to English altogether - would be that Greek artefacts with a title or description referring to the particular theme would not appear among the results when someone searches for paintings about the Last Supper on the Europeana website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building a bridge between Europeana and eTranslation Digital Service communities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How is the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">Europeana Translate</a> project working with other stakeholders and tools to address this challenge?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed by the European Commission, <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/language-technologies-multilingualism\">eTranslation</a> is a language tool created using the newest AI technologies and has been trained on the large amounts of data available both in-house and gathered through an EU-wide language resource collection effort. In the <a href=\"https://elrc-share.eu/\">ELRC-SHARE</a> repository used by the eTranslation DSI, cultural heritage is underrepresented, and, as a result, existing technology solutions are less well-equipped to handle the specific aspects of cultural heritage data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this context, building collaborations between stakeholders from the Europeana and eTranslation communities is key to customising machine translation tools so that they can serve the particular needs of the cultural heritage domain.&nbsp; Europeana Translate seeks to bring the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/language-technologies-multilingualism\">eTranslation</a> and the Europeana communities together to address challenges encountered by both sectors. Improving multilingual access to digital cultural heritage requires a number of complementary roles and expertise, which are served by the diverse partners of Europeana Translate (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-translate\">see them here</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Experiments with machine translation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past several months, project partners have worked together to select and appropriately segment and clean metadata records from the Europeana website. This data was then exploited by project partner&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pangeanic.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668768064536000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KTCsFCNUVF_vrWVmDLM2I\" href=\"https://pangeanic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pangeanic</a>, who used it on top of 12 million translation textual segments from existing generic language resources to improve the accuracy of machine translation algorithms when translating cultural heritage metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pangeanic&nbsp;conducted a number of experiments&nbsp;considering different combinations of training data. This included bilingual metadata from Europeana, synthetic data produced from metadata in one language, and multilingual vocabularies relevant to the cultural heritage domain. Alternative sources of data, beyond Europeana, were also considered for languages for which few or no resources with translations to English exist. The automatic evaluation of these experiments using established metrics allowed partners&nbsp;to decide on the setup for the best-quality automatic translations and compare them with the results achieved by other translation tools, such as Google Translate and eTranslate. In general, the evaluation demonstrates improvements in results compared to generic models for most languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The machine translation engines resulting from this process&nbsp;will be used to translate metadata from the 23 official EU languages to English (the 24th official language). These&nbsp;translation engines will be used to generate automatic English translations for at least 25 million metadata records on the Europeana platform. The translations will be indexed and displayed, improving the multilingual user experience on the Europeana platform. Revisiting the person who searches for artefacts inspired by the religious theme of the 'Last Supper', after the completion of Europeana Translate, they will be able to also access paintings from Greece, Romania and many other countries that are currently not included in the search results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, Europeana Translate will make openly available the selected and appropriately processed language resources it produced via the ELRC-SHARE repository under a free reuse licence (CC0). This will enable the machine translation community to make use of open data&nbsp;to train, adapt&nbsp;and test their translation services in the cultural heritage domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Involving humans in the loop</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming months, two complementary evaluations of the automatic translations produced by the experiments will be carried out by linguists and cultural heritage professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://mtet.pangeamt.com/main\">Machine Translation Evaluation Tool</a> will be used to evaluate the accuracy and performance of all 23 translation engines. Three crowdsourcing campaigns will be organised to engage cultural heritage professionals to help test and evaluate automatic translation (the languages to be evaluated in this respect include French, Italian, and Dutch). The campaigns will also engage audiences and raise awareness in the cultural heritage community about the power of automatic translation services. The <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en\">CrowdHeritage platform</a> will be used to present the automatic translations in the context of the cultural heritage items to which they refer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The results of these evaluations will provide useful insights and be used to determine the acceptable quality threshold for publishing automatic translations to Europeana and for use on cultural heritage organisations’ own platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more and get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more, you can watch an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGiKvbsCobs\">introductory video</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxGORZpzJ94\">video about the project’s first results</a>, or read about the Europeana Translate architecture in this <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2022.eamt-1.39.pdf\">paper</a> presented at the European Association for Machine Translation 2022. Professionals in the field of audiovisual, fashion and museums will have the chance to contribute to the project by helping evaluate the results in our niche-sourcing campaigns, which will occur at the beginning of 2023.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The <a href=\"https://www.erm.ee/en\">Estonian National Museum</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(ENM), collaborating with creative agency <a href=\"https://domesticstreamers.com/\">Domestic Data Streamers</a> as part of the <a href=\"https://www.memind.eu/the-project/\">Me-Mind</a> project, recently closed its doors on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ExDsJDDRGc\">Number Fascination</a> exhibition. As well as questioning, celebrating and promoting better data collection practices about impact, the exhibition served as a data collection opportunity itself. We ask Pille Runnel, research director and deputy director (Estonian National Museum), and Me-Mind project leader Marzia Cerrai (Fondazione Sistema Toscana) about what they learned and their tips for other heritage institutions that want to embed impact and data collection into their exhibitions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us about the ‘Number Fascination’ exhibition, and how you collected data at it?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the Me-Mind project and the ‘Number Fascination’ exhibition we aimed to measure and visualise the impact of culture. We explored and explained how measuring and counting have historically evolved and how contemporary society has become a ‘datafied society’ which is heavily dependent on numbers and data analysis. While the exhibition showed the way data is linked with the digital, our interactive objects were analogue and hands-on, from playful interaction with worksheets to collectively creating a wall of coloured threads. We conducted observations and obtained additional insights into the kinds of visitors attending the exhibition and how they preferred to consume culture (for example, events, books or films).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did you want to achieve with the exhibition?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Estonian National Museum&nbsp;actively participates in research and learning projects. The Me-Mind project has helped us to advance how we collect and use data, not just for our internal decision-making and capacity-building, but also for how we communicate, interact and learn from our audiences. Our participation in the <a href=\"https://www.museumsofimpact.eu/\">Museums of Impact</a> (MOI) project has also been part of this journey, helping us to think about impact from the perspective of the organisation’s self-development and self-evaluation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are still learning how to implement a richer indicator framework that could help us manage the museum in a different way. Making an exhibition on measuring and counting, including how contemporary society is ‘datafied’, and asking visitors to participate in data collection was an intervention into this status quo, pointing out that data does not only ‘belong’ to the management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It creates the impression that impact is expressed by outputs (such as visitor numbers, publications or exhibitions). But this is not enough to inform actual planning at different levels of the organisation. Data collection can be implemented into other processes and is relevant at all stages of work. The exhibition was primarily an experiment to make this idea visible to colleagues outside the project team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Making our own institution more aware of the opportunities of using different data sources and approaches to create new ones besides conventional visitor surveys remains a priority even after closing the exhibition. For example, curators still have to realise the value of exhibitions as an opportunity for data collection and communication. Exhibition-based data collection can also support other areas of museum work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key advancement in the Me-Mind project and the exhibition was replacing one-way reporting with two-way, real-time communication. We call this info-experiences.&nbsp;Real-life data collection that is simultaneously collecting information and curating the experience is rewarding for both the institution and its audiences. The strength of designing these info-experiences is the interaction of the audience: their participation creates the data set, which is communicated back in a meaningful way in real-time. We are also developing the digital version of the exhibition to be used as part of educational programmes for children and young people.</p>\r\n"

However, organisations should collect data that is meaningful for them that shows how they are creating impact in these areas. Standard indicators might not be suitable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s important not to forget that data is something we can generate ourselves. In the Me-Mind workshops, we used tools as simple as a piece of paper and a set of stickers. It is not likely that small cultural organisations will be employing data scientists any time soon. These simple data collection methods can also serve as an enabler of the basic interpretation of data, which can be carried out without advanced skills in data analytics. However, it’s important that you have some basic skills in data collection and analysis - you will need to be able to contextualise the findings in your particular setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s important to keep human elements at the centre of impact discussions. Data collecting and data visualisation merge into the experiences and cultural formats offered by the particular institution. For us, we could experiment with the museum exhibition format, but others might experiment with a festival or another part of their programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can we do now?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to find out more and access resources around data collection and impact in the cultural heritage sector, explore the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.memind.eu/results/#rigacasiduso\">download</a> the Me-Mind project’s impact canvas and guidelines on data, impact and the cultural and creative industries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I came to academia rather late, after several years of freelancing as a writer and researcher in South Africa, where I am originally from. In the early 2000s, I worked for a nonprofit called The African Commons Project, which was affiliated with Creative Commons. Working on free culture and open access topics sparked my interest in digital cultural heritage and the complexities and joys of working with it. This led to a PhD in Digital Humanities, where my research focused on the institutional, technical and conceptual changes that take place in large museums when they digitise their collections and records.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since&nbsp;then, I have basically been obsessed with museum records and their digital surrogates and how the processes of digitisation and ingestion into large-scale, federated collections impact the ways in which people share, consume and understand digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right now, I am on maternity leave, so I am mostly working on making sure I remember to brush my teeth! But when I am not parenting, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the History department at the University of Vienna. My project looks at the museological and ethical issues involved in using linked open data to build digital heritage infrastructures. As museum professionals, we are used to using complex evaluation and decision-making processes for dealing with sensitive heritage materials. But these aren’t always appropriate in the digital context. So part of my project involves developing an evaluation framework for Linked Open Data collections, which take all of these issues into consideration, and will, hopefully, help producers and consumers of Linked Open Data collections to plan how and what they share.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a non-technical person, the learning curve has been quite steep when it comes to understanding what is and is not possible with Linked Data.&nbsp;But I have been very lucky to work with colleagues who do have those skills, and are generous with their knowledge, and incredibly patient. These kinds of collaborative working relationships are also one of my favourite elements, especially since it is not always the norm in academia. I also love being given access to museum collection records. There is nothing I enjoy more than rummaging through such troves of data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have used Europeana as a source of research material for several years, and am fascinated by the technical infrastructure and architecture of the project. So one reason for joining the Members Council was to help me to understand the platform better. As someone who spends a lot of time thinking about metadata, I can't imagine a better place to be, to engage with people who think deeply about the quality of data all the time. But I also hope I can contribute to the Members Council in whatever ways possible as a&nbsp; way of putting something back into Europeana, since I have benefitted so much from it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />As well as participating in the general activities, I have joined the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Research Community</a> Steering Group in order to get a better idea of the kinds of questions and requirements that researchers have of Europeana, both within the Members Council and in the broader network. I hope to learn from the archivists, librarians and technical folks who make up that community. I also hope to be able to contribute some of my own research findings on the use of Linked Open Data in heritage institutions to help inform the activities of the Members Council as a whole. And to make new friends!</p>\r\n"

These entries remixed 106 digitised cultural heritage collection objects sourced from GIF IT UP partners (51 from Europeana), and these objects came from 37 different cultural heritage institutions located in 20 countries across the world. <a href=\"https://gifitup.net/winners-2022\">Explore the winners</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">New partners and new languages</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana runs GIF IT UP in partnership with organisations from around the world, including Japan Search, Art Institute of Chicago, DAG Museums, DPLA, Digital NZ and Trove.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year we welcomed two new partners, Canada’s Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ) and Uruguay’s Centro de Fotografía de Montevideo. Both institutions shared their openly licensed collections, giving participants more cultural heritage to explore and be inspired by. A humourous GIF depicting the airship Graf Zeppelin from the Centro de Fotografía de Montevideo&nbsp;collection has received the prize for the first time GIF-maker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />To help French-speaking GIF-makers find their way through the website, with the help of BAnQ, we launched the <a href=\"https://gifitup.net/fr/\">French version of the GIF IT UP website</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>On April 15, 2019 Notre-Dame in Paris caught fire. The images and videos of the famous cathedral burning and portions collapsing sped across the world. Once the ash settled, the world asked how the cathedral would be rebuilt. While much discussion focused on the famous aesthetics and ceiling including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/20/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-rebuild-medieval-carpenters-guledon\">the wood and carpentry skills</a> needed to accurately restore the cathedral, an element that went slightly under the radar, the sound of Notre Dame, was being tackled. <a href=\"http://www.dalembert.upmc.fr/home/katz/\">Brian Katz, an acoustics researcher from CNRS</a> and his team got to work the day after the fire. Using models and measurements made in 2014 to document the acoustics of Notre Dame along with prior acoustic measurements, texts and images, Katz’s team are ensuring that every step of Notre Dame’s restoration will <a href=\"https://www.snexplores.org/article/giving-notre-dame-back-her-unique-voice-acoustics\">ensure that the space sounds the same as it did before the destruction</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Heritage acoustics’ is a growing field of research within cultural heritage and the Notre Dame fire certainly brought its importance to the fore. In short, heritage acoustics uses different measurement techniques, in particular impulse responses to document how sound reacts in a specific space. Anyone who’s stepped into any cathedral or concert hall and clapped their hands or whistled and listened to the reverb trail off has, at a very elementary level, conducted an impulse response.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This intangible heritage brings an incredibly valuable level of documentation for heritage sites. For EuropeanaTech, who over the years have helped make great strides in the field of 3D heritage thanks to the hard work of Kate Fernie and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">3D Content in Europeana Task Force</a> and Working Group, heritage acoustics is a logical topic to explore next, especially considering the continued improvement of audiovisual content playout on Europeana. Read on to discover&nbsp;a few different ways heritage acoustics can be used in different creative reuse endeavors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Convolution reverb</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Convolution reverb is a digital signal processing effect where one can input an audio signal - you playing guitar in your bedroom - and then in the computer apply the convolution reverb of the Sydney Opera House, making your bedroom guitar recording sound like it was being played in the Sydney Opera House.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process of creating convolution reverb software relies on the same techniques used in heritage acoustics, taking multiple impulse responses at different spaces within a room. Convolution reverbs on the market today are provided by commercial companies like Altiverb by Audio Ease and are considerably expensive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As heritage organisations and researchers begin to document more and more historic spaces and recreate spaces lost to time, they should consider adding&nbsp;the creation of convolution reverb VSTs (Virtual Studio Technology) in an open and inexpensive way to the project plan. This will allow artists from around the world to experience the unique historical acoustics of countless historic spaces all from their own computers and take this as inspiration to create new music and share it with even more people. <a href=\"https://www.openair.hosted.york.ac.uk/\">The OpenAIR project</a> is a great source of inspiration for this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Augmented reality&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another powerful usage for acoustic models is to add deeper layers of detail to augmented reality instances. This process is known as auralisation - the audio version of visualisation and is already being done by many initiatives. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.lam.jussieu.fr/Projets/index.php?page=GhostOrchestra\">Ghost Orchestra</a> to celebrate the 850th birthday of Notre Dame in Paris or the lost performances by the University of Edinburgh of a <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/636883/experience-a-scottish-concert-as-it-would-have-sounded-in-1512/\">1512 Easter celebration performance at Linlithgow Palace</a>. Another initiative, <a href=\"https://virtual-music-heritage.fr/portfolio-item/tours-1480-3d-saint-martin/\">Virtual Music Heritage</a>, offers a short time machine, back to a specific day in the life of Jean de Okeghem, master of the royal choir at Collegiate Saint Martin in Tours, France back in 1480. The Collegiate Saint Martin was destroyed in the 17th century, but with combined 3D reconstruction and auralization, one can join Okeghem and the choir for practice in the beautiful building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These are just a handful of examples. In practice, acoustics offer the potential to not only provide a deeper and often overlooked level of documentation when it comes to preservation, but the creative reuse potential while either immediate or for enrichment is boundless. As we lose more architectural landmarks to climate change, war, urbanisation or simple disrepair, let’s not forget that a space’s character is not just what it looks like but also how it sounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more heritage acoustics,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-presents-acoustics-in-cultural-heritage\">watch a EuropeanaTech webinar</a>&nbsp;on the topic! You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">join EuropeanaTech</a>,&nbsp;the community of experts, developers, and researchers from the R&amp;D sector within the greater Europeana Network Association, to contribute to - and be the first to hear about - discussions in this area!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We are delighted to announce that the European Commission has funded four projects under their new flagship initiative for deployment of the common European data space for cultural heritage. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/digital/wp-call/2022/call-fiche_digital-2022-cultural-02_en.pdf\">call for these projects</a>, launched in spring 2022, aimed at&nbsp;seizing the opportunities of advanced technologies for the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector. This included a focus on 3D, artificial intelligence or machine learning for increasing the quality, sustainability, use and reuse of data, which we are excited to see the projects explore in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Foundation is a beneficiary in all funded projects, joining partners from 11 EU countries. The projects will start from January 2023 and run for two years. Find out more about their scope and goals below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EUreka3D - European Union's REKonstructed content in 3D</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project aims to build the capacity of small cultural heritage institutions by creating the Eureka 3D platform, a knowledge hub based on a smart technical infrastructure. The platform will allow institutions to store, manage, model and enrich 3D assets. It will have a knowledge base with holistic information to strengthen the creation and reuse of 3D content and 3D technologies within the sector. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/eureka3d-european-union-s-rekonstructed-content-in-3d\">Find out more</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5DCulture - Deploying and demonstrating a 3D cultural heritage space</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project aims to enrich the offer and management of 3D digital cultural heritage assets in the common European data space on topics such as fashion, architecture and archaeology. The project will explore specific scenarios for the reuse in domains such as education, tourism and the wider cultural and creative sector. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/5dculture-deploying-and-demonstrating-a-3d-cultural-heritage-space\">Find out more</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>DE-BIAS - Detecting and cur(at)ing harmful language in cultural heritage collections&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project will work towards making cultural heritage metadata more inclusive. For this, it will create a tool that automatically detects offensive terms, and provides information on their problematic background. It will use a vocabulary that will pair biassed language with contextual information and suggestions for appropriate terms. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/de-bias\">Find out more.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>AI4Europeana - An AI platform for the cultural heritage data space</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project aims to develop the ‘ AI4Culture platform’, an online capacity building hub for the application of artificial intelligence technologies in the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp; The AI4Culture platform seeks to offer AI services to satisfy various needs of cultural heritage institutions in a modular and flexible manner so that the services can be incorporated into different institutions’ workflows. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai4europeana-an-ai-platform-for-the-cultural-heritage-data-space\">Find out more</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Saving the invisible</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As physical buildings reflect visual architectural heritage from their times of design and use, the acoustic environments of their enclosed spaces constitute intangible aural heritage that is likewise historically relevant. Performing artists and audiences sometimes regard concert halls and recording studios with exceptional acoustical qualities as ‘temples of sound.’ Music created, heard and felt in such spaces is profoundly shaped by the acoustic environment of the venue that constitutes an unseen but influential dynamic&nbsp;heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intangible cultural heritage in the United States may be most abundantly preserved in recorded music. Recording studio acoustics have driven the aesthetics of popular music through these structural contributions to the recording process. Still, the material influence of recording room acoustics in trends in popular music has been greatly overlooked, although acoustical and auditory science provide theory and methods to document and describe it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Music Row</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nashville, Tennessee, has been long established as a major center for commercial music production, home to over 180 recording studios, 130 music publishers, 100 live music clubs and 80 record labels. Music Row is the core locale in Nashville, where today's booming music industry was born. Much of that industry began and remained in this unique district that changed the face of American music and brought authentic regional music to a popular mass audience. Few cultural communities have as significantly developed in just one geographic zone, that also have shaped a worldwide cultural expressive trend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.riaa.com/reports/nashville-music-industry-impact-contribution-and-cluster-analysis/\">Harper’s study</a> demonstrated a statistical measure called 'location quotient'&nbsp;to chart the concentration of music-related businesses, including recording studios, distributors, record labels, and music publishers in metro areas in the USA and Canada, with populations over 500,000. Nashville appears as the top-ranked city with an index value much greater than any other city. The Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce’s Research Center also showed that Nashville’s density of music industry activity is currently 2-to-30-times greater than in the nation overall, up to 10-times greater than New York or Los Angeles, cities that also boast a concentration of music production venues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Endangered spaces</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nashville is now suffering from the continuous demolition of dozens of historic buildings for lucrative redevelopment. Recording studios, record labels, publishing houses, supporting industries, and other music-related businesses are rapidly being replaced with condominiums, hotels, and office buildings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2015, the <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/places/nashvilles-music-row#.Y4j1P-zMIeY\">National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP)</a> designated Music Row as a ‘National Treasure,’ characterised as a highly significant yet threatened historic place, one of many throughout the country where the organisation is committed to working with local partners to ensure their future. The recent progress on the Music Row preservation plan is encouraging; however, merely maintaining the physical presence of Music Row buildings does not guarantee the preservation of their intangible cultural heritage – the historic music-making venues. In order to preserve what matters most significantly in these Music Row buildings, their aural heritage, we must document and preserve their acoustic environments.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Preservation of recording studio acoustics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2017, we formed a <a href=\"https://savingplaces.org/stories/sound-hounds-how-one-research-team-is-helping-preserve-the-acoustics-of-historic-places#.Y3GxqezMIeY\">cultural heritage acoustics research and technologies development team</a> that subsequently received funding from <a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/news/team-receives-grant-recreate-sound-signature-cultural-heritage-sites\">the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)</a> in the U.S.A. Our first case-study location was Columbia Studio A (CSA) in Nashville, founded in 1954 by brothers Owen and Harold Bradley. It has been a popular destination for recording artists of that time, particularly country music stars such as Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash. In 1962, the studio was sold by the Bradley Brothers to Columbia Records. The studio would continue to have legendary artists come through its doors, including sessions for Bob Dylan’s critically acclaimed album 'Blonde on Blonde.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal was to document the acoustics of Columbia Studio A via many different source and receiver combinations that represent locations that musicians would inhabit during the recording process. We tested a variety of equipment configurations and combinations to collect aural heritage data, then conducted both acoustical analyses and perceptual evaluations to develop best-practice recommendations for preserving aural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Case-study aural heritage documentation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The case-study sites chosen for our project extend beyond music venues, to create a comparison group of culturally, architecturally, and temporally specific examples of endangered aural heritage. After the initial study of Columbia Studio A, we adapted our method to a much larger room, the Rochester Savings Bank, located in downtown Rochester, New York, U.S.A. This building with an ornate and multi-material Byzantine revival interior is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for its significance for art, architecture&nbsp;and commerce. We intersected with the archaeological community focusing on the interior architecture at the 3,000-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Centre archaeological site at Chavín de Huántar, Peru, one of the best-preserved examples of pre-Columbian architecture in the Americas. These culturally distinct and diverse spaces provide different aural environments to test and demonstrate the extensibility of our method across&nbsp;fieldwork contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are interested in finding out more about the work above, visit the team’s <a href=\"http://www.auralheritage.org/\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more heritage acoustics, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-presents-acoustics-in-cultural-heritage\">watch a EuropeanaTech webinar</a> on the topic.&nbsp;You can also <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">join EuropeanaTech</a>, the community of experts, developers, and researchers from the R&amp;D sector within the greater Europeana Network Association, to contribute to - and be the first to hear about - discussions in this area!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What inspired the Albertina’s open access policy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The desire to share the works of our comprehensive collection with our fellow human beings and the curiosity to see what happens. We are excited to see in which contexts the works will be seen, how they will serve online users, which questions they will raise, and with which content they will be associated. As Klaus Albrecht Schröder, Albertina’s Director General, put it, ‘If art is objectively in the world, it's not there to hibernate in storage, but to become visible, audible, and legible.’<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Albertina sees making its collections accessible to the public as one of its core tasks, not only within the framework of exhibitions, but also by digital means and without limitations, within the legal framework of copyright. We want our fellow human beings to be able to express their creativity, answer scientific questions, and realise entrepreneurial ideas with our works, without restriction and in the clear context of free use. Admittedly, it also gives us pleasure when our works are seen more often.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What benefits do you think open access will bring to the Albertina? How do you measure this?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The decision to adopt an open access policy was made at the Albertina more or less independently of such considerations. Rather, it seemed to us as a museum – with the clear intention of communicating art and bringing it closer to people – that there was no alternative to releasing our works as liberally as possible for research and innovation. To quantify the benefits of this approach for our organisation is, in some respects, beyond the scope of conventional evaluation schemes. Of course, it is possible to evaluate and assess results in certain areas, but these results are only one piece of a puzzle that needs to be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing people engaging with Albertina artworks, becoming inspired and creative is a big part of the desired outcome, without it necessarily being possible to capture in numbers.</p>\r\n"

Every researcher knows about the great effort that clarifying image rights entails. The Albertina has always tried to support scientific research by providing the widest possible access – so labelling the works with the Public Domain Mark was the next logical step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another priority for us is that educators should be able to use our works freely for teaching and knowledge transfer. In this context, Austria’s national aggregator <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/kulturpool\">Kulturpool</a> and Europeana Foundation are important supporters of these wonderful efforts. Numerous examples show us that public domain works empower teachers and drive educational outreach. It is our goal to reach as many people as possible through this strategy and to inspire them with art.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you think the open policy will impact the museum’s commercial activities?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, the open policy will certainly influence our commercial activities. But we are very confident that it will do so in a positive sense. This field has been undergoing sustained change since the onset of digitisation, and we will see how it is composed in the future.&nbsp; In fact, with our open policy, we believe we are in a position to break new ground.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am Assistant Professor at the University of Coimbra’s Department of Informatics Engineering. I teach web technologies, interaction design and virtual and augmented reality. Before joining the University of Coimbra in 2015, I was a professor at the Portuguese Catholic University, which I joined right after finishing my degree in Informatics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have always had an interest in Informatics from the point of view of understanding how people use the technologies we develop and also from the point of view of creating new possibilities for interaction. More recently, this interest has focused on virtual and augmented reality and the cultural heritage domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Too many things! But let’s focus on a few of the most important ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently coordinator of the Bachelors degree in Design and Multimedia in the Department of Informatics Engineering. This more managerial role comes at the cost of having less time for research and for preparing teaching materials, but allows me to better understand the needs of the students and of the institution and to have a more active role in setting the current and future vision for the bachelor program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am also currently setting up a Virtual Reality Lab at our department. This entails getting funding for equipment and installations, and promoting activities around this area within the department’s community - but also outside of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Research-wise, my students and I have been working on applications of virtual and augmented reality to different kinds of cultural heritage areas. A beautiful example (in my opinion) is the <a href=\"https://kairos.dei.uc.pt/\">Kairos project</a> in which we used photogrammetry to digitise three locations in the Botanical Garden of the University of Coimbra and then created a virtual reality experience that tries to recreate the ambience of the garden.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>And last, but certainly not least, I continue to try out new ways of teaching and creating new teaching materials for my students. In many of the courses I teach, I have tried to promote a connection with cultural heritage (and with Europeana, more specifically). For example, in the last edition of the Interactive Media Design course, I asked students to propose and design a mobile app that would take advantage of or contribute to the contents of Europeana. The results were a <a href=\"https://dmi.dei.uc.pt\">series of prototypes</a>, some of which were very creative. For instance, ARTence is a proposal for a mobile app that fetches pictorial references from Europeana for art students to exercise their drawing; or Artican, a mobile game where players are asked to recreate scenes from paintings found in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">University professors, as in many other professions, end up taking up many roles, each with slightly different challenges. Perhaps the main challenge is exactly the number of different roles one needs to take on and the amount of work that one is expected to accomplish. Juggling teaching, grading, jurying, research, management, etc., feels at times overwhelming. Fortunately, these difficulties are often shaded away by the positive appraisal of students, or by the achievements of the students themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I got to know the Europeana Network Association a bit by chance (a reference from a colleague) and felt that by joining the Members Council I could understand it a bit better and maybe also contribute to it in a more objective way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am still navigating my way around the Europeana Network Association and Members Council, and trying to find the best way to contribute. I would like my contribution to be in promoting the use of virtual and augmented reality for the exploration of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Launched in 2016, the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu/\">Transcribathon platform</a> has been further developed by two Generic Services projects: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enrich-europeana\">Enrich Europeana</a> (2018-2020) and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enricheuropeana\">Enrich Europeana Plus</a> (2021-2023). The platform allows volunteers to transcribe handwritten historical texts in different languages and from different historical periods, using nothing more than their computer. Since the projects started, over 372,000 documents have been transcribed by volunteers and turned into digital text files, helping to expand and enrich Europeana’s vast collections of digital cultural heritage items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2021, the Enrich Europeana Plus project began to update the Transcribathon platform with advanced handwriting recognition technology, which uses artificial intelligence to provide automatic transcriptions that can then be checked by volunteers. One of the biggest providers of such technology is <a href=\"https://readcoop.eu/about/\">READ-COOP</a>, a European Cooperative Society that manages the popular <a href=\"https://readcoop.eu/transkribus/\">Transkribus software</a>. Enrich Europeana Plus spent several months working with READ-COOP and incorporating their technology into the Transcribathon platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Linking Transcribathon with the ‘metagrapho’ API</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed as part of an <a href=\"https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/\">EU-funded project led by the University of Innsbruck</a>, Transkribus software enables historical handwritten documents to be automatically transcribed on a mass scale. The technology uses AI to ‘learn’ how to read specific types of handwriting, and then implements this knowledge to create automatic transcriptions of texts. This dramatically speeds up the transcription process: the transcriber no longer needs to spend hours writing a transcription from scratch, <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />as they can proofread the automatic transcription instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Handwriting recognition technology like Transkribus is particularly ideal for citizen science projects. The easier it is to transcribe those documents, the more documents the volunteers can process in a certain timeframe, and the faster the Europeana website can be enriched. The Transcribathon team were therefore keen to implement this technology into the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To do this, they decided to use READ-COOP’s <a href=\"https://readcoop.eu/api/\">metagrapho API</a> to enable Transcribathon to access the Transkribus technology. An API is a piece of software that acts as a messenger between two different platforms. Someone requests information on one platform, and the platform sends this request to the API of another platform. Once this second platform has a response to the request, the API brings it back to the first platform and the person gets the information they need.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Transcribathon platform uses the metagrapho API in exactly this way. When a volunteer wants to get an automatic transcription of a text,they request this on the Transcribathon platform. Transcribathon then sends this request to the metagrapho API, which uses handwriting recognition technology to process the image and generate an automatic transcription. Finally, once the processing is complete, the Transcribathon platform can access the transcription and show it to the volunteer, again via the metagrapho API.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The metagrapho API not only provides the transcription but also the coordinates for each line or even word found in the image - something that was not possible in the old version of Transcribathon. This feature makes it possible to then use the transcriptions for further applications, such as highlighting matching keywords in the text during a full-text search.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An enhanced transcription editor</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Updating the technology behind Transcribathon meant that the transcription editor - the part a volunteer uses to input their transcriptions - was no longer able to cope with the richer data format that it was receiving back from the metagrapho API. Therefore, READ-COOP built a custom transcription editor for Transcribathon. This allows people to click on a line of the transcription, and see the corresponding line in the image of the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To speed up the process, READ-COOP took the existing editor in the Transkribus software, modified it to fit the requirements of Transcribathon, and turned it into a widget. The widget was then simply inserted into the Transcribathon platform, making it possible for users to access and edit the transcriptions generated by the metagrapho API. Using the existing Transkribus editor and simply modifying it also saved precious development time and costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The power of collaboration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These technological updates take Transcribathon to the next level. Instead of creating time-consuming transcriptions from scratch, volunteers can now simply correct automatically generated transcriptions in the new transcription editor, helping them to process many more documents during a run.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">READ-COOP is currently training the handwritten text recognition AI models on the basis of material already transcribed, or for material soon to be transcribed, in Transcribathon. The better the AI model is adapted to the material in focus, the more accurate the automatic transcriptions will be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, one upcoming Transcribathon Run will feature scans of ration cards from the <a href=\"https://daz.hr/\">State Archives in Zagreb</a>, which were used during WW2 (from 1941 1945.) as a form of rationing food and other resources. The cards contain demographic and socioeconomic indicators for individuals and/or households like titles, jobs, and are therefore a rich source of research material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As preparation for this run, READ-COOP held a webinar with employees of the archive, to show them how to prepare training data. This training data will then be used to train a handwriting model or ‘teach’ the engine how to read documents of this type, so that it can provide more accurate transcriptions during the run. This, combined with the proofreading skills of the volunteers, should enable the Zagreb archive to digitise a larger number of documents than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can review&nbsp; the webinar on how to prepare training data in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uTB7fFqr3-0\">this video</a>. You will find the integration of the editor for automatic Handwritten Text Recognition on the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu/\">Transcribathon platform</a> and can <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu/index.php?page=acymailing_front&amp;ctrl=fronturl&amp;task=click&amp;urlid=31&amp;userid=15&amp;mailid=61&amp;noheader=1\">check out the first results</a> from the Dublin papers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Where information moves freely across sectors - securely, easily, usefully. Data spaces are designed to turn this vision into reality. They will ensure that Europe has a flourishing ecosystem of data sharing which offers alternatives to private and/or centralised platforms - an ecosystem based on the values of ownership, sovereignty and privacy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the data space, we have the opportunity to be bold and create new rules of engagement while upholding what we stand for. Stewarding this space means working with new and different partners and designing innovative methods of collaboration. And it means we will widen the variety of data formats available in Europeana, with a particular emphasis on 3D.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this rapidly evolving landscape and as we welcome a growing momentum in digital policy at EU and national levels, we will review the Europeana Foundation’s long-term strategy, striving for even greater impact and relevance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

And we aim to do it sensitively - aware that what we do has an impact on the very fabric of our planet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our values guide us to good decisions that can benefit our sector, its institutions and its people - starting within our own organisation and network. Refining our hybrid working practices will help everyone to balance work and home life, personal development and physical and mental wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, collaboration takes on even greater significance. As part of a consortium of 19 partners and in close cooperation with the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, we will deploy the common European data space for cultural heritage. With the advent of the data space, we look forward to enhancing the use of cultural heritage for the benefit of society and to delivering more in terms of diversity, inclusivity and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world we strive for is collaborative, diverse and inclusive, participatory and sustainable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><em>The more you give - the more you get.</em> This tagline summarises why the Europeana Initiative believes that investing in data quality matters. Aiming for the highest possible quality of metadata published on the Europeana website (for example, with meaningful titles and descriptions, contextual information about the subject or the creator of the object, information in multiple languages) will make it more likely that the content someone is looking for will be returned in search results. If the content is of high quality (with direct links to objects, and high resolution images), it is more likely that it will be used by teachers, students, researchers and creatives. Ultimately, the higher the quality of the data (the more you give), the more likely it is that cultural heritage institutions will be able to engage new audiences in new ways and have more visibility and relevance in society (the more you get).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tools to support data partners and aggregators&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together with our partners, the Europeana Initiative offers products, services, tools and frameworks which support cultural heritage institutions in their efforts to manage and deliver high-quality data to Europeana. For example, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> offers guidelines around the quality of content and metadata shared with Europeana, and is supported by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Europeana Publishing Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://metis-statistics.europeana.eu/en/\">Europeana Data Statistics Dashboard</a> helps cultural heritage institutions to understand more about the quality of the data they have published on the Europeana website. The Dashboard offers a good overview of several data quality dimensions for a given dataset, data provider, provider or even country. This makes it possible to identify areas for improvement.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Watch a video about the Dashboard below.<b> </b></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Data Statistics Dashboard and the EDM Tier Checker are products developed using <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana’s APIs.</a> The former was developed by the Europeana Foundation, the latter is a product developed by partners. This shows how others can contribute to the suite of products that support data quality, addressing use cases not covered by Europeana Foundation developed products and sharing them with the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Metis Sandbox&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most powerful product that the Europeana Initiative has developed to support the publication of high-quality data is the <a href=\"https://metis-sandbox.europeana.eu/\">Metis Sandbox</a>. Unlike the tools above, the Metis Sandbox allows data providers to evaluate the quality of data before it is published on the Europeana website, as it allows them to simulate the enrichment and publication procedure that Europeana will perform on their data. This means they can get feedback, see what their data would look like on the actual Europeana website and get insights into the quality of the data. The application helps aggregators and cultural heritage institutions get a sense of how well-prepared their data is for ingestion by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The development of the Metis Sandbox <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">began under the Europeana Common Culture Generic Services project</a>, and aimed to shorten the feedback loop between data partners and the Europeana Data Publishing Services (DPS) team. Using the Metis Sandbox, a data partner can work on the data without involving the Europeana DPS team. Data issues can be fixed at an earlier stage and feedback from cultural heritage institutions can be sought before the data is submitted to Europeana. This reduces a lot of the back and forth communication between institutions, an aggregator and the DPS team to make data ready for publication in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Powerful features</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Metis Sandbox is more than just a preview of the data in the Europeana website; it also offers features to analyse the data in a granular way and report the findings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, through the ‘tier report’ feature, a data provider can find formation on the quality of a specific piece of metadata. The report specifies, for example, the resolution of the image used as a representation of the cultural heritage object and explains why it complies with a particular quality tier. It specifies which metadata fields are expected to have a language attribute, and which fields have the language attribute and which do not. It also provides a full analysis of the quality of the contextual information, and where potentially more contextual information can be provided. This can help to identify areas for improvements, or at least clarifies what can be achieved with the data as it stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most recent feature introduced in the Metis Sandbox is the ability to analyse data quality criteria that are not part of the content or metadata tiers calculation. The titles and descriptions of cultural heritage objects are the first focus for this feature. Using this feature can&nbsp;help answer questions like ‘is this title or description unique?’ or ‘can we expect this title or description to be meaningful based on its length and the type of characters used?’. This way, someone using the Metis Sandbox will be informed of potential problems with titles and descriptions used in the data. Providing at least one of them is mandatory for a metadata record published in Europeana, and so it is expected that the reports about the quality of titles and descriptions will help to improve them over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This news post kicks off our January Europeana Pro News focus on the Metis Sandbox. In the coming weeks, we will focus on use cases for aggregators and cultural heritage institutions, as well as look to the future of the Metis Sandbox and how you can make the most out of it. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/news\">Keep reading Pro News for more</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>The transposition process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CDSM Directive caused much controversy in Sweden when it was adopted in 2019. In a country which has been pioneering in internet usage and digitisation, the new related rights for press publishers and new liabilities for online sharing were met by much discontent. In the end, Sweden was one of few EU countries that voted no to the CDSM in the European Council.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Striving to develop a balanced law proposal, the Swedish government opted for a comprehensive and inclusive implementation process. About a hundred stakeholders were invited to give input, article by article. A large part of the stakeholders were, however, either collective management organisations (CMOs) or online sharing services. Wikimedia Sverige and a few others created a network of cultural heritage and research institutions as well as civil society and internet users, to balance this and get a stronger voice. This was an important way to build common knowledge and increase the impact of the legislation, paving the way for – among other things – a major win on article 14, often referred to as the ‘safeguarding of the Public Domain’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the implementation, the Government launched a public inquiry that will review all exceptions and limitations in Swedish copyright law until November 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Text and data mining (TDM)</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new TDM exception opens up new possibilities for the general public as well as research and cultural heritage institutions to make reproductions and extractions for the purposes of TDM. The Swedish implementation also opens up for TDM to be performed on ‘photographic images’, that is, images that do not meet the threshold of originality, but are protected via a related right in Swedish copyright law. Furthermore, the implementation makes it clear that cultural heritage and research institutions that are integrated parts of other establishments should be able to perform TDM under these exceptions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preservation of cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Where the previous provisions only allowed public archives and libraries to copy any kind of work in their permanent collections for preservation purposes, the exception is now broadened to include all cultural heritage institutions. These are defined as public libraries and museums, archives as well as institutions dedicated to cultural heritage related to moving images and sound. It explicitly states that this exception overrides any contract stating otherwise. The updated section even includes computer software which was earlier excluded from copying for preservation purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, it is still only national and municipal archives as well as certain public and research libraries that are allowed to make copies of in-copyright works (except for computer software) for other reasons (such as research purposes).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital and cross-border teaching activities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Extended collective licences (ECLs) have a strong prevalence in Swedish copyright, unlike many other EU Member States. This system gives CMOs an ‘extended’ representation ‘power’: CMOs can grant licences for works that are not in their repertoire and authors that they do not represent, in certain contexts. Those who wish to make works available to the public but whose rights would otherwise be difficult to clear can approach the CMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Article 5 of the Directive creates an exception to use of copyright-protected material for educational purposes without permission, and explicitly recognises the possibility for these activities to take place across-borders. The Swedish implementation covers both digital or physical means, but the second paragraph states that the exception is not applicable if there is a licence easily available on the market that will allow for these uses. As the Swedish licence market is well-developed, there will probably be few cases where the exception is applicable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the system might be efficient for those that can afford to pay, it makes it hard for the less wealthy to access and distribute knowledge. Due to the prevalence of ECLs, some of the exceptions and limitations put forth in the CDSM Directive, especially concerning education, will likely have little effect in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Out of commerce works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Swedish implementation allows cultural heritage institutions to make copies of out-of-commerce works and publish them if there is no CMO representative of relevant rightsholders; if the material is published on a non-commercial website; if it is used for non-commercial purposes and if the names of potential rightsholders are indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If such a CMO exists, a new type of licence for out-of-commerce works can be applied. This licence covers all kinds of access and use of out-of-commerce works in the collections of cultural heritage institutions, whereas the exception only includes publishing of these works. In both sections, it is clearly stated that rightsholders can opt-out of their works’ publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive requires that cultural heritage institutions making use of the exception for out-of-commerce works need to publish information about the works on a platform managed by EUIPO. Interestingly, the Swedish government emphasises that this should not be seen as a requirement for publishing or using the works in question. They argue that it could not be deemed reasonable to share information about every single work used or to be used on the portal. Furthermore, they argue that it should not automatically lie in the cultural heritage institution’s responsibility to update the portal&nbsp;when uses are agreed under an ECL; instead,&nbsp;the parties to the licence may agree&nbsp;that&nbsp;this task can&nbsp;be carried out by a CMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the proposal, the government also indicates that the exception for out-of-commerce works should include photographic images, and that a work could be defined as out-of-commerce even if it is physically available for loan in a library. When it comes to the sufficient representativity of a CMO, the rules remain unchanged – the organisation needs to represent several rightsholders of works from the category in question which are in use in Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Public Domain</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From a cultural heritage perspective, the changes brought about by the implementation of article 14 – often called the ‘safeguarding of the public domain’ – is one of the large wins.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Swedish copyright law has a specific related right for photographic images, as distinguished from photographic works. Photographic works are covered by the usual copyright provisions, whereas photographic images, that do not reach a threshold of originality, are protected by a related right for 50 years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the implementation, however, a new exception is introduced to this related right. The exception stipulates that the related right is not applicable if the main motif of the image is a work of art no longer covered by copyright. The exception has a large potential for the digitisation and digital dissemination of Swedish cultural heritage, especially since it has been a fairly common practice to put restrictive Creative Commons licences on digitised public domain material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new legal text chooses the word konstverk, whose verbatim translation would be artwork, which is slightly broader than bildkonstverk (work of visual art) in the directive. The broader implementation opens up for broader and more inclusive digitisation practices, where types of art in the grey zone between bildkonstverk and konstverk are now surely included, such as folk art, textile arts, handicrafts, glass blowing, engravings and potentially old manuscripts with both text and image, as well as typography in fracture style.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As article 14 is implemented as an exception to the related right for photographic images, it is, however, unclear if 3D digitisation practices are also covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can read more about the transposition of the CDSM Directive in Sweden from the <a href=\"https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-1960729-om-upphovsratt-till-litterara-och_sfs-1960-729\">Swedish Parliament</a>, <a href=\"https://www.regeringen.se/49fcf0/contentassets/f44969a0911147e1bc4a7ca63e1577f0/upphovsratten-pa-den-digitala-inre-marknaden-prop.-202122278.pdf\">Swedish Government</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statensmedierad.se/aktuellt/nyheter/2022/ny-lag-om-upphovsratt-2023\">Swedish Media Council</a> (all in Swedish).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to learn more about copyright and digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">join the Europeana Copyright Community</a> and read our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/cdsm-series\">CDSM Directive Pro news series</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />When Metis (the application that Europeana uses to run its ingestion, aggregation and enrichment pipeline) was conceived, it was designed not only to make the Europeana Foundation’s work more efficient, but also to be a system that Europeana’s data partners can work with to make data processing easier and more rewarding for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the early days of Metis, only certain functionalities were available to aggregators, which mainly allowed them to check whether data could be accepted for ingestion in Europeana. But now that the <a href=\"https://metis-sandbox.europeana.eu/\">Metis Sandbox</a> has been released as a tool, all Metis workflow steps for testing data ingestion can be performed in one go through a user-friendly interface which also allows data to be previewed as if it were on the Europeana website. With this, the Europeana Initiative is getting closer to the ambitions set forth in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\">aggregation strategy</a> to help speed up dataset updates, involve contributors in testing and encourage data enrichment. This will in turn benefit the quality of our data and contribute to building capacity in aggregators.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What aggregators have to say about working with the Metis Sandbox</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/tom-miles\">Tom Miles</a>, Metadata Coordinator of the Europeana Sounds aggregator at the British Library, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kerstin-arnold\">Kerstin Arnold</a>, Manager (COO) of the Archives Portal Europe Foundation (APEF), have been using the Metis Sandbox since the early days. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/cosmina-berta\">Cosmina Berta</a>, Advisor for Project Management, Tools and Workflows, and her colleagues from the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek were involved with the Sandbox even earlier, from the pilot stages in the Europeana Common Culture project, and continue to use the Metis Sandbox regularly in their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Kerstin, working with the Metis Sandbox has streamlined the communication workflow between APEF, Europeana Foundation and the various archives providing data via APEF. ‘With the Metis Sandbox I can identify potential data issues myself before submitting the data to Europeana. I can also distinguish directly between issues that will have to be addressed by the archive and issues that APEF has to work on, like adaptations of the conversion to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Tom, it has been useful to see how a dataset is going to look when it is published on Europeana, because it’s not always easy to visualise the display from spreadsheets and XML files. It is now possible to see, for example, if more information should go in the title, whether there is too little or too much information in the description field, or whether the subject terms work properly. ‘It’s been really useful having access to the Metis Sandbox for the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Europeana%20Sounds%22&amp;qf=TYPE%3A%22TEXT%22&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3A%2A%2Fpublicdomain%2Fmark%2F%2A&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22The%20British%20Library%22&amp;query=&amp;view=grid\">Microsoft books dataset</a> - I’ve been able to review this dataset using the Sandbox and spotted several things that needed changing.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Cosmina, ‘the Metis Sandbox is very successful in the Europeana aggregator community and we, the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek, are extremely proud to have contributed to the developments of such a practical tool. We use it for all our Europeana deliveries and it is so helpful to be able to flag issues early enough in the data delivery, so that we can correct them efficiently. In our opinion, the main advantage is that we can show the data partner - who are the very source of the data - what the consequences of thorough cataloguing and mapping are, or the effects of bad quality and good quality data in the Europeana website. So we definitely see the Metis Sandbox as a good “learning resource” for all those involved in the data delivery process.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What else can the Metis Sandbox do?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Metis Sandbox is particularly useful when working with new datasets. It helps to provide a sense of the overall quality of the dataset and to confirm if an expected or required level of data quality can be achieved. In that context, the Metis Media Processing module, which is embedded in the Sandbox, is useful. This component attempts to extract technical metadata from records’ linked media resources, and therefore prevents broken links as much as possible. Similarly, for aggregators who do not have their own EDM validation tool, using the Metis Sandbox can be essential in getting more immediate feedback and fixing data issues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Metis Sandbox can also show its strengths when experimenting with new technologies or data formats. Several aggregators have started working with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) - a set of open standards for delivering high-quality, attributed digital objects online at scale. Mapping IIIF resources properly to EDM is more complex than mapping traditional media links. Getting a sense of how the mapping impacts the display and quality of the content can be tried out easily with small samples in the Metis Sandbox. Furthermore, experiments like this can also help to advance&nbsp; how the metadata and content tiers are calculated, thereby extending the use cases covered by the Europeana Publishing Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This news post is the second in our January Europeana Pro News <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/metis-sandbox\">focus on the Metis Sandbox</a>!

Also, we will explore and showcase relevant developments at our own EuropeanaTech Conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Priority areas&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023 we will focus - within the previously mentioned main goals - on the following priority areas. Our priority areas of focus directly align with the Europeana 2021-2025 strategy:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Tech is changing all the time. Reflecting its public service role, Europeana will develop and use cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, e-translation and machine learning in line with the European Commission’s Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1) From shelf to Europeana: supporting the workflow&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to reach the goals specified in the common European data space for cultural heritage, organisations will need to increase their digital output and look at each step of the workflow between shelf and Europeana. We aim to encourage and support cultural heritage institutions - especially small and medium sized ones - at each step by sharing available best practices and Open Source tools. As each institution/organisation&nbsp; is different, the particular steps will have to be adapted to local circumstances, including, for example, materials present, budget, the workforce, applicable laws etc. Next to the addition of new datasets to Europeana and opening them up for (re-)use, this will greatly contribute to the digital skills of the cultural heritage professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2) AI in relation to cultural heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will continue to support the community with AI related efforts following the conclusion of AI in Relation to GLAMs task force. These will include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Offering webinars and editorials on Pro to explore the latest AI-related developments and gather insights into the adaptation of selected technology and workflows. Through this, we will provide a space for discussion and expertise to continue the focused growth of AI within digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Coordinating, sharing knowledge and seeking collaboration with other AI related groups, for instance: AI4Media, AI4LAM, AI+Museums Network and AI-driven cultural heritage projects under the Horizon 2020 - Research and innovation program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3) 3D Content&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will follow up on the efforts from the 3D Task Force in relation to 3D, supporting the actions in the data space implementation plan. This includes engaging in dialogue&nbsp; with the IIIF 3D community and with 4CH - centre of competence on 3D in cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4) Multilingual discovery and access&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group will investigate possible actions to enhance the multilingual coverage of vocabularies and to improve cross-vocabulary alignment. We will look at furthering Europeana’s work with relation to automatic translation (e.g. Europeana Translate), collaborating and sharing knowledge with the EuropeanaTech community and related centres of competence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Task Forces and Working Groups&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Linked Data Integration and Publication: Theory and practice Task Force&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Workflow from shelf to Europeana Task Force</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The EuropeanaTech IIIF working group will continue to support the uptake of IIIF in the EuropeanaTech and Aggregator communities by exploring one off webinars and look to produce documents and other outputs that will help the community implement IIIF, including organising a technical workshop alongside the EuropeanaTech Conference</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Data Quality Committee will continue its work among others on detection of problem patterns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Contributing to the priorities of the Europeana Network Association</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EuropeanaTech Community work plan for 2023 contributes to the strategic priorities of the Europeana Network Association in a number of ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EuropeanaTech will continue its efforts to disseminate and raise awareness of best-practices plus recent innovations within digital cultural heritage R&amp;D, directly aligning and propagating ENA's strategic priority to <strong>transfer knowledge</strong> across the Europeana Network Association.

In the coming year, it is our ambition to expand the Steering Group and we will aim to recruit new members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we do</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Connect</strong>: We aim to be a communication hub between community members, communities, the Europeana Network Association, and communicators across the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Support</strong>: We contribute to Europeana's shared knowledge by supporting the development and promotion of training resources, tools and activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Upskill</strong>: We equip and empower our members with digital communications skills and tools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Inspire</strong>: We share examples of digital culture in action, demonstrating the relevance of Europeana and (digital) culture heritage and inspiring people to engage with it.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community aspiration for 2023</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Foster a welcoming, inclusive community of engaged communicators, who recognise, share and promote the value of (digital) cultural heritage and of the common European data space for cultural heritage. We aim to embrace our multinational and multilingual community, and be transparent in our activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Aspirations for the data space&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Behind every piece of data in the common European data space for cultural heritage stands human inspiration, creativity, action, knowledge. As communicators we want to safeguard and showcase the human aspects, values, misfortunes and emotions behind these ‘data’ by advocating storytelling as an essential part of this data space - and the importance that it is transparent and accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past years many cultural heritage institutions have been developing so-called participatory approaches, offering citizens the possibility to contribute to the collections by annotating and translating data and by telling their stories, related to objects. Europeana did the same by crowdsourcing projects and by campaigns like World War I, Migration and Sports. As communicators we want to see participatory approaches as an integral part of the design and content of this data space, with cultural heritage institutions ensuring that all their work and projects consider their community. Citizens should be able to recognize the data space as THEIR cultural heritage, THEIR data space and to take ownership. Use and re-use is value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Priority areas and activities for 2023</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1.

Copyright Community members will be invited to actively participate. The Copyright Community and its Steering Group will also be called upon by Europeana Foundation to contribute their views to copyright policy questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1. Identify the terminology we use when we talk about the different aspects of ‘open’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continued work, began in 2022, to understand the various terms used in this space, their overlap and differences, and the contexts in which they might be most suitable to be used by the Europeana copyright community. Develop this work with a focus on artistic works, aided by the new Article 14 Working Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2. Support the use of the out of commerce works provisions in the CDSM Directive&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue the work of the Out of Commerce Works Working Group.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3. Copyright office hours and Policy office hours</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue setting up the copyright and policy office hours to have a space where community members can engage and discuss shared questions. Each session will be focused on a specific topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4. Promote and help to develop the Europeana Licensing Framework (ELF)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Encourage use of the ELF through awareness raising and training resources. Support the development of updates to the ELF toward a data governance mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5. Develop resources to support copyright management</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maintain a tools page where professionals in the sector can find copyright support. Help to develop a ‘contract bank’ of copyright-related documents for the Copyright Cortex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Continue to promote and update the copyright management guidelines for practitioners. Explore areas for further development, for example,rights clearance, identify its cost, and harmonise practices across Europe. Create links with the copyright tools page, as well as with the Copyright Cortex and CopyrightUser.eu, and partner with research centres and projects such as ReCreating Europe and inDICEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6. Support the protection of the public domain</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Develop and instigate a new Article 14 Working Group to develop resources, guidance, and best practice around Article 14 of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive (CDSM), which relates to the protection of the public domain for digitised artistic works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Contributing to the priorities of the Europeana Network Association</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Copyright Community work plan for 2023 contributes to the strategic priorities of the Europeana Network Association in a number of ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Supporting capacity building and digital transformation in cultural heritage institutions</strong>, by developing and promoting resources that build the capacity of cultural heritage professionals, from copyright training, to tools and resources, or guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Harnessing the potential of (individual) ENA members</strong>, by facilitating regular policy and copyright office hours through which members of the copyright community meet and can support each other by discussing common challenges and sharing solutions that have worked for some of them. The creation of an 'Article 14' working group alongside the currently existing 'out of commerce works working group' also facilitates a platform for discussion, exchange of knowledge and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I)</strong>, by opening up a conversation about the notion and various definitions for 'openess' and 'reuse' and how it interacts with other important values and principles.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Collaboration with Europeana Foundation, Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and wider networks</strong>, by contributing to the development of a data governance mechanism that brings in the stakes of various groups and individuals.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Communications and outreach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will communicate and raise awareness of products, events and important developments through the Europeana Initiative’s communication channels. Where relevant, we will invite members of the copyright community and other guests to write posts to be published onEuropeana Pro on relevant topics for the sector. Where possible, we will develop our products and services in collaboration with other Europeana communities and relevant partners and projects working on the same areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Budget</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EUR 4 000 to be assigned to the research, production and design of materials to support the activities described in the work plan.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Foreword</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Climate Action Community's purpose is to advocate for and embed working practices that minimise the digital cultural heritage sector’s impact on the climate and environment. This operational plan for 2022-2023 sets out our work over the coming year to support sustainable practices in our community, across the Europeana Initiative and to inspire the sector at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This work plan has evolved through a co-curated, iterative process and a series of exploratory discussions, prioritisation, critique/feedback in the Steering Group, former leads of the Climate Action Group and the Climate Action Community over four months. Three main areas of focus determine the Community’s activities for the period between November 2022 - December 2023:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>Design and publish a Digital Information Management Survey;</li>\r\n    <li>Contribute to and raise awareness of climate action in the data space; among ENA communities through cross-community collaboration; and through editorial and curatorial content;</li>\r\n    <li>Reach out to the wider Europeana Network Association, raise awareness across the sector and disseminate knowledge and good practice. &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning our activities will enable us to balance our programme with our volunteer work force across the Steering Group and the Community. The ultimate aim is to ensure we advocate for climate action and embed sustainable practices in all we do together with the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation, the Foundation’s Green Team, and the Aggregators’ Forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Steering Group Composition</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Climate Community Steering Group is composed of a chair, a co-chair, a community manager and other members with a range of expertise</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Susan Hazan, CEO Digital Heritage Israel (Chair)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Killian Downing, Archivist Dublin City University (Co-chair)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Corinne Szteinsznaider and Marco Fiore, Coordinator Michael Culture/MUSEU-HUB&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Evangelia Paschalidou, Researcher/ Museums for Future, PhD candidate</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Flavia Bruni, ICCU, Italy, ENA Members Council</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Helen Vincent, Head of Rare Books, Maps and Music Collections National Library of Scotland</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Jostina Dhimitri, Professor University of Tirana</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Matias Katajavaara Seidler, Partner &amp; European Projects Lead, Khora Virtual Reality</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Nelson Brito, Researcher University of Coimbra</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Randi Cecchine, Student/ Documentary Filmmaker University of Amsterdam</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Shadi Ardalan, Member States Officer, Europeana Foundation (Community Manager)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community aspiration</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Climate Community seeks to drive impactful, cooperative and sustainable action to address the climate emergency and the environmental impact of our life and work, while building on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Europeana Climate Action Manifesto</a>.

We will solicit expert advice if and when needed. This survey is a formative action that supports Europeana’s Climate Action Manifesto. It will advocate embedding optimal working practices that minimise the digital cultural heritage sector’s impact on the climate and environment.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Executive summary</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023, the Europeana Education Community will follow up with its regular activities to strengthen the connection between the cultural heritage and educational sectors, taking into account the European Year of Skills, the New European Bauhaus activities and the other multiple educational initiatives that will happen all over the year. To get a deeper understanding of the needs of educators in regards to the use of digital cultural heritage, the community will share information and best practices, facilitate collaborations at the intersection of cultural heritage institutions and education, promote the Europeana Initiative at events and engage with new members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Steering Group's main activities will be around the European Year of Skills 2023. In particular, we will work in the design of a digital skills framework for educators working in cultural heritage institutions, the organisation of the Upskill/Reskill webinar series and the organisation of Low-Code Fest 2. This intends to focus on the use of Europeana’s APIs to support educators in developing their knowledge and skills to teach about the climate crisis and sustainability, including dealing with eco-anxiety among their students. We will also try to approach the Anne Frank Youth network to explore collaboration in the area of citizenship education and draft a survey to better identify the needs of our community members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Steering Group composition</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Community is governed by a chair, two co-chairs and a manager (from the Europeana Foundation).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Altheo Valentini, Founder &amp; CEO at European Grants International Academy, Italy (Chair)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Loa Kristjánsdóttir, History Teacher | EuroClio, Iceland (Co-chair)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dr. Margherita Sani, Project Manager of the LEM Group at NEMO, Italy (Co-chair)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dr. Ping Kong, Heritage &amp; Education GmbH, Germany</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Marco Streefkerk, Information Manager at Anne Frank Museum, Netherlands</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dr. Tatyana Oleinik, OpenEduHub |H.S.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a relatively small organisation based in The Hague, it would be impossible for the Europeana Foundation to work directly with all cultural heritage institutions who want to share data with Europeana. Instead we work with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">aggregators</a> - organisations who gather data and make it accessible through the Europeana website. Aggregators act as a bridge between the Europeana Foundation and cultural heritage institutions, who they help to get their data published. Cultural heritage institutions don’t need to be directly involved with the data ingestion process, which is taken care of by the aggregator, in collaboration with the Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the <a href=\"https://metis-sandbox.europeana.eu/\">Metis Sandbox</a> now opens the door for cultural heritage institutions to get more involved in the data ingestion process, if they are interested in this and if their data is suitable for it. This has the potential to benefit the process of dataset updates even more - read on to discover how.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How the the Milutin Bojić Library used the Sandbox</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The possibility for cultural heritage institutions to get involved in the data ingestion process using the Sandbox is demonstrated by the collaboration of the Milutin Bojić Library and the National Library of Serbia (the country’s national aggregator) with the Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/andrija-sagic\">Andrija Sagic</a>, Head of the Digitisation Department of the Milutin Bojić Library and Co-Chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech community</a>, was in the process of preparing data for the first time for publication on the Europeana website. The collections from the Milutin Bojić Library were also the first data from Serbia to use the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to deliver the manuscripts and documents in the highest possible quality. Andrija Sagic is very familiar with IIIF and is the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/community/ambassadors/\">IIIF ambassador</a> for Serbia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past, Andrija would have submitted the data to the National Library of Serbia, which would have sent it to the Europeana Foundation for processing in Metis. Feedback would have travelled back via the National Library to Andrija before the process started again, until the data was ready for publication. This could have taken days, if not weeks. Using the Metis Sandbox, however, the process was completed in only one afternoon. Working on one metadata record in the Sandbox helped to find and iron out a few issues until the data was not only valid but resulted in the desired display on the Europeana website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With this experience, Andrija prepared the entire collection and sent it to the National Library of Serbia for mapping to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>. Providing support and guidance to cultural heritage institutions on how to model or map their data in EDM is one key responsibility of aggregators, particularly as cultural heritage institutions don’t work with EDM but different metadata schemas. After another test with the Metis Sandbox, the collection was ready to be ingested to Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Andrija says, ‘I would like to thank you a lot for helping us in the beginning to define all parameters that were needed to prepare our data. The Metis Sandbox has played a big role in testing and previewing datasets and also for assessing the metadata quality. Together with Tamara Butigan and her team from the National Aggregator of Serbia we got all that was needed to eventually have the collection published on the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=edm_datasetName%3A812_%2A\">Europeana website</a>.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How you can use the Sandbox for your data</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not every cultural heritage institution is able to produce data in EDM or map their metadata to EDM, but they can still use the Metis Sandbox for testing data. Using the coding language Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), XML documents can be transformed into other XML documents. This allows metadata in Dublin Core or MARC21 to be transformed into EDM. In addition to the actual data, the XSLT can be&nbsp; uploaded to the Metis Sandbox. The application will then apply the uploaded transformation while processing the data, and cultural heritage institutions will then be able to preview what the data will look like on the Europeana website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you work for a cultural heritage institution that would like to test working with the Metis Sandbox, but don’t have an XSLT for your own data to map it to EDM, please contact us by emailing henning.scholz@europeana.eu. We can either provide you with a customised XSLT for your data, if available, or send you a generic XSLT that will also allow you to get an idea how your data will look in Europeana. This can be a very valuable first step before you then work with your aggregator to finalise the process and get your collection ready for Europeana, just like Andrija has done for the Milutin Bojić Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This news post is the third in our January Europeana Pro News <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/metis-sandbox\">focus on the Metis Sandbox</a>! Keep following Europeana Pro News for more - our next post will explore how the Sandbox will evolve to meet the needs of the common European data space for cultural heritage.

The project is developing European eArchiving standard-based, long-term preservation solutions for Jewish heritage archives, which it has integrated into the aggregation flow of a Europeana thematic aggregator for Jewish heritage, Judaica (operated by the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/jewish-heritage-network\"> Jewish Heritage Network</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project is unique in using software components from three different initiatives funded by the European Commission (<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/earchiving\">eArchiving</a>, Europeana, eTranslation) to build a comprehensive end-to-end solution for small and mid-size cultural heritage institutions, an important group of stakeholders for European infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enhanced aggregation workflow</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>J-Ark has brought together the open-source, eArchiving-compliant, long-term preservation solution <a href=\"https://www.roda-community.org/\">RODA</a> (provided by <a href=\"https://www.keep.pt/en\">KEEP SOLUTIONS</a>, Portugal) and services for machine translation and anonymisation of heritage content (provided by Pangeanic, Spain) as a new, integrated solution to Judaica. This means that the aggregator now offers a service which ingests digital objects and metadata via an orchestrated workflow, starting with a web-based or file-based pipeline for submitting digital objects (as <a href=\"https://earksip.dilcis.eu/\">E-ARK SIPs</a>, the eArchiving specification for submitting an archival package). Metadata can be added manually through the user-friendly CMS offered by the aggregator or uploaded in a spreadsheet file.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

We built a custom integration with <a href=\"https://dingo.psnc.pl/en/dlibra-en/\">dLibra</a>, the digital library system actively used in Poland, which allows cultural heritage institutions using dLibra to upload a collection of objects in dLibra to the archival service with several clicks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After digital objects and metadata are submitted, the metadata is automatically translated to European languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian) and anonymised to address privacy requirements of preserved archival collections. Representation of the metadata in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>&nbsp; (a Linked Data description format is stored by RODA (the preservation system), which now added EDM to the list of supported formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has been piloted on the data sets of two partners: Brama Grodzka - Teatr NN, a Jewish heritage centre from Lublin, Poland, and the Jewish Community of Lithuania. Content partners explored different metadata and digital content submission workflows during hackathons, which were then implemented by the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These pilots highlighted the importance of two fundamental aspects when integrating a preservation solution into an existing digital environment. First, the solution needs to integrate harmoniously with the current workflows (such as content publishing, metadata production etc.) and systems (CMS, digital asset management) around digital objects and metadata. Second, it is necessary to find the right strategy to decide how the complexity and specifics of the data structure at source is reflected on the preservation end. For example, harvesting Brama Grodzka - Teatr NN data (based on &nbsp;dLibra system) required a custom harvester to map a complex hierarchical data structure to more \"flat\" EDM representation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a cultural heritage institution interested in a long-term preservation solution compatible with aggregation flows please <a href=\"http://info@jhn.ngo\">get in touch</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Future perspectives on preserving data within data spaces</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of the J-Ark project, it has become clear that connecting the different services of European digital infrastructures will be a core requirement of the next generation of European ecosystems for data - the data spaces. Developing the common European data spaces is a new flagship initiative of the European Commission aiming to support the growth of the digital economy in strategic sectors and domains of public interest. Interoperable data spaces cover/domains from manufacturing and health to energy and agriculture, and ensure both public and private sector organisations and research institutions can make available and exchange data in a trustworthy and secure manner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project’s experiences connecting digital preservation to the aggregation flow highlight the importance of considering long-term preservation of cultural heritage assets in the broader perspective of data space design. They also raise some of the bigger questions about the future of digital preservation and how they can be addressed by the common European data spaces. How long is ‘long-term’ preservation: 10, 50 or maybe 300 years? How do we make it truly inclusive by preserving not only mainstream collections, usually safeguarded by institutions well-equipped with preservation means (or at least an established Content Management System for objects and metadata), but also archives of small organisations, communities, and even personal archives? How do we save on costs by looking at the ecosystem as a whole rather than at specific use cases?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in exploring some of these questions, the project has organised a free online event on Wednesday 22nd February 2023, and we’d love to see you there. The event will include updates from the project, the European Commission and the Europeana Foundation and a round-table that looks at the future of digital preservation and the common European data spaces.

It&nbsp;will establish and develop an autonomous advocacy and knowledge platform bringing together a large array of cultural heritage stakeholders, contributing to a more sustainable, innovative and inclusive future for the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project will also foster synergies and cooperation between existing heritage initiatives and actors, and create new ones when relevant. The European Heritage Hub will be at the forefront of heritage policy development at all governance levels and will support heritage professionals and volunteers in acquiring the necessary skills to adapt to our society’s transformation and build resilience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project will actively engage the extended networks of all partners (see list below). Ultimately, it will reach out to citizens at large, with a special emphasis on the younger generation of heritage students and professionals, to carry on the legacies of both the European Year of Youth 2022 and the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, and contribute to the European Year of Skills in 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Heritage is not only a common treasure to protect, but also an asset for the green transition of our societies. Europa Nostra has developed over the last decades a unique experience allowing heritage to be protected and to play a pivotal role for the greening of territories. The pilot project establishing a European Heritage Hub will bring concrete means to the consortium to make a positive impact at local level. I would like to congratulate all members of the consortium for their commitment in a new endeavour!' said&nbsp;Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'The Europeana Foundation is proud to be among the partners tasked by the European Commission to implement this ambitious initiative. We are delighted to once again join forces with Europa Nostra, and to start a close cooperation with new partners, to make the Hub a reality and a success. Through the European Heritage Hub, we are looking forward to empowering the heritage sector to effectively respond to the triple transformation of our society - digital, environmental and social - and its multiple challenges,'&nbsp;stated Harry Verwayen, General Director of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Europa Nostra is very proud to act as coordinator of the setting up of a future European Heritage Hub (...). This is a most challenging task which we are glad to take on together with a fantastic group of European and regional partners. We shall seek to involve the widest possible range of heritage stakeholders, including members of the European Heritage Alliance and of the Climate Heritage Network and the young generation of heritage professionals. The European Heritage Hub should be beneficial to all! It will help us to further demonstrate the relevance of cultural heritage as a strategic resource for the future of Europe and as an invaluable vector for achieving many priority goals of the European Union and its key partners in Europe and beyond,'&nbsp;stated Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović, Secretary General of Europa Nostra, coordinator of the pilot project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of implementation, the Europeana Foundation will play a key role in the areas of knowledge-sharing, networking, training and capacity-building, the setting-up and development of a Heritage Policy Lab as well as communication and dissemination efforts. Europeana’s network will have the opportunity to benefit from and contribute to the Hub’s multiple activities and to be part of its Europe-wide community of practice. Stay tuned for more!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lead organisation and partners of the European Heritage Hub&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the basis of its extensive expertise and experience, <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/\">Europa Nostra</a> will take the role of the project leader. The project will bring together relevant partners, reflecting at the same time all levels of governance (EU, national, regional and/or local) and the priorities of the project (such as capacity-building, research, communication, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The key European partners (co-beneficiaries) of the project are&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://eurocities.eu/\">Eurocities</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven\">KU Leuven</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://iclei.org/\">ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other strategic partners of the project include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"http://www.tmhzk.krakow.pl/index.php/pl/\">The Society of Friends of Kraków History and Heritage</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.ellet.gr/en/\">ELLINIKI ETAIRIA - Society for the Environment and Cultural Heritage</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">ASBL Horizon 50-200 &nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.cnc.pt/\">Centro Nacional de Cultura</a> &nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://www.hispanianostra.org/\">Hispania Nostra</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://cemusique.org/en/\">European Music Centre</a> &nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several associated partners will support the strengthening or creation of new regional heritage hubs, namely the <a href=\"https://www.ovpm.org/all-about-owhc/\">Organisation of World Heritage Cities</a> (based in Canada), the <a href=\"https://www.krakow.pl/krakow_open_city\">City of Kraków</a> (Poland), the <a href=\"https://www.cityofathens.gr/\">City of Athens</a> (Greece)&nbsp;and the <a href=\"https://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/en/quem-somos/\">Directorate-General for Cultural Heritage</a> (Portugal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other partners supporting the project are the <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/\">European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage</a> (ESACH), the <a href=\"https://www.euyo.eu/\">European Union Youth Orchestra</a> (EUYO) and <a href=\"https://www.generali.com/\">Generali</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The MOOCs have trained more than 6,000 teachers with a potential impact on more than 72,000 students. The majority of participants (90+%) said they were ‘satisfied or very satisfied’ with the course and felt more confident to use digital cultural heritage in their classrooms as a result. Do you want to know why? Keep reading and watch this video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qA0BDNgL74w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What’s in the course?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Digital Education with Cultural Heritage MOOC teaches you about the educational potential of digital cultural heritage and prepares you to implement it using digital technologies and innovative pedagogies, like CLIL or Project Based Learning. The course&nbsp; introduces the learning scenario methodology, shows you how to use it and how to build your own scenarios.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will also learn how to navigate Europeana’s digitised collection to find primary sources in multiple formats (such as pictures, videos, texts, 3D) and in different languages, and discover ready-to-use materials from the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>. The course also explains how to use tools like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/transcribathon\">Transcribathon</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a> in history and citizenship lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the MOOC includes upgraded and updated content. With a focus on promoting more interactive use of audiovisual content in education through crowdsourcing platforms like <a href=\"https://www.subtitleathon.eu/\">Subtitle-a-thon</a> and <a href=\"https://subbit.eu/\">Subbit</a>, it also explores how to integrate the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana APIs</a>&nbsp; in learning projects and shares practical examples from the recent <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-low-code-fest-2022\">Low-Code Fest</a>. Finally, some new materials for post-secondary teaching are included, extending the outreach of this course to higher education, being particularly useful in teacher training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How does the course work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course is organised around the principle of peer learning, with course content designed to stimulate reflection and discussion so that participants can learn from each other’s experiences and ideas. Participants will enjoy two live events with peers and experts and engage in conversations with other colleagues in a dedicated <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/DigitalEducationCulturalHeritage\">Facebook group.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to complete the course, participants are required to submit a final course product and review their peers’ work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who should take the course?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course aims to foster connections between educational and cultural heritage institutions like museums and libraries. So whether you are a teacher (of any subject or level), a non-formal educator, or someone with an interest in designing educational activities using Europeana, we welcome your participation! Other educational professionals and stakeholders, like heads of schools, school support staff and policy makers in education and culture are welcome to join too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">When does the course run?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This course starts on 27 February 2023 and you can register now through the <a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/courses/course-v1:Europeana+Culture_EN+2023/about\">course page</a>. The course will run for 6.5 weeks – with modules opening one by one each week, followed by a 1.5 week grace period. The course consists of five modules, with a peer-reviewed final activity developed and offered in English, and a workload of about 25 hours in total.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From 24 April onwards, the course will be run in Romanian. Register from mid-March - keep an eye out for more details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Register now</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The course is available on the European Schoolnet Academy.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/metis-sandbox\">January Europeana Pro News focus</a> has shown, the Metis Sandbox meets a real need by allowing aggregators and cultural heritage institutions to run a full ingestion workflow on their data. This means that they can test their data, review the resulting records and get immediate feedback on data quality, allowing them to resolve any issues before submitting it to Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional quality feedback comes in the form of a full report on tier calculations (for more on our data quality tiers see the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>) and the signalling of field warnings (patterns in the data that might indicate issues to resolve). Recently, training resources and an extensive user guide have been developed for the Sandbox and the application is gaining traction as a diagnostic tool for data partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this final article of the Metis Sandbox focus, we’ll look to the future. The Metis Sandbox has been a key component of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\">aggregation strategy</a> since its inception, and is a core product of the Europeana Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have lots of plans and wishes for the application that we hope to realise in the months and years to come. But, in software development as in other fields, we’ve got to make sure that our foundation is strong. Some attention will need to be devoted to consolidating the application after the recent period of functional growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How are we consolidating what we already have?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main driver for our consolidation efforts is that of expected demand. As more and more people will be starting to use the Sandbox, we expect that, unless we take action, dataset queues will start to develop and people will have to wait longer for their datasets to be processed. A bit of queuing is of course unavoidable in an application like this and comes and goes with variations in demand. But it should be contained to acceptable levels and not lead to errors or a bad user experience. To this end, we’re working on the capacity of the application to scale up, as well as on optimising its data processing component. Additionally, we’re considering ways in which we can signal more clearly to the user that even though there is currently a queue, their data is on its way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another thing we’re working on is the user experience in general. The Sandbox interface has grown organically along with the functionality, and, even though it has received a lot of attention from our developers, has never been designed holistically. Now that the functionality is becoming established, it is a good moment to look at the visual design. Our design team has already begun to bring&nbsp; the interface in line with the Europeana house style and find ways to enhance the user experience. We’ll be conducting user feedback sessions to help us in this endeavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What new functionality will we be adding to the Sandbox?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a lot of things we are or will be working on that we hope will make the life of our data partners better. For instance, people who use the Sandbox often comment&nbsp; that, given that the Sandbox processes the first 1,000 records it finds in a dataset, the feedback it gives is not always representative of the whole set. We’re working to allow the user to set a sampling offset, which should enable them to get the Sandbox to process a representative sample by selecting records more evenly across the dataset.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another request we occasionally get is for extended tier calculation reports that also contain statistics covering the whole dataset sample instead of just the details for one record in isolation. This too is something we will be working on in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feedback from aggregators tells us that the functionality that the Sandbox offers would be useful at earlier stages of aggregators’ workflows, specifically when preparing and mapping the data. We are working to address this by making some functionality available as an API, which means that people can use it at any point in their aggregation process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we’re adding to our repertoire of field warnings (i.e. problem patterns). The current list consists of eight types of warnings, all to do with record titles and descriptions. New field warnings could cover more and different fields, and therefore give more comprehensive feedback to Sandbox users. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee</a> will work on selecting and prioritising these from a list of options, and we will then implement them in the Sandbox.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What about the medium and long term?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we are building the common European data space for cultural heritage, the&nbsp; Europeana Initiative is discussing and designing improvements and enhancements to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>. Developments there may have to be reflected in the Metis Sandbox; for example, we expect some improvements in the handling of 3D records, which is identified as a priority for the data space. Future <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-dsi-4-aggregation-strategy\">updates to the aggregation strategy</a> will also be reflected in the Metis Sandbox and hopefully improve the data publication journey for cultural heritage institutions and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the last news post of our January Europeana Pro News <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/metis-sandbox\">focus on the Metis Sandbox</a>. We hope that this series has given you an idea of what the Sandbox can do now and what it will do in the future. We look forward to hearing from our Sandbox users: the application has a feedback functionality we encourage you to use.

                body: "<p>Europeana's Collections Engagement team works hard to surface a broad range of interesting stories inspired and illustrated by the digital cultural heritage found on the Europeana website. But we are not always the best-placed writers for every topic. We firmly believe in the phrase&nbsp; 'nothing about us without us', making sure our colleagues with lived experiences are the ones to lead our editorial campaigns around certain topics. For Women's History Month, for example, our women editors take the lead as they have the power to tell women's stories. The same goes for our campaigns around Pride Month, Black History Month, and so forth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are very aware, though, that our team can't possibly encompass all of the lived experiences that exist in Europeana's rich cultural heritage database. To expand our editorial horizons, and in line with our wider work on Diversity and Inclusion, we invite writers to tell the stories that they are best-placed to tell.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Grants for writing blogs</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year, to spotlight these unheard voices and surface more stories about underrepresented topics in Europeana, in 2022, we launched the Europeana Editorial Grants Programme.&nbsp;We invited anyone to pitch us their blog idea, and provided funding for writers who could contribute blogs that put a spotlight on underrepresented communities, voices and lived experiences. Throughout 2022, we received more than 20 pitches, from which we selected five ideas to be published as blogs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

We posted the invitation as a call to action on our Stories page but did not do any further promotion so we could gauge the interest of people visiting europeana.eu in this opportunity. Despite this quiet launch, the submissions received throughout the year show that there is clearly an audience that has stories to tell. Here are some of the stories that were written and published through the Grants Programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Selene Carboni:&nbsp; the evolution of the Bas-Relief</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Selene Carboni detailed the history of sculpture in relief over thousands of years. She ended her story by shedding light on how relief sculpture is currently being used to create a new dimension of experiencing art for visually impaired people, blind people, and sighted people alike. Selene's blog is a wonderful editorial piece combining historical narrative with recent developments in accessibility in cultural heritage organisations. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/the-evolution-of-the-bas-relief\">Read the blog.</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dr. Johanna Fisher: medieval ecofeminism</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Fisher, a professor of gender and women's studies, laid out the fascinating story of how medieval mysticism was used as an avenue of feminist activism. Hildegard von Bingen is probably one of the most famous of these female mystics, who used her unique position to campaign for ecological consciousness, conservation, and care. Dr. Fisher's blog is a great addition to our editorial, highlighting the intersection between feminism, climate justice and medieval studies. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/hildegard-von-bingen-celebrating-an-early-ecofeminist\">Read the blog</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Monty Moncrieff: London Friend</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monty Moncrieff looked back on the history of London Friend, the oldest LGBTQ+ charity in the UK. Over the past 50 years, they've been at the forefront of supporting the health and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community mostly through volunteer effort. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/london-friend-the-uks-oldest-lgbtq-charity\">Read the blog.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Plans for the future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We're very grateful to everyone who pitched us a blog idea and to those who worked with us to publish their blog on europeana.eu. In the coming years, we want to continue and expand the grants programme. We want to publish more stories and support more underrepresented voices both financially and by providing our platform to publish their stories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first half of 2023, part of our editorial grant programme will be dedicated to the World Festival of Cultural Diversity, supporting underrepresented stories and experiences on religious diversity. If you have a story that you want to put out into the world through europeana.eu on religious diversity, you can apply for an Editorial Grant below. If you have a different story to tell, you can still apply for a grant, so please reach out to us through the grant form. And please help us spread the word about the grants by sharing with your own networks.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the Leadership programme&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DEN Academy Leadership programme Digital Strategy &amp; Innovation has already been successfully run in The Netherlands for several years, and was piloted at the European level for the Europeana Foundation&nbsp;in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the programme is back! Consisting of three interlinked modules, it explores a range of strategic themes related to digital transformation delivered by experts who lead in their fields.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together, the group following the programme will be supported by these experts to work collaboratively on questions like:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What challenges do you face in leading the digital transformation of your organisation or the cultural heritage institutions you work closely with?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How do you approach and develop a digital strategy and vision?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How do you actively involve or mobilise your regional or thematic network?&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How do you engage your staff and colleagues in digital strategy and organisational developments?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who can join the Leadership programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DEN Academy Leadership programme Digital Strategy &amp; Innovation is aimed at directors, senior managers and practitioners who drive digital transformation in their organisations. It’s open to anyone who works in a European cultural heritage organisation, and in the application process we will select participants with the aim that everyone can learn from each other. We can host a maximum of 16 participants in this programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why join the Leadership programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme will empower you to support your institution to develop a coherent digital strategy. It will support your own professional development to influence and drive strategic decision making in your organisation. The programme offers the opportunity to learn and hear from experts and leaders in the field of digital transformation and strategy, and get the chance to work with and learn from peers. Participants will finish the course with their own strategic toolbox to lead digital transformation in a structured and impactful way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What have previous participants said about the Leadership programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Previous participants have reported that the programme held great value for them, with one saying, ‘It was a privilege to attend this programme.’ Another commented that, ‘This programme helped me to see to go from vision to implementation, not the other way around.’ The process of the sessions was also a bonus for some, with one participant commenting, ‘It’s a good thing that it’s being spread out so you can start working on this in your daily routine and work.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do I join the Leadership programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme is free, but participants will need to commit to six online sessions, some preparatory work and homework assignments. The three modules over six sessions together are one programme and as such participants are expected to participate in all the sessions. The sessions will take place between 31 March and 30 June 2023, and the dates of each session are listed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Module 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 1: 31 March 2023,09.00 - 13.00&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 2: 14 April 2023, 09.00 - 13.00&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Module 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 1: 12 May 2023, 09.00 - 13.00</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 2: 9 June 2023, 09.00 - 13.00</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Module 3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 1: 23 June 2023, 09.00 - 13.00</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Part 2: 30 June 2023, 09.00 - 13.00</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A debrief session will also take place at the beginning of July.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If this programme sounds right for you, and you can commit to the dates above, please complete the form below. <strong>The deadline as been extended to 27 February&nbsp;2023</strong>.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Involvement in Enrich Europeana+&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The State Archives in Zagreb care for the documentary and archival materials that were created in the city of Zagreb, Zagreb County as well as for part of the County Krapinsko-Zagorska (towns Donja Stubica and Oroslavje and the municipalities of Gornja Stubica, Marija Bistrica and Stubičke Toplice) in Croatia. The rich materials stored in the archive are mostly handwritten, and range from the 13th century to recent history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are more than 10,000 due metres of materials spread through more than 1,300 archival fonds and collections in the State Archives. This makes it challenging for researchers, educators and curious citizens to know whose archival funds we hold. This was an issue that we aimed to address through our participation in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enricheuropeana\">Enrich Europeana+ project</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the project, we wanted to present a more comprehensive overview of our archives and collections to a larger audience. The State Archives in Zagreb is one of the biggest content providers in this project, and we aim to provide more than 120,000 new records to Europeana. Those materials are a part of eight different archival funds and collections. The most considerable number of records come from the archival fond HR-DAZG-24 Zagreb City Administration, more precisely, the ration cards that were issued in Zagreb during WW2 to regulate food distribution, which number around 120,000 individual cards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Working with the Croatian national aggregator, Ekultura</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The State Archives in Zagreb was also the first cultural heritage institution in Croatia to use the Croatian national aggregator <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/ministry-of-culture-and-media-of-the-republic-of-croatia-ekultura-hr\">Ekultura</a> to deliver these materials to Europeana. For every single fond and collection, a new set of metadata was constructed to provide the data. This was a significant step, because before the establishment of Ekultura, and engagement in the Enrich Europeana+ project, the State Archives in Zagreb didn't produce metadata in such a structured, machine-readable form.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ekultura was established by the Croatian Ministry of Culture and media as part of the ‘e-Culture - Digitization of cultural heritage’ project. The project includes the establishment of a central information system for permanent digital storage and preservation of digital and digitised cultural heritage from museums, archives, libraries and other heritage institutions. The aggregator plans a crucial role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage, collecting and organising information from multiple sources&nbsp;to make cultural heritage more accessible, searchable, and understandable. It offers cultural heritage institutions two main services– integration with the national aggregator and integration with Europeana - which the State Archives of Zagreb used for this project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Preparations were quite exciting. None of our employees had ever done an event of this type, so we relied on the help and experience of our project partners, especially from the Transcribathon and Europeana teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event took place from 7 - 11 November, at the Faculty of Humanities and Social sciences in Zagreb (the State Archives in Zagreb is under renovation and restoration after the earthquake in 2020).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We focused on getting university students involved in the Transcribathon because we were on their grounds. Two weeks before the event, we held two 45-minute presentations for the students from the Department of Information and Communication Sciences. The presentation contained information about the Transcribathon platform, the Enrich Europeana+ project, and about the materials and the work that needed to be done. Students applied to take part through an online form and in total 52 signed up.&nbsp; To simplify the process of transcribing, we translated the instructions for Transcribathon to Croatian, and designed a <a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/runs/zagreb-2022/\">dedicated landing page</a> for the Zagreb event on the Transcribathon platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In total, 431 documents were started during the event with 356,552 characters transcribed by 45 volunteers. Leading participants then gave presentations on their work, which were judged by professors from the faculty and State Archives in Zagreb. They decided on the winners, as well as the second and third places, in three different categories: the largest number of transcriptions (winner Eva Vitković), enrichments (winner Marijeta Ćubrić), and the presentation (winner Tena Matićević). The prizes for the winners included a collection of books, tickets to the chocolate museum and tickets for an escape room.</p>\r\n"

We organised a two-day conference ‘Cultural heritage and AI : Transcribathon Zagreb’, which invited lecturers to share their knowledge and experiences with more than 80 attendees from 20 different cultural heritage institutions from the region (there were representatives even from a theatre and the Veterinary faculty). The lectures were focused on the new Croatian national aggregator, the possibilities of including AI in everyday work, and examples of good practices in Croatian archives. The conference set the wheels in motion. We already received a few queries about how to join the Transcribathon platform, and the Transkribus platform as well as how to take part in any future projects with our institution and/or Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We invite you all to continue transcribing <a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/documents/?q=&amp;view=stories&amp;Dataset=Zagreb&amp;ps=1\">our materials</a> on the Transribathon platform to help us unlock the stories of the past. If you are interested in running a Transcribathon in your own institution, please contact digitalservices@factsandfiles.com.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />In this interview, we hear from Hanna Dudich, teacher of English and vice-principal; Halyna Tkachenko, teacher of Ukrainian Language and Literature, vice-principal; Oksana Strekalovska, ICT teacher, class tutor of the participating students, a vice-principal; and Olena Tarasova, Artem Havryliuk, Anna Prytula, Vladyslav Dobrunov, students of the 10th form, Low-Code Fest participants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did your project want to achieve?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Halyna Tkachenko</strong>: The goal of the project was to popularise the name of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko\">Taras Shevchenko</a>, a famous Ukrainian writer, who is a symbol of our nation, to preserve the historical memory of the people and their achievements. We also wanted to involve learners in research and creative activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hanna Dudich</strong>: The project that we produced to do this, ’<a href=\"https://www.thinglink.com/mediacard/1327607306946347011\">VR Kobzar</a>’ consists of a virtual tour in the Taras Shevchenko museum (situated in our school). It was made with the help of a ThingLink tool on the school website, and links the Museum’s exhibits with local library digital content and with the digital content of European libraries via the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search\">Europeana Search API</a>. The idea was to research the similarities and differences between PDF versions of different historic editions of Shevchenko's collection of poems called ‘Kobzar’, located in our school Shevchenko Museum, in the Regional Chizhevsky Library and in various libraries across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you use Europeana's APIs and data from Europeana in your project? How was your experience of using them?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Oksana Strekalovska</strong>: After getting acquainted with the functionality of Europeana’s APIs at the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmob1mKZ8h0\"> Low CodeFest webinars</a>, it was clear to us which API to choose and how it could enrich our project. We made a search engine using the Europeana Search API and created a tool within the VR tour to search for scanned copies of Shevchenko’s works located in cultural institutions worldwide. The 10th form IT students were involved in this project. ‘VR Kobzar’ benefited greatly from using the Europeana Search API because it added the possibility of research work turning students from consumers of a VR product to its creators and researchers. The students are already thinking of using Europeana APIs in other educational projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Did you use any other technical tools that you had never used before?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hanna Dudich</strong>: We had used both Thinglink and Canva for other educational purposes, but 'VR Kobzar'&nbsp;was the first time that we used Canva to create customised tags for Thinglink. At the Low-Code Fest we had a possibility to talk to experts during mentoring sessions and it was a really valuable experience. They gave us helpful advice, introduced us to new tools and showed new features of already familiar ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Oksana Strekalovska</strong>: We also used WebStorm - an integrated development environment for JavaScript – to create search engines with the help of HTML, CSS and&nbsp; Europeana API.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We would love to hear from your students directly - what was the most valuable thing that they learned from the programme?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Olena Tarasova</strong>: In my opinion, the most valuable thing they learned while working on the project was teamwork and mutual understanding. Before the war, we had often worked on projects together, but now we don't go to school everyday, we mostly study online. This project united not only students and teachers but also countries, and it's a really good and valuable experience. Also, we could master the English language in the field of information technology, which is very important and really fascinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Artem Havryliuk</strong>: This event was useful and interesting for me. I tried and practised my skills. It was interesting to work in a team, this was a good experience for me. Such events are great for improving IT and group work skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Anna Prytula</strong>: First of all, the most valuable thing for me was working in a friendly team together with teachers and classmates. Joint meetings and conversations inspired us for great creativity, which resulted in ‘VR Kobzar’. I enjoyed listening to very smart and talented people&nbsp; - the mentors - who inspired us to create this project, to learn more about IT design. I was very happy to take part in the Low-Code Fest and delve into the world of IT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Vladyslav Dobrunov</strong>: I have improved my logo and web page design skills and abilities. I realised that it is necessary to know the history of the country and its people to be able to tell others about it, because without the past there is no future.&nbsp; At this time, it is very interesting to travel in the virtual world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where can people find your project, or learn from your work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Halyna Tkachenko</strong>: The ‘VR Kobzar’ is a VR tour of our school Shevchenko museum which can be found on the school website. The school Shevchenko museum is part of our learning environment. Here, children learn to select information and conduct excursions not only for students of our school, but also for learners of other educational institutions as well as for adults. The museum welcomes visitors from all over the region. Now with the digital VR tour new learning opportunities will be available for a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What's next for you/your team?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hanna Dudich</strong>: We'd like to continue to promote the project on social networks and invite other students nationally and internationally to explore our educational VR experience. Taras Shevchenko was not only a poet but also an artist. So we'd like to develop our project further by enriching the VR tour with other Europeana APIs and providing the ground for the research in the field of art by searching and exploring Shevchenko's paintings in European art galleries and museums. We'd also like to present the project at a national educational conference to share innovative teaching practices with colleagues. And of course, we are excited about presenting the project at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/register-now-for-the-upgraded-digital-education-with-cultural-heritage-2023-mooc\">Europeana MOOC </a>and attending <a href=\"https://www.socialhackathonumbria.info/en/live-the-challenge/\">Social Hackathon Umbria</a> this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Explore and use Europeana’s APIs </a>or discover more opportunities to use digital cultural heritage in education by signing up for the upgraded <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/register-now-for-the-upgraded-digital-education-with-cultural-heritage-2023-mooc\">‘Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ 2023 MOOC</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>A promise to solve the twentieth century black hole</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions across the European Union could not (and still often cannot) disseminate millions of items held in their collections because of the difficulty in obtaining the copyright permissions necessary to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012L0028\">Orphan Works Directive</a> came with the promise of solving this worrying problem that has led to the ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">twentieth century black hole</a>’. It did so by creating an exception to copyright for cultural heritage institutions to be able to digitise and disseminate works in their collections that are ‘orphan’, without the need for permission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, in addition to a limited scope in the types of materials, the Directive was adopted with significant administrative burdens for cultural heritage institutions that used the system. It was perceived as too costly, leading to many cultural heritage institutions not being able to use it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Orphan Works Directive review</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like all European Union Directives, a review took place a number of years later to evaluate whether the Directive was fulfilling its purpose in practice. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/evaluating-the-orphan-works-directive\">review was initiated</a> by the European Commission in August 2020, over seven years later than the date established in the Orphan Works Directive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process included an independent <a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/3c880c5c-7065-11ed-9887-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Study on the application of the Orphan Works Directive</a>, published in December 2022. On the basis of desk research, a stakeholder survey (answered by 87 participants), and interviews (with 13 individuals), the study concludes that the number of works registered as orphan ‘represents a tiny portion of the estimated orphan works existing in the collections of cultural heritage institutions across the EU’ and that only 24% of the cultural heritage institutions responding to the survey ‘believe that the [Orphan Works Directive] has led to significant improvements in the digitisation and dissemination of orphan works’. Alongside the various issues identified by respondents, two were particularly prominent: the complexity of the diligent search and the mandatory list of sources to be consulted, and the uncertainty surrounding the possibility for rights holders to claim compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the basis of this independent study, the European Commission acknowledged in a <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/report-application-orphan-works-directive\">Report on the application of the Orphan Works Directive</a> that ‘the [orphan works] Directive’s mechanism has been rarely used in practice and its relevance as a potential tool for the mass digitisation of cultural heritage has therefore proven to be limited’. It also notes that ‘there are practical difficulties affecting the Directive’s efficiency, especially regarding specific requirements for the diligent search’. However, the European Commission does not propose any modifications to the Directive or measures to ensure that it has a bigger impact. The Directive will therefore continue to exist as it is, with no changes to its scope or to its system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While it is regrettable that the Directive will not be modified, the Commission expresses willingness to continue the dialogue with all interested parties on how to make sure practical difficulties affecting the Directive’s efficiency are mitigated and will explore with the EUIPO possible improvements to the database.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking ahead: the out of commerce works provisions enter the game</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2019, the adoption of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market (CDSM) Directive</a>, with its articles on out of commerce works, offered a new solution to the copyright clearance challenges faced by cultural heritage institutions, one that seems an improvement to the orphan works provisions. The out of commerce works provisions have a broader scope, and less administrative requirements to comply with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Orphan Works Directive and the out of commerce works provisions now coexist as two distinct options that cultural heritage institutions can rely on for clearing rights. They overlap in scope, as it can be argued that all orphan works are necessarily also out of commerce works because commercial exploitation would require permission by an (identified) rightsholder, but offer different approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the Europeana Network Association’s Copyright Community, a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/out-of-commerce-works-working-group\">Working Group</a> has been created to exchange information and recommend ways to successfully use the out of commerce works provisions. The working group believes that this system can offer a fit for purpose solution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Given that the Orphan Works Directive has only ‘partially fulfilled the goal of facilitating the mass digitisation of orphan works’, according to the Commission’s report, it is essential that Member States transpose the out of commerce works provisions in full respect of the scope and requirements set out in the Directive. This includes setting up the mandatory <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/out-of-commerce-works-faqs-stakeholder-dialogues\">stakeholder dialogues</a>, that is, consultation of rightsholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions in each sector. If this is done correctly, the twentieth century black hole might eventually be solved by the out of commerce works solution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to learn more about copyright and digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">join the Europeana Copyright Community</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:copyright@europeana.eu\">copyright@europeana.eu</a> to join&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/out-of-commerce-works-working-group\">out of commerce works working group</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also read our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/cdsm-series\">CDSM Directive Pro news series</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/recommendations-on-copyright-and-its-role-in-the-digital-transformation-of-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">recommendations on copyright and its role in the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector</a>, and learn about other <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/orphan-works-and-uk-glams-the-case-for-a-risk-managed-approach\">solutions</a> in the UK.

                body: "<h3><strong>About the project&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its kick-off in April 2022, the Europeana Foundation has been participating in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/watching-videos-like-a-historian-watchlikeahist\">Watching Videos Like a Historian</a> Erasmus+ project, which aims to support European educators in teaching media literacy and critical thinking skills through audiovisual resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By equipping teachers to pass on media literacy competences to their students, the project aims to instil the ability - and confidence - in students to critically analyse digital sources and audiovisual formats, which are particularly popular and powerful among this age group. The COVID-19 pandemic and socio-political events in Europe and beyond have shown that fighting the spread of disinformation is more important than ever, and media literacy is a core factor that can help to address this challenge, especially if it is supported by trustworthy sources from archival collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project partners are made up of a diverse group of audiovisual collection holders and experts in media literacy, education and assessment. The partnership is built around three European networks that represent some of the main stakeholders - educators, students and EU citizens, AV collection holders and, indirectly, policy makers. Partners in this project are <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/\">EuroClio</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a>, <a href=\"https://centrumcyfrowe.pl/en/homepage/\">Centrum Cyfrowe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision- NISV</a>, <a href=\"https://webtic.nl/\">Webtic</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ccma.cat/\">Corporació Catalana de Mitjans Audiovisuals- TV3</a>, all representing (in different capacities and areas) audiovisual collection holders, educational communities and EU citizens at large.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A toolkit and resources for educators&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the most important resources this project will develop include a toolkit for educators, which will offer recommendations and ready-to-use material on how to bring audiovisual resources into educational practices to promote media literacy. The project will also develop a guide for cultural heritage practitioners (audiovisual content holders) on how to unleash the potential of this type of content for educational use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the project works towards developing these resources, it is already undertaking research which shines the light on important questions in this area. For example, the <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/wp-content/uploads/State-of-the-Field-Report-on-Media-Literacy-supported-by-AV-Collections.pdf\">State of the Field Report on Media Literacy supported by AV Collections</a> by Centrum Cyfrowe analyses how AV materials are currently used for education, what challenges teachers, students, and educators face, and what can be done to overcome them. The study shows that the main barriers to use of AV materials in media literacy education are the deficit of technical equipment and pedagogical skills among educators, as well as the difficulty they have in finding adequate AV with clear permission for educational use and related teaching materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report also recognises a number of stimuli that could better integrate AV in education, like proper training (on the importance of the topic itself, media literacy and searching for appropriate materials or copyright), more technical and ready-to-use pedagogical support or improved access to online collections of archival AV that feature high-quality metadata matching the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to make this report more accessible to a wider audience it has an executive summary in English, Polish, Dutch, Spanish and Catalan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On top of this research, project partner NISV has updated the media literacy competence framework for history education, previously developed by EuroClio, in English, Polish, Dutch, Spanish and Catalan. The framework helps to better understand what are the media literacy competencies needed in history and citizenship education, and how they are supported by audio-visual materials. This framework will also support the didactical requirements to build and add more pedagogical tools on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a>, a free online learning environment that supports AV for history and citizenship education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the coming months, the project will work to build capacity in educators through training workshops. It will also develop a dedicated module on the use of AV materials to promote critical thinking and digital literacy skills, which will be available in the 2025 edition of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom/moocs\">Digital Education with Cultural Heritage MOOC</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to stay tuned of future developments and other capacity building opportunities that will take place, follow #WatchLikeHistorians and consult the<a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/projects/watching-videos/\"> project page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Recent advances in IT and AI offer remarkable opportunities for the automatic enrichment of cultural heritage metadata with minimal resources. However, involving humans in this work remains important. In the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crafted\">CRAFTED project</a>, we are taking craft heritage as a case study in order to forge, implement and test a methodology that combines algorithms with human validation for the enrichment of cultural heritage metadata at scale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The methodology, which we outline below, consists of four main steps: data analysis; automatic enrichment; validation of the enrichments by humans; and refining enrichments based on the validation outcomes. In each of the steps in this process, we grappled with a number of crucial questions. What kinds of enrichment are useful for different types of data? How do we select appropriate samples for human validation? How can we establish acceptable quality thresholds for automatic enrichments?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Data analysis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gaining a detailed understanding of the metadata and content in the collections selected for enrichment, as well as defining case appropriate enrichment objectives, is a crucial first step in determining the requirements that our tools have to meet. It's important to study the different languages and semantics of each metadata field, as well as the way their values are structured (for example, when looking at a field that conveys spatial information one might find out that its value is often structured in the format&nbsp; of ‘city / region’). Similarly, the characteristics of the content have to be scrutinised to identify meaningful features that can be derived from it, considering aspects like the available image resolution and the way objects are depicted in images.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Automatic enrichment</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the CRAFTED project we have applied a number of different tools to analyse the textual metadata and content of a large variety of collections with different characteristics and enrichment needs. For the analysis of metadata, we used the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/sage\">SAGE</a> platform (Semantic Annotation and Generation of Enrichments) developed by the National Technical University of Athens. The platform is able to analyse textual metadata in different languages and identify a broad variety of case-appropriate concepts (such as materials and techniques) mentioned in the metadata. It can then link them with terms from domain-specific online vocabularies, such as the Europeana Fashion thesaurus that covers fashion-related concepts. It can also perform more general-purpose named entity extraction to identify organisations, places, and people, and connect them to Linked Open knowledge bases such as Wikidata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In parallel, we tried out a number of tools that analyse images and videos. We experimented with two main approaches for colour detection: the first approach distinguishes the foreground from the background, after which it tries to extract the colour(s) of the detected foreground. The second approach essentially does the same, but is assisted by a trained object detection algorithm. We also tried to detect and extract written text from images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Lastly, we extracted textual transcripts from videos, with mixed results depending on the spoken language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Human validation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the third step of the methodology, humans are&nbsp;&nbsp;invited to check the results of the automated annotation step and accept or reject them. The human validators can also add new annotations that the automatic algorithm failed to identify.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Admittedly, the more of these automatic annotations are validated, the better. However, there are thousands of these automated annotations, and having human validators go through them is a very resource-intensive process. So instead we review a sample of the annotations that is&nbsp;selected to allow&nbsp; us to draw conclusions about all automatic annotations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of factors have to be considered during sample selection. For the metadata analysis, the sample needs to&nbsp;cover different metadata fields with various text lengths, consider the certainty scores that the annotation algorithms assigned to their annotations (which suggest how confident they feel that they are correct), and so forth. Similarly, for the content analysis, the sample has to keep a balanced representation of items with different content characteristics, for example, with different colours and different types of objects.</p>\r\n"

For example, if humans tend to accept all sample annotations for which&nbsp; the automated model gave a confidence score of 80% or higher, we may decide that all annotations above that score can automatically be accepted as valid. Human validations can also help us to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different algorithms. This last goal is the objective of a recently initiated crowdsourcing campaign that aims to evaluate the results produced by two different colour detection algorithms. <a href=\"https://dev.crowdheritage.eu/en/crafted-campaigns\">You can help us evaluate our annotation models too!</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lastly, we want to use human feedback to improve the accuracy of the automatic algorithms themselves. Although retraining algorithms that rely on machine learning techniques is not among the objectives of the CRAFTED project, human feedback can help us tweak the algorithms towards achieving higher-accuracy results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you wish to help us evaluate the results produced by our colour detection algorithms, we invite you to contribute to one of the following crowdsourcing campaigns:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/crafted-prato\">campaign</a> on collections from the Museum of Prato that aims to compare two different AI algorithms</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/crafted-momu\">campaign</a> involving crafts items from the Fashion Museum Antwerp</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/crafted-ekt\">campaign</a> on various items from Greek crafts heritage</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

Martin is a patron of many churches and convicts around the Netherlands and Europe, which are connected via the European Cultural Heritage Route and promote the values of sharing, mercy and equality. These values and religious sites are often forgotten among the young as other lifestyle products and interests become more important. So Breda University partnered with the Saint Martin Church in Utrecht to curate relevant information for a location-based game to attract a young target audience and share the European spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you use Europeana's APIs and data from Europeana in your project? How was your experience of using them?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana API</a> was used as a database to retrieve and add information about cultural heritage objects and sites in a user-centred way. Our project was based on the concept of crowdsourcing which means that users could co-create it, by, for example, adding information about cultural heritage, and curating and moderating (newly added) data (text, video, numbers, audio) which then trains artificial intelligence to create and moderate it - a technique called supervised machine learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the hackathon we tested the API for feasibility. We experienced few problems in communicating with the database in itself, although some information we aimed to retrieve was unavailable/needed some more preprocessing, specifically with retrieving the actual images from the API, because we only got the indexing data back as opposed from the image.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Did you use any other technical tools that you had never used before?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within this project we tried to make a connection to Niantic’s Lightship platform which is used to design location based games and playful experiences. The hackathon gave us a good overview of different technology components, their features and limitations. This has to be further explored and implemented in a clickable prototype.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We would love to hear from your students directly - what was the most valuable thing that they learned from the programme?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jos Kamp, 4th year International Tourism Management Student, BUas, says, ‘During the Europeana Hackathon I have really seen the value of thinking outside of the box when it comes to combining different types of technology. The fact that Europeana adds so much value through their cultural heritage database provides many options for the future. Combining the strengths of different disciplines is an extremely powerful tool!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elisabeth Engering, 2nd year student Data Science &amp; AI at BUas added: ‘The most valuable aspect I learned from this project was definitely the APi integration. The creative ways on how the information from such a big database can be used was fascinating!’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where can people find your project, or learn from your work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For now, you can contact the professorship of Digital Transformation in Cultural Tourism at Breda University of Applied Sciences - me, Professor Jessika Weber Sabil, via email (<a href=\"mailto:weber.j@buas.nl\">weber.j@buas.nl</a>) or Frederike van Ouwerkerk (senior lecturer in Tourism, Ouwerkerk, <meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"mailto:Ouwerkerk.f@buas.nl\">Ouwerkerk.f@buas.nl</a>)&nbsp;for more information or collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;What's next for you/your team?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the project is still in its concept phase, there are still many details for collaborations and further funding to explore. We intend to collaborate with another educational institute and the cultural heritage route of St Martin to develop a gaming prototype. Jos will evaluate and explore this prototype in his bachelor thesis. Also, the team is so much looking forward to <a href=\"https://www.socialhackathonumbria.info/en/live-the-challenge/\">going to Umbria in summer</a> to continue the second phase of the hackathon and getting to know the other teams of the Europeana Low-Code festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Explore and use Europeana’s APIs </a>or discover more opportunities to use digital cultural heritage in education by signing up for the upgraded <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/register-now-for-the-upgraded-digital-education-with-cultural-heritage-2023-mooc\">‘Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ 2023 MOOC</a>.</p>\r\n"

From April, an online 'transcribing' event on our website <a href=\"https://transcribathon.eu\">Transcribathon.eu</a> will invite people across Europe to transcribe historical documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In May, Europeana's third Digital Storytelling Festival will explore themes relating to the World Festival of Cultural Diversity in a two-day online event discussing trends and ideas in digital storytelling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stories</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From February to May 2023, Europeana will focus on publishing and promoting stories relating to cultural diversity across Europe and beyond. These will be added to a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/world-festival-of-cultural-diversity\">special Festival section on the Europeana website</a>, bringing together stories of European culture in all its diversity under three themes: cross-cultural exchange, under-represented cultures and European cultural expressions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Support to tell your story</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2022, Europeana began supporting an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-are-supporting-underrepresented-voices-on-the-europeana-website\">editorial grants programme</a> to provide funding for writers to contribute blogs that put a spotlight on underrepresented communities, voices and lived experiences. In spring 2023, as part of the World Festival of Cultural Diversity, we are dedicating this programme to supporting authors telling stories about religious diversity in Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to support stories that reflect Europe's diverse religious cultural heritage. For example, we would like to publish stories about Europe's Islamic heritage, Hinduism, Orthodox, Yazidism and other minoritised religions. While we have published many stories about Christianity (for example, stories about <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=monasteries\">monasteries</a> or <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/stories?tags=saints\">saints</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/jewish-heritage\">Jewish history</a>, stories about other religions remain under-represented on the Europeana website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you think you can tell a story on the Europeana websiteabout these topics? We can support you with a grant of €200 - see more information and apply through the form below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

To find out more about the work of the DSSC, we speak to Esther Huyer, Director for data strategy and data policy at <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/\">Capgemini Invent,</a> one of the 12 Consortium partners entrusted by the European Commission to set it up and run it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us about your own work and that of Capgemini Invent in the Data Spaces Support Centre?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Capgemini Invent, we have long been supporting the European Commission on its path towards making data available and increasing its impact. We first focused on open data with the development of the European Open Data Portal data.europa.eu, and then deployed the <a href=\"https://futurium.ec.europa.eu/en/support-centre-data-sharing/pages/about\">Support Centre for Data Sharing</a> - which gave advice on technical, legal and organisational topics around data sharing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Its successor is the Data Spaces Support Centre. A data space is the model of data sharing currently seen as a best practice to achieve a common European data ecosystem in which data can be shared interoperably and compliantly across sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the new Support Centre, we teamed up with our partners from the <a href=\"https://internationaldataspaces.org/\">International Data Spaces Association (IDSA)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fraunhofer.de/\">Fraunhofer Fokus</a> and others with whom we formed the <a href=\"https://dataspaces4.eu/\">dataspaces4eu</a> group in preparation for the actual project funded by the European Commission. As partners in the Data Spaces Support Centre, we are now supporting the development of key tools and are, in particular, responsible for the creation of a methodology to measure the impact and progress of the data spaces and conduct research on that basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Data Spaces Support Centre was launched in October 2022. What have you been working on since then?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As most of the Consortium partners have been collaborating on the topic for many months if not years, there is a great deal of strong networking, public events and a solid body of knowledge to look at today. Having many renowned experts from all fields of data sharing in one ‘room’ leads to in-depth, very fruitful and exhaustive discussions to define and align the terminology, scope and strategy of the endeavour. Our priority is to consolidate this knowledge and align visions within our partners and stakeholders. A useful first outcome is the <a href=\"https://dssc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Starterkit-Interim-Version-Release-19-Dec-2022.pdf\">Starter Kit for Data Space Designers</a> which is a How-to-Guide and collection of good practices on setting up a data space. We must remember that many data spaces do not have their own best practices yet or any legacy, on the contrary, they are in the early phase of forming, networking and researching.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Data Spaces Support Centre will help establish common ground between the different data spaces. What type of meaningful connections do you envisage between them?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As much as the business rationale or purpose might differ between the data spaces, there is much common ground and many potential synergies. A data space for the common good and a data space for increased efficiency and economic impact both need, for example, a solid approach to data governance, technical and semantic interoperability, community outreach and upskilling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many building blocks and best practices can and should be shared. This also enables us to compare the data spaces even though they are different in their objectives, level of maturity, and many other aspects that we are yet to discover and assess. We also need to prioritise cross-data space use&nbsp; sooner rather&nbsp; than later. Examples for the common European data space for cultural heritage might be found in interlocking with the data spaces for Skills, Tourism, and Language. We are already in contact to assess potential use cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the building blocks and principles towards a common European data ecosystem?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DSSC has based its Data Space Blueprint on the <a href=\"https://h2020-demeter.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Position-paper-design-principles-for-data-spaces.pdf\">OPEN DEI Position Paper: Design principles for data spaces</a>, which identifies interoperability, trust, data value and governance as key building blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You are involved in&nbsp; both the Data Spaces Support Centre and in the deployment of the common European data space for cultural heritage stewarded by the Europeana Initiative.&nbsp; What is the thing you find most exciting about this connection?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That is a wonderful question and makes me smile! Where to begin? I have been working on the conceptual side of things for many years in my role as data strategy and policy advisor, and it now intrigues me to be part of the team putting them into practice. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to be on both sides now: thinking and talking about blueprints, solutions and concepts, and&nbsp; also putting these elements into practice and making sure they&nbsp; stand the test of being realistic, viable, pragmatic and ultimately successful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second aspect that excites me is the cultural heritage mandate - a prestigious and vastly complex honour to be working on for Europe. Questions like finding, discussing, prioritising and realising digital preservation of our European culture entails so much meaning to me!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The 14 interconnected data spaces will grow at their own rates, but with the Europeana Initiative - already almost 15 years old - at its heart, the common European data space for cultural heritage has a head start. Based on this experience, what could the data space for cultural heritage share with the data space community?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although I fully agree with you and the idea that Europeana has a head start, I would also like to add that a rich legacy can also be burdensome. Looking at legacy IT systems or data platforms and their migration, I have seen the complexity of a proven solution when it has to undergo change. Processes, mind-set and beliefs need to follow the shift as well. That is the reason the term ‘change management’ exists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That said, Europeana´s excitement to learn and to share its learnings will benefit the other data spaces immensely. The Data Spaces Support Centre is very aware of the treasure the pre-existing data spaces bring to the table, and I have not seen any resistance to accepting, sharing and adapting best practices, ideas, and impulses. Europeana´s very solid approach to data governance and community engagement are just two aspects that come to my mind which the other data spaces will want to understand in depth and mimic. As we speak, we are setting up a working group on data governance with representatives of the Europeana Foundation and other data spaces. The Europeana Foundation will also contribute to the <a href=\"https://internationaldataspaces.org/data-spaces-symposium/\">Data Spaces Symposium</a> that will take place from 21-23&nbsp; March in the Hague.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I invite you to <a href=\"https://internationaldataspaces.org/data-spaces-symposium/\">join this event</a> if you are curious to learn more about the DSSC and the data space ecosystem!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have been working in the field of UNESCO World Heritage since 2006, with a focus on capacity building for professionals. While working, I noticed the gap in capacity building for the younger generation, who are the future guardians of our common heritage. Therefore in 2021, I founded a non-profit organisation in Berlin that works with UNESCO World Heritage sites to develop place-based, cross-curricular e-learning materials for school children (9-16 years) to support Education for Sustainable Development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We create accessible and engaging e-learning curricula to transfer and share the values and knowledge embedded in World Heritage sites, encouraging pupils to explore Local Solutions - Global Challenges. Our <a href=\"http://www.heritage-and-education.de\">cross-curricular e-learning materials</a> use interactive EduTech, storytelling and multi-sensory media presentations to create a student-centred, self-paced, collaborative learning journey. It offers a ready-to-use digital solution for pupils (9-16 years) to learn about sustainability in a contextualised and meaningful way. In addition, the e-learning materials provide downloadable worksheets to guide offline, hands-on activities and lesson plans for teachers/instructors to use flexibly in different formal and informal educational settings, such as eTwinning, flipped classrooms or project weeks. It is made available free of charge on the open-source learning platform for schools and pupils across cultures to enhance intercultural understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our e-learning curricula require copyright free digital materials from heritage sites and other resources in order to ensure the free use by teachers and pupils. Acquiring suitable audiovisual materials can be a challenging process. Open Education Resources (OER), as recommended by UNESCO, shine a light on the future of education, but they need collaborative efforts and further support from different stakeholders in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My favorite part is the participatory process of creation. We have an interdisciplinary team across cultural/natural heritage and pedagogy, and we invite a wide range of local stakeholders in the design and feedback. It is a very dynamic and beneficial experience, in which we gain a deep understanding of the needs and interests of our target audience and relevant stakeholders, and we have received inspiring input and genuine support for a shared vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe in the power of culture and education and I am interested in building synergies across different sectors. Europeana is pioneering the digitisation of cultural heritage in Europe with the support of dynamic and active communities from all walks of life. I am very excited to join the movement and discussion with dedicated professionals to embrace digital transformation through innovation, creativity and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Members Councillor, I would like to work together with Europeana’s various communities to enhance the educational applications of digital cultural heritage. I plan to ensure that the needs and interests of our Education Community are better heard and better served. Meanwhile, I would like to strengthen the exchange and cooperation between the Education community and other communities, such as the Climate Action, Copyright, EuropeanaTech and Impact community by supporting some joint initiatives.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why this topic? Why a digital platform?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rubbish has become a central issue of our time, but it’s a difficult one - it concerns what we dispose of and do not want to look at anymore. When the House of European History started developing our exhibition project about the history of waste - titled <a href=\"https://historia-europa.ep.eu/en/throwaway\">‘Throwaway - the history of a modern crisis’</a>, we decided it was an opportunity to fulfil ’s our mission as a European museum, working in a truly transnational fashion with fellow museums across the continent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also believed that museums, as places of conservation that connect objects and stories across time, have a responsibility to address the topic of waste. The response we received from the organisations we contacted showed that many others shared our conviction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a concrete result of our collaboration, we chose to develop a web platform accessible in several languages, to have a Europe-wide outreach. This content-driven online environment offers a wealth of resources in various formats, all developed by the partners themselves. It is a unique opportunity for all partner organisations to create intersections and connections between their collections and their local environments. And hopefully, to broaden their audience’s horizons.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does this digital platform have to offer?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than an online equivalent to the House of European History’s exhibition in Brussels, the platform is a gateway for people to discover objects, places and people across Europe and their relations across countries, disciplines and periods. It provides a kaleidoscopic view of the significance of our rubbish in the past and today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visitors can discover over 60 digitised objects from the participating museums’ collections. &nbsp;Each object tells a story through photos and texts, making the visitor reflect on everything around us – are they disposable and valueless, or rather transitory and reusable? Rubbish or resource?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform also invites people to reflect on global issues by learning about local realities and communities related to waste, through around 40 short videos filmed in the museums’ surroundings or premises. Audiovisuals show stories as diverse as the reconstruction of a house using a zero-waste approach, the management of the rubbish resulting from floods, and an interview with a member of one of the museum’s cleaning staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To engage online visitors in a playful way as well, we developed a game on ‘defining rubbish’, something more complex than it seems, using definitions we gathered from professionals working in the fields of waste collection, reuse and reduction in Brussels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, the online platform will host blogposts, photo reportages, live-streamed events and podcasts on a variety of activities and happenings around the issue of waste taking place throughout 2023.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did we work together?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The House of European History has played a central role as initiator and coordinator of the initiative. From the outset and throughout the process, it has proved important to provide clear and reliable information to our partners on the why, what and how of our joint project. This has been necessary for them to identify what their contribution can be, and to be able to mobilise their broader museum team. From the beginning, our aim has been to ‘Europeanise’ the discourse on a given historical topic, waste in this case. We conceived this partnership as part of a bigger museum-wide project that allows us to draw human and financial resources from the House of European History and to bring in design and production expertise from a contractor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has also been crucial to build on the partner museums’ own initiatives and priorities. Initially we had to convince the museums we approached that their active participation in the partnership was not only worthwhile but also feasible despite their other engagements and sometimes scarce human resources. Together, we were able to identify how participating in the consortium was actually a way for them to deepen and enrich some of their on-going or upcoming work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do we achieve through this initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together, as museums, are we becoming better equipped to address the topic of waste and its history in Europe? Certainly! Are we being successful in achieving the goals we set for this partnership? We hope so! It is encouraging to see how our German partner, the Museum of European Cultures, decided to enrich its own exhibition project on menstrual waste and the environment with expertise and content coming from other European countries; to learn that the colleagues from the Austrian Museum of Folk Life and Folk Art in Vienna want to organise a trip to another partner museum, the Slovenian Museum of Recent History Celje, for their Museum Association members; to hear that thanks to the project our Italian partner, the Ettore Guatelli Museum, has started to collaborate with a neighbouring centre to promote/undertake creative recycling. And these are just a few examples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, it is too early to evaluate the project. What is certain is that this collaborative journey is proving to be a unique exercise in gathering collective knowledge that allows us to connect as people, to reflect as a group, and to act in a concerted way. In doing so, we are contributing to providing a meaningful answer to the question we have been asking throughout this project on the history of waste: what does Europe’s trash tell us about its past, its present, and its future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.throwaway-history.eu\">Explore our platform online</a> and do not hesitate to give us feedback!&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Can you tell me about your institution?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are a public school in Batalha, in the centre of Portugal. We have about 2,000 students from kindergarten to secondary school, and 200 teachers. We try to involve our students in many different projects and initiatives (including Erasmus). As an ambassador for EUN, when I saw the Low-Code Fest Initiative I thought this was exactly what we were looking for because my 12th grade students of informatics develop projects related to software and digital.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did your project want to achieve?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our school has a very close relationship with the famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_Monastery&amp;qf=TYPE%3A%22IMAGE%22&amp;qf=collection%3Aphotography&amp;query=Batalha%20AND%20portugal&amp;view=grid\">Monastery of Batalha</a>, and so the students developed their project in partnership with the monastery. The aim was to use digital activities and an app to encourage teachers and students (who may be less interested in cultural heritage) to develop interest in the monastery through digital artefacts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you use Europeana's APIs and data from Europeana in your project?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once our proposal was accepted we met with technicians from the monastery to discuss how to achieve our main goal - to attract young people to the monastery. We started to develop a website which tells the history of the monastery through four main characters, and a script which structured the space of the monastery. This approach resulted from the brainstorming with the students and technicians - it was very interesting because it really put people into life in the monastery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From searches on the Europeana platform we saw that there was <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;qf=TYPE%3A%22IMAGE%22&amp;qf=collection%3Aphotography&amp;query=Batalha%20AND%20portugal&amp;view=grid\">lots of information related to the monastery and its history available</a>. We decided to use the API to bring content from the Europeana website to the website that we are building; it’s currently in draft but we are working to bring it to life!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How was your experience of using the APIs?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the beginning it was not straightforward for the students, even if they had experience and knowledge of software development. They had some difficulties inputting what we needed, but having support from the webinars organised through Low-Code Fest, and from Jolan Wuyts at the Europeana Foundation was very beneficial!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once they understood more about the APIs - that through an interface, their website can connect with a big platform like the Europeana website, which could push content directly to it (rather than having to copy across and extract information) - they found this very interesting and beneficial to work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Did you use any other technical tools that you had never used before?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the APIs, the students explored tools related to web development, app development and prototyping (for example, Sigma).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We would love to hear from your students directly - what was the most valuable thing that they learned from the programme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The students reflected that, ‘It was a great adventure to participate in this project and to be one of the three finalist projects. We learned a lot about digital cultural heritage and its importance not only in the dissemination but also in its preservation. The opportunity to collaborate with the Monastery was very important and the workshops with experts from various areas even more exciting. This kind of initiative should be common in schools, where we can interact with experts from various areas because it motivates us to learn a lot.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘From the programme, and regarding the technical issues of APIs, we learned that the optimization of speed in services utilising APIs is crucial. In our view, a fast and responsive API can make a substantial impact on the user experience, leading to improved satisfaction and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They also shared that, ‘We are super excited to go to Italy to share our project idea and learn even more about this whole subject.’</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>At the heart of J-Ark is the eArchiving component, which provides a powerful, open-source long-term preservation solution. J-Ark uses the <a href=\"https://www.roda-community.org\">Roda</a> software developed by <a href=\"https://www.keep.pt/en/\">KEEP Solutions</a>, a leading provider of digital preservation solutions. Roda is a proven platform that has been successfully used by institutions around the world to manage and preserve their digital archives. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Integrating Roda into J-Ark has created a robust and reliable platform that is specifically tailored to the needs of Jewish archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">J-Ark offers the possibility to publish materials on Europeana.eu, which offers access to thousands of digitised cultural heritage objects from across Europe. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://judaica-europeana.eu/\">Judaica Europeana</a> aggregator, operated by <a href=\"https://jhn.ngo/\">Jewish Heritage Network</a>, the Europeana website already provides access to an<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/jewish-heritage\"> enormous wealth of Jewish heritage materials</a> including digitised manuscripts, photographs, artwork, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, J-Ark employs the eTranslation component to provide machine translation and anonymisation services (via <a href=\"https://pangeanic.com/es/\">Pangeanic</a> API). This allows Jewish archives to quickly and easily translate the texts included in their digital content into multiple languages, making it accessible to a wider audience. The anonymisation services ensure that sensitive information can be protected, while still enabling researchers to access and analyse the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">J-Ark is already being used by a number of Jewish archives, including the <a href=\"https://teatrnn.pl/en/\">Grodzka Gate ‐ NN Theatre</a> in Lublin, <a href=\"https://thetogetherplan.com/\">The Together Plan</a> in Minsk and London and the <a href=\"https://www.lzb.lt/en/\">Lithuanian Jewish Community</a> in Vilnius. These institutions have praised the software for its user-friendliness, robustness, and compatibility with existing workflows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/j-ark-european-jewish-community-archive\">J-Ark project partners</a> are excited to offer this innovative solution to Jewish archives around the world, and look forward to working with institutions to ensure the preservation of this vital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About the project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled</a> was a Europeana Generic Services project co-funded by the European Union under the Connecting Europe Facility Programme. Running from&nbsp; June 2021 to November 2022, the project aimed to enable audiovisual media heritage to be enjoyed by professional and non-professional audiences as well as to increase its use through closed captioning and subtitling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Subtitled gathered seven major national broadcasters and audiovisual archives from seven European countries to provide high-quality audiovisual materials to Europeana. The project combined AI technology and audiovisual cultural heritage to produce high-quality closed captions and English subtitles for local video content, and created a platform to allow organisations to run crowdsourcing campaigns to revise captions using state of the art editing tools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Subtitled also supported cultural heritage professionals with the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) technologies in the cultural sector through an online training suite consisting of video tutorials, documentation and guidelines, and worked with teachers and museum educators to create learning resources with audiovisual content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the project engaged audiences through crowdsourcing events and editorial activities on the Europeana website, in particular, through the '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/broadcasting-europe\">Broadcasting Europe</a>' page and '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/mass-media-and-propaganda-in-20th-century-europe\">Mass-media and propaganda</a>' online exhibition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Delivering audiovisual content to Europeana</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through Europeana Subtitled, over 8,000 thousand high-quality audiovisual materials related to the theme ‘Broadcasting Europe’ were published on the Europeana platform, complying with the publishing criteria of content Tier 2 or higher and metadata tier B or higher, as specified in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework (EPF)</a>. In addition, the project made more than 12,000 updates to content that was already published. This included quality improvements in the data and rights statements, to allow reuse for educational purposes (InC-EDU).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The audiovisual content was aggregated through the domain aggregator for audiovisual heritage, EUscreen, and was carefully selected by the project partners to highlight the social, political and cultural changes in Europe as seen through television screens in the Netherlands, Slovenia, Greece, Germany, Italy, Romania and Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Subtitled content is publicly available and videos can be enjoyed directly on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?view=grid&amp;query=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Europeana%20Subtitled%20-%20new%20record%22%20AND%20NOT%20proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Europeana%20XX%3A%20Century%20of%20Change%22%20AND%20metadataTier%3AB&amp;page=1\">the Europeana website</a>, while you can also access<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=edm_datasetName%3A2051906_%2A%20AND%20proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Europeana%20Subtitled%22%20AND%20NOT%20proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Europeana%20XX%3A%20Century%20of%20Change%22%20AND%20metadataTier%3AB\"> freely reusable&nbsp;content</a> with more than 3,000 records in the Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Crowdsourced captioning&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Subtitled project partner Translated developed The Subbit! Platform. This audiovisual editing platform allows cultural heritage institutions to set up and run custom campaigns to correct, edit and validate automatically generated subtitles from a variety of languages into English. Subbit! encourages professionals and the general public to work directly with audiovisual archival content and European heritage, highlighting the importance of more accessible audiovisual archival material for multilingual audiences and increasing awareness of audiovisual online collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the course of the project, crowdsourcing events using Subbit! were held throughout Europe, encouraging students and cultural heritage enthusiasts to engage with audiovisual clips from European heritage collections in a friendly and fun way, while enriching the clips for future use and practicing their language skills. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/subbit-platform\">Find out more and use the platform.&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Subbit! and the Europeana Subtitled AI Pipeline&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The subtitles used in the Subbit! platform are created automatically by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-subtitled-ai-pipeline-and-training-suite\">Europeana Subtitled AI Pipeline</a> which generates closed captions and subtitles for videos using automatic speech recognition and machine translation from EU languages to English. By using this tool approximately, 250 hours of AV recording were post-edited by professionals, while 50 hours were post-edited by the general public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Comparing subtitles post-edited via the Subbit! platform with their original automatic version generated by the Europeana Subtitled AI Pipeline allowed project partners to quantify the quality of the automatically generated subtitles in terms of WER and BLEU scores (two metrics commonly used for the evaluation of respectively automatic speech recognition and machine translation). The results of this comparison showed that the overall target for WER and BLEU were successfully achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both the Europeana Subtitled AI Pipeline and Subbit! platform use the Europeana APIs to retrieve video content and contribute back the generated and validated subtitles and closed captions to the Europeana platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘Broadcasting Europe’ to audiences</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A dedicated feature page on the Europeana website called <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/broadcasting-europe\">Broadcasting Europe</a> showcases editorial content curated and published by Europeana Subtitled project partners. The 28 editorial pieces highlighted on the page cover a diverse range of topics using audiovisual heritage from local and national archives across Europe. Using broadcasting and communication as its key themes, Europeana Subtitled partners created stories about European identity, social change, politics and tourism (among others) through the lens of cultural diversity, gender equality, youth empowerment, migration, discrimination and social exclusion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Featuring audiovisual heritage broadcast at local, national and international levels, Europeana Subtitled told stories about important events and personalities that marked the history of the seven participant countries and of Europe at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Europeana Subtitled training suite&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project developed a training suite for people that want to create and contribute to improving subtitles, who can follow instructional videos on the <a href=\"https://subbit.eu/how-it-works/\">Subbit! Website</a> to learn how to create and/or improve them. In addition to technical skills and competencies, these resources also present general good subtitling practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Professionals that want to get a better understanding of the work involved to subtitle their audiovisual cultural heritage were also supported by the project, and could participate in one of three training events that were organised in winter 2022. The project has converted these events into a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-subtitled-ai-pipeline-and-training-suite\">training suite</a> which covers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the steps you need to take to enrich audiovisual collections with subtitles and translation&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">which variables to take into account to determine the usability of audiovisual collections, from training AI to publication with subtitles and translations and&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">where to find more information in case you want to start working on subtitles and translation for audiovisual collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

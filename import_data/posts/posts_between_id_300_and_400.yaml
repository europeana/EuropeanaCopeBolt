        title: 'Sharing Metadata Expertise With DPLA'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Metadata expertise from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a> is now being used by the American library community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 8 February, the <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America</a> released a new version of its <a href=\"http://dp.la/about/map\">Metadata Application Profile</a> (MAP), to be used in the coming April 2013 DPLA public release. The DPLA drew on advice and feedback from Robina Clayphan (Interoperability Manager for The European Library and Europeana) and Antoine Isaac (Scientific Coordinator for Europeana) to create its latest set of metadata documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its <a href=\"http://dp.la/2013/02/08/map-announcement/\">announcement</a>, the DPLA says, 'This new version is designed to build on the experience of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM). In addition, it incorporates feedback from the DPLA community and digital hub pilot participants to create a balanced framework that allows us to accommodate existing and emerging data models for library, archive, and museum resources.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Migration%20kids.jpg\" style=\"width: 321px; height: 427px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Image from the first DPLA/Europeana joint exhibition 'Leaving Europe: A New Life in America'. 'Emigrants [sur Ellis Island], deux gosses d'Italie', Bibliothèque nationale de France, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical interoperability between the DPLA and Europeana has been defined as a crucial goal for the two initiatives (read <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=861972&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">'DPLA and Europeana announce collaboration' press release</a>). By directly re-using a number of elements from EDM, the DPLA MAP makes a big step towards easing data interchange between both networks and lowering the barrier for data consumers who will want to plug into both platforms at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the collaboration between Europeana and the DPLA was announced in October 2011, Robert Darnton, a DPLA Steering Committee member and University Librarian at Harvard, said, 'The association between the DPLA and Europeana means that users everywhere will eventually have access to the combined riches of the two systems at a single click. The aggregated databases will include many millions of books, pamphlets, newspapers, manuscripts, images, recordings, videos, and other materials in many formats.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana, welcomed the agreement, saying that 'Europeana was designed to be open and interoperable, and to be able to collaborate with the DPLA is a validation of that aim. By this combined effort on two continents, Europeana and the DPLA hope to promote the creation of a global network with partners from around the world.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recent work on the DPLA's MAP provides the opportunity to widen collaboration channels between the two initiatives. In recent months, Europeana Foundations's Robina Clayphan and Antoine Isaac have been providing feedback to the DPLA metadata team (Jeffrey Licht, Jenn Riley, Amy Rudersdorf and Richard J. Urban), helping them to make the most of the metadata modelling expertise gathered in the Europeana Network. This is a great acknowledgement of the work carried out over the past few years by the entire Europeana family, including projects such as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-v1.0\">Europeana Version 1.0</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanaconnect.eu/\">Europeana Connect</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-libraries.eu/\">Europeana Libraries</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mimo-international.com/\">Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a>, <a href=\"http://www.peoplesheritage.eu/content/about_hope.htm\">Heritage of the People's Europe (HOPE)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.apenet.eu/\">APEnet</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPLA and Europeana have also collaborated on a virtual exhibition, exploring the stories of Europeans migrating to the US. <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\">Visit the 'Leaving Europe: A New Life in America' exhibition</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Introducing Network Officer Bengt Wittgren'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>In the latest of our blogs introducing the Europeana Network Officers, we meet Bengt Wittgren of Sweden...</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Bengt Wittgren_Photo_Björn Grankvist.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 366px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Bengt Wittgren</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am head of the Information Department and Deputy Director of <a href=\"http://www.murberget.se/english.aspx\">Västernorrland County Museum</a> - a regional museum in mid-Sweden. I have been in this role for 11 years but have worked at the museum since 1986, when I started as a curator in textile collections. Collections management and IT are my real areas of expertise in the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As there is no permanent organisation dealing with collections management across Sweden, I joined the International Council of Museums’ committee for documentation (<a href=\"http://network.icom.museum/cidoc/\">CIDOC</a>) in about 1995. The international CIDOC meetings have grown over the years and it is now very much like a congress. When I joined, it was more like a tight international group working with tasks such as documentation standards and international recommendations. I think that the International Council of Museums' (ICOM) workgroups need to work like that too – maybe nowadays more than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1998-2001, I worked with the Swedish Arts Council. When, in 1999, the European Commission asked the European National Ministries to establish a network to coordinate specific tasks in the area of museums and IT, the Arts Council was given the responsibility. I got the job of representing Sweden in a network called the European Museums Information Institute (EMII). We understood quite quickly that research and development took place in many countries but that not much of it was connected or re-used internationally. The idea with EMII was to avoid EU-financed projects inventing the same things as sister projects or previous projects had done. This is still an area that needs further work and I think the Europeana Network can be an important tool in this effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a number of years, I have been studying for a PhD in museology and have now happily come to the end of that road. This spring, I will publish my thesis about catalogues in museums, archives and libraries. My viewpoint is that catalogues are the key and the only real key to collections. My goal is to explain the boundaries hidden in the catalogues. I describe the Swedish history of collections management, review what knowledge the catalogues actually store and what the professionals think the catalogues represent. From this research, it is clear that there are quite large differences between catalogues in museums, archives and libraries. Most of the differences are related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxis_%28process%29\">praxis</a> (practices) and not to what you can see. I do not, however, offer the brilliant solution of a single cloud catalogue system for the whole of the museums, libraries and archives sector - I am not sure that is possible. Instead, the thesis offers facts about catalogue ‘macro metadata’ and about the relationships between the professions and the praxis. The thesis shows that the tacit knowledge in the praxis is, in some parts, possible to explain. This explanation is the result that I wanted and is one I am proud to introduce in my dissertation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When not working or studying, I enjoy folk music and traditional dance. I am engaged in Scandinavian traditions and give classes in Swedish dance and music traditions in groups around Europe, USA and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BengtMuseum.jpg\" style=\"width: 425px; height: 301px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'Friluftsmuseum' in Härnösand, where Bengt both works and lives. See this record in Europeana <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09410/3C3F73723D2727E05BC2CB3BC0A34B076D5920FC.html\">here</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I live in Härnösand, a small town in mid-Sweden, about 500km north of Stockholm and 1000km from the southern border of Sweden. My wife and our two boys like the differences between the winter with skiing, skating and all the snow and the bright summer nights - that is a quality of life we really enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Europeana Network Officer, my mission is to follow and support each sector's internal needs. I am convinced that the most important way of enriching museum content - especially in the Europeana context - is to jointly translate internationally accepted cataloging rules, which many countries do not have. And I think that the British SPECTRUM standard could be an important tool in this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think of Europeana as an essential platform for cooperation in the area of digitisation and the only area in which both GLAMs and the media can collaborate and build long-term solutions on a European level. But the ideas and support from content holders are vital. I am your voice – use me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can reach me by email: <a href=\"mailto:bengt.wittgren@murberget.se\">bengt.wittgren [at] murberget.se</a>, on Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bwittgren\">@bwittgren</a> and on LinkedIn.</p>"

Joris Pekel tells us more...</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Open%20Humanities%20Awards%20logo.png\" style=\"width: 179px; height: 170px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week the Open Knowledge Foundation launches the first ever Open Humanities Awards as part of the Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana project. There are €15,000 worth of prizes on offer for 3-5 projects that use open content, open data or open source tools to further humanities teaching and research. Whether you’re interested in patterns of allusion in Aristotle, networks of correspondence in the Jewish Enlightenment or digitising public domain editions of Dante, we’d love to hear about the kinds of open projects that could support your interest!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Humanities research is based on the interpretation and analysis of a wide variety of cultural artefacts including texts, images and audiovisual material. Much of this material is now freely and openly available on the internet enabling people to discover, connect and contextualise cultural artefacts in ways that previously proved very difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make the most of this new opportunity by encouraging budding developers and humanities researchers to collaborate and start new projects that use this open content and data, paving the way for a vibrant cultural and research commons to emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who can apply?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Awards are open to any citizen of the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is judging the Awards?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Awards will be judged by a stellar cast of leading digital humanists:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/institut/personen/gradmann\">Professor Stefan Gradmann, Humboldt University</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.tcd.ie/English/staff/academic-staff/susan-schriebman.php\">Dr Susan Schreibman, Trinity College Dublin</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/people/academic/prescott/index.aspx\">Professor Andrew Prescott, Kings College London</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/people/david-robey\">Professor David Robey, University of Oxford</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dis/people/melissaterras\">Dr Melissa Terras, University College London</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/\">Nicole Coleman, Stanford University Humanities Center</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/institut/professuren/korpuslinguistik/mitarbeiter-innen/laurent/laurent/\">Dr Laurent Romary, INRIA</a></li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What do we want to see?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Open%20Humanities%20Awards.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 324px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Mapping the Republic of Letters project is a great example of what is possible with humanities data.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are challenging humanities researchers, designers and developers to create innovative projects using open content, open data or open source to further teaching or research in the humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example you might want to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Start a project to collaboratively transcribe, annotate, or translate public domain texts</li>\r\n    <li>Explore patterns of citation, allusion and influence using bibliographic metadata or textmining</li>\r\n    <li>Analyse and/or visually represent complex networks or hidden patterns in collections of texts</li>\r\n    <li>Use computational tools to generate new insights into collections of public domain images, audio or texts</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You could start a project from scratch or build on an existing project. For inspiration you can have a look at the <a href=\"http://openglam.org/culture-labs\">open-source tools the Open Knowledge Foundation has developed </a>for use with cultural resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As long as your project involves open content, open data or open source tools and makes a contribution to humanities research, the choice is yours!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who is behind the awards?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Awards are being coordinated by the Open Knowledge Foundation and are part of the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\">DM2E</a> project. They are also supported by the <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/\">Digital Humanities Quarterly</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to apply</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Applications are open now!

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><i><a href=\"mailto:m.hagedorn@smb.spk-berlin.de\">Monika Hagedorn-Saupe</a> writes on behalf of the ENUMERATE project, asking some probing questions about the nature and cost of digitisation, and encouraging you to make use of the statistical information they are collecting.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>How much do we know about the growth of digital collections in Europe?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>Do we know how digital material is used?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>How much does digitisation cost?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>How is digital preservation maintained?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are questions many actors in the cultural field and primarily the European Commission are confronted with. There is not yet a consistent evidence base for making strategic decisions about investments in digitisation. The ENUMERATE project, co-funded by the European Commission, was started with the aim of creating a reliable baseline of statistical data about digitisation, digital preservation and online access to cultural heritage in Europe. ENUMERATE should bring about major improvements in the quality and availability of intelligence about digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Enumerate%20logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 318px; height: 212px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ENUMERATE Consortium of ten partners is at the heart of the ENUMERATE ‘Thematic Network’. Together, they have initiated a Europe-wide community of practice to share statistical data and knowledge on the progress of digitisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Enumerate%20team.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 356px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The ENUMERATE team</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the project's activities is to conduct a programme of coordinated surveys over several years. Currently the project focuses on thematic surveys to acquire a detailed understanding of how best to measure the growth of digital collections, the usage of digital material, costs of digitisation and digital preservation practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENUMERATE's first core survey was conducted in 2012 and the results have been published on the <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu\">ENUMERATE website</a>. The Consortium is also proud to announce the launch of its <a href=\"http://dataplatform.enumerate.eu/\">Data Platform </a> - the repository of all the project's data - which is now ready for consultation. Anonymised data can be downloaded and used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ENUMERATE Consortium would love it if the results of this project are re-used, re-analysed and re-interpreted as much as possible. Also, those of you who are interested in open source tools for the assessment and reporting of statistical data can find an evaluation of the tools we've tested as part of the project on the <a href=\"http://enumeratedataplatform.digibis.com/review-tools\">Data Platform</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to invite you to follow our work by subscribing to our <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu/en/newsletter/\">newsletter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also keep up-to-date with our news <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu\"> on our website</a>, on <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/ENUMERATE-4042570\">LinkedIn</a>, and on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EnumerateEU\"> Twitter</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Open Culture Data: Creative Re-use of GLAM Data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today's extended guest blog post introduces us to Open Culture Data and showcases some of the creative apps resulting from a series of hackathons that ran in 2012. By Lotte Belice Baltussen from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open data is data that can be accessed, distributed and re-used by everyone, even for commercial purposes, without the need to explicitly ask the data owner for permission. Many (semi-)governmental organisations are already openly publishing parts of their data. Open data is also high on the digital agenda in Europe. Europeana has contributed to the open realm by releasing all of its aggregated metadata under a CC0 Public Domain Dedication. The majority of GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives, museums) still need to incorporate this new form of transparency and public access into their policies, but do realise that it will help fulfil their public mission to open up access to heritage and that openness allows for creative re-use of material in new productions and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on these developments, <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/\">Kennisland</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, together with <a href=\"http://www.hackdeoverheid.nl/\">Hack de Overheid</a> (Hack the Government) launched <a href=\"http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/\">Open Culture Data</a> in September 2011. We are a network of cultural professionals, developers, designers, copyright specialists and open data experts who share the aim of making cultural data sets available under open conditions and stimulating the creation of useful and innovative applications in which these data sets are incorporated. In this context, we recently held a masterclass for cultural institutions, a series of hackathons and an app competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stimulating Re-use: Competitions and Hackathons</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with contributing eight data sets from six GLAM organisations to the national 'Apps for the Netherlands' 2011 competition and attending one of this competition’s hackathons. As a result, developers made 13 open culture data apps in one month. In 2012, we organised our own competition and two large-scale hackathons in June and October, followed by one smaller one in December aimed specifically at re-use of open culture data in games. The number of data sets available grew explosively: 35 sets from 22 data providers. This was due in a large part to our open data masterclass which was attended by 17 GLAM organisations, many of whom have also contributed to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our own competition, we set out three main challenges for the developer community:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Create applications that expand audience reach (online, offline, on-site)</li>\r\n    <li>Create applications in which the audience is reached in novel ways</li>\r\n    <li>Create applications that connect different data sets.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>There were four awards (Gold, Silver, Bronze, Dutch National Archives Prize) and a total prize pool of €7,500. The overall Gold winner could win €3,000. From June- December, we held many presentations to raise awareness of the competition and Open Culture Data itself, for instance talking at a developers conference, the Wikimedia Netherlands conference and to Communication and Media Design students. When the 31 December deadline for submitting apps arrived, the developer community had made 27 more Open Culture Data apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Apps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The 'Apps for the Netherlands' competition of 2011, which was primarily aimed at re-using open government data, had very positive outcomes for Open Culture Data. GlimwormIT won the overall contest prize with their app 'Vistory' (an app to recreate historical footage scenes with your smartphone camera). The app 'Rijksmonumenten.info' (a mash-up of data about monumental heritage in the Netherlands), made by Arjan den Boer won the education category. And the encouragement prize went to 'ConnectedCollection' (a cross-collection search widget), made by Wout van Wezel (Cit).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/baltussen.fig1.jpeg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 229px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Figure 1: Apps for the Netherlands 2011 winner '<a href=\"http://www.vistory.nl/\">Vistory</a>'</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our own app competition in 2012, a jury of five (two GLAM and two open data professionals, plus one developer) picked the winners. First prize went to 'Muse' app made by Femke van der Ster, Peter Henkes, and Jelle van der Ster. Muse allows you to create your own work of art with cut-outs from world-famous old masters: landscapes, people, animals, objects and skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/baltussen.fig2.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 360px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Figure 2: Gold prize winner '<a href=\"http://www.museapp.org/\">Muse</a>' app, developed by Femke van der Ster, Jelle van der Ster and Peter Henkes.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Silver went to 'Histagram' by Frontwise (Richard Jong), which is an app you can use to make digital postcards based on historical pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/baltussen.fig3.png\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 454px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Figure 3: Silver prize winner '<a href=\"http://www.frontwise.nl/lab/histagram\">Histagram</a>', developed by Richard Jong.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third prize went to 'SimMuseum' by Hay Kranen, a web game in which you can play a museum director, collect work of arts and build your own museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/baltussen.fig4.png\" style=\"width: 493px; height: 370px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Figure 4: Bronze prize winner '<a href=\"http://simmuseum.haykranen.nl/\">SimMuseum</a>', developed by Hay Kranen.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dutch National Archives prize went to 'Tijdbalk.nl' made by Arjan den Boer. Users can make their own timeline with historical photos and add their own content as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/baltussen.fig5.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 379px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Figure 5: National Archives prize winner '<a href=\"http://tijdbalk.nl/\">Tijdbalk.nl</a>', developed by Arjan den Boer.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By organising an app competition, Open Culture Data was able to raise awareness and set the agenda for open data, broadening the perspectives for cultural heritage institutions and demonstrating what can happen when you open up. It takes time, resources and energy to do this, but we are very happy with the outcomes. Of course, we are greatly indebted to all the developers who spent their valuable time and energy to build a great variety of apps. There are now 40 Open Culture Data apps, 90% of which are live and can be used by anyone. Many of these apps use not just the metadata, but also open content (images, videos, audio, text) of our data providers. Through Europeana, 23 million metadata records are already available. The content of 5 million of these records have open licences or are in the public domain and so qualify as Open Culture Data. This means that Europeana represents a gigantic pool of data that can be re-used in innovative ways via the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana API</a> in apps like the ones developed through our network. Models for doing so, including large-scale app competitions, are being developed all over Europe, notably in the '<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/apps/projects/factsheet/index.cfm?project_ref=325090\">Apps for Europe</a>' project. Kennisland, Sound and Vision and Hack de Overheid are all partners in Apps4EU, as is Europeana. We hope many more apps that are relevant to the GLAM community will be developed in the coming years. In the meantime, we hope you can find inspiration in the apps that have already been made on our website and will join the open culture movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More information on Open Culture Data</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.opencultuurdata.nl\">www.opencultuurdata.nl</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/opencultuurdata\">@opencultuurdata</a> and tag/search with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opencultuurdata&amp;src=typd\">#opencultuurdata</a></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<h3 id=\"a_call_for_proposals\">\r\n    A call for proposals</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    The European Commission has published a call for funding proposals under their ICT Policy Support Programme, due on 14 May. This call for proposals includes Objective 2.1, 'Europeana and Creativity', described as 'enriching and improving Europeana, coordinating Europeana, and promoting the use of Europeana by creative industries'. As this source of funding is likely to be of interest to the wider Europeana community, we thought we could offer a place for organisations to share ideas with each other and perhaps to find other project partners.</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n        <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/ict-policy-support-programme\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PSP Description\">About the call</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital-agenda/files/cip_ict_psp_wp2013_publication.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PSP Work Programme\">Download the full work programme (PDF)</a>\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n    If you are interested in putting forward a project proposal in this area, it may help you to know about other organisations also planning to apply. Using the form below, you can register your interest in this call for proposals. In this form, you may elect to make your contact details public, in which case other organisations will be able to get in touch with you directly. You may also keep these details private, sharing only with the Europeana Foundation. We will review these expressions of interest a couple of times a month to see how and where we might be able to help.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of raising matching funding, the Europeana Foundation is not able to participate as a full project partner in proposals. However, Europeana would like to be considered as a subcontractor if you envisage work from the Europeana Office, or if your project will be contributing data to the Europeana repository.</p>\r\n<h3 id=\"tell_us_about_your_project_or_organisation\">\r\n    Tell us about your project or organisation</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Projects seeking partners and partners seeking projects may use this form to tell us:</p>\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n        Your organisation details</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        A project abstract or description of your capabilities</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        What part of the funding objective you are considering</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Whether you would like the Europeana Foundation to consider subcontracting on your project</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n        Whether you would like these details to be shared publicly</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>\r\n    <strong><a href=\"https://europeana.wufoo.com/forms/ictpsp-expression-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Expression of Interest under ICT-PSP\">Use this form to enter your details</a></strong></p>\r\n<h3 id=\"find_partners_or_projects\">\r\n    Find partners or projects</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n    Once potential projects and organisations have uploaded their information to the web form above, those electing to share their details will be listed here:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong><a href=\"https://europeana.wufoo.com/reports/ictpsp-expressions-of-interest/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"List of potential partners\">List of potential partners and projects</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We wish you the best of luck in your proposals, and please do not hesitate to get in touch with your ideas. If you have questions about this process, just send an email to us at <a href=\"mailto:partnernetwork@europeana.eu\">partnernetwork@europeana.eu</a>.</p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Guest blog by Dr Natalie Harrower, Manager of Education and Outreach, Digital Repository of Ireland.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In October 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/\">Digital Repository of Ireland</a> (DRI) and the <a href=\"http://decipher-research.eu/\">Decipher Project</a> assembled a team of researchers, and entered <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/hack4europe-2012\">Hack4Europe! 2012 Dublin</a>. The purpose of the hackathon was to make use of the newly released <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana API </a>(Application Programming Interface), and our team entered with the intention of connecting Europeana’s data with curation tools being developed by Decipher. Exactly how we were going to program the connection and how we hoped to exploit Europeana’s vast collections only emerged over the course of the two-day event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decipher’s platform <a href=\"http://decipher-research.eu/introducing-storyscope-edinburgh-museums-association-conference\">Storyscope</a> is being developed for museum professionals and the public to provide tools to research, develop, and present stories that connect cultural objects across diverse museum collections. The software includes an attractive visual interface that allows users to not only collect and arrange online objects, but to shape these collections into compelling narratives. The Storyscope developers understand that objects are enriched and given meaning through their connections, along with the annotations that surround these connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our team’s programmers worked on Storyscope to access the Europeana API, the rest of the team started developing a narrative around objects relating to Ireland and the Great War, which was one of the hackathon’s stated themes. One of our team members, Cormac Farrell, knew that his great grand-uncle Charles M. J. Ryan had fought and died in France, and Cormac had some of his medals and other memorabilia in his possession. Starting with the dates on Ryan’s death certificate, we were able to find related objects on Europeana, and started to build a narrative around the activities of Irish citizens at the Western Front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Storyscope also enables users to upload personal objects; in this case we added photographs of Charlie Ryan, and scans of letters he wrote to family members at home. Focusing on the last month of the war, our team was able to trace the lives of several individuals from varied backgrounds who were all in the Somme region on 4 October 1918, which is the date that Charlie Ryan died. By the end of the two-day event, we had curated a 'dossier' of objects that touched on the lives of a young lieutenant from the Royal Munster Fusiliers (Ryan), a private from the Royal Enniskillen Fusiliers, a war nurse from County Down, and a German soldier who took extensive photographs of the battlefields. The narrative we created paints a picture of the brief intersection in time and space when these individuals, all far from home, crossed paths in one of Europe’s most significant moments in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By combining Storyscope with Europeana’s API, users are able to search Europeana directly through Storyscope, and add other digital objects to enhance Europeana’s vast collections. In addition to the technological possibilities provided by this innovation, the social benefits are clear. Through this sample narrative, our team was able to draw connections between people from different cultural backgrounds through the lens of First World War experiences, revealing a 'common ground' that once proved so divisive in European history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can view a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/53006320\">screencast of the Ireland at the Western Front</a> dossier, and software concept explanations on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user1774074\">Decipher’s Vimeo channel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DRI team was composed of the following hackers: <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/cormac-farrell\">Cormac Farrell</a> (DIT), <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/dermot-frost\">Dermot Frost</a> (TCD), <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/damien-gallagher\">Damien Gallagher</a> (NUIM), <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/natalie-harrower\">Natalie Harrower</a> (RIA), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkBMaguire\">Mark Maguire</a> (IMMA), <a href=\"http://www.dmc.dit.ie/people/paula_mcgloin.html\">Paula McGloin</a> (DIT), <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/jimmy-tang\">Jimmy Tang</a> (TCD), and <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/james-wogan\">James Wogan</a> (RIA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Repository of Ireland and the Decipher Project continue to collaborate on innovative projects. The Storyscope prototype is undergoing trials with museums professionals, and the results will be presented at the <a href=\"http://www.museumsandheritage.com/show/\">Museum and Heritage Show</a> in London on 15-16 May 2013. For more information on Decipher, contact <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/james-wogan\">James Wogan</a>, and for more information on the work of the Digital Repository of Ireland, contact <a href=\"http://www.dri.ie/dri-team/natalie-harrower\">Natalie Harrower</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>\n\tRecently, we ran a competition to win a copy of a book by Breandán Knowlton, Europeana Programme Manager. To win <a href=\"http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-managing-web-projects\">'A practical guide to managing web projects' </a> all you had to do was answer the question 'How is the web changing cultural heritage?' We are now delighted to announce that the winner is Willem Prins. Rather than simply just publish his response, we thought we'd get to know him a little better.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>First things first though. Willem, how do you think the web is changing cultural heritage?</b></p>\n<p>\n\tWillem: The web is not changing cultural heritage. Both the concept of cultural heritage - and the objects we have labelled as such - have always meant different things to different people. If anything, the web is unchanging cultural heritage, as online digital (representations of) heritage objects from around the globe are becoming more easily accessible every day, to more and more people. The opportunities and challenges of the web have got us talking about what heritage means to us, and large-scale web projects like Wikipedia and Europeana show that the desire to share valued knowledge and art is capable of bringing people and ideas together. But the web is not only helping us to define what cultural heritage is, it also encourages us to share and improve the tools to keep our heritage safe for the future. In other words: the web has turned many things upside down, but maybe, in the case of cultural heritage, it is just helping us to finally keep it the right way up?</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>So what does Breandán think to that response? Was that what he anticipated when he set the question?</b></p>\n<p>\n\tBreandán: I agree with Willem about the transformative nature of the web enabling a long tradition of making cultural heritage available and meaningful. I might go even further, though: the culture that we create now is often born digital, an expression of a connective society threaded across distance and culture by tools enabling a new and transformative synthesis. My hope is that platforms like Europeana can shape this new ecosystem, spurring the creation of new cultural artefacts born from an appreciation and remixing of the past. Whatever the era, at our best we humans are storytellers, and as the tools change around us we retain a perennial desire to transform impression and information into narrative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/5d7b9af3-c640-41df-92c6-ad4015bafcf5\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<i>Willem Prins, competition winner</i></p>\n<p>\n\t<b>So, now a little more about our winner. Willem, you entered a competition to win a book about managing web projects, so, I guess you're a web project manager? </b></p>\n<p>\n\tWillem: Depending on who asks, my answer to the question 'What is your job?' varies from 'I build websites' via 'I am a historian and a bit of a computer nerd' to 'As an information designer, I develop web applications for education and research.' The two larger projects I am currently working on fit this last description beautifully. Together with another designer/developer, I am working on a smartboard interface for an organisation that provides musical education for primary school children. Even more exciting is my newest project, which started in December after many years of preparation and patiently getting things together. Together with a small Amsterdam-based museum, I'm working on a platform aimed at collecting information about objects related to a very early-twentieth-century Dutch expressionist architectural style. The plan involves adding crowdsourced - or even nichesourced, if you're into terms like that - information to existing (open) data available from digital repositories. The entire project is quite complex, with many different stakeholders, so I am certain that having a guide like Breandán's handy will prove useful to me as a project manager.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>Do you have any involvement with Europeana?</b></p>\n<p>\n\tWillem:My involvement with Europeana has so far been mostly indirect: I've had the pleasure of meeting several Europeana project officers at various professional meet-ups and seminars. Of course, I'll do everything in my power to ensure that the online platform that we're building now can become a Europeana provider. Luckily, I'll know who to ask for advice when the time comes. Although I am pretty sure that ideally, and I wonder what the book has to say about this, the time to ask for advice is now.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>Breandán's book is full of tips for project management, but do you have any of your own?</b></p>\n<p>\n\tWillem: Seeing that I only have a little bit of experience as a project manager, I'll just stick to something obvious: 'keep it real'. It's easy - and sometimes, I'll admit, very tempting - to get lost in the conceptual and the virtual. Not too long ago at a seminar I heard someone suggest that maybe we would need to get rid of the word 'archive', because it might not fit our needs in the digital age. It made me a little sad. It's probably a bold thing to say, but I would say that usually, if you feel that you have to re-invent something to solve a problem, ask yourself 1) whether the problem is really a problem and 2) whether you've been looking in the right places for the solution.</p>\n<p>\n\t<b>If Willem's web project excites you or you'd just like to get in touch with him, you can email him at </b><strong><a href=\"mailto:willem@somtijds.nl\">willem@somtijds.nl</a></strong></p>"

The Wellcome Library, CC-BY-NC</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DG Connect say that they will achieve this by 'supporting ICT research and innovation and by deploying our regulatory and policy tools in order to boost growth and to create jobs' and that 'we will get there by setting an example as a lean and effective modern public actor.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to that, DG Connect is making a call for evidence and for your help. They ask all stakeholders and interested parties to respond to a questionnaire. By doing so, you will help them to check the evidence on which they will base their priority actions in 2013 and beyond:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Do you share their view as to what they should do?</li>\r\n    <li>Do you have facts and figures beyond those that they have identified?</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>DG Connect's survey is in two parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>A short set of questions on the survey itself. This will take you a maximum of 10 minutes.</li>\r\n    <li>A set of questions about each of their priorities. You can comment on as many of the priorities as you want.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>One of the priority sections is of particular interest to those interested in Europeana and the digitisation and re-use of cultural heritage in general. The 'Media and Data' section includes links to questions on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Creativity: research on new creative experience tools</li>\r\n    <li>Creativity: promoting innovation</li>\r\n    <li>Creativity: online accessibility and digital preservation of Europe's cultural heritage</li>\r\n    <li>Creativity: Europeana platform</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Take the survey</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/help-us-improve-our-analysis-measurement\">the survey</a>, register or log in to the site and then start providing your answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can save your answers and go back to complete them at any stage before the consultation period closes on 15th March 2013 at 12:00.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>\n\t<i>Last week, we introduced you to Nick Poole, Europeana Network Chair. This week, it's the turn of Johan Oomen - read on to find out where we works, what he does and what he's picked as his favourite item to be found in Europeana.</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/6986f286-aec5-454e-9af6-b049825a5718\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<i>Johan Oomen, Europeana Network Officer</i></p>\n<p>\n\tFor over 13 years now, I’ve been working for the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/dossier/5145/rd\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, one of Europe’s largest audiovisual archives. Currently, I’m heading the Research and Development department, which seeks to explore the use of innovative technology in the areas of multimedia annotation, interoperability and access. Prior to my employment at Sound and Vision, I worked at the British Universities Film and Video Council and RTL Nederland. My background is in Information Science (BA) and Media Studies (MA). Since 2012, I’ve been a board member of CLICKNL, the network responsible for driving innovation in the Dutch Creative Industries. Three years ago, I joined the <a href=\"http://wiki.cs.vu.nl/web-media/Main_Page\">Web and Media Group</a> of the Department of Computer Science, at the VU University Amsterdam. Here, I work part-time as a researcher. As part of my PhD research, I examine how the impact of memory organisations changes as a result of digitisation and changing consumer behaviour. Specifically, I investigate how memory organisations can embrace open innovation as a means to strengthen and expand their position as centres for learning, research and creativity. The case studies are closely linked to my work at Sound and Vision.</p>\n<p>\n\tSound and Vision looks after 750,000 hours of content and is regarded as one of the most technically advanced audiovisual archives in the world. Our technical infrastructure is linked to that of the Dutch public broadcasters. Many thousands of hours of audiovisual content are ingested in our storage systems annually. Programme makers have direct access to this material and continuously re-use content in new productions. We are the lead partner in the national mass digitisation programme, <a href=\"http://imagesforthefuture.com/en/news/images-future-90-seconds\">Images for the Future</a>, that will be completed in 2014. A big challenge is to provide services that provide meaningful, fine-grained and contextualised, personalised and engaging access to this massive collection of digital content. This is one of the challenges the Research and Development department is dealing with.</p>\n<p>\n\tCentral to my work at Sound and Vision, VU University and CLICKNL is forging a connection between research and working practices. I feel very fortunate to be in a position that allows me to look at this challenge from different angles, and make strategic interventions hat drive this forward. For instance, we have agreed on strategic, long-term collaborations with computer science departments at three Dutch universities and we’re setting up a Lab environment to make it easy for researchers to execute evaluations. On an EU-level, I initiated the <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a> project some years ago. This project has a big impact in the way audiovisual archives can be accessed and studied online. We use state-of-the-art technology to create semantic links between items in these collections. EUscreen currently brings together 22 leading archives and provides access to tens of thousands of items in a unified way. This material is available through both the EUscreen platform (allowing for comparative exploration) and through Europeana.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t\_</p>\n<div about=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/files/23/23180.23172.WEEKNUMMER741-HRE00016E93.ogv\" class=\"oip_media\" style=\"text-align: center;\" xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\">\n\t<video align=\"center\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"288\" poster=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/images/67910/WEEKNUMMER741-HRE00016E93.png\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"512\">\n\t\t<source src=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/files/23/23180.23172.WEEKNUMMER741-HRE00016E93.ogv\" type=\"video/ogg;

For instance, widespread availability of SmartTVs and other networked multimedia devices offer an unprecedented opportunity for archive content to be repurposed. Also, the context in which this material is used changes. I feel that we will see a wave of innovations in the creative industries, digital humanities and tourism, all tapping into this resource.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI see Europeana as a main driver for innovation in our sector. The Network connects and supports GLAMs (Galleries, Librearies, Archives and Museums) in their quest to provide the best possible access to their collections, initiating joint plans to connect heterogeneous, dispersed collections. The Network also supports a broad discussion on the relation between GLAMs and commercial entities, social networks, the adaptation of ‘open’ licences and user involvement, just to name a few topics. A lot of work still needs doing in terms of raising awareness of Europeana within the audiovisual domain, engaging in advocacy regarding the adoption of open licences, and also forging links between online repositories of content and the creative industries. These are just some of the issues that need to be addressed urgently in order for audiovisual content to become better represented in Europeana and the wider cultural commons. This is what led me to stand as Europeana Network officer representing the audiovisual domain.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tOn a personal note, travelling and photography are two big passions. It is so rewarding to get inspired by other cultures. Also, I listen to indie music (contributing to a weekly <a href=\"http://www.haarlem105.nl/?pageid=10411&amp;langid=1\">radio show</a>), collect 7” <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/johanoomen/james-bond-vinyl/\">vinyl records</a> and go to the cinema as often as possible. I live in Amsterdam, and have two bikes.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tYou can reach me by email (joomen [at] <a href=\"http://beeldengeluid.nl\">beeldengeluid.nl</a>) and follow me on twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/johanoomen\">@johanoomen</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\_</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\_</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\_</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\_</p>\n\t</source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></source></p>"

        body: "<p><em>This guest post from Paul Keller, vice chair of Kennisland, introduces Europeana's new 'Rights Labelling Campaign'.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Europeana transitioned towards the new <em>Europeana Licensing Framework</em>. The most notable aspect of this transition was <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c_itemId=1284453&amp;_itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">the release of Europeana metadata under the CC0 waiver </a>in early September.\_ 2013 began with the Europeana portal containing 23,595,557 metadata records that are freely available for re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While making Europeana metadata available for re-use was the most visible change that came with the new licensing framework, it is not the only one. The new licensing framework also introduced rules for communicating the rights status of the digital objects to which the metadata in Europeana refers. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/the-data-exchange-agreement\">Europeana Data Exchange Agreement</a> requires that data providers communicate the rights status of their objects by providing a rights statement through the 'europeana:rights' field. Data providers can choose from <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">a predefined set of rights statements</a> that cover the entire rights spectrum from Public Domain works to copyrighted works for which the rights holder reserves all rights and everything, such as Creative Commons licences, in-between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obligation to provide these rights statements is relatively new (the 'europeana:rights' field was only made mandatory with Europeana Semantic Elements version 3.4 from 31.03.2011) and as a result, not all metadata records in Europeana carry rights information about the digital objects to which they refer . The chart above shows the changing levels of rights statements as a proportion of the published metadata, on a monthly basis over the course of 2012.\_ We, together with our data providers, have made good progress in reducing the amount of metadata records without rights statements. But at the end of 2012, 36% of all metadata records were still missing rights information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having good quality rights information about the objects that are available through Europeana is essential. We need to be able to communicate to our end-users if and how they can re-use the material that is being aggregated and published. Teachers need to know if they can use material they find via Europeana in the classroom or in readers. Publishers need this information if they wish to re-publish material they find via Europeana, and app developers and third-party services need rights information to ensure that services they build using the Europeana API do not infringe copyright. At the same time, good quality rights metadata improves the overall quality of the metadata and makes it a more valuable resource for all data providers and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To address this, Europeana is starting a rights labelling campaign. Over the next couple of months, we will work with our data providers to ensure that all objects that are available via Europeana carry a valid rights statement. Throughout 2012, <a href=\"http://www.kl.nl\">Kennisland</a> and Europeana analysed the collections in Europeana with regards to the presence and quality of rights statements (summarised in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/904448/99e76339-ef00-43f2-9f4f-1aefdf9b3ce3\">this report</a>, <a href=\"http://goo.gl/1H5DH\">full research data here</a>). Based on this analysis, we will approach data providers in two phases:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36.0pt;\">●\_\_\_\_ In the first phase we will approach data providers who have provided collections that can be improved relatively easily. This means collections that are lacking rights statements for all records or collections where we have reason to believe that they carry the wrong rights statement for all records (for example a Creative Commons licence when the collection should be labelled as Public Domain). We will be asking data providers to review their collections and if they agree with our analysis to add/change the rights information. Once this has been done, the collections will be re-ingested into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:36.0pt;\">●\_\_\_\_ In a second phase, we will approach data providers who have provided collections that we consider more difficult to improve. This refers to collection with different rights statements applying to different objects. We will provide data providers with as much information as possible with regards to which parts of the collections need updating and will be working with them in doing so. Once both parties have concluded that the rights statements are correct, these collections will be re-ingested into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We understand that this process will require efforts from all parties involved and we hope to make it as smooth as possible. We aim to finish the first phase before the summer (which means that all datasets in Europeana should carry rights statements by then) and conclude the second phase by the end of 2013. Meanwhile, the ingestion team is ensuring that all new collections that are ingested into Europeana carry rights statuses in line with the <em>Europeana Licensing Framework</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have questions, suggestions or feedback about the rights labelling campaign, please get in touch with us via <a href=\"mailto:licensing@europeana.eu\">licensing@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Finland’s National Digital Library Formula for Success'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>\r\n    <i>Today, David Smith, Europeana’s Business Developer for GLAM relations, tells us how his year finished with a productive get-together in Finland.</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Throughout 2012, we worked hard on building relationships and improving working practices with the organisations who provide Europeana’s content, in particular national content initiatives and aggregators.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    We ran a series of workshops, including one in Finland. On 20 November, three members of Europeana travelled to a cold but beautiful Helsinki for a day of presentations and lively discussion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The general theme of the workshop was how to streamline the process of making metadata available to the national aggregator and to Europeana - never a small task. We were joined by members of Finland’s <a href=\"http://www.nationallibrary.fi/\">National Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.minedu.fi/OPM/?lang=en\">Ministry of Education and Culture</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nba.fi/en/index\">National Board of Antiquities</a> as well as developers and private companies.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/26fe623a-3429-465a-a56b-7223a52d9d92\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <i>Workshop in progress</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    First of all, we learnt about the environment that Finnish cultural organisations find themselves in right now, and heard about the establishment of an aggregation service and its relationships to the Europeana Network. You can see the presentation from Minna Karvonen from the Ministry of Education and Culture <a href=\"http://bit.ly/URoo55\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Aki Lassila shared progress on Finland’s National Digital Library. It will consist of two technical elements: a public interface called ‘Finna’, and a service called ‘Formula’ which aggregates material to Europeana. With a potential collection of 20 million items from across the cultural sector in Finland, the aggregator will take on an increasingly important role when it goes live.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/9e3c9f12-8bca-4da9-b834-21b544e0d033\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <i>Helsinki, 1928, French National Library, public domain</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The Europeana team then took the opportunity to discuss our priorities for the Europeana Network, Business Plan and the aggregation landscape. In my role as Business Developer for GLAM relations, my own priorities are around use of the Europeana API, and the development of audiovisual material and masterpieces in Europeana. This triggered a lively debate on masterpieces with questions ranging from ‘What constitutes a masterpiece?’ through to fundamental arguments about the necessity of representing masterpieces in the Europeana dataset.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    After the morning’s discussions, we turned our attentions to practical workshops, the first of which was run by Europeana’s Francesca Morselli and looked at metadata ingestion. This raised some interesting perspectives from content owners on the new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> metadata standard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/8072d332-3247-4194-ab31-5fe9b2523e95\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n    <i>Helsingfors, le Quai, Zentralbibliothek Zürich and The European Library, public domain</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Another workshop looked at making the process of providing content to ‘Formula’ more efficient. Again, the issues and possibilities raised by EDM were talking points, as was how ‘Finna’ and ‘Formula’ could be promoted to Finland’s cultural heritage sector to ensure wide buy-in and ongoing development.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    The day finished with a series of action points for the future for both Europeana and the National Library. Then, armed with our ‘To do’ lists for 2013, we made our goodbyes, hopped onto the airport bus and headed home.</p>"

They stressed the importance of national aggregation for Bulgarian digital heritage and their willingness to support private companies and public institutions in this goal.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/c0b4c49d-8662-4991-be48-026b686f86da\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n\t<i>Prominent Bulgarian poet, translator and public figure <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/0943105/7AEF272752F7E6EE3643F85F704F32E8D6942017.html\">Dora Gabe </a>(1888-1983), Varna Public Library, Public Domain</i></p>\n<p>\n\tIn our presentations, Annette and I told the group all about Europeana’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602\">Strategic Plan </a>and its four strategic tracks: Aggregate, Distribute, Facilitate and Engage. Annette stressed the importance of a national aggregator for the national cultural heritage ecosystem and the benefits this structure could bring to local cultural heritage institutions. We also discussed the role of a national aggregator in helping local institutions to improve the quality and consistency of the metadata that is brought into Europeana.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther presentations included:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.ontotext.com/\">Ontotext</a> - work in semantic web technologies such as semantic databases, semantic search, web mining and linked data management.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<a href=\"http://www.geocad93.com/index_en.html\">GeoCad-93</a> – the potential of geo-scanning in the cultural heritage field.

        title: 'Nick Poole and the comet Europeana'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In the first of a series of posts introducing Europeana's Network Officers, Chair Nick Poole tells us what his day job is, why he got involved with Europeana and what makes him tick.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I am the Chief Executive Officer of the <a href=\"http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk\">Collections Trust</a>, a role I have held for the past 8 years. Before this, I was the Digital Policy Adviser to the national agency for Museums, Archives and Libraries, and before that I worked briefly in the corporate finance sector looking at risk in mergers and acquisitions. I hold degrees in languages, historical linguistics, fine art and illustration, and the history and philosophy of science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Collections Trust is an independent not-for-profit organisation based at the Natural History Museum in central London. We work with a network of around 23,000 museums, galleries, libraries, archives and heritage attractions worldwide to help open up their collections for use and enjoyment, both online and in the real world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My job as CEO is to set strategy, to provide leadership and direction and to be a champion, not so much of our work, but of Collections and their value to public life. Europe’s cultural heritage organisations are responsible for documenting, interpreting and providing access to some of mankind’s greatest achievements, alongside the wonders of the natural world. I find it incredibly fulfilling to work with the people who care for this material and help others to understand it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an internationalist, through and through. My favourite poem when I was a child was Robert Frost’s ‘The Tuft of Flowers’, which includes the line ‘men (and women!) work together, I told him from the heart. Whether they work together, or apart’, and I believe strongly in the idea that culture unites us across geographical, political and economic boundaries. I am excited to be part of an international professional community united by its commitment to improving people’s understanding of themselves and their responsibility to care for each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what first drew me to Europeana, as an expression of cultural unity across Europe, and what led me to stand as the Chair of the Europeana Network – a position I am proud to have held for nearly 4 years. Europeana, to me, is like a comet – what you see most is the huge achievement of bringing together so much of Europe’s heritage into a common platform. But equally important is the tremendous professional capital, the trail of knowledge, expertise and unity which follows on from the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This belief in collaboration and cooperation has also led me to take on my other roles, formerly as the Chair of the UK Committee of the International Council of Museums, and most recently as Treasurer of the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals here in the UK. I love to be able to make a difference, and to help support the incredibly passionate and committed people who work in this sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one stage in my past, I was trained as a negotiator. This training taught me to avoid polar opposites and instead to seek common ground between parties with apparently different interests. This view - that apparently conflicting needs can be reconciled around common values - is what has led me to set out my main ambition in my role as Chair of the Network to create a Cultural Commons for Europe which reconciles the public mission of our cultural institutions with their drive for greater independent financial viability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years, I have worked with both the publicly-funded and commercial sectors, and from this experience I know that there is a way of operating which plays to both their strengths. I think Europeana has a tremendous opportunity to be a catalyst to resolve decades-old differences of opinion – about copyright, business models and user needs – and I am really pleased that we have been able to make progress in these areas already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s not all work, work, work, though! I live in south west London with my wife and two children, and I love spending time with them – there’s nothing like seeing the world through the eyes of a child to help to understand it better! I am a keen kayaker, making regular expeditions around the UK’s inland waterways, coastline and islands. I am also the compere of a monthly Music and Poetry Festival called <a href=\"http://www.rhythmandmuse.org/\">Rhythm and Muse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a real culture-geek, and I always love to hear from people working in the industry. I can be contacted by email at <a href=\"mailto:nick@collectionstrust.org.uk\">nick@collectionstrust.org.uk</a>, twitter via <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nickpoole1\">@NickPoole1</a> or on LinkedIn – just search for my name!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Judaica Europeana: alive and kicking after end of EC grant'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Judaica Europeana began in 2010 as a targeted project, co-funded by the eContentPlus programme, to digitise content documenting the Jewish contribution to European heritage: books, documents, manuscripts, periodicals, audio recordings, pictures, photographs, videos, postcards and posters. The initial project ended in February 2012 but Judaica is still alive and kicking. Lena Stanley-Clamp, Coordinator of <a href=\"http://www.judaica-europeana.eu/\">Judaica Europeana</a>, tells us how…</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>After two years of hard work, we emerged from the project’s final review into Rome’s February sunshine buoyed by a sense of accomplishment. We exceeded our targets for digitising and uploading to Europeana diverse digital material on the history and culture of Jews in Europe. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:Judaica+Europeana\">uploaded metadata records</a> pointed in total to 3.7 million pages/items. We produced more than 30 deliverables, carried out a <a href=\"http://www.judaica-europeana.eu/docs/D2-4_Survey_of_controlled_vocabularies.pdf\">survey of controlled vocabularies</a> and implemented one vocabulary relevant to our domain. A pilot application of the <a href=\"http://semantic-mediawiki.org/\">Semantic Media Wiki</a> to a scholarly database on the Jewish Enlightenment was another achievement, albeit in need of further development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dissemination activities exceeded our expectations: 100 events in 25 cities staged by or featuring Judaica Europeana. Digital humanities workshops, virtual exhibitions and a crowd-sourcing inititative in Italy met with a remarkable response, and our illustrated <a href=\"http://www.judaica-europeana.eu/Newsletter.html\">newsletters</a> brought enthusiastic feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Jewish_Bakers1984.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 469px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>London Jewish Bakers Union banner, 1920s, Jewish Museum London </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it was not all plain sailing as we struggled with challenges posed by the diversity of content, metadata standards and working practices of our cross-domain partners – libraries, archives and museums. After much experimentation and consultation, two different platforms had to be used for the preparation of partners’ metadata. Our technical experts (David Klein at AIU, Marko Knepper at Frankfurt University and the NTUA team in Athens) developed a number of solutions for dealing with the diverse metadata systems and content. The large amounts of audio material brought more complications. A team spirit helped greatly in coping with those challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As aggregators of Jewish content, we had to reach out to potential associate partners with relevant digital collections. With no extra funding to distribute, it took some persuasion to explain the opportunities that Europeana represents in terms of higher exposure and new audiences, access to professional networks and cutting-edge expertise. The project began with 10 partner institutions; by the end of 2011, we were joined by 12 associate partners who were at various stages of digitisation or readiness to upload their collections. There was much more potential out there including in the US where some extraordinary collections on Jewish life in Europe are held. Clearly, there was a need for the work to continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_165-Poster_Gymnastics-Czestochowa.jpg\" style=\"width: 376px; height: 530px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Poster: Gymnastic competition of the Jewish Sport Organisation in Poland, Czestochowa, 12 August 1917, YIVO</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a meeting in Warsaw, the partners agreed a Memorandum of Understanding providing a framework for continuity and growth. The Judaica Europeana network will make use of the experience, skills and knowledge acquired by the team, and will sustain the friendships developed over the two years. The leading partners – the European Association for Jewish Culture and the Frankfurt University Library – committed part-time human resources to the project. The National Library of Israel strengthened our capacity by seconding a systems librarian to serve as our Technical Coordinator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Judaica%20team.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 268px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Judaica Europeana partners in front of the Dohány Street synagogue, Budapest, May 2011.

In its new phase (2012-15), the network will also serve as a conduit for the opportunities created by Europeana, the Semantic Web and the Linked Data environment. This is currently achieved through participation, by some of the partners, in new Europeana projects such as <a href=\"http://www.dm2e.eu/\">DM2E</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of the new phase, the network has gained 5 new member institutions with more interested in joining. Judaica Europeana sessions and presentations have been held at international conferences. Discussions are currently under way on publishing an encyclopaedia in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework\">RDF</a> that would provide a valuable contextual resource for Judaica content. Plans are in hand for a joint DM2E/Judaica Europeana digital humanities workshop at the British Library next June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, read Judaica Europeana's latest <a href=\"http://www.judaica-europeana.eu/Newsletter.html\">newsletter</a>.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Are you a technical entrepreneur? If so, you could win the title of ‘Europioneer’ in a new series of awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"European Commission Digital Agenda site\">European Commission</a> presents Europioneers, an initiative to celebrate Europe’s finest technology entrepreneurs. Supported by <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The Next Web website\">The Next Web</a>, this prestigious technology award will be handed out to Europe’s Tech Entrepreneur of the Year. The awards aim to give technology entrepreneurship in Europe visibility on a national, regional and global scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re not a tech-preneur, maybe you know someone who is. Why not nominate them for the award? You never know, they might take you along to the glitzy award ceremony on April 24th! You can nominate multiple times, but your votes will only count one time per voting medium (email, Twitter, Facebook).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two categories in which you can nominate someone: European Tech Entrepreneur of the Year and Young European Tech Entrepreneur of the Year (under 30). The definition of ‘Tech’ entrepreneur in this context is an entrepreneur who operates in web, mobile or other online fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get to the winner of The Europioneers award, there are three stages: a nomination round, a public voting round and at the end the jury will decide on the actual winner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europioneers.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Europioneer nominations\" src=\"/files/blogimages/europioneer.png\" style=\"width: 504px; height: 237px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone can submit nominees via the site and a hand-picked jury of tech illuminati will pick a short list. There will be a public voting round to select the five final nominees from that short list (based on most votes). The jury will select the winner of the Europioneers Award from those final five nominees. The awards will be presented by Vice President of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Neelie Kroes\" src=\"/files/blogimages/31e9cac4-0eef-447c-b218-2d28a7c5bd61.jpg\" style=\"width: 419px; height: 452px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have until 14th February to get your nominations in - just go to the <a data-mce-href=\"http://europioneers.com/\" href=\"http://europioneers.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europioneers\">Europioneers site</a> and enter the name of your nominee plus a link to their website/Twitter/LinkedIn page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow the awards on Twitter: <a data-mce-href=\"http://www.twitter.com/europioneers\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/europioneers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europioneers on Twitter\">@Europioneers</a></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>In this extended post, Marco Rufino, the project co-ordinator for <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion</a>, is interviewed about the aims and challenges of the project. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Marco Rufino\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Marco Rufino.jpg\" style=\"width: 316px; height: 494px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Marco Rufino, project co-ordinator for Europeana Fashion</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana Fashion Logo(2).png\" style=\"width: 148px; height: 212px;\" /></a> <a href=\"http://www.rinascimento-digitale.it/news-eng-europeanafashion.phtml\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Logo_FRD.jpg\" style=\"width: 199px; height: 122px;\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a degree in Historical Studies and a background in the field of education, multimedia and cultural heritage, Marco Rufino has extensive experience in cultural heritage's digitisation and access issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How did you get involved with Europeana Fashion?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Florence, where Fondazione Rinascimento Digitale is based, has a great tradition in fashion. We can say that <i>haute couture</i> in Italy was born here in 1951, when Giovanni Battista Giorgini organised the first fashion show in Palazzo Pitti in front of an international audience, making Italian fashion famous in the world. Pucci, Ferragamo, Gucci, Coveri and Cavalli started their fashion houses in Florence. Today, the fashion industry is still a big asset in the economic and cultural life of the city. So when Alessandra Arezzi and Marco Rendina came to me two years ago with the idea of gathering the major fashion archives and museums in Europe to build a fashion portal connected with Europeana, I immediately embraced the idea! And from 1 March 2012, this idea became a reality with the kick-off of the Europeana Fashion project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/marc_by_marc_jacobs_ss11_007.jpg\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 900px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Marc by Marc Jacobs, Spring-Summer 2011. From the collection of Europeana Fashion partner <a href=\"http://www.catwalkpictures.com/index,en.html\">CatwalkPictures</a>. © CatwalkPictures/Etienne Tordoir</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the goals of Europeana Fashion?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Fashion is a best practice network, encompassing 22 partners (3 technical partners and 19 content providers) from 12 European countries, representing the leading public and private museums, archives and libraries in the fashion domain. The ambition of this consortium is to build a thematic fashion aggregator, reflecting the versatility of fashion as a medium while putting a strong emphasis on the quality and granularity of data. The project will also build a dedicated portal, as a specialised front-end for further development of specific functions and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our main goal by March 2015 is to publish online through Europeana over 700,000 fashion-related digital objects, ranging from historical dresses to accessories, photographs, posters, drawings, sketches, videos, and fashion catalogues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also contributing to the development of interoperability in the fashion domain by creating and promoting a common metadata schema for fashion content, based on the Europeana Data Model. To achieve interoperability on a semantic level, we are developing a multilingual Fashion Thesaurus, based on the widely adopted AAT thesaurus from the Getty Institute, enriched with fashion-related specific terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the biggest challenges for Europeana Fashion and how are you tackling them?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing a consortium of 22 partners from 12 different countries is a challenge: every partner has different technical skills and different experience levels in participating in European projects. Different languages and cultural differences don't help, but this challenge is probably the easiest to win, and in the first months of the project we have already created a very united and enthusiastic group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real challenges are probably about the interoperability and harmonisation of the aggregated content, coming from the different institutions in our consortium. Every content provider in the project is using its own metadata schema locally and its own classification system, describing content in its own local language. Without taking any action, the content aggregation process would result in a 'babel' of mixed data in different languages, different data structures with different description granularity and quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europeana Fashion, we decided to address this big issue by taking several actions: from the metadata structure point of view, we developed an application profile of the Europeana Data Model specialised for fashion content (EDM-fp), and we gave content providers a visual mapping tool to map their local metadata schemas to the common defined EDM-fp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a semantic point of view, we defined a common multilingual fashion thesaurus that will be used to semantically enrich and classify all the aggregated content. This means users will have a multilingual access point to all the fashion content we're providing, despite the local classification scheme and the local language of the original source. We're confident that this approach will allow us to provide Europeana and the public with a rich and homogeneous fashion data set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/The-Collection-of03.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 640px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Jacket in chintz, India, 1750-1800, and skirt in wool damask, Europe, 1750-1800. From the collection of Europeana Fashion partner <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\">ModeMuseum</a> Provincie Antwerpen © Hugo Maertens, Bruges</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is your long-term vision for Europeana Fashion?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, an increasingly large audience has developed a growing interest in fashion content for research, learning and leisure. The internet has become the principal source of information for the fashion world and industry through a wide range of websites, portals, blogs, social networks, etc. The virtual dimension has become fundamental territory for the creation, diffusion, consumption and study of fashion. However, there is an evident lack of structured, easily searchable and reliable content about fashion. At present, searching these materials online is difficult and it is likely to become even more complicated as digital content on fashion continues to grow in a scattered way. Our Europeana Fashion thematic portal represents an ideal answer to these issues, and not only at a European scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the institutions involved in our project (both public and private) agree and are in fact highly interested in keeping this initiative up and running, not only from a financial point of view but also from a content enrichment point of view. And since fashion is a popular theme online that potentially could attract a broad audience to the Europeana portal too, it was also natural that we started to explore possible ways for a long-term collaboration with the Europeana Foundation, keeping the Europeana Fashion initiative alive beyond the funding period. I hope to have the chance to tell you more about these developments in the forthcoming months, here on the Europeana Professional blog.</p>"

        title: 'Breandán’s got a book out – win a copy!'

        intro: null
        body: "<p>It’s January, and the time many of us resolve to work more, play more or relax more than ever before and generally be better, nicer, healthier people. That can seem like a big task, a huge one in fact. So much so that it’s easy to fall at the first hurdle, overwhelmed by the scale of what you have undertaken to achieve. This is not unlike the sinking sensation you might have at the start of a new piece of work or project. If you recognise that feeling, then a new book from Europeana’s Programme Manager, Breandán Knowlton, might be just what you need to get revitalised and focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Breandan Knowlton\" src=\"/files/blogimages/bfk_avatar_lg.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 336px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Breandán Knowlton, Europeana Programme Manager and author of 'A practical guide to managing web projects'</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>A practical guide to managing web projects</i> is for people who make or commission websites, as well as those who are hoping to start or grow a web design agency or department, or are working on a project with a significant web component. The book demonstrates good project management skills in just five simple steps, which means you don't have to crumble under that great weight of ambition. Follow Breandán's advice and before you know it, you and your team will have made something you can all be proud of, on deadline and on budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Managing Web Products\" src=\"/files/blogimages/mwpcover_lg.jpg\" style=\"width: 253px; height: 388px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Breandán tells us in the introduction to the book, 'Many people think of project management as an annoying overhead cost. And while time spent managing is not time spent designing, coding or deploying websites, it is not time wasted either. Good project management is all about making sure that you and your team have a better time doing something that you love.' His analogy to sport makes perfect sense: 'If you are a football player, your coach is not an annoying overhead to the discipline of playing football. The coach helps you train, strategise and execute winning plays. Itʼs the same with a good project manager.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm delighted to say we have two copies of <i>A practical guide to managing web projects</i> to give away. To win one, all you have to do is email <a href=\"mailto:beth.daley@bl.uk\"> beth.daley@bl.uk</a>, telling us in less than 200 words how you think the web is changing cultural heritage. We'll pick our top two answers and if yours is one of them, we'll send you a copy of the book. We'll also publish the best entries in a future blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closing date for entries: <b>18th January 2013</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about Breandán's book, go to <a href=\"http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/a-practical-guide-to-managing-web-projects\"> Five Simple Steps.</a></p>"

        title: 'Europeana - Wiki GLAM Toolset: your opinion needed'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Following on from yesterday’s post about using Europeana to enhance Catalan Wikipedia articles, Geer Oskam gives us more information about how Europeana is working with Wikimedia to create a ‘Wiki GLAM Toolset’.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name of this project is probably the most difficult part of the scheme to understand; what is important is that the end result is a new service that will make your life much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana - Wiki GLAM (Gallery/Library/Archive/Museum) Toolset is a collaboration between Europeana, <a href=\"http://nl.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hoofdpagina\">Wikimedia Nederland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.fr/\">Wikimedia France</a>, <a href=\"http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia United Kingdom</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en\">Kennisland</a>. In this project, a software tool is to be developed that will make it as easy as possible for you to put your digitised cultural objects into the <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikipedia database</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last few years, you have been digitising your collections; by doing so, the reach of cultural content has grown enormously. Think of new audiences who are being reached on <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/how-28-moustaches-resulted-in-over-300-likes-300-shares-and-120-tweets?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dv\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2012/03/pinterest-for-glams-europeanas-experiment/\">Pinterest </a>or via new mobile <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/case-studies\">applications</a>. The Wiki GLAM Toolset is just going to add to this, tapping into the world of Wikipedia visitors. And may I remind you that Wikipedia has almost 500 million unique visitors per month!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Night Watch\" src=\"/files/blogimages/nachtwacht.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 407px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Here, Rembrandt's 'De Nachtwacht', a public domain image available on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/BBB671E55C02F3480278B3E4B3558CFBD3DC86DB.html\">Europeana</a> (inset bottom) from the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-C-5\">Rijksmuseum</a>, has been used to illustrate a <a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Nachtwacht\">Dutch Wikipedia article </a>on the image (inset top). </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Wikipedia has become a mainstream source of information, more pages are being created, and more topics are being covered. Via the Wiki GLAM Toolset, you will be able to upload your data files to Wikimedia Commons in large or small quantities. After uploading it, your content can be used to illustrate existing pages, or it can become a primary source for new Wikipedia pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>We need your opinion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we get this far though, we need your input: we would like to know what you would like to get out of a statistics report after your data has been uploaded to Wikimedia. Please lend us 10 minutes of your time and take a look at this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGNMQ2hMMXFBQ0RIYnJtcmhRQm5oN3c6MQ#gid=0\">GLAM Content on Wikimedia survey</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana – Wiki GLAM Toolset is developed in Wikipedia’s signature open style, you can take a look at the project page <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMToolset_project\">here</a>.<br>\r\nYou might also be interested in our other blogs about Wikipedia for GLAMs, like Àlex Hinojo’s work as a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1466485\">Wikipedia editor</a>, or how Europeana attended an <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/wikipedia-ww1-articles-enhanced-with-europeana-content?_33_redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fweb%2Fguest%2Fblog%3Fp_p_id%3D115%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id\">Editathon in Stockholm</a>.</p>"

        title: 'How Europeana helps Wikipedia editor and GLAM ambassador'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today, Àlex Hinojo, GLAM projects director at Amical Viquipèdia, tells us how Europeana is used to enhance Catalan Wikipedia articles.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a <a href=\"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM\">GLAM Ambassador </a>(galleries, libraries, archives and museums) in Barcelona, I work to facilitate and improve the relationships between the Catalan GLAM sector and the local free knowledge community. Once heritage is digitised, catalogued, wikified and put online, it must come back to the people, so I'm looking for new ways to engage people with cultural heritage and share cultural commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since I discovered Europeana, I use it more and more every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/800px-Wiki_Takes_Barcelona_-_deu_anar_b%C3%A9.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 378px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Local Wikipedians during an outreach activity in Barcelona, Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA 3.0</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>As a Wikipedia editor</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia editors are always looking for references. Wikipedia does not publish original thought: all material in Wikipedia must be attributable to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\">reliable, published source </a> so, when improving an article, we need to ensure all the facts that we write are correct. Europeana is really useful for us for several reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>It has a huge amount of specific heritage indexed content.</li>\r\n    <li>The interface is available in several languages so we can check out a foreign collection data set without problems.</li>\r\n    <li>The ‘Cite on Wikipedia’ button including the wiki-markup text is extremely helpful for referencing content quickly and easily.</li>\r\n    <li>The ‘Similar content’ feature lets us discover new items that can help us to hone our articles.</li>\r\n    <li>We can check the copyright status of an item in a collection.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>It is very important for us that metadata is well documented. When it describes the object in a formal and structured way, it is easy for us to find and re-use it. As a proposal for improvement, I would include some kind of ‘registry fix’ system where Europeana’s visitors can propose fixing typos or little mistakes on data sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/800px-Backstage_Pass_at_the_Museu_Nacional_dArt_de_Catalunya.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 377px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>A Wikipedian co-working with a restorer during a Backstage Pass at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA 3.0</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>As a GLAM Ambassador</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working on projects with more than 25 GLAM institutions, like the <a href=\"http://theglamwikiexperience.blogspot.com/2012/04/qrpedia-use-at-fundacio-miro-case-study.html\">Fundació Joan Miró</a>, Museu Picasso (where we co-organised <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUDyimhkxdg\">Hack4Europe </a>in 2011). Some of them are already cooperating with Europeana, like the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_dataProvider%3A%22Centre+de+Documentaci%C3%B3+Museu+de+les+Arts+Esc%C3%A8niques+Institut+del+Teatre+de+Barcelona%2C+ITB%2C+Barelona%2C+Spain%22\">Performing Arts Museum</a> in Barcelona. In our experience, Wikipedia and Europeana are both giving GLAMs the excuse to open up their collections. They are like a little seed planted inside the GLAM that is growing slowly but constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we talk to an institution that is already working with Europeana, things are easier: they are aware of the reasons for opening up content, they understand that aggregating collections has a powerful impact on reach and they even know most of the technical terms we use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, we are focusing our efforts on GLAM-educational projects and a project in cooperation with the <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/08/30/whole-network-public-libraries-begins-wikipedia-collaboration-catalonia/\">Catalan Public Libraries Network</a>. Librarians are learning not only how to contribute to Wikipedia, but also how to use it as a tool for engaging their users and to reassess their collections and local funds. In education, we are working with a research department of the University of Barcelona, where more than 100 students are improving <a href=\"http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viquiprojecte:Viquimodernisme\"><i>Modernisme</i>-related articles</a> in the Catalan Wikipedia, using Europeana, among others, as a great documentation source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Follow Àlex on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kippelboy\">@kippelboy</a></i></p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Just before the Christmas break, the European Commission published 7 new priorities for the digital economy and society in 2013-2014. The EC's press release states, 'The digital economy is growing at seven times the rate of the rest of the economy, but this potential is currently held back by a patchy pan-European policy framework. Today's priorities follow a comprehensive policy review and place new emphasis on the most transformative elements of the original 2010 Digital Agenda for Europe.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased to say that Europeana is explicitly named in the second priority, 'New public digital service infrastructures through Connecting Europe Facility', which is explained as follows: 'With Council support, the Commission will fast-track the roll out of digital services (especially their cross border interoperability) in eIDs and eSignatures, business mobility, eJustice, electronic health records and cultural platforms such as Europeana.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said: '2013 will be the busiest year yet for the Digital Agenda. My top priorities are to increase broadband investment and to maximise the digital sector's contribution to Europe's recovery.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Neelie Kroes\" src=\"/files/blogimages/NeelieKroeswithIPad2.jpg\" style=\"width: 380px; height: 570px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Commissioner Kroes browsing Europeana on an iPad at the Ministers' Briefing for Europeana Awareness, in Brussels, May 2012</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 7 new priorities for the Digital Agenda are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new and stable broadband regulatory environment</li>\r\n    <li>New public digital service infrastructures through Connecting Europe Facility</li>\r\n    <li>Launch Grand Coalition on Digital Skills and Jobs</li>\r\n    <li>Propose EU cyber-security strategy and Directive</li>\r\n    <li>Update EU's Copyright Framework</li>\r\n    <li>Accelerate cloud computing through public sector buying power</li>\r\n    <li>Launch new electronics industrial strategy</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>In in a post titled 'I'm a fighter, not a bureaucrat' on her blog, Neelie Kroes talks candidly about the challenges facing the digital economy. She advocates action and movement, saying, 'Yesterday doesn’t count in the digital world – complacency is a killer. And Europe doesn’t have time.' She goes on to say, 'There is too much risk-avoiding in Brussels and in national capitals. That has to stop or Europe has no future. I refuse to just tick off the list of actions we created [for the Digital Agenda] in 2010. I don’t want that, that is lazy. Europe cannot afford laziness. That is why I am here today with new priorities.' She concludes decisively that 'the time for thinking and complaining is over. 2013 is all about doing.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that's not the right spirit to start the new year, I don't know what is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More info</strong>: Read the EU's <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-1389_en.htm?locale=en\"> press release</a> and Neelie Kroes' <a href=\"http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/neelie-kroes/im-a-fighter-not-a-bureaucrat-new-digital-priorities-in-2013-14/\">related blog.</a></p>"

        title: 'ECLAP''s three-step guide to clearing rights'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Performing arts organisations met in Slovenia last month to discuss best practice guidelines for rights clearance. This blog is based on an article by Lotte Belice Baltussen that first appeared on ECLAP's website.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECLAP is an online archive for all performing arts in Europe, funded by the European Commission. ECLAP contributes to Europeana with its collected performing arts records, videos, photographs, manuscripts and sketches. It also provides innovative and unique solutions and tools to help performing arts institutions manage and make their collections accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eclap1.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 334px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Title: Scene from the performance Sirene (No. 4). Creator: Miha Fras From collection: MUZEUM. License: CC BY-NC-ND.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major challenge that is facing performing arts organisations that want to provide online access to their holdings is that they are often unsure how to determine the rights status of these collections, and how to clear rights. ECLAP is setting up Best Practice guidelines in order to aid organisations in this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 14 November, the ECLAP event 'Stage heritage at your fingertips' took place at the National Theatre Museum of Slovenia in Ljubljana. One of the objectives of the event was for the ECLAP Working Groups to get input from workshop attendees about the Best Practice guidelines established. The focus of 'WG-B on IPR and Business Models for Performing Arts Content' was the recently developed three-step guide to clearing rights. Each step suggests a question that should be asked to help organisations to determine the appropriate way to clear rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Step 1 - What kind of access does my institution want to provide?</li>\r\n    <li>Step 2 - Who (and where) are the rights holders?</li>\r\n    <li>Step 3 - Which methods can I use to clear the rights?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/4a5108a6-12a9-4096-836b-cdca74df7bc7\">presentation from ECLAP </a>explains more about the three-step guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each attendee was asked how they are currently providing access to their collections, how they approach rights holders to clear rights, and which types of agreements and licences they make. Licences ranged from restricted access for educational use, to public access and use of the most restrictive of the Creative Commons licences which allows downloading and sharing, but does not permit making new works of the content, or commercial use - CC BY-NC-ND.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eclap2.png\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 500px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Title: Yes nurse, no nurse (Ja zuster, nee zuster). Ep. 15; Cast From collection: Sound and Vision. License: CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>General conclusions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop's conclusions are represented below in brief – please see the <a href=\"http://www.eclap.eu/drupal/?q=en-US/node/113343\">full story</a> for more discussion on each area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Grey area</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‘grey area’ was mentioned a lot by the workshop attendees. Many organisations often make choices to provide access to content, even if they are unsure whether all rights have been cleared.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Open up, increase impact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was clear that many organisations see the benefit of using open licences, since they facilitate easy re-use across different platforms. However, truly ‘open’ access would also allow people to, for instance, make new works based on the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Keep the Public Domain healthy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is problematic that some content providers do not mark public domain material content as such, because they do not want to lose control of the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be as generic as possible</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All agreed that when making new agreements with rights holders, it is vital to make them as generic as possible. Keep in mind that generic does not mean that you should not explicitly describe what types of re-use you will allow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>IPR is a personal matter</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A final note was that clearing rights is more often than not a very personal experience. Rights holders are often approached individually by the organisations to sign agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the full story and look out for updates on <a href=\"http://www.eclap.eu/drupal/?q=en-US/node/113343\">ECLAP's blog.</a></p>"

        title: 'Metadata = better data'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Here at Europeana, we use the word 'metadata' a lot. But why is it quite so important to us? Well, because it's vital to our end-users. Europeana's Technical &amp; Operations Director, Jan Molendijk, tells us why he's pushing hard for improvements to metadata quality in 2013.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right from the start, Europeana has always been concerned with the quality of the metadata we collect, index and publish. The metadata for an object in Europeana is the equivalent of the catalogue record of traditional library, archive and museum systems. It describes the object in a formal and structured way and provides links to the object and its presence on the website of the data provider. The metadata is the only thing we have to create a searchable index – Europeana does not itself have access to the described objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Jan.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 265px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Here's an example of an item with good metadata - a public domain painting called 'Tobit en Anna met het bokje' by Rembrandt from the Rijksmuseum. Have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/153963007835274F7029C95AC21A64EA8D215BB3.html\">full record</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The data that comes into Europeana has often been created over a long period, sometimes centuries, in a succession of systems that were not designed for remote, multi-lingual, cross-domain searching. That is why we have, from the start, imposed some quality <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements\">criteria and guidelines </a>for the metadata sent to Europeana. These have evolved over time, which is one of the reasons why some fields that are now mandatory for new datasets still contain no information. By and large, these guidelines have resulted in ‘reasonably usable’ data, but there is still room for improvement. Over the coming months we will be focusing on several aspects of metadata quality. These are detailed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rights information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata in Europeana is of course now available under a CC0 waiver, which means that it can be re-used for any purpose. For the digital object itself, the situation varies. Some of the objects are in the public domain and therefore free, while others are free to access, but not to re-use, for example. To help the users of Europeana to ‘do the right thing’, we have added an 'edm:rights' field (called 'europeana:rights' in the old ESE system). This field contains a URL pointing to a page that describes what can be done with the objects. These can be public domain, any of the Creative Commons licences, or one of three specific Europeana rights pages – free access, restricted access and paid access. This field was introduced in 2010 and has been mandatory ever since. That still leaves about 35% of objects in Europeana that do not have a value for this field, leaving the user in the frustrating position that they would still have to contact the data provider to know if and how they can re-use the digital object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other issue is that there are some collections for which we now think that an error may have been made in assigning rights values to the objects, for example, collections of very old material that are not available under Public Domain when we think they should be, or collections where the content (as opposed to the metadata) is listed as being available under CC0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to summarise, we want rights statements on every item and we want the correct rights statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thumbnails</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The thumbnail images, or 'previews', for Europeana objects are shown both on the search results pages and on the object pages. To guarantee a consistent quality of thumbnails, we ask the data providers to supply us with a link to a reasonably high resolution version of the object. We then harvest that image, and create a thumbnail out of it. The image itself is not published by Europeana, just the thumbnail. We know from both user studies and usage analytics data that objects with a thumbnail are 8 times(!) more likely to be clicked on than objects that have no thumbnail. Clearly the existence of thumbnails makes for a more attractive user experience. So we will be going back to providers who have not yet supplied thumbnails and encouraging them to do so. We will also be looking into improving our image harvesting tools, enabling them to handle more of the cases in which the thumbnail generation process currently fails. And we will again explain that the thumbnail itself is not released under CC0 but is covered by the same rights statement as the digital object itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Link quality and persistent identifiers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On any given day, about 3% of the links in Europeana are unreachable. A server at the data provider may be temporarily down for maintenance, or it may have been moved before we have received an update from the data provider. We have started to monitor this more closely, checking a number of objects from each collection every day and contacting owners of collections that are offline for more than a few days. We encourage data providers to put temporary redirections in place when they move their servers so that the old links continue to work, while together we update the links in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of this would not be necessary if all data providers implemented 'Persistent Identifiers'. When they do, they commit to keeping their links resolvable by updating a central registry with each change they make. However, we understand that introducing Persistent Identifiers means a considerable commitment, both technically and organisationally. We encourage their use, but cannot (yet) make it mandatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Depth of description</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Metadata is the only thing we have to make an object discoverable. But we still have quite a few objects in Europeana that have no free-format description at all (a huge 8.1 million objects), or have no title (nearly 1 million objects). As the primary means of searching in Europeana is a free text search, it is very unlikely that these objects will show up in any searches. There may be very good reasons not to supply Europeana with a description: some descriptions are considered to be under copyright and all metadata delivered to Europeana is effectively licensed under CC0. Some objects may simply not have a description or a title in the collection management system of the data provider. Together with the data providers, we will be looking into what can be done in these cases. Maybe sending an excerpt of the description would be a good first step forward?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the coming months we will be addressing these issues and more, starting with the rights information. We will be contacting the providers whose collections lack rights information, or where we think the accuracy of the rights information could be enhanced. If this results in updated datasets, we hope to convince these providers to also address some of the other data quality issues. And of course any data provider that feels inspired to improve their presence in Europeana is welcome to do so. Over the coming months we will also be blogging more here on Europeana Professional, giving you more detailed information on each of these quality issues and possible ways to address them. Watch this space!</p>"

        title: 'Why we’ll be sharing more images on Facebook in 2013'

        intro: null
        body: "<p>If there’s one thing we’ve learnt from Facebook in 2012, it's that sharing images significantly increases engagement, impressions and the overall reach of your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>“History is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many copies.” - Alexis de Tocqueville (1805 – 1859)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=who%3A+Alexis+de+Tocqueville\">Alexis de Tocqueville</a>, the French political thinker and historian best known for the classic French text <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/04202/86F3A54A99E92B7C2669F7FFBE2B8A9AC00289ED.html\"><i>Democracy in America</i> </a>might have been around over 100 years ago, but his quote can not be more relevant in today’s digital world which is driven by self-expression online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Sarah-Europeana-Facebook.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 250px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>This image remix of three different public domain images from the French National Library achieved 99 likes and 114 unique shares on Facebook.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re not new to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\">Facebook at Europeana</a>. In fact, we’ve been using it since 2008. However, until recently we were only sharing text and link-based content. For example, a link to a blog post with short description that, when clicked, takes the users to more information on the blog, accompanied by images. This is perfectly fine, however by tweaking this process a little, we’ve noticed engagement indicators increase significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Monet-Facebook-Europeana.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 250px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>We regularly engage our followers with a collection of nice public domain images from Europeana and ask them to vote for their favourite. The image with the most votes is used as the new cover image (the big image at the top of a page) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\">on our profile</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, we have begun to shift content out of the blog, exhibitions and portal to create an immersive experience on Facebook. By creating galleries on Facebook, we’re able to engage users directly on the platform through liking, commenting and sharing – key indicators of measurable engagement. Sharing content this way may in turn decrease referral traffic, but engagement metrics are now skyrocketing on Facebook. This begs the question, is it really important where we engage users, as long as we are?</p>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js\"> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0At1Rk6Y4HaPodEZUbHo3R2VzUExEUlFtRjFuWTRiWVE&transpose=0&headers=0&range=A7%3AB8&gid=0&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":16},\"vAxes\":[{\"title\":null,\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"logScale\":false,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"logScale\":false,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null}],\"title\":\"Average Number of Engaged Users\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"domainAxis\":{\"direction\":-1},\"legend\":\"none\",\"hAxis\":{\"title\":\"Type of Facebook post\",\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":null,\"viewWindow\":null,\"maxValue\":null},\"isStacked\":false,\"tooltip\":{},\"width\":600,\"height\":371},\"state\":{},\"view\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart 1\"} </script>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve learnt that providing a high quality image with a description and link offers more context and therefore attracts twice as many end-users when compared with sharing only text/link-based content. It has also been important to identify the ideal time to engage users on our page to ensure that the engagement levels remain high. From our experience, posts published between 11:00 and 12:30 generate the highest number of likes, comments and shares.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between January and November 2012, we published 228 posts on Facebook with 170 of those being text/link-based posts and 49 image-based. A text/link-based post on average receives 154 engagement indicators (the number of unique users who clicked anywhere on the posts), while an image-based one racks up an average of 305.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So by simply increasing the number of images we share in 2013, we’ll be significantly increasing the number of end-users we engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are your experiences with Facebook pages? Leave us a comment below. We also want to hear from you if you are interested in joining us in curating collections on Facebook and other social media platforms in 2013.</p>"

        title: 'New Virtual Exhibition - Leaving Europe: A new life in America'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Today, a brand-new exhibition goes live on Europeana. <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\"> <i>Leaving Europe: A new life in America</i></a> tells the story of European emigration to the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055659618.html\"><img alt=\"Migration boat\" src=\"/files/blogimages/migration%20boat.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 364px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s the result of an exciting collaboration with the <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America</a> and uses more than 100 photographs, manuscripts, newspapers, paintings, letters, audio and government documents to chart peoples’ journeys across the European continent and their settlement in the United States. The exhibits are from U.S. and European libraries, museums and archives and the accompanying narrative has been commissioned specially for the exhibition from U.S. and European experts. Many of these images have rarely been made available before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘By combining forces to show how Europeans began new lives in the New World, Europeana and the DPLA have demonstrated a principle that goes far beyond the immediate subject of their exhibition: to build a successful digital future, we must collaborate on an international scale,’ said Robert Darnton, DPLA Steering Committee member and Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and Director of the Harvard University Library. ‘The exhibition inaugurates an alliance that will multiply the benefits of the Internet for generation after generation, everywhere in the world.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Migration children\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Migration%20kids.jpg\" style=\"width: 321px; height: 427px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPLA and Europeana—guided by a common mission to make the riches of libraries, museums and archives openly available to everyone in the world—collaborated regularly with curators, content partners, project staff and others to design and build the exhibition cooperatively. <i>Leaving Europe: A new life in America </i>represents the starting point of a significant long-term relationship between the two digital libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I am delighted at this first joint initiative between the DPLA and Europeana, one on an eminently trans-Atlantic subject,’ said Bruno Racine, Chair of the Europeana Executive Committee. ‘We share common goals—the free circulation of ideas and knowledge, dedication to the public good—and we believe that the digital revolution opens up unprecedented possibilities for exchanges like this one. I am very proud that Europeana can in this way express its support for the DPLA and for the values it defends.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 30 million Europeans, from as far north as Scandinavia and as far south as Sicily, set sail to America in the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century. The virtual exhibition, organised across seven major themes, describes the very human experiences and the historical context that different groups of hopeful immigrants from across Europe faced. The exhibition allows the virtual visitor to accompany them on their journey from their native country and region, across the Atlantic and into the ports, cities, and local communities of the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/migration-3.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 220px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of a life story from the exhibition is demonstrated by the man on the left of this photograph, Peder (Peter) Martinson Eyes, who was born on 25 January 1886 in Island Hjellan, Norway. On 18 April 1906, aged 20, he emigrated from Kristiansund via Liverpool on the 'RMS Baltic', arriving at Ellis Island on 5 May. He then moved to North Manitou, Michigan, in the Upper Midwest of the USA. In 1910, almost 80 percent of the one million or more Norwegian Americans—the immigrants and their children—lived in that part of the United States. Peter married Eleanor Anderson Nerland (from Kristiansund) on 30 May 1921 in Traverse City, Michigan. They had three children. He died in Traverse City on 27 May 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s contributing partners to the exhibition include the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the National Gallery of Ireland, the Jewish Museum of London, the Royal Library of the Netherlands, the Saxon State Library, and the Norwegian Photo Archives. The DPLA’s contributors include the New York Public Library, Harvard University, The (U.S.) National Archives and Records Administration, and the University of Minnesota Immigration History Research Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Explore <i>Leaving Europe: A new life in America</i> in <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\"> English</a> or <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-fr\">French</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/dpla%20logo.png\" style=\"width: 483px; height: 56px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Images</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/7DA05E546477FC8BCA63F0BE744E226AE2F91582.html\">Emigrants, une arrivée [le pont d'un navire arrivant à Ellis Island remplis d'émigrants]</a> Bibliothèque nationale de France, public domain<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/DA0CF42F379E7F482C8CAA0C22AA27D0A601EB52.html\">Emigrants [sur Ellis Island], deux gosses d'Italie</a>, Bibliothèque nationale de France, public domain<br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09414a/4A5204E81E5C5F25037CBBFC7DCDA40081869FBF.html\">Peder (Peter) Martinson Øyen</a>, FylkesFOTOarkivet i Møre og Romsdal, Norway, free access</p>\r\n"

        title: 'MEPs discuss Europeana’s financial future'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 29 November, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and participants from Member States met over breakfast at the European Parliament to discuss the financial future of Europeana. The overall EU budget for 2014-2020 is under pressure and so are the funds allocated for structural funding of Europeana and its ecosystem.<br><br>\r\nMEP Monika Hohlmeier welcomed the nearly 30 participants. During the meeting, my role was to demonstrate the achievements and opportunities of Europeana, and Joe Harrod, Head of Editorial and Social Media of Promethean Planet, showed how Europeana is used in education.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We reminded our audience that the European Council stated in 2008 that ‘Digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material are essential to highlight cultural and scientific heritage, to inspire the creation of new content and to encourage new online services to emerge. They help to democratise access to culture and knowledge and to develop the information society and the knowledge-based economy.’<br><br>\r\nAfter four years of innovative work, Europeana now gives access to a European treasure of 23 million books, pictures, films, maps, archival records, museum objects and sound recordings from over 2,200 participating institutions across Europe. In early October, Europeana released its unique cultural heritage dataset as open data. Since then, Europeana has received 40 requests per month to re-use this data to develop innovative digital applications and 20 API implementations have been realised. The Europeana data model is now being used by the US, Korea and South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Jill%20Cousins%20at%2029%20Nov%2012%20Brussels%20meeting.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 451px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We explained how the release of open data helped to shape Europeana’s Strategic Plan 2011-2015. The Plan was developed in close collaboration with its key stakeholders, by looking at the value that they derived – or wanted to derive - from Europeana. This resulted in four tracks around which Europeana’s activity turns and on which all the resources are focused: aggregate – facilitate – distribute – engage.<br><br>\r\nHere are some of the examples we used to illustrate the ways Europeana’s treasure can be re-used.<br><br><a href=\"http://artspot.eu/stackathon\">Stackathon</a> – a mobile application that allows users to select works (e.g. art works or artefacts) in Europeana, give them audio annotations and then share the selected works and annotations with the world.<br><br><a href=\"http://wiki.agroknow.gr/agroknow/index.php/Hack4Europe_2012\">E4E </a>– a set of two widgets that automatically suggest cultural resources from Europeana and learning resources from Open Discovery Space to the author of educational pathways.<br><br><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/hack4europe-uk-11\">Casual Curator</a> (now part of <a href=\"http://decipher.open.ac.uk/storyspace/\">Decipher Storyspace</a>)– gets semantically improved search results from Europeana to aid personal curation for learning and teaching, making it easy to organise, annotate and share culture via Android touch-screen devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Joe%20Harrod%20presents%20Promethean%20Planet.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Joe Harrod presenting Promethean Planet</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Joe Harrod of <a href=\"http://www.prometheanplanet.com/\">Promethean Planet</a>, the world’s largest interactive teaching community, explained why they consider Europeana as a fantastic resource for 21st century learning, saying: ‘At Promethean Planet, we have already seen a huge move in both the curriculum, and teaching practice towards guided research and Europeana is quite simply the best publicly funded resource there is. With a simple interface and an unprecedented wealth of material, Europeana is a hugely exciting portal for use in collaborative or home learning.\_ Europeana has several distinguishing features that set it apart from other online archives, apart from the wealth of material and ease of accessibility. We need to support amazing enterprises like Europeana in order to create a curious, adept and clear sighted generation of European school leavers for 21st century.’<br><br>\r\nIn a lively debate that followed, MEPs underscored the high added value to Europe of Europeana’s digital services. They discussed how they can support Europeana and its ecosystem. At this stage of development the platform does not yet receive adequate financing from the market. Hence, for the next seven years, structural funding by a grant (<em>Connecting Europe Facility </em>CEF art 10.4c) is an indispensable condition for Europeana’s maturation into a self-supporting digital infrastructure. The Europeana team stressed that access to digital resources of European heritage must remain one of the projects of common interest eligible for support (<em>Telecom Guidelines </em>Annex III). And finally, we emphasised that protection of the <em>digital services</em> budget under CEF-<em>telecommunications</em> promotes Europeana and access to European cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><i>In today's guest blog, find out how and why Digital New Zealand are using </i><em>Europeana metadata and API. By Fiona Fieldsend, DigitalNZ Content Manager.</em></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://digitalnz.org\">DigitalNZ</a> aims to make New Zealand Aotearoa’s digital content easier to find, share and use. Like Europeana we aggregate metadata relating to our geographic area. We look for content about New Zealand and New Zealanders and bring its metadata into one place for discovery via <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org.nz/\">DigitalNZ Search</a>. We also have <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org.nz/developers\">an API</a> so that developers and programmers can build new discovery tools to help expose our partners’ content in innovative and exciting ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/moa.png\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023901/721122B314F36D4E55D0B3423E7F119F14E47483.html\">'Moa a ruhatárban'</a> from the Hungarian Natural History Museum, CC-BY-NC-ND </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DigitalNZ is just over four years old and we currently point to over 25 million items from our 120+ <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org.nz/partners/current-content-contributors\">content partners of all types</a>. Our partners include television and radio companies, government agencies, a myriad of community organisations, as well as the GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To support our “Share” and “Use” goals we also run <a href=\"http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/\">Mix and Mash</a> which aims to show what is possible when data and content is released for reuse. We also want to encourage the creation of more New Zealand digital content. <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/make-it-digital\">Make it Digital</a> is where you can ask questions about digital content creation and learn about digitisation good practice from the Make it Digital guides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/MNHNL-0000101-JB-IMG-web.jpeg\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 374px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023901/BC94D1B37748C223648CF6913CA33CCEC598FD4D.html\">'Detalhe da flor de metrosideros excelsea</a> do jardim botânico do museu nacional de história, lisboa - portugal' from the National Museum of Natural History, University of Lisbon, CC-BY-NC-ND.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand is a small country but we have wide reach. We know there is relevant New Zealand content all over the world. So over the last couple of years we’ve been identifying kiwi content held internationally and working with organisations to harvest that metadata into DigitalNZ. We have content from our closest neighbours at the National Library of Australia, State Library of Victoria, Museums Victoria and the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. We also used the Victoria and Albert’s API to bring in a <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/records?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;text=&amp;open_filters=true&amp;i%5bformat%5d=all&amp;i%5bdnz_type%5d=all&amp;i%5busage%5d=all&amp;i%5bcontent_partner%5d=Victoria+and+Albert+Museum&amp;i%5bdisplay_collection%5d=&amp;i%5byear_type%5d=any&amp;i%5bstart_year%5d=1500&amp;i%5bend_year%5d=2020&amp;tab=&amp;view=\">small but beautiful collection</a> of New Zealand related objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So of course we’ve had our eye on Europeana’s API for some time because we knew that there was a goodly amount of kiwi treasure in that fine ship! Since the API was launched for more open use we’ve been experimenting to see how it would work with our harvester and how the metadata would look in the DigitalNZ search interface. We completed that work last week and now almost 1,400 stunning New Zealand related items can be discovered through our services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve made a DigitalNZ set of <a href=\"http://digitalnz.org.nz/user_sets/50c50c31fb002c10df000083\">beautiful Europeana items</a> that we thought you might enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to all the Europeana content partners for opening up your metadata for everyone around the world to discover, share and use. New Zealanders can now learn more about themselves and their country because of you. We are looking forward to unearthing more New Zealand treasures in your wonderful collections. Kia ora!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/NZmapBiblioteca%20Virtual%20del%20Patrimonio%20Bibliogr%C3%A1fico.png\" style=\"width: 494px; height: 401px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09407a/CF8EB00B803B2EEF3810938157BCC594F6A2C74C.html\">'Der Isthmus von Auckland</a> (der Hauptstadt von Neu - Seeland) im Maassstabe 1:500000: [generalkarte]' from Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliográfico, public domain.</i></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Fashion Thesaurus: capturing imagination'

        body: "<p><em>Today's guest blog comes from Nacha Van Steen, Europeana Fashion partner at the <em>Royal Museums</em>\_of Art and History in Brussels, and discusses how and why the project is developing a thesaurus on fashion.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What springs to mind when I say ‘Fashion’? Exactly, an immense variety of images, clothes, shoes, magazines, lifestyle choices, as diverse and complex as your own imagination. Now imagine trying to capture all of that in words, and worse still, structure…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, that is exactly what the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion project</a> has set out to do in creating a thesaurus on fashion, a reference that assembles all things fashion in a controlled, structured hierarchy, including synonyms and antonyms.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The thesaurus will allow for maximum compatibility between the Europeana Fashion project and related fashion content. It will be used within the project for metadata enrichment and for high quality disclosure of fashion-related content within <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> itself. Moreover, it will be made publicly available on the project’s own website, ready to be used by all interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because it will exist as a digital reference only, it can serve as a starting point for fashion researchers, can be expanded as the need arises and will hopefully encompass the richness and complexity that the fashion industry, from creator to manufacturer to buyer and collector, has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The benefits are numerous: the vocabulary is controlled, can be translated (the Europeana Fashion Project offers 10 languages!), and the information can be retrieved in a fast, complete and orderly manner. Relationships become clear, data entry is simplified and a vast amount of knowledge is gathered in an logical, structured, organised way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, creativity – the base, the building block of fashion - always comes up with new takes on existing concepts. It evades capture, poses new questions and generally does not respond well to structure and organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what do we do? We go on right ahead anyway, because the benefits far outweigh the obstacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on existing international standards, first and foremost the <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html\">Getty Research Institute’s Art and Architecture Thesaurus</a>(AAT), we create a faceted and hierarchical thesaurus on fashion in no less than 10 languages on fashion as a cultural domain. We will innovate and expand existing AAT-concepts and continuously offer high quality disclosure of fashion-related content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim is to provide users with a myriad of search options, to help them find what you need, to keep them informed, interested and curious, and to help the fashion domain to publish its work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And how? Through creativity, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about the project, the thesaurus and the developments, please visit our <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu\">Europeana Fashion Project </a>website.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Network AGM: A Coming of Age'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Last week, the Europeana Network held its Annual General Meeting at the <a href=\"http://www.hamburgerbahnhof.de/text.php\">Hamburger Bahnhof</a> Museum of Contemporary Art in Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was packed with discussion and networking opportunities, as well as the launch of our new <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/54364439\">API video</a>, and the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=1402601&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">Korea Copyright Commission</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Monday, after a day of pre-AGM Task Force meetings (of which more later), the event officially kicked off with a private viewing of one of the museum’s exhibitions followed by a dinner buffet. But no red wine allowed – the floor of the venue is so historic and precious, it was white wine only for fear of damaging it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This social evening was a great opportunity to give out Europeana’s first ever ‘Unsung Hero’ awards. These went to partners nominated by Europeana Foundation staff for the great work they do. The team chose one Unsung Hero for each of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c4f19464-7504-44db-ac1e-3ddb78c922d7&amp;groupId=10602\">strategic tracks</a> - Aggregate, Facilitate, Distribute, Engage. Congratulations to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\n<ul>- Aggregate: Mariana Damova, Ontotext, Bulgaria, for the high quality of images and metadata Ontotext provides and for efforts to establish a Bulgarian national aggregator.</ul>\n<li>\n<br>\r\n- Facilitate: Paul Keller, Patrick Peiffer, Lucie Gilbaut, Georgia Angelaki for their work on the Data Exchange Agreement.<br>\r\n- Distribute: Marcin Werla, Federated Polish Digital Libraries, Poland, for support with the API pilot, implementations and marketing, and the organisation of two hackathons.<br>\r\n- Engage: Zachos Polyviou, Ministry of Education and Culture in Cyprus for his work on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> Family History Roadshow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On Tuesday, the AGM got underway with welcomes from Europeana Foundation Executive Director, Jill Cousins, and Prof. Dr. Günther Schauerte, Vice-President Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (SPK) – Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Detlef Eckert, from DG Connect and the European Commission, discussed how Europeana is positioned in terms of future funding and the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility\">Connecting Europe Facility</a> and stressed that ‘Europeana is one of our priorities’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then fell to Johan Oomen, from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and Vice Chair of the Europeana Network, to introduce the new Network Officers: Gunnar Urtegaard, Kulturrad; Anne Bergman-Tahon, Federation of European Publishers; Louise Edwards, The European Library; and Bengt Wittgren, Murberget Länsmuseet Västernorrland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chair of the Europeana Network, Nick Poole from Collections Trust, reviewed the activities and successes of what he called this ‘network of activists’ and introduced speakers to sum up the progress of the Task Forces, which covered: European Cultural Commons Advisory Board; Impact Assessment; Inter-project services and practices for User-Generated Content and tools; Public-Private Partnerships; Extending the list of Europeana controlled rights values; Europeana Tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New to the AGM agenda were two ‘Soapbox’ sessions. Members had 5 minutes to present topics close to their hearts, which ranged from how to share data to semantic data experiments, and from the importance of curation to a re-use competition proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bulk of the afternoon was spent discussing the Business Plan 2013 and the Cultural Commons, informed by presentations from Harry Verwayen, Europeana Business Development Director, and Louise Edwards, Director of The European Library. Each table chose a topic and assessed which aspects Europeana should prioritise. The results will help shape the Business Plan and Cultural Commons Task Force work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/AGM%20discussion.jpg\" style=\"width: 376px; height: 500px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Discussions in full flow</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chair Nick Poole rounded the day off with inspiring quotes reflecting the position of the Europeana Network: ‘The first, from a friend of mine who runs a National Museum in Auckland, is “We are the people we have been waiting for”. The second, from a colleague of mine, was “Culture is in good and careful hands”. The last, from Mike Edson at the Smithsonian Institution, “Think big, start small, move fast. But move!”’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back at the event a week on, Nick’s message to the Network is a positive one. He says, ‘It was a successful event, and it was good to be able to meet so many of the Network. It was good to hear of the work that the Task Forces were able to do on the previous day, and great to see such momentum and energy behind our work. Many thanks, too, to those of you that shared the proceedings via social media, adding to the vibrant feel of proceedings.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick concludes: ‘This AGM really felt like a coming-of-age for the Network, and I hope that those who attended felt it was a useful opportunity to make a real contribution to the strategic direction of Europeana. I was glad to have the opportunity of exploring our ideas around the Cultural Commons, and thanks to all of you for your feedback on this.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>More info: </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><a href=\"http://bit.ly/VowwIw\">Presentations</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><a href=\"http://flic.kr/s/aHsjD2eLDf\">Photos</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.tweetarchivist.com/ea18094/1\">Twitter statistics</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please share these links and encourage more of your colleagues to join our ever-growing Network.</p>\n</li>"

        body: "<p><i>Inventing Europe is an exhibition that incorporates content via the Europeana API. Below, guest blogger Suzanne Lommers tells us what it's all about. Before that, take a look at our new API video - launched last week at the Europeana Network AGM.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/54364439?badge=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/54364439\"><u>Europeana API</u></a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\"><u>Europeana</u></a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/\"><u>Vimeo</u></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>The first 'Hungarian' floppy disk drive…</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>'British' dye used in a 'Norwegian' wool factory…</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A 'Dutch' polygon news reel about a pan-European train network… </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn how, where, and why technologies were fundamental to shaping modern Europe in the exhibition <i>Inventing Europe</i>, now online at <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\"><u>www.inventingeurope.eu.</u></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><u><img src=\"/files/blogimages/22Nova.png\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 383px;\"></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A unique collaboration between historians and cultural heritage institutions across borders has created a new and innovative history of Europe. Inspired by the book series <a href=\"http://www.makingeurope.eu/\"><u>Making Europe: Technology and Transformations 1850-2000 </u></a>that will be published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2013 and 2014, <i>Inventing Europe</i> opens up brand-new perspectives on the history, formation, and culture of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How was Europe explored, communicated, and experienced? And how have people everywhere used technologies up to the present day, to unify or fragment or otherwise give shape to Europe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/22Novb.png\" style=\"width: 336px; height: 419px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collections of over ten cultural heritage institutions give a whole new reality to this history. What can a floppy disk drive, a film about the Trans Europe Express or dye tell about Europe? Visitors will discover that nothing is quite what it seems and that there is more to an object than might appear at first sight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Inventing Europe</i> is meant for everybody who has an interest in the history of Europe and in technology. Thus far, museum audiences, professionals, and cultural heritage institutions as well as university researchers and students with all sorts of backgrounds have explored the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors can follow a number of object-based tours through Europe’s history. These tours are collected within different exhibitions that explore the broader themes of Daily Lives, Media &amp; Communications, Knowledge Societies, Infrastructure, Globalisation and Governance. Europe’s history comes to life as users interact with the objects and stories that show the forces that shaped it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These interactive and vivid experiences make <i>Inventing Europe </i>an excellent tool for new ways of engaging with rich primary materials. Therefore, the <i>Inventing Europe</i> team is developing a new educational programme. European universities in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal already use the website in their classroom teaching. The first results will be evaluated in February of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/22Novc.png\" style=\"width: 504px; height: 198px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Inventing Europe</i> is one of Europeana’s API projects. In addition to direct feeds from partner websites, the Europeana feed turns the rich narrative environment of <i>Inventing Europe</i> into a portal for further exploration of objects across Europe.

        title: 'DM2E to start work on Wittgenstein''s Brown Book'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>As part of the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\">Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana</a> (DM2E) project, a group of scholars will begin working on Ludwig Wittgenstein's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_and_Brown_Books\"><i>Brown Book</i></a> in 2013. This document will be made available to Europeana by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen (WAB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein\">Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein</a> (26 April 1889 – 29 April 1951) was an Austrian-British philosopher who worked primarily in logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. In 1999, his posthumously published <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> (1953) was ranked as the most important book of 20th-century philosophy by the Baruch Poll, standing out as '...the one crossover masterpiece in twentieth-century philosophy, appealing across diverse specialisations and philosophical orientations'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Wittgenstein\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Wittgenstein.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 374px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Blue plaque commemorating Ludwig Wittgenstein in Cambridge, from </i><i><span>'Notice the interesting things'</span> (<a href=\"http://www.geograph.org.uk/profile/11413\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Keith Edkins</a>) / <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\" rel=\"license\">CC BY-SA 2.0</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, WAB created the online platform <a href=\"http://wittgensteinsource.org/\">Wittgenstein Source</a> (1) which gives open access to 5,000 pages of manuscripts and typescripts from the <a href=\"http://wab.uib.no/wab_nachlass.page/\">Wittgenstein nachlass,</a> including the <i>Brown Book</i> corpus. The <i>Brown Book</i> was dictated by Wittgenstein to students in Cambridge in 1934-35 as a summary of his philosophy at that time. One aspect of the book is the introduction of 'language games' which shed light on the complexity of our language. The <i>Brown Book</i> was revised several times; Wittgensteinsource includes both the typewritten dictation and the last revision in Wittgenstein's own hand, which led to the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of scholars will gather around Wittgenstein Source in order to address their questions to the <i>Brown Book</i>. In order to achieve this, they will make use of the <a href=\"http://www.thepund.it\">Pundit </a>platform, which is being developed within the DM2E project by the Italian company <a href=\"http://www.netseven.it/\">Net7</a>. The platform allows scholars to access the <i>Brown Book</i> easily and to create semantic annotations of particular relevance. Through the platform, they will also be able to interact and comment on each other's views and questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WAB will provide the texts as well as an ontology which can be used as the backbone for scholarly annotation and interaction on these texts.(2) This ontology will include names for the single texts (on a remarks level), the persons and works referred to, text-genetical relations, but also terms for subject entries, and, moreover, properties which allow scholars to express argumentative relations between single annotation statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wittgenstein pilot has an important experimental aspect as it will demonstrate to what extent humanities scholars are willing to migrate research and argumentation activities to a digital environment, and highlight the challenges and limitations they experience as well as the new opportunities this kind of working makes available to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep up with this project, follow DM2E's <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/blog/\">blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) 2009 A.

        title: 'First public beta version of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek is launched'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>The Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) went online for the general public this week at <a href=\"http://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de\">www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de</a>. This post is taken from the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek <a href=\"http://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/news/2012-11-28-000\">news pages</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 28 November, in Berlin’s Altes Museum on the city’s Museum Island, Hermann Parzinger, President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and Spokesperson for the Board of the DDB Competence Network,&nbsp; Elke Harjes-Ecker, Head of the Culture Department at Thuringia’s Ministry of Education, Science and Culture and Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the DDB Competence Network,&nbsp; Matthias Harbort, Head of New Media for the Federal Government Representative for Culture and Media and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Trustees, as well as Jill Cousins, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, introduced the new portal together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/launch-gross.jpg\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 319px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Jill Cousins, Hermann Parzinger, Elke Harjes-Ecker, Matthias Harbort (from left to right). Photo: Julia Hoppen</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will pave the way for networking all of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions together with their digitised inventories in the medium to long term and integrating them into the European digital library, Europeana. \"The goal of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is to offer everyone unrestricted access to Germany’s cultural and scientific heritage, that is, access to millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music and other sound documents, as well as films and scores, from all over Germany,\" explained Hermann Parzinger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"The DDB should secure Germany’s connectivity and competitiveness in the areas of science, research and education, but also make it possible for anyone to access Germany’s unique cultural heritage and knowledge conveniently via one central point of entry,\" emphasised Elke Harjes-Ecker. \"This will bring about a fundamental improvement to our opportunities in the areas of research, education and the economy.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince the summer of 2007, a competence network made up of representatives of the Federal Government, the Länder and municipalities has been working on this ambitious project. Starting in 2010, the first phase of the technical infrastructure was created at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIA). As technical operator, FIZ Karlsruhe – Leibniz Institute for Information Infrastructure is responsible for the entire technical and administrative operations of the DDB central infrastructure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first public beta version provides users with a great many contents and new functions. Users can explore the entire inventory of items using search terms. In addition, the system provides an advanced search as well as different filters to narrow down results. The information to be found there has been processed with a great deal of editorial care and bears the quality seal of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions. Search results are not influenced by commercial interests. Thanks to the comprehensive preparation of the metadata, it is possible to carry out a uniform search in the collections from different contexts. \"The user will soon be able to navigate between the objects found using semantic references, which will open up unexpected content and contexts. This will highlight connections and cross-references that are not clearly visible on the websites of individual institutions or on domain-specific sites, such as purely library-based portals for example. This is a feature unique to the DDB,\" explained Matthias Harbort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne important function fulfilled by the DDB is that of national data aggregator for the European cultural portal, Europeana. It enables German cultural and scientific institutions to make a significant contribution towards this European project. \"The Europeana emerged from the conviction that free, democratic access to cultural heritage must be guaranteed for everyone so that the opportunities provided by digitalisation can be used for the further development of our society,\" said Jill Cousins. \"We are happy to have the DDB on board as a central national partner whose support will help us work towards fulfilling our objective.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike many internet services, the DDB lives from participation. On the one hand from those who provide content and, on the other, from those who use the portal and recommend it further. \"All of Germany's scientific, research and cultural institutions are invited to support the continued expansion of the DDB to make it more attractive,\" says Elke Harjes-Ecker. The institutions that have provided their content for the DDB already enjoy many advantages. The central access provided by the DDB takes users reliably to digitised cultural items from Germany. As the digital items are always linked to the location where the actual works and objects can be found, this increases the visibility and public awareness of the institutions in question, so they can expect an increase in visitor numbers both online and offline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon the institutions will be able to exchange information and ideas and support one another via the emerging DDB network. What is more, the DDB offers tools and services that should help the institutions in future to prepare, edit and present their own digitised objects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the course of the coming year, the DDB will already be adding successively to the functions it provides and will optimise the search for and networking of objects. The virtual exhibitions put together by experts will clearly present the entire range of cultural heritage to be made accessible via the DDB. The portal will act as a continuously growing network for the participating cultural and scientific institutions. Moreover, an application programming interface (API) will enable the development of services around the DDB, for example, specific applications for smartphones and tablets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\"Today’s launch of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek beta version goes a long way to realising our vision of making the cultural and scientific heritage of Germany available in digital form via the portal,\" explained Hermann Parzinger. \"However, we have not yet reached our destination. This is a process that will take years to complete.\"</p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>In today's guest post, the Natural Europe project tells how they're working with schools and museums to bring digital collections about natural history to life and to create new tools for exploring it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe is a project co-funded by the European Commission under the ICT-PSP programme (2010-2013) and co-ordinated by the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET), Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe works with Natural History Museums (NHMs) to facilitate access to a large amount of natural history and environmental collections and to highlight their educational value. The Natural Europe digital libraries aim to facilitate storage, search and retrieval of digital content that is related to natural history. Natural Europe offers the tools that will allow museums to continuously manage and publish their digital collections online and will allow museum educators to design innovative online pathways through the museums’ digital collections. Visitors will use the educational pathways to navigate both physically and virtually through NHM exhibitions, connecting them with the school curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe works with NHMs to make their digital collections available online through the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana portal</a>. Both Natural Europe pathway’s website and Europeana’s portal provide access to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:The+Natural+Europe+Project&amp;rows=1000\">9,880 natural history digital resources</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural1.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 157px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 1 </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural2.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 316px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 2</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe is creating meaningful educational experiences within the museums through <a href=\"http://education.natural-europe.eu/natural_europe/index\">learning pathways</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural3.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 260px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 3</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To train school teachers and museum educators to use the technologies deployed by the project, Natural Europe organises targeted events and workshops. Three workshops took place in the Hungarian Natural History Museum last October. In addition, a Hungarian Natural History Museum representative presented the project and its methodology at a workshop, held on 15 November, during the <a href=\"http://www.natural-europe.eu/en/news-and-events/news/project-news/331-a-workshop-using-natural-europe-methodology\">Environmental Education and the Museum conference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural4.jpg\" style=\"width: 434px; height: 327px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 4</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural Europe schools and workshops give participants the chance be creative, develop their own ideas for exercises and learn how to use the project’s tools. About 25 new educational pathways were created by teachers and museum educators during the <a href=\"http://www.natural-europe.eu/en/news-and-events/news/project-news/309-educators-summer-school-2012\">Educators Summer School 2012</a>. Its aim was to bring together science teachers, teacher trainers, museum educators/museum staff and science communicators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural5.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 5</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/natrural6.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Figure 6</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project’s <a href=\"http://www.natural-europe.eu/en/news-and-events/news/project-news/325-natural-europe-summer-school-coming\">next summer school </a>is taking place in June/July in Crete, Greece (30 June 2013 - 5 July 2013). The course focusses on learning design and the use of educational resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very interesting <a href=\"http://www.natural-europe.eu/en/news-and-events/news/project-news/315-winter-school-in-lithuania\"> winter school </a>on design of learning material is to be held next January/February in Vilnius, Lithuania (28 January 2013 - 01 February 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museum exhibitions will be made richer through the use of interactive installations deployed by Natural Europe. Their natural history content will be displayed in different ways, allowing for its full exploitation on the museum floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone interested can join the project’s <a href=\"http://www.natural-europe.eu/en/affiliation-application-form\">Affiliated Partnership Programme</a> and become part of the community of users and experts.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://movember.com/\">Movember</a> (the month formally known as November) is a moustache-growing charity event held during November each year that raises funds and awareness for men’s health. A few of the blokes at the Europeana office (including me) are joining the cause through the sprouting of our moustaches during the month of November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/moustache1.jpg\" style=\"width: 390px; height: 367px;\"><br><i>Image from the French National Library – 1912 – Public Domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day we’re working to initiate the re-use of Europeana content in creative ways that engage users outside the portal, particularly on <a href=\"http://facebook.com/europeana\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/europeanaeu\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana\">Pinterest</a> and other social media platforms. Ultimately we want to ignite ideas within the network and share our experiences and results that can hopefully be applied to your own project or organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when this year’s Movember launched on 1 November and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23movember&amp;src=typd\">spread like wildfire </a>through social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, quickly becoming a trending topic, we saw an opportunity to join the cause and dig through Europeana to select some dashing examples of moustaches throughout history. Jumping into an active discussion such as Movember opened up Europeana to a receptive audience and enabled us to easily engage them with the subject/event from a historical context.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Throw your collections into the discussion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It quickly became clear that Europeana is not lacking <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151130698868668.444959.10261403667&amp;type=1\"> content related to moustaches</a> and we wanted to bring a small selection of them to the Movember movement. We pin-pointed some of the finest examples of facial hair from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks to public domain content from our partners at the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_dataProvider%3A%22French+National+Library+-+Biblioth%C3%A8que+Nationale+de+France%22\">French National Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_dataProvider%3A%22Archivo+de+la+Imagen+de+Castilla+La+Mancha%22\">Archivo de la Imagen de Castilla La Mancha</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/moustache2.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 376px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Our historical moustaches Facebook gallery</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The small amount of time invested in curating two collections resulted in our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151130698868668.444959.10261403667&amp;type=1\">gallery of 28 images</a> generating more than 120 tweets, 300 likes and 300 shares on Facebook – not to mention countless impressions thanks to the gallery being republished on websites such as <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/2012/11/movember-historical-moustaches/\">Retronaut</a>, one of the biggest websites for amateur historians. The collection was also posted on the official Movember Facebook accounts of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MovemberGermany/posts/365651940185951\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MovemberSwitzerland/posts/388570601217013\">Switzerland</a> amongst others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the moral of the story is, spending a little time curating your collections to focus on a hot topic opens them up to a wide audience for discussion online. Check out some of the great reactions that we saw on Twitter as a result of our gallery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>@awessendorf - Some fine retro moustache action to inspire Movember participants</p>\r\n\r\n<p>@tct_culturetrip - #movember, if you need some inspiration check out these photos of historical moustaches</p>\r\n\r\n<p>@amamro - Some Movember inspiration for all you moustache growers</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we’ve learnt and what you can do</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Jump onto trending topics and curate your collections around them.</li>\r\n    <li>Provide context and play with humour.</li>\r\n    <li>Take your collections out of your space and host them on social networks such as Pinterest and Facebook, that way they’ll spread easily.</li>\r\n    <li>Have fun and record the feedback, you never know when it’ll come in handy.</li>\r\n</ul>"

        body: "<p><i>Linda Veinberga, Dissemination Officer for DCA, tells us what the project is all about and how it has already exceeded all expectations.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitising Contemporary Art (DCA) is a 30-month project, digitising art created after 1945. By June 2013 it will have made central parts of the collections of 21 European art institutions available online. The collections include paintings, sculptures, photographs, video, drawings, prints, collages and book art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Pat_Andrea_Returning_%20from_%20Greece_Frissiras_Museum.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 354px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Pat Andrea: Returning from Greece (1965), oil on canvas, 108x150cm (c) Frissiras Museum, Athens, Greece.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 27,000 artworks and 2,000 contextual documents are being digitised to create high quality digital reproductions drawing upon the know-how of 4 experienced technical partners and using the best practices in digitisation, metadata implementation and long-term preservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/42762249?badge=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Digitising the installation Genet's Toaster (1997) by Leda Papaconstantinou at Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art. The video shows the process of digitisation, starting with the assembling of the installation that is normally kept in the storage room, and ending with photographs being taken of it.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has sucessfully reached its aggregation phase now and the digitised content and metadata will soon be integrated into Europeana, thus adding a contemporary art content still largely missing on Europeana's database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Stephan_von_Huene_Untitled_Mind_Maps_HfG.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 353px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Stephan von Huene: Untitled, from the series Mind Maps (1987), pencil on paper, collection of Dr. Petra Kipphof von Huene, digitised at the Staatliche Hochschule für Gestaltung Karlsruhe, Germany.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has undergone several phases:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first period lasting six months (January-June 2011), the project consortium carried out an extensive assessment of the status of the collections and the very different situations of each content partner. This allowed for the establishment of a digitisation framework for the whole project, based on best practices, expert knowledge and technical support. Subsequently, each content provider created an individual digitisation plan, detailing the targeted quality and schedule of identified content segments along the trajectory of the digitisation workflow. Only after the planning phase did the actual digitisation start (July 2011) and it has since been a work-in-progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/40940857?badge=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Digitisation process at Fundacio Antoni Tapies, for Digitising Contemporary Art (DCA) .</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reached the halfway mark in spring 2012, the achieved results exceeded all expectations. Around 30% more items than anticipated had been digitised (12,834 items, including artworks of, for instance, Barry Flanagan, Stephan von Huene, Atelier Van Lieshout, Claes Oldenburg). 12,508 of these digitised items were already recorded in the partners’ collection management system with the appropriate metadata. This was three times more than expected for the period. By April, 2,632 items had already been placed online on the respective content partners' websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Tamas_%20Waliczky_Landscape_Image_ArsElectronica.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 359px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Tamás Waliczky: Landscape (1998), Awarded Distinction at Prix Ars Electronica 1998 in the category Computer Animation/Visual Effects, the archive of Ars Electronica Linz GmbH, Austria.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parallel to the digitisation process, workshops were held to offer in-depth introductions to metadata schemes, file formats and codec standards, XML exports, vocabularies, long-term preservation tools and strategies, aggregation procedures and copyright issues. Guidelines based on the experience and assessment of the best and successful practices in terms of digitisation and preservation strategies have been published to the benefit of other professionals in the field and interviews with the staff working for content providers give a concrete insight into issues of creating digital collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Deliverables, project-related documents, interview transcripts and other information can be found on <a href=\"http://www.dca-project.eu/\"> the DCA website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DCA_project\">@DCA_project</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read interviews with <a href=\"http://www.dca-project.eu/documentation/category/interview\">content partners</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Wikipedia WW1 Articles Enhanced with Europeana Content'

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Geer Oskam, Senior Marketing Specialist at Europeana, tells us about an Editathon event at which Europeana content was used to update Wikipedia pages related to World War One.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week I attended the first Europeana-Wikimedia Editathon: our friends from the Swedish Wikimedia Chapter organised the event together with Stockholm University. An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_run_an_edit-a-thon\">Editathon</a> is a gathering where Wikimedians get together to upgrade existing Wikipedia pages, or to create new Wikipedia pages. Editathons are usually based around a particular topic. On 11 November it was WW1 Remembrance Day, so an appropriate time to update related articles with Europeana data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this Editathon, John Andersson from Wikimedia Sweden uploaded 60 images from the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918 collection</a> to <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_1914-1918\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. These images were the starting point for the Editathon. We gathered in Gulan Villan (Yellow House) at Stockholm University. There were 12 people present at the event, and another contributing online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Editathon%20photo.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 376px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>The Editathon in progress!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We worked from 4pm till 9pm. In this time, 10 new images from the Europeana database were uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, 5 new Wikipedia articles were written and 17 existing articles were enriched with 11 of the 60 already uploaded Europeana images. The improvements to the articles were done in Swedish, Finnish, English, German and Dutch. In addition to the work done by those present at the Editathon, some ‘wiki magic’ happened over the next few days as ten other online volunteers helped to improve the texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples of Wikipedia pages that were updated during the Editathon: a page on <a href=\"http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler\">Adolf Hitler </a>which now incorporates a postcard written by Hitler in 1916 from the Europeana 1914-1918 collection, and a page on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Berlin_%281908%29\">SS Berlin</a>, now including a picture of the ship from Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can we measure the success of an event like this? A number of page views will give us a starting point. To give you an idea - the articles these images illustrate were viewed 33,500 times in the 2 weeks before the Editathon. Over the next few weeks, we will monitor page visits and referral links from pages that have been enriched by data from the Europeana database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Playing_cards_for_trench_cards.jpg\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 415px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Miniature playing cards and case belonging to a soldier on the Western Front. One of the images from Europeana 1914-1918 uploaded to Wikimedia Commons for the Editathon.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fastest way to get a high amount of people viewing a donated picture is to upload high quality pictures that are suitable to use as illustrations in central Wikipedia articles. Carefully chosen pictures can easily be added to many articles and thus increase the amount of people seeing the material. This takes time and an expert view on subject matter is needed. In smaller language versions, such as the Swedish one, a lot of articles are still ‘missing’, meaning they exist in other languages but not Swedish. So if we want to use a photo on the Swedish pages, it needs to be put into context, which means writing or translating the article that goes with it from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/War_hospital_WWI.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 312px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Christmas in a military hospital. One of the images from Europeana 1914-1918 uploaded to Wikimedia Commons for the Editathon.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While editing my first Dutch Wikipedia page (about the <a href=\"http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Berlin_%281908%29\">SS Berlin</a>), I was thinking about how being involved in an Editathon brings greater benefits than simply an increase in the number of page views. Building a partnership with Wikimedia and with Wikimedians - volunteers who understand the ways of the largest free knowledge network of our time - is invaluable. If your cultural organisation hosts a Wikimedia Editathon, you provide access to your data and begin an engagement with a powerful partner. Just to remind you: Wikipedia has 490 million unique visitors per month. That is more then any mainstream media, meaning that Wikipedia has become the ultimate mainstream medium. Also, remember the reach of Wikipedia: it has articles in 270 languages, I’m pretty sure that's more languages than you have in the multilingual menu on your website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we are focussing on expanding our partnerships with Wikimedia. We are organising more events with the Swedish chapter throughout Europe in 2013. Europeana is also partnering with Wikimedia in the <a href=\"http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/\">Wiki Loves Monuments </a>contest. And if you are a cultural institution and you want to upload your data to Wikimedia, Europeana is also building a <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:GLAMToolset_project\">Europeana Wiki GLAM Toolset </a>that will let you bulk upload your material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow this blog and our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Twitter</a> account to hear more about our Wiki collaborations.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'CARARE Final Conference – How Did We Do?'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><i>The CARARE project will come to a close at the end of January and has just held its final conference showcasing some great progress and achievements. Guest blogger, Kate Fernie, gives us the low-down.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE Project </a>launched in February 2010 with the aim of supplying 2 million items on archaeology and architecture to Europeana and of bringing the historical cultural environment to end-users. By November 2012, over 1.3 million records have been published and more content is on its way to Europeana in the next two months. The project is set to exceed its content target, but what else have we achieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the two-day Final Policy Conference held on the 8-9 November, it was evident that the CARARE content providers were delighted to be able to share their enthusiasm and knowledge with Europeana end-users, and provide access to content such as protected buildings in Brussels, ancient forts and old images from Lithuania, 3D models of Greek churches, icons, archaeological monuments from Denmark, and so much more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It goes further than that… CARARE and Europeana have stimulated other initiatives. For example, the Cyprus Research and Educational Foundation told us about a project with the Elementary School at Pyrga where they worked with teachers to show the children how to investigate their local heritage, along the way photographing their church and creating a 3D model. The results of a developer hackathon, <a href=\"http://hack4dk.tumblr.com/\">Hack4DK</a>, showed the popularity of these events, with 25 developers taking part. The winning apps included <a href=\"http://codeunited.dk/kulturarv/\">'Kulturarv'</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/AdoptAMound/info?ref=stream\">‘Adopt a Mound’</a>. Kulturarv was developed after the event to produce a fully working augmented reality for anyone wishing to explore Denmark’s historic past with an Android phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Kristine Hoff Meyer\" src=\"/files/blogimages/CARARE1.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Kristine Hoff Meyer of the Culture Agency of Denmark introducing the session on Hack4DK - photo by Sheena Bassett.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also heard about exciting initiatives from the Arts Council Norway such as ‘Heritage Here’, which is bringing information about monuments, buildings and natural sites to mobiles and tablets. '1001 Stories About Denmark' illustrated both the power of people’s connections with historic places and successful use of social media. We heard Wiki Loves Monuments has become global and is beating its own world record for the number of photographs captured by members of the public in a campaign. <a href=\"http://historiana.eu/\">EuroClio</a>, the association of European History Educators, spoke about possibilities for future collaborations. It was clear from delegates that cultural heritage institutions are focused upon adapting to this new and changing world to exploit the full potential of their content while grappling with issues such as sustainability and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, back to CARARE… yes, I think we can say we have made a difference. CARARE has helped Europeana to introduce <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=TYPE:3D\">3D content</a> to its users, and it is the geo-spatial co-ordinates available in much of our content that forms the basis of many of the mobile apps now in development following the move of Europeana metadata into the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what happens next? We have a lot more CARARE content still to be uploaded before the project ends on 31 January 2013, and we will be unveiling a geo-browser based on CARARE content and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana API </a> before then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn’t the end – a project called <a href=\"http://3dicons-project.eu/\">3D-ICONS</a>, an off-shoot of CARARE, began earlier this year. 3D-ICONS is digitising a series of architectural and archaeological masterpieces of world and European cultural significance and will make 3D models and related digital content available for Europeana users. And in January 2013 a project called LoCloud will start, this is a follow-on from Europeana Local and CARARE and will be aggregating local history and heritage content for Europeana using cloud technologies.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>For the past two years, 19 of Europe's leading research libraries have been hard at work on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-libraries.eu/\"> Europeana Libraries </a> project. Their primary goal? To make 5 million digital objects freely accessible on <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana websites.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has attracted attention at the highest political levels in Europe, including by Vice-President of the European Commission Neelie Kroes who mentioned the project in a 2011 speech at LIBER's annual conference. She named Europeana Libraries as an example of how her goal of digitising all of Europe's digital heritage by 2025 could be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GIU14-3hYto\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now - after two years of work - the Europeana Libraries project is almost complete. It will leave a rich legacy of treasures from prestigious European libraries when it finishes, as scheduled, in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These include thousands of pages of full-text content and digital objects that range from <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/1000086107573\">medieval manuscripts </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/1000096107255\">17th century books</a> to the letters of prominent scientists and artists such as <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/2000083228445\">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/1000086057211\"> Oscar Wilde.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/2000083228456\" src=\"/files/blogimages/einsteinletter.jpg\" style=\"width: 406px; height: 659px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Letter from scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Thirring\">Hans Thirring </a>to Albert Einstein, from The European Library. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A particularly strong theme to emerge from the Europeana Libraries project is material related to technical and scientific advancements in the 19th and 20th centuries. These items will be highlighted in an online showcase, set to be launched later this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From early x-ray images to portraits of pioneering researchers such as Marie and Pierre Curie, this virtual collection on The European Library website will bring together over 500 maps, letters, journals, videos and photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/1000086120532\" src=\"/files/blogimages/armenianmanuscript.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 374px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>An Armenian manuscript from The European Library. The illuminated page shows an astronomer gazing through a telescope.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technical Advances</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to assembling cultural material, partners in the Europeana Libraries project have worked on technical solutions for the library community. Notably, they have built a robust and efficient aggregation system, able to transform library metadata in formats such as MARC 21 and Dublin-core to the new <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model </a>standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This system can be used by any library to deliver digitised content to Europeana, The European Library and other services for researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new and robust library network has also been created by the Europeana Libraries project. Bonds have been strengthened both between the 19 project members and between its coordinating organisations: <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/web/\">CERL</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/foundation;jsessionid=B8C818B432F5A0BA3A05D61515226123\">Europeana Foundation.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Europeana Libraries project comes to a close, these coordinating organisations will turn their focus to a new opportunity: the Europeana Cloud project. Its 35 partners will start work in early 2013 on three main goals:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>To provide access on the Europeana website to 2.4 million new metadata records and 5 million research-focused digital items from across European universities, libraries, data centres and publishers.</li>\r\n    <li>To create a cloud-based infrastructure capable of delivering cost-efficient content and metadata storage for stakeholders across Europe.</li>\r\n    <li>To develop a digital platform named Europeana Research. This platform will provide tools and services for researchers that encourage innovative research involving digitised content.</li>\r\n</ol>"

        title: 'Sign the CEF Declaration - Europe''s digital future is in your hands'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>It is vital for the future of digital projects in Europe that you show your support for the Connecting Europe Facility. You can do that online by signing the Declaration <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kallas/connecting-europe-facility/\"> here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>So what is the CEF? </b> It provides the funding stream that enables the work of the Europeana ecosystem. The <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-1200_en.htm?locale=en&gt;\"> CEF </a> is a proposal by the European Commission to invest around 9.2 billion Euros in the provision of high-speed broadband and digital public services to 45 million households across Europe. This allocation of funds provides for the services outlined by <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/\">The Digital Agenda for Europe</a>, and this includes Europeana. This is part of the 50 billion Euro budget allocated to improving Europe's transport, energy and digital networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why do we need to support it? </b>Because the budget of CEF is under threat. Member States want a substantial reduction of the overall EU budget. All the savings must be found in the new programmes like CEF since the long-standing Structural Funds and Agriculture Fund have strong support among groups of Member States, so they will be spared. If the CEF budget is reduced substantially (up to 30% or more) there will be no money available for the work the Europeana Network is doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Make your voice heard by signing <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kallas/connecting-europe-facility/\">here</a></b>. Note that any individual may sign, so encourage all in your associations/institutions to sign <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kallas/connecting-europe-facility/\">the Declaration </a>as soon as possible. No registration is required - it only takes a minute!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also comment or follow the conversation on Twitter using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CEFdigital&amp;src=typd\">#CEFDigital</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The Cultural Commons: ‘Think big, start small, but act fast!’'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>On 29 October, the Europeana Network hosted a strategic briefing on the ‘cultural commons' in Cyprus. Yes, the weather was great, as was the hospitality of the Cypriots who are leading the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from July-December 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our event ran alongside <a href=\"http://www.euromed2012.eu/\">Euromed 2012 </a> so we were in good company and had many fruitful side-discussions with colleagues from all over Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Cyprus meeting\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Cyprus.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 256px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But our meeting was concerned with one thing only: ‘<a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/cultural-commons\">The Commons, from Concept to Action</a>’. So, what is the cultural commons? My favourite definition comes from David Bollier:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'There is no such thing as ‘the’ cultural commons. A commons follows certain design principles that govern the collective, sharable goods. It is a social system for the long-term stewardship of resources that preserves shared values and community identity. Therefore, the commons is not merely a resource. It is a resource plus a defined community and the protocols, values and norms devised by the community to manage its resources'.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year we have had many conversations about the 'commons' as a way of better harnessing the potential of our digital cultural heritage. Most people think it’s a very good thing, but there is also confusion about what it means in practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlotte Hess, one of the leading thinkers about the commons and an advisor in our Task Force  expressed the potential as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>‘A commons provides... a new way of looking at what is shared or should be shared in the world around us. It focuses on collective action and the importance of understanding who shares what, how we share it and how we sustain commons for future generations.’ (Hess, 2008)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This captures the imagination but is not quite sufficient for action. A very inspiring keynote video by Michael Edson, one of the most thought-provoking speakers on the subject, and Web and Strategy Director at the Smithonian Institution in the US, gave us more to think about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VlHC0uPqdRY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael introduced 5 important concepts for constructing a commons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>The web is a giant copying machine, and an immensely powerful tool in making heritage as accessible as possible so make it work for you and your institution.</li>\r\n    <li>Be wary of looking at Europeana as the 'mother of all websites'. Europeana is only as strong as its Network – it’s a node in an ever-expanding community of partners with common goals.</li>\r\n    <li>There is no ready-made recipe to make a commons work. Every situation we are trying to solve is different, so don't look for the ultimate definition.</li>\r\n    <li>Don’t assume everyone understands what we mean by 'Culture', 'Audience', 'Access' or 'Engagement'. These words may mean something quite different to others so we must express ourselves clearly.</li>\r\n    <li>We should train ourselves to think like investors: is a commons the best investment for our time/digital objects/energy?</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>With this in mind, we set to work discussing 3 topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Vision: Do we agree on the vision as laid out in the <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/6f48965b-a584-424d-b5a5-b8a0b2909888\">discussion paper?</a> While the general vision was agreed on by all participants, the concept of the commons still needs to be clarified so that it is completely transparent and clear. Nick Poole, Chair of the Europeana Network pointed out that,\r\n\r\n    <p></p>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>‘We should be careful not to build something that ends up ‘commons-like’, but really isn’t. A commons is a fundamental design principle that we need to build together, as a community.’</blockquote>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>Principles: What are the principles of the commons, in the context of the Europeana Network? Nick Poole gave us the rules of engagement of other commons, such as Flickr, Wikimedia and water suppliers, <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/b8ee6cb9-608a-46f2-b3d5-97a6b1e49e80\">in his presentation </a>. This provoked discussion on the subject of mutuality and the (free) re-use of content in a commons. We hope the Task Force can advise us so that we may define our rules of engagement together during the <a href=\"http://agm2012-berlin.eventbrite.nl/#\">Europeana Network Annual General Meeting</a> in Berlin on 27 November.</li>\r\n    <li>Projects: Commons thrive on concrete action - what are the most promising projects to apply commons principles to? Merete Sanderhoff told us how she applied principles of the commons within the <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/62587486-4e45-475b-bc38-84c3be359908\">Danish Museums network </a>, which helped us to see how we could apply this in future Europeana projects. We also discussed a 'Research Commons' as presented by <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/71951f13-89d0-497c-a872-936259d6ed9a\">Louise Edwards</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>The group concluded that it is a good idea to test our ideas out in real life and we’ll start with three pilots: Europeana Research, Europeana Tourism, and infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We made real progress in Cyprus and we’re eager to discuss it with you in Berlin. In the meantime, if you have any questions or remarks, please leave a comment below.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'End-User Research: Why We Love Visitors From Social Media'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Don’t get me wrong, we love all traffic groups here at Europeana, but we’re especially interested in visitors who come to us from social media. You’ve probably seen us in your feeds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\" target=\"_blank\">Tweeting</a>, updating <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, +1ing on<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/115619270851872228337\" target=\"_blank\"> Google+</a>, publishing new blogposts and pinning on <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a> – but what does all this achieve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social media is now one of Europeana's fastest-growing traffic groups and in this blogpost I’m going to give you a brief overview of what impact social media has had here at Europeana and what kind of results it’s generating for us in terms of traffic and more importantly engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might think that behind our social media work, there's a process that looks like this…</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Neil2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>to achieve something as simple as this...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Neil1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But it's not like that - it's easy and incredibly effective. </strong>Social media doesn’t need to be complicated, it's not a new phenonomen, and therefore we can skip the difficult mind-maps and simply focus on the two kids sharing music through a single pair of headphones on a street in Rome. At the end of the day, social media is about the joint use of a resource or space, in our case that would be Europeana.eu and digitised cultural heritage in general. Ultimately we want to distribute digitised cultural heritage and make it easily sharable, and social media as a platform has played an important role in helping us do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purpose of this blog entry, the information presented is based on metrics from a rolling year, therefore from October 1 2011 to October 31 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to traffic from social media, it becomes clear that quality over quantity really matters, social media represents a small minority of our traffic, currently 1.7% to be more precise, however end-users that arrive at Europeana via this source are more engaged and more likely to share when they’re there. Below you'll see that when compared to search engine traffic and the site average, users from social media spend longer on the site, visit more pages and are less likely to bounce on their arrival. What's more is that end-users from social media spend an extra 33 seconds longer on the portal (00:03:03) when compared to the site average (00:02:30). The percentage of new users coming to Europeana from social media is lower when compared with other groups, however this indicates that our end-users from social media are loyal and more likely to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<table width=\"640\"><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0At1Rk6Y4HaPodG9XbWFqRTItNGs1RjNQM1FzUEVEX0E&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A5%3AB8&gid=0&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"12\"},\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"width\":320,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"logScale\":false,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":null,\"viewWindow\":null,\"maxValue\":null},{\"useFormatFromData\":true}],\"title\":\"Average Page Depth\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"height\":200,\"domainAxis\":{\"direction\":1},\"legend\":\"none\",\"focusTarget\":\"category\",\"tooltip\":{},\"isStacked\":false},\"state\":{},\"view\":{},\"chartType\":\"BarChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart 1\"} </td>\r\n            <td> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0At1Rk6Y4HaPodG9XbWFqRTItNGs1RjNQM1FzUEVEX0E&transpose=0&headers=1&range=C5%3AD8&gid=0&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"logScale\":false,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"logScale\":false,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null}],\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"12\"},\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"title\":\"Bounce Rate\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"legend\":\"none\",\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":null,\"viewWindow\":null,\"maxValue\":null},\"tooltip\":{},\"isStacked\":false,\"width\":320,\"height\":200},\"state\":{},\"view\":{},\"chartType\":\"ColumnChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart 2\"} </td>\r\n        </tr>\n<tr>\n<td> {\"dataSourceUrl\":\"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0At1Rk6Y4HaPodG9XbWFqRTItNGs1RjNQM1FzUEVEX0E&transpose=0&headers=1&range=E5%3AF8&gid=0&pub=1\",\"options\":{\"titleTextStyle\":{\"bold\":true,\"color\":\"#000\",\"fontSize\":\"12\"},\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":null,\"viewWindow\":null,\"maxValue\":null},{\"useFormatFromData\":true}],\"title\":\"New Visits\",\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"height\":200,\"animation\":{\"duration\":500},\"legend\":\"none\",\"width\":320,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindowMode\":\"pretty\",\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},\"isStacked\":false,\"tooltip\":{}},\"state\":{},\"view\":{},\"chartType\":\"BarChart\",\"chartName\":\"Chart 3\"} </td>\r\n        </tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Taking things a step further, let’s breakdown some more interesting discoveries related to Europeana and social media:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Almost half of Europeana’s social media traffic is from Facebook.</li>\r\n    <li>Overall, the United States is Europeana’s sixth most popular country for traffic, however for social media it's the biggest group, followed by Germany and France.</li>\r\n    <li>Almost 3% of visitors from social media were using a mobile device, slightly higher than the site average.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Apply What We’ve Learned to Your Project/Organisation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, create an advanced segment in Google Analytics for social media - <a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/segmenting-social-traffic-in-google-analytics\" target=\"_blank\">you can learn how to do that here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After segmenting your social media traffic, rather than measuring just quantity, take a closer look at your qualitative metrics and you’ll be surprised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go a step further, breakdown your traffic by each social media source and discover which one is working best for you.\_Social media is like baking, the more effort you put in, the greater the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re really interested in hearing your experiences when it comes to all things social media. We understand that it works for some, while for others it doesn’t – but what is important is that we track, measure and share this information within the Europeana Network. I'm currently in the process of setting up Europeana's End-User Research Workgroup, so any information will be used to help expand our knowledge of Europeana end-users and users of digitised cultural heritage in general. I'm also open to hearing any suggestions you might have for collaborations on social media, our channels are open to our partners and we want to work with you in reaching more users outside of the portal.

        title: 'Europeana Inside: Culture is a Right'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Nick Poole, chair of the Europeana Network, and CEO of <a href=\"http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/\">Collections Trust</a>, recently addressed the Europeana Inside partners meeting via video. In this inspiring address, he explains the vision of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-inside/home\">Europeana Inside</a>, its transformational potential for all cultural institutions and how it motivates him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'I've been living with this idea for nearly ten years now. It is fantastic to see it coming to fruition,' says Nick. 'It's a very simple idea. It's also a very powerful idea. Culture is a right, it's a fundamental right that every child is born with - the right to access, to enjoy, to be amazed by, to learn from and to discover the cultures that went before them that created the society that they're in today. It's a right that's at risk of being eroded in the digital age as our sector struggles to make the transition from physical to digital.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9Fw3EPJ7tNc\" width=\"420\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Watch the video </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick goes on to say that Europeana Inside is a project that at heart is about the 'digital transformation of the culture sector.' He says that the project has two key advantages that will help to overcome the technology, copyright and cost barriers to transformation. First, it has 'a network of people that have immense technical knowledge' and who have a 'real understanding of how to build systems that are fluid, responsive, agile.' And second, the project has the capability to reach nearly 20,000 institutions across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary objective of Europeana Inside is to support the Digital Agenda for Europe by achieving a lasting transformation in the quantity, scope and usability of the content available to Europeana from European cultural institutions by reducing or removing the operational, legal, technical and financial barriers to participation. It will lead to a specific increase in content to Europeana of more than 960,000 new records from 15 cultural institutions and 5 national and thematic aggregators in the EU. It will also open up the potential for more than 7,000 other cultural institutions to deliver content to Europeana simply and easily in the future – a potential contribution of more than 30 million new records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick continues, 'We need to make Europeana Inside as invisible, as comfortable, as opaque as possible to even the most non-technical of users. Put simply, opening up your collections to future generations has to become as simple as pressing a button.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the capability to reach so many institutions across Europe, Europeana Inside is about 'taking a great leap forward, doing something genuinely transformative to enable access to culture for current and for future generations.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Got an opinion on Nick's video? Leave a comment below.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'At a Glance: Europeana Awareness PR Campaigns'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a> is an important element of Europeana, involving 48 partners across 30 countries. Its chief aim is to publicise and promote Europeana by developing new partnerships and distribution channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Awareness aims to run PR (public relations) campaigns in all 30 countries over three years. These campaigns can stand alone or be linked to others. They can be unique or repeat a topic used in another campaign, as appropriate for each country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several countries have so far chosen to link in with the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918 project</a> and run family history roadshows related to World War One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This blog provides a brief insight into some of the behind-the-scenes work needed to put on a family history roadshow, taking the next event – Banbury, UK, 3 November - as an example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/banbury%20poster.png\" style=\"width: 434px; height: 605px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Promotional poster for Banbury Family History Roadshow</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Banbury roadshow is part of a wider range of events organised by the <a href=\"http://www.sofo.org.uk/\">Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum</a> to commemorate World War One, including a school event giving pupils the opportunity to explore WW1 collections, talk to historians and bring in their families’ objects, and events for the elderly at care homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny, European Campaign Manager for Europeana, leads all of the campaigns, working with Europeana Office colleagues and a range of partners. Some partners have worked on roadshows before (<a href=\"http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/\">Oxford University</a>, <a href=\"http://www.factsandfiles.com/\">Facts &amp; Files</a>), others are specific to UK roadshows (<a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jisc.ac.uk/\">JISC</a>), while others are only involved in the Banbury roadshow (<a href=\"http://www.cherwell.gov.uk/museum/index.cfm?articleid=5758\">Banbury Museum</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cherwell.gov.uk/\">Cherwell Council</a>). \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s a lot of partners, organisations and people to keep in the loop. To keep things running smoothly, it’s important to keep communications open and clear, and for tasks and responsibilities to be well-defined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the campaign process, we must keep in mind the key goal of raising awareness of Europeana. As a measure of this, we record all press mentions of the campaign in a document which will ultimately form part of the project’s official report to the European Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emphasis on press coverage must, however, be balanced with the other main goal of the roadshow – recording family stories of WW1. For the people bringing their objects to the event, telling their families’ personal stories to strangers can be an emotional experience and so must be managed respectfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Dublin%20roadshow%20(2).jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Waiting area at the Dublin Family History Roadshow</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many tasks are repeated from one roadshow to the next, and indeed are transferable to other types of events and campaigns. As a result, we’ve established procedures and materials for many activities, a key example being the important training days for technical staff who digitise material on the day. Other examples from a communications point of view include:<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Choosing and briefing a PR agency.<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Designing and printing promotional collateral using a template tailored for the particular location.<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Identifying, photographing and writing up local case studies for promotion. (Read Banbury case studies at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">europeana1914-1918.eu</a>.)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Producing and circulating strategic press plans, idenitifying key messages and objectives.<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Preparing and distributing press releases to all local media to achieve coverage encouraging the public to attend. (Read the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=1339170&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">Banbury press release</a> and a selection of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-mentions\">resulting coverage</a>.)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Holding a press launch 1-2 weeks before the event. Print, radio and TV journalists are provided with a wealth of information, including promotional material, press releases, case studies and broadcast-quality film.<br>\r\n•\_\_\_ Using and encouraging partners to use social media to promote the event and key messages. (Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40europeana1914&amp;src=typd\">@Europeana1914</a> on Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/en\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/I-Chloe%20Coules%20with%20medals%20and%20badge.jpg\" style=\"width: 299px; height: 448px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Chloe Coules' story was chosen as a case study for the Banbury Family History Roadshow. Here, she holds WW1 medals and a cap badge belonging to her great-great-grandfathers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the day of the roadshow, all partners are on hand to play their part, whether it’s recording people’s oral stories, digitising their objects, or managing the photographers and TV crews there to record the day. If the previous media work has gone well, there will be a queue of people waiting at the door but until the day itself, we can never really know what the response will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, with a target of 30 campaigns over three years, we’re not just dealing with one event at a time, and that is where Europeana Awareness as a best-practice network comes in. At meetings like the WP1 meeting in Berlin on 26 November, partners in similar roles in different countries come together and learn from the experiences that have gone before, sharing ideas, documentation and lessons learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The promotion and results of the WW1 family\_ history roadshows benefit not only Europeana Awareness and Europeana 1914-1918, but also other related WW1 projects <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a> and <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\">European Film Gateway 1914</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what’s the real key to achieving success in a Europeana Awareness PR campaign? It has to be team work. Thank you to those who have worked with us so far, we couldn’t do it without you.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Last week, I blogged about the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-new-portal-and-infrastructure/\" title=\"Link to the blog post about Europeana's new technical infrastructure\">new technical infrastructure for Europeana</a>. A central piece of that infrastructure is a <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api-introduction.html\" title=\"Link to the introduction page for the new Europeana API\">new Europeana API</a> which we are releasing for testing today. As with the portal, we expect the test period to last for about 6-8 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Europeana already has an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">API</a> you say? That's true and that API will continue to function just as before for at least 12 months after the new API goes into formal production, but should be considered as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to the Wikipedia article about software deprecation\">deprecated</a>\_from the moment the new API goes into production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api-introduction.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/api%20home.png\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 417px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new API we're now previewing differs from the old one in some crucial aspects:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can 'try before you buy' by using our <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api/console.html\" title=\"Link to the Europeana API console\">API console</a>\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n<li>More traditional documentation coming soon!</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>And when you've decided you want to use it, you can <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api/registration.html\" title=\"Link to the registration page for the new Europeana API\">sign up for an API-key</a> (or two or three, or as many as you like) and receive them immediately</li>\r\n    <li>When you try out the new API, you'll notice that it returns metadata compliant with the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\" title=\"Link to the Europeana Data Model documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>And that it has more functionalities like for example, returning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search\">facets</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocompletion\">autocompletions</a> and similar items as part of its responses</li>\r\n    <li>The new API also has better tools for our management of it with improved security, the possibility to\_<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting\">rate limit</a> the number of calls, and improved logging of its use.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api/console.html\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/api%20console.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 405px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of the new API preview console</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, the new API and our recently updated <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/rights/api-terms-of-use.html\" title=\"Link to the Europeana API Terms of Use\">API Terms of Use</a> will give all developers and partners using our API a superior and future-proofed product to work with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned above, we will run <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/api-introduction.html\">this preview version of the API </a>for 6-8 weeks before we formally release and begin versioning it.\_During the preview period, we'll be using our <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#%21forum/europeanaapi\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to the Europeana API Forum\">API mailing list</a> as a forum for developers to ask questions, report issues and request feature changes.

        title: 'EUscreen Celebrates Television History'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>As the <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a> project draws to a close, in a special extended blog post Erwin Verbruggen tells us about its achievements and how work will continue once the project is over. All at Europeana would like to give a huge congratulations to everyone involved in EUscreen on their recent Lovie Award for Television – don’t forget to vote for them in the People’s Lovie Award category too!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\n<a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a> started in 2009 in an effort to enable users from varying backgrounds to explore Europe's television heritage through an attractive portal. This focus on user studies and design has been well rewarded: the EUscreen website received a Silver award for 'Television' in the second annual <a href=\"http://lovieawards.eu/\">Lovie Awards</a>, the only pan-European award to honour the entire breadth of content created for the internet, and the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.webbyawards.com/\">Webby Awards</a>' European sister. This is an unparalleled honour. The site was chosen by the expert members of the <a href=\"http://lovieawards.eu/judging-process/\">International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences</a> (IADAS) from nearly 1,000 entries from over 20 countries in Europe.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Over the past three years, EUscreen has worked on an effort never seen before: 40,000 items - fragments, full programmes, documents and photographs from a wide array of European broadcasters - have been made available freely online, with extensive metadata in two languages, on a multilingual, sleekly designed platform. The main motivation for the initiative is to provide unified access to a representative collection of television programmes, secondary sources and articles, and in this way to allow students, scholars and the general public to study the history of television in its wider context.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/3d461ac0-f772-48ec-b232-d83d571ba50f\"><img alt=\"EUscreen portal\" src=\"/files/blogimages/EUscreen%20portal2.jpg\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 354px;\">\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connectedness: Linked Open Data</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Galleries, libraries, archives and museums across the world are beginning to explore the added value of sharing data resources following something called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data\">Linked Open Data</a> (LOD) principles.\_Linked Data aim to make data accessible not only to humans but also to machines and software agents. It builds a layer that enables automatic links between different signifiers (for example a director, or an event such as a specific football match) to improve and enrich their interaction.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In 2012, EUscreen launched its <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/?page_id=3119\">Linked Open Data Pilot</a>, based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of the data, and structured it using the <a href=\"http://tech.ebu.ch/lang/en/MetadataEbuCore\">EBU Core</a> ontology. The aim of the pilot is to demonstrate the added value of adhering to LOD standards in the cultural heritage domain. The data, made available under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0</a> declaration, served by <a href=\"http://lod.euscreen.eu/resource\">lod.euscreen.eu/resource</a> is generated from the metadata EUscreen has harvested using the <a href=\"http://mint.image.ece.ntua.gr/redmine/projects/mint/wiki/Introduction\">MINT</a> ingestion platform.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>In addition to the original data harvested by EUscreen from its data providers, the data served at <a href=\"http://lod.euscreen.eu/resource\">lod.euscreen.eu/resource</a> includes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>internal links to other videos that are also served by <a href=\"http://lod.euscreen.eu/resource/\">lod.euscreen.eu/resource/</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>semantic enrichment done by <a href=\"http://www.ntua.gr/index_en.html\">NTUA</a>, connecting EUscreen videos to structured representations of places and languages.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<div>In particular, EUscreen content has been enriched by its linking to external data sources like the <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org/About\">DBpedia</a>, <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/\">Eurostat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.freebase.com/\">Freebase</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\">NY Times</a> allowing for more expressive search and retrieval.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Entry Points: Virtual Exhibitions</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>The design and implementation of a range of <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html\">EUscreen Virtual Exhibitions</a> has been ongoing since summer 2011, led by <a href=\"http://www.noterik.nl/\">Noterik</a> and <a href=\"http://arts.aalto.fi/en/\">Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture</a>. The tools designed for these exhibitions allow for the insertion of multimedia materials from all the project's content providers and links back to the original items on the site, where users can find out more about them, share the links or get in touch with the providers themselves.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"EUscreen exhibitions\" src=\"/files/blogimages/EUscreen%20exhibitions.png\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 338px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Workshops have played an important part in designing the exhibition tools. Programmers and interface designers have worked hands-on in close collaboration with the scholars who curated the first exhibitions. This collaboration and further testing and feedback from EUscreen content providers has enabled\_ a range of needs and perspectives regarding audiovisual storytelling to be taken into account.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>As a result, we developed an Exhibition Builder tool, which provides a WYSIWYG style interface for creating online exhibitions. With this tool, it is possible to select different layouts, add media from EUscreen, and enrich it further with, for example, texts and links to external websites as well as direct links to parts of videos.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Examples of EUscreen's virtual exhibitions include: a journey through French broadcasting history; an exploration of Dutch architecture; and the role of women in sport in Sweden. As well as these individually curated exhibitions, a range of exhibitions draw upon material provided by all EUscreen project contributors to showcase topics like fashion, food, culture and religion.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creative Re-use: Open Video</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The second EUscreen conference focused on <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/?page_id=1901\">Re-use and Creativity</a>. A significant milestone related to this topic is the production of an <a href=\"http://euscreen.openimages.eu/\">Open EUscreen portal</a>, which advances the work on re-use executed in the project. Thanks to the enthusiastic responses from some partners, we've been able to develop and advance a separate EUscreen platform on <a href=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/\">Open Images</a>. This is an open media platform that offers online access to audiovisual archive material to stimulate creative re-use. Footage from audiovisual collections can be downloaded and remixed into new works. Open Images also provides an API, making it easy to develop mashups. The 'open' nature of the platform is underscored by the use of open video formats (Ogg Theora), open standards (HTML5, OAI-PMH) and open source software components. Furthermore, all software that is developed within the scope of Open Images will also be released under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\">GNU General Public Licence</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site will be up at<a href=\"http://euscreen.openimages.eu/\"> http://euscreen.openimages.eu</a> to coincide with this week's <a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/events\">Open Access Week</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Research and Display: Open Access Journal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUscreen project and the European Television History Network are the birthplace of <em>VIEW</em>, the open access <a href=\"http://journal.euscreen.eu/index.php/jethc\">Journal of European Television History and Culture</a>. It is the first peer-reviewed, multimedia and open access e-journal in the field of European television history and culture. It offers an international platform for outstanding academic research and archival reflection on television as an important part of our European cultural heritage. With its interdisciplinary profile, the journal is open to many cross-disciplinary perspectives on European television\_ including television history, media studies, media sociology, cultural studies and television studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first issue of the Journal of European Television History and Culture, <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/?p=2647\">published in March 2012</a>, followed up on the central theme of the <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/?page_id=839\">first EUscreen conference</a> held in Rome in October 2010 and explicitly addressed the challenges of contextualising television material online. The second issue will come out at the end of this month and discuss 'Europe on and behind the screens'. What's more, you can view\_ the multimedia elements discussed within the online articles.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future Work</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>In relation to the virtual exhibitions, future work will be focused on:\r\n<ul>\n<li>Exception-based IPR: allowing content owners to set the rights of re-use in flexible ways per collection, per video or even per parts of videos.</li>\r\n    <li>Content-based editing: this is a process by which videos are edited based not on time but by adding time-based entity information and concepts. This means it would be possible to shift editing from the moment of production to the moment of viewing/consuming, allowing for multiple montages that all still reflect the wishes/intent of the creators.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We anticipate these alternative item discovery methodologies will attract new user-groups to engage with the rich body of content offered by the archives represented in the EUscreen consortium.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vote for EUscreen!</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>The EUscreen portal is still in the running for the People's Lovie Award, so head to <a href=\"https://www.peopleslovie.eu/#television-0\">http://www.peopleslovie.eu</a> to vote for us!</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Or visit <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html\">www.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html</a> to explore more than 20 online exhibitions.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>Expect the latest series of exhibitions to be released on Saturday when, one year after launching the EUscreen portal, archives worldwide <a href=\"http://www.iasa-web.org/world-day-audiovisual-heritage\">celebrate their audiovisual heritage</a> as part of the UNESCO World Day for Audiovisual Heritage.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Glossary</strong></div>\r\n\r\n<div>\n<br>\r\nCC0 – Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.

        title: 'Europeana - New Portal and Infrastructure'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Today, we are pleased to launch the preview of the new Europeana technical infrastructure. This preview will last for about 6-8 weeks as we stabilise and optimise the technology and models behind it. We'll keep the current Europeana infrastructure going during this time in order to provide full redundancy. The most visible part of this new infrastructure is, of course, the <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu\" title=\"Link to the Europeana preview portal\">portal</a>, but in truth, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"New portal preview\" src=\"/files/blogimages/new%20portal%20preview.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 311px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new infrastructure comprises three main components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>An updated United Ingestion Manager which uses the MINT-tool for mapping original metadata to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\" title=\"Link to the Europeana Professional pages about EDM\">Europeana Data Model (EDM).</a>\n</li>\r\n    <li>A new core system with components for storage and indexing; and a new API that uses this new storage/indexing model.</li>\r\n    <li>A new mobile and tablet-friendly portal serving metadata modelled in EDM.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>In this blog, I'll focus on providing some more detail about the new portal. We'll return to the other components in future blog posts. Look out for a blog about the new API very soon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are basically two principles that underpin the new design: \_<em>1.\_Treat all users the same</em> and \_<em>2.\_Show don't tell.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Treat all users the same</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the current Europeana portal, users of mobile phones are directed to a mobile-specific version of the portal, in which functionality is limited. For example, a mobile user can't filter search results via facets or see all the metadata for the items they're looking at. The new portal is developed according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link to the Wikipedia article about responsive design\">responsive design</a> methodology where a fluid grid and media queries adapt the layout and media size to devices with differently sized screens. The content and functionality, though, stays the same and so all users, irrespective of device, are able to access all the metadata for all items and have access to all functionalities.\_Note also that all image carousels and slide-shows will respond to swipe control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Show don't tell</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In our latest\_ update of the portal design (October 2011), we made the user interface more visual. We started <em>showing</em> with images rather than just <em>telling</em> with links. This has proved to be successful and so we're further reinforcing that success in the new portal. One example is that featured exhibitions, blog posts, items and partners on the landing page are displayed with a combination of images and text. Indeed, the <em>Featured Partner</em> component is entirely new and we hope it will help our users discover collections and Europeana Network members they didn't know they were missing!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of <em>Show don't tell</em> is that in the <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/record//15502/538B7E1B2B4577D7B546FC81257363E773D1758E.html?start=12&amp;query=who%3Ad%C3%BCrer&amp;qf=TYPE:IMAGE&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\" title=\"Link to the object display of Dürer's Young Venetian Woman\">object display of the new portal</a> we show similar items and canned search links (the auto-suggested 'Search also for' links) more prominently in order to encourage the user to explore the content further.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Did I mention EDM?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned at the start of this post, the portal is just the tip of the iceberg. Under the hood, the metadata it displays is now modelled in EDM. To have a peek at the underlying metadata just add '&amp;format=labels' to the end of any portal URL and <a href=\"http://preview.europeana.eu/portal2/record//15502/538B7E1B2B4577D7B546FC81257363E773D1758E.html?start=12&amp;query=who%3Ad%C3%BCrer&amp;qf=TYPE:IMAGE&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24&amp;format=labels\" title=\"Object display with metadata visible for Dürer's Young Venetian Woman\">voilà</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the preview period, we will regularly request feedback from all our users. Don't hesitate to give us yours! More information on our <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2012/10/preview-europeanas-new-portal/\">end-user blog</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'User Engagement and the Distribution of Culture'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>How has the digital revolution affected the distribution of culture? Geer Oskam, Europeana Senior Marketing Specialist, reflects on this question and tells us about some of Europeana's user engagement practices. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last week I was in Stockholm where I attended the <a href=\"http://www.fabel.se/trulydigital/%20\"><em>Truly Digital</em></a> conference, a Scandinavian conference looking at how to build a ‘Nordic Ecosystem for the Arts’. The gathering in Stockholm was the first in a series of four seminars to get an answer to the question ‘How can we use the resources of the current digital landscape to improve the infrastructure?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nordic countries have a longstanding tradition of cooperation; together they have a strong infrastructure of public and semi-public cultural institutions. The rapidly expanding worldwide web is the starting point for a discussion about the digital landscape and the possibilities for new ways of distribution of digital heritage and (digital) audience involvement.<br><br>\r\nIt’s difficult to sum up in just a few words exactly how the digital revolution has affected the distribution of culture. One thing is certain - we are all affected by it. Europeana has shown that big things can be possible if we join arms. The<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=1284453&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\"> CC0 release of Europeana metadata</a> is a big turning point in free digitised cultural heritage; it shows the power of cultural institutions working together in a similar format. The speed at which the web is developing causes difficulties for many institutions: what might be useful today is outdated next year. Therefore it's very important to think beyond individual projects and to find out where possible partners are and to let yourself be informed about where new online developments are heading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/calculator.png\" style=\"width: 504px; height: 324px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Technology changes quickly. This is <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/91989/7AE340149E1AAC71B8F752DA67759341F9CAB95D.html\">Calculadora</a>, a calculating machine from Sweden that in its time in the 1960s was 'one of the latest models of mechanical calculator'. Image from <span class=\"notranslate\">Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya, CC-BY-NC-ND.</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of institutions are hesitant about making their content available for just anyone. Very understandable since this is a big change from being a ‘controlled’ database. But what should you do if you have cleared the topic of opening up your data, and you want as many people to interact with your collection as possible? The magic word right now seems to be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\">API</a> (Application Programming Interface).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has a free <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api-implementation\">Europeana API key</a>, available for anyone. With the Europeana API key you can create an access point to the Europeana database, for example, by implementing it on your website to enrich users' search results. But you can also use the Europeana API to start developing specific mobile applications. <a href=\"http://www.pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/hackathon-prototypes\">Hackathons</a> that Europeana has organised show you many of these ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An even deeper form of interaction with cultural institutions' content is through end-user engagement. A fairly new concept that is difficult to put a finger on as it requires knowledge about user groups and multiple social media platforms. At Europeana, it is our goal to create a repository of user engagement concepts for our partners to get inspired by, or to learn what to do and what not to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example of a user engagement concept is our presence on <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/\">Pinterest</a>. We came up with four bullets points that should form the pillar of a user engagement concept: a target group, a theme or collection from our database, a partner and a certain existing online platform. At Pinterest we created a board together with the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/the-black-sea-coast-by-the-varna-public-library/\">Varna Public Library</a> (see image).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Pinterest%20Black%20Sea%20Coast%20board.png\" style=\"width: 504px; height: 366px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we share very visual content with our followers and ask them to interact by, for example, commenting on or re-pinning the images. One of the surprising results that we found out is that users coming from Pinterest to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana.eu</a> look at more pages and stay longer on our website than users from Facebook or Twitter. So, if you are building your presence online this is an audience worthwhile tapping into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After last week's seminar in Stockholm, I am once again convinced that it is not only key to talk about web trends and share knowledge but also to just start doing. You will probably make some mistakes (presenting the wrong content for the wrong online audience), and yes, entering new territory might be ‘scary’ but the only thing you are certain of when you don’t participate is that you won't be seen. So, apart from talking, let's start doing, and sharing!<br>\r\n\_</p>"

        title: 'Creating 3D Content for Europeana - a Big Challenge'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>In today's guest blog, Sheena Bassett celebrates the inclusion of new 3D models in Europeana, and explains some of the hard work the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/carare/home\">CARARE project</a> has undertaken to make this happen. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>CARARE supplies a wealth of digital content relating to archaeology and architecture <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=carare&amp;qf=PROVIDER:CARARE\">to Europeana</a>.\_ This includes images of monuments and sites, maps, objects such as ceramics and art works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big challenge is to supply <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=TYPE:3D\">3D models</a> which meet the Europeana requirements. 3D models are widely used in cultural heritage to create accurate records of individual monuments and buildings as well as complete sites. They are an increasingly valuable tool for research purposes, for example, to test out theories (it's much easier to move or add something in a 3D model than in real life!) and make comparisons between objects to see if they are related. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we know that 3D models are also of great interest to the public - just look at 3D gaming. Cultural heritage organisations find that 3D models help people visualise the past and appreciate the historical significance of their curated objects and sites. A fascinating 3D model recreates a complete site with all the buildings, monuments and everyday objects that in real life may be scattered all over the world in various cities and museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These lovely models can be created in many ways, using and combining technologies such as laser scanning and photogrammetry and with many different software applications. Their final size can be huge - in the Gigabyte range.\_ So, the (big) challenge is how to transform very large files in multiple formats to a much smaller user-friendly item that doesn't require specialist software of a plug-in to view it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CARARE chose <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/3dpdfsamples/3dsolutions/\">3D PDF</a> because it is stable, allows for the transformation of most of the more commonly used 3D formats and also enables text to be combined with the embedded model. It just requires a PDF reader (Acrobat 7 onwards) for viewing. A number of the CARARE partners have been transforming their existing 3D models into 3D PDF and the first of these (from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=CETI%20&amp;qf=TYPE:3D\">Cultural and Educational Technology Institute (CETI) in Greece</a>) have just appeared in Europeana. More in the pipeline include several models from the Civil Forum of Pompeii, the Hypogeum and temples from Malta, Iberian ceramics and buildings and monuments from Greece. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020703/05607B24D15BD516EE2B765F74CDA39C7427F7FB.html\"> now available in Europeana </a>from CETI is the <a href=\"http://www.ceti.gr/carare/CETI_BCK_20_EN.pdf\">Castle of Kavala</a> (26 MB), part of the defensive 'wall' of the Byzantine Empire designed to protect the capital, Constantinople (Istanbul).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"The Castle of Kavala\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Kavala.jpg\" style=\"width: 470px; height: 353px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Castle of Kavala, <span class=\"notranslate\">Cultural and Educational Technology Institute - Research Centre Athena</span>, CC-BY-NC-ND</em> <a class=\"external-services toggle-menu-icon\" href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/action/siwa/record/2020703/05607B24D15BD516EE2B765F74CDA39C7427F7FB.html?field=europeana%3AdataProvider&amp;value=Cultural+and+Educational+Technology+Institute+-+Research+Centre+Athena\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to search for this term in external services\"> </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Castle of Kavala or 'Fortress', as the locals call it, is located on the peninsula of Panagia (Virgin Mary) in the area of Macedonia and Thrace. The outer walls surround the peninsula by following the coastline on three sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other examples of 3D PDFS can also be viewed on the CARARE website on the <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/eng/Resources/3D-Virtual-Reality\">3D/Virtual Reality </a>page.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry\">Photogrammetry</a> - the practice of determining the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry\" title=\"Geometry\">geometric</a> properties of objects from photographic images</p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On Wednesday, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-business-plan-2013-%E2%80%93-distribute-and-engage-workshops\">Europeana Professional blog</a> reported on the first two of four interactive Business Plan Workshops that were held at the Europeana Offices in the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) in The Hague from 25-28 September.\_ Today’s blog looks at what happened at the final two workshops: Facilitate and Aggregate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 335px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Day Three: Facilitate</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s strategic ambition for Facilitation is to ‘Support the cultural heritage sector through knowledge transfer, innovation and advocacy’.<br><br>\r\nThe topic for this workshop was: ‘What are the most important priorities in terms of positioning Europeana as the Network facilitator?’<br><br>\r\nTo explore this, the group discussed some of the topics that are currently on the horizon for the Facilitation track: Network positioning, sustainability, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/search?p_p_id=3&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;_3_struts_action=%2fsearch%2fsearch&amp;_3_keywords=%22European%20cultural%20commons%22\">Cultural Commons</a>, interoperability and rights labelling, business models and legal framework for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing\">Cloud </a>development and knowledge transfer. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/2.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 389px;\">\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSome reflections from the group:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘The questions that we need to ask ourselves are: What happens when we stop investing in Facilitation? What opportunities do we miss?’ </em><br>\r\nErwin Verbruggen (Netherlands Sound and Vision Institute)<br><br><em>‘Ownership and labor need to be shared with the Network. This will transform an office of 30 into a movement of over 500.’ </em><br>\r\nNick Poole (Collections Trust)<br><br><em>‘In light of the current recession it will become even more important to pool resources to cut costs. This notion is important to underpin Europeana’s position as a Core Services Platform.’ </em><br>\r\nFrederic Herrera (www.protonlabs.co)<br><br><em>‘Knowledge exchange should be about the ‘Why, What and How’. This calls for very concrete actions and examples.’ </em><br>\r\nMarco Streefkerk (DEN Foundation)<br><br>\r\nThe group suggested amongst other things, that the ‘big picture’ needs to start to become more concrete, as does the scope of the Cultural Commons, and that metrics for success should be defined. The Europeana Foundation should continue with the ‘practical stuff’ and produce clear case studies of its value, and continue to build trust by encouraging mutuality. On the legal side, all metadata needs correct rights labeling, the legal framework should be developed to accommodate content and the Cloud, and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model </a>(EDM) should be promoted as a standard. The group suggested that <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/linked-open-data\">Europeana Linked Open Data</a> could be made interoperable with <a href=\"http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html\">Google Knowledge Graph.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/3.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day Four: Aggregate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s strategic ambition for Aggregation is to ‘build the open trusted source for European cultural heritage content.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question discussed at this workshop was: ‘How can we improve the quality of Europeana metadata?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/4.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 372px;\"><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group discussed specific aspects of metadata improvement. Reflections included acknowledgement that the support of the partner network is crucial in the endeavour to improve metadata. Therefore Europeana needs to continue to support the aggregator infrastructure with tools, training and information. Workshops on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> would be useful as would more documentation about rights labelling. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">Europeana Inside</a> project will be key as it is developing a connection kit and management tools. Further support and resources would be beneficial for both the <a href=\"http://mint.image.ece.ntua.gr/redmine/projects/mint/wiki/Introduction\">Mint </a>metadata-mapping tool and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech/-/wiki/Main/Task+Forces\">Persistent Identifiers</a> work. In 2013 we will focus specifically on improving some of the more critical metadata fields such as rights/location/time and the lack of previews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/5.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 392px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><em>‘We could re-use a lot of the tools, platforms and standards that already exist to lower the investment costs.’ </em><br>\r\nWorkshop contributor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is proposed that an Aggregator Forum be established to enable aggregators on both domain and country levels to share best practices. This forum would be able to support many of the recommendations made by the workshop group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank everyone who attended and contributed to these workshops. They were inspiring and incredibly useful. We look forward to continuing the conversation online and offline in the coming weeks.<br>\r\n\_</p>"

We want our partners to know that both our focused Network and extensive end-user followings are at their disposal through these channels.<br><br>\r\nWe encourage our partners to submit posts, updates, images, events or stories via email: <a href=\"mailto:marcomms@europeana.eu?subject=Guest%20blog%20post%20or%20social%20media%20entry\">marcomms@europeana.eu</a>. The <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/editorial-calendar/\">editorial calendar</a> is a reference point to see what is planned and how your editorial submission can fit in. Perhaps there is a blogpost planned that is linked with one of your collections or events - presenting an opportunity for you to be featured within existing plans. Alternatively, seek out available days and explore when you would like your blogpost or social media update to be posted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that your increased editorial involvement through our end-user and Europeana Network channels will result in greater user engagement and increased social media sharing, and will boost cross-promotion efforts between Europeana and partners.

        title: 'Europeana Business Plan 2013 – Distribute and Engage Workshops'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Four interactive Business Plan Workshops were held at the Europeana Offices in the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) in The Hague from 25-28 September.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partners and Network members, representing a wide range of roles, organisations and countries, were invited to share their ideas and priorities for the coming year. Each workshop focused on a strand of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/search?p_p_auth=O4B0MoR8&amp;p_p_id=20&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=exclusive&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_20_struts_action=%2Fdocument_library%2Fget_file&amp;_20_groupId=10602&amp;_20_folderId=370691&amp;_20_name=13464\">Europeana’s Strategic Plan</a> - Aggregate, Facilitate, Distribute, Engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop conclusions will be further discussed with the participants, Europeana Network Officers and the Europeana Network at the <a href=\"http://agm2012-berlin.eventbrite.com/#\">Annual General Meeting</a> in Berlin on November 27 and will feed into the Europeana Business Plan for 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s blog looks at what happened at the first two workshops: Distribute and Engage.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Breandan Knowlton\" src=\"/files/blogimages/1_1_Breandan.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day One: Distribute</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s strategic ambition for Distribution is to ‘make digital cultural heritage available to users, wherever they are’. With the release of the data under CC0 Public Domain waiver, we are now in a much better position to achieve this aim, but this is only a starting point.<br><br>\r\nThe topic for this workshop was: ‘How to build an \"eco-system for distribution\" that capitalises on the opportunities of open data, together with the partner network’. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To explore this, the group discussed their associations with and recommendations for the following channels: the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana portal</a>, <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/\">virtual exhibitions</a>, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana\_ API</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">widgets</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/\">Wikipedia</a>, social media marketing and the Thematic Channels project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/2_1.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 371px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSome reflections on the workshop from attendees were:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Europeana should be the incubator, where the great ideas are developed.'<br>\r\nLizzy Jongma (Rijksmuseum)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'The API is the skeleton of the eco-system. It is a push for creativity and we evolve with the alteration of this tool.'<br>\r\nGhislain Guillaume (CVCE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Widgets mean power to small institutions. They are a good way to improve their websites.'<br>\r\nMarco Rendina (FRD)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Wikipedia is a fast moving train.\_ Libraries, museums, archives should move with this train and not try to stop it.'<br>\r\nChristopher Natzen (National Library of Sweden)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group reflected that it would like Europeana to focus more time on becoming a strong ‘enabler’ than on reaching end-users directly. This would make the API crucial and the developer community a target market. It was also suggested that the partner network be empowered to use widgets, social media and virtual exhibitions and that a way of reporting object usage statistics would be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Day Two: Engage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s strategic ambition for Engagement is ‘to cultivate new ways for users to participate in their cultural heritage’ and ‘to broker new relationship between curators, content and users’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop addressed the question: ‘What should Europeana do to encourage end-user participation?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/3_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A discussion focused on ideas for stimulating further user participation with the following engagement tools: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">1914-1918 Collection Days</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/hackathons\">hackathons</a>, Wiki editathons, <a href=\"http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/\">Wiki Loves Monuments </a>photo contests, the <a href=\"http://remix.europeana.eu/\">Europeana HTML5 Popcorn Remix</a>, a digital storytelling platform, the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/\">Pinterest</a> project and Europeana Thematic Channels.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/4_1.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nGroups were asked to assess the level of feasibility, required investment and potential positive impact of the concepts. New ideas were welcome in this session. Ultimately, a specially designed matrix was used to separate the concrete ideas from the not-so-feasible ones!<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/5_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 378px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe group suggested amongst other things, that Europeana should combine offline and online interactions, continue the Wikipedia and collaborative social media projects, combine different concepts and build on and develop concepts that have been successful in the past. Europeana could also think about how end-user participation is measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were two very inspiring days for us, and we look forward to continuing the conversation online and offline in the coming weeks.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.okfestival.org\">OKFest, </a> organised by the\_<a href=\"http://okfn.org\">Open Knowledge Foundation,</a> is the biggest open knowledge event in the world. More than 1,000 people participated in about 150 different sessions on the whole spectrum of issues related to openness and the digital commons. The <a href=\"http://www.openglam.org\">OpenGLAM initiative</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu\">DM2E</a> project, organised a 3-day topic stream dedicated to open cultural heritage data and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cultural Hackday</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Programmers, designers and curators joined forces at the cultural hackday to unlock the potential of Finnish cultural content and data that has been openly licensed. Representatives from the <a href=\"http://www.nationallibrary.fi/\">Finnish National Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.fng.fi/caa\">Central Art Archive</a> and the <a href=\"http://kallioarkisto.fi/en\">Kallio Archive</a> provided datasets and APIs. As did <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> who had just released the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_itemId=1284453&amp;_itemsindexportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_AtV7_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">data for more than 20 million cultural objects</a> under the Creative Commons public domain waiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers created prototypes including ArtMapp - a map of Helsinki enabling users to find and explore artworks by their characteristics. The team used Europeana <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu\">Linked Open Data</a> to enable users to search collections using semantic links. In practice, this means that a user searches for, for example, Leonardo da Vinci, and finds out that he was born in a small village, moved to Florence, and died in Amboise. The Linked Data component means they can also easily find other artists from that same period born in the same region. By clicking on the city on ArtMapp, other related objects appear and can be explored. The creators have built a <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/sirmmo/art-mapp\">series of slides</a> to further explain it, and all data can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/citizennerd/ArtMap\">GitHub</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"ArtMapp\" src=\"/files/blogimages/ArtMapp.png\" style=\"height: 291px; width: 499px;\"><br><sub>Artmapp by Rene Pare</sub></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video artists and VJs from Aalto University took cultural data from several open repositories and remixed it into a new piece of work. It was incredible to see what they were able to produce in just a few hours. For the video 'Horror in Kallio', a team of two used short videos about the streets of Helsinki from the Kallio Archive and added effects to create a an eery feeling. Then, through Europeana, they found high quality scans of owls and insects from an 18th century collection at the Rijksmuseum and animated them. Finally, they took horror sounds from the free sound archive <a href=\"http://www.jamendo.com/en/\">Jamendo</a> and combined it all into this video. For a full description about how they created the video, see <a href=\"http://avoinglam.fi/?p=199\">their blogpost.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/50084388?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff0179\" width=\"400\">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Building the Cultural Commons</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day of OKFestival, 25 leading open cultural data evangelists and professionals from the cultural sector met for a full day of hands-on meetings dedicated to building the cultural commons and the legal and technical challenges to openness in the cultural heritage space. Among them were representatives from Europeana, Wikimedia, Creative Commons, and several leading cultural institutions such as the <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/\">Danish National Gallery</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.si.edu/\">Smithsonian Institute</a>. Issues around open licensing, digitisation and developer outreach took centre stage. The outcomes of the meeting are currently being taken forward on the <a href=\"http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-glam\">OpenGLAM mailing list</a>, so if you'd like to join the discussion, do sign up.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>OpenGLAM Workshop</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana (<a href=\"http://dm2e.eu\">DM2E</a>) project, the Open Knowledge Foundation has been running a series of Open GLAM workshops across Europe aimed at helping cultural heritage institutuions address the technical and legal challenges to opening up their content and metadata. As part of OKFestival one such workshop was run with representatives from Finnish cultural heritage institutions. For a full summary of all the presentations <a href=\"http://openglam.org/2012/09/27/openglam-workshop-at-the-okfestival-2\">click here</a>. Participants were invited to create a roadmap for getting more Finnish cultural data openly licensed and into Europeana. A Finnish ‘<a href=\"http://www.avoinglam.fi\">AvoinGLAM</a>’ (avoin = open) working group was formed, dedicated to bringing more Finnish heritage into Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the week is over and everybody has got a chance to digest their experiences, it is time to get to action and create the cultural commons of the future! We look forward to reporting on our progress so keep your eyes peeled for updates on the <a href=\"http://openglam.org\">Open GLAM</a> blog.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europ.in - Would Your Grandmother Use It?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Last month, we told you we would soon be hearing from some of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/hackers-to-guest-blog-for-europeana\">Hack4Europe! 2012 winners</a>. Developers were given access to the Europeana API </em><em>at hackathons in Riga, Warsaw and Leuven in May-June this year</em><em> and had two days to create a marketable app.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>First to tell us about their app is guest blogger <strong>Uldis Bojars,</strong> who writes on behalf of the Riga winners. The team, who only decided to work together on the day of the hackathon, did some brainstorming and came up with 'Europ.in'. Here's their story…</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europ.in/about\">Europ.in</a> is a visually-engaging web application for exploring <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europ.In%20Opera%20search%20for%20problog%2002Oct12.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 308px;\"><br><em>Europ.in showing search results for 'Riga opera'. See it in the Europ.in app <a href=\"http://europ.in/search?q=R%C4%ABga+opera\">here</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application is search-based. Visitors enter a keyword and are presented with a stream of images from Europeana. The ‘infinite scroll’ approach sees new content appended to the page when the user scrolls to the bottom of it. This creates an impression that there is a never-ending stream of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The idea</strong><br><br>\r\nThe initial idea for Europ.in came from the popular image-sharing site <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>. When we looked at Europeana, we liked the interesting content but not the time it took to browse through pages of results.<br><br>\r\nOne of our team asked, 'How could we make something that my grandmother would use?' The result is an application in which people can view hundreds of images at once, then access a close-up view of an item's details, links to related items and sharing options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Europ.In Close-Up view of an 'Inro' search result\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europ.In%20close-up%20for%20pro%20blog%2002Oct12.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 315px;\"><br><em>Europ.in close-up view of an 'inro' search result. This one is 'Inro lotusbloemen en vogel', a public domain image from the Rijksmuseum. View it in Europeana <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/0F1995118D21BE4B665859843ADFDE5D9F55AD9D.html\">here</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br><br>\r\nEuropeana preview images come in a range of dimensions, resolutions and file sizes. One of our problems was that some images were too low resolution for our close-up view. Showing only the results of sufficient size discarded too many results and enlarging them resulted in blurry images that did not give justice to the originals. Now, the app displays all results but the size of the search results column has decreased to 150 pixels, so there is less blurring. Better solutions would be to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>have access to larger preview images on Europeana; or</li>\r\n    <li>for the app to look for larger, higher resolution images on the provider's own website (where digital object licences allow).</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We wanted to supply viewers with a steady stream of results whilst keeping image file sizes reasonably small for mobile devices. For larger previews, we used an image-resizing service to convert them and cache them for faster access next time.<br><br><strong>Metadata and image licensing</strong><br><br>\r\nWhat makes Europeana attractive to applications like Europ.in is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>a large amount of diverse content</li>\r\n    <li>adoption of the providing freely available and re-usable metadata</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The open re-use of metadata creates potential for new, innovative applications and is an important step towards openness. However, in the world where people increasingly expect content that is more visual and engaging than pure text, having free use of metadata may not be enough. As developers, we would like to see more open re-use of item previews. This would perhaps mean previews having a different, more open usage licence than the digital objects themselves.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>\r\nThe main future challenge for Europ.in is making the application more engaging and helping people discover interesting content. Some possible directions for improvement are: adding visual content to the main page; making additional images load even faster; and increasing awareness of the application. We would be glad to receive suggestions for improving Europ.in by email: uldis bojars (at) gmail.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Collage of Riga hackathon images\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Riga%20collage%20for%20pro%20blog%2002oct12.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 394px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>The Europ.In team at work at the Riga hackathon - images by Hack4Europe!

        title: 'I went to Wiki GLAM Camp'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Geer Oskam, Europeana Senior Marketing Specialist tells us what he got up to last weekend…</em><br><br>\r\nLast weekend, I went to a Wiki GLAM Camp! What that means is I went to London and sat down with a group of Wikipedians (people who write for Wikipedia) and representatives of GLAM institutions – that is Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums. We talked about collaborations between Wikimedia (providers of the largest online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia) and cultural institutions. The aim for both parties was to find out how to benefit from each other’s knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is getting more and more acquainted with the Wikimedia community. For the second year running, we are working together on the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2012/09/wiki-loves-monuments-submit-your-photos/\">Wiki Loves Monuments</a> photo contest. As part of the Europeana Awareness project, we are collaborating with the Wiki community even more this year. Together with the <a href=\"http://se.wikimedia.org/wiki/Projekt:Europeana_Awareness/English%20\">Wikimedia Sweden</a> Chapter, we are organising a series of events across Europe with the aim of making Wikipedians aware of the open data that Europeana has to offer.<br><br>\r\nWhy are we doing this? Just ask yourself: how often do I visit a Wikipedia page? And ask yourself: how often do I think internet users stop by at a Wikipedia page? Also, search for any subject on Google and what comes out as one of the first results? Correct, a Wikipedia page.<br><br>\r\nThese Wikipedia pages have a huge impact on the visibility of cultural heritage. Imagine what a page enriched with the correct data (image / text) can do for your institution and your collection.<br><br>\r\nSome cultural institutions already collaborate with Wikipedians, for example by creating a space for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/BM/Wikipedian_in_Residence\">Wikipedian-in-Residence</a>; but there are also many GLAM professionals who don’t yet know how they can get involved.<br><br>\r\nIf you’re interested in working with Wikipedia, I have good news - there is a special <a href=\"http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM-WIKI_2013\">GLAM-WIKI Conference</a> coming up.<br><br>\r\nThe GLAM-WIKI Conference 2013 will be held at the British Library in London on Friday 12 - Sunday 14 April 2013. This is the second conference in the series and brings professionals from GLAM institutions together with activists, volunteers and those interested in open content for the cultural sector, especially on Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation.<br><br>\r\nThe conference is organised by Wikimedia UK in association with Wikimedia Sweden and <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>, and hosted by the British Library. The cost to attendees will be low, especially for those from GLAM institutions and Wikimedia volunteers.<br><br>\r\nThe agenda will include sessions on open content initiatives, Wikimedia partnerships, practical workshops and the sharing of interests and best practices.<br><br>\r\nIf you are interested in attending the conference, would like to give a presentation or have some general inquiries, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:daria.cybulska@wikimedia.org.uk\">daria.cybulska@wikimedia.org.uk</a> or give her a call on +44 (0) 207 065 0994. Any other questions I am also happy to answer <a href=\"mailto:geer.oskam@kb.nl\">geer.oskam@kb.nl</a><br></p>"

        body: "<p>Two weeks ago, Europeana opened up its <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/press-releaseCC0\">huge cultural dataset for re-use</a> under the Creative Commons Zero Universal Public Domain Dedication. Now we can announce that datasets reflecting this change are available as 'data dumps' for re-use in Linked Open Data initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uju4wT9uBIA&amp;list=UU_Z8vHTU2qx4_qBIy9f_u0A&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"Linked Open Data screenshot\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Linked%20Open%20Data%20video%20screenshot.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 350px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>\_'Linked Open Data - What is it?'

(Non-techies, please feel free to share this blog with your technical teams!)<br><br>\r\nThe datasets are available to download at <a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/download/2.0/\">data.europeana.eu/download/2.0/</a><br><br>\r\nAn overview of the datasets is available in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsHgkgfrIiQ3dHRNaFpGeHVUNFJMazd6WkVEQ21NeHc#gid=0\">spreadsheet</a>. It is possible to preview a dataset in the Europeana portal by using the first numbers of its name followed by a wildcard: e.g. '<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_collectionName%3A+08602*\">europeana_collectionName: 08602*</a>' or '<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_collectionName%3A+03486*\">europeana_collectionName: 03486*</a>'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://data.europeana.eu/download/2.0/\" target=\"_self\"><img alt=\"Datasets download screenshot\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Datasets%20screenshot.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 268px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Screenshot of the dataset download page.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nYou'll see that the 'datasets' folder has two sub-folders, 'nt' and 'rdf'. These contain the files corresponding to each individual dataset, expressed using the N-Triples and RDF/XML syntaxes for RDF. In both datasets, the data model used is the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/tech-details\">Europeana Data Model </a>(EDM).<br><br>\r\nThe 'links' folder contains links to other <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/rights/linked-data-sources.html\">Linked Data sources</a>. These links are the results of the semantic enrichment done by Europeana. Co-reference links to Linked Data services maintained by Europeana partners (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.ksamsok.se/in-english/\">SOCH</a>, the Swedish cultural heritage aggregator) are also provided in this folder.<br><br><strong>Further development</strong><br><br>\r\nWe're also planning to offer access to these data sources via a SPARQL-endpoint. This work has just begun and we'll make an announcement when it is ready.<br><br>\r\nIn parallel to working with making Europeana metadata available for Linked Open Data initiatives, we're currently developing a new REST-style API. This new API will allow querying of the Europeana repository with responses in JSON-format and the returned metadata modelled in EDM.<br><br>\r\nFuture versions of the Europeana portal will be developed using the same back-end as this new API so it will always keep pace with our own portal's search capabilities.\_ We hope to make this new API available in late autumn.

        body: "<p><em>In this post, guest blogger Nick Poole, Chair of the Europeana Network, shares the latest Network news.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network is a community of nearly 500 members, representing the cultural and creative industries across Europe. The role of the Network is to act as a critical friend to Europeana, helping to ensure that the voice of the community is heard in Europeana’s strategic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Network enters a new phase in its development, the Network Officers thought it would be useful to send you this brief update and to invite you to participate in the work ahead of us in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Network Officers Election</strong><br><br>\r\nAfter a successful election (many thanks to all those of you that voted!), we are delighted to confirm that the following people have been elected as your Europeana Network Officers (individual affiliations/representation is shown in\_ parentheses):<br><br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Nick Poole, Collections Trust (Cross Domain Aggregator) - Chair<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Anne Bergman Tahon, FEP (Publishers)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Johan Oomen, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (Audiovisual)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Bengt Wittgren, Murberget Länsmuseet Västernorrland (Museum)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Gunnar Urtegaard, Kulturrad (Archives)<br>\r\n•\_\_ \_Louise Edwards, the European Library (Library)<br><br>\r\nI am sure that you will join me in offering your congratulations to our newly-elected officers. I would also like to offer our thanks on behalf of the entire Network to Henning Scholz and Hans van der Linden who have worked tirelessly in their former capacity as Officers.<br><br><strong>Europeana Business Plan</strong><br><br>\r\nAs discussed at the last plenary meeting in Leuven, a key role for the Europeana Network is to ensure that the views of the community are reflected in the development of the Europeana Business Plan. We have been working with the Europeana Office to set out the schedule for discussion of the Business Plan, which is shown in the diagram below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nYou will see that there are three key opportunities to reflect on and contribute to the draft Business Plan:<br><br>\r\n1.\_\_ \_At the Business Plan Workshops, which will take place on 25-28 September<br>\r\n2.\_\_ \_Through the Network Officers at their pre-meeting on 23 October and<br>\r\n3.\_\_ \_In advance of the AGM in Berlin on 27 November (don’t forget to <a href=\"http://agm2012-berlin.eventbrite.com\">register</a>).<br><br>\r\nThe drafts will be made openly available for comment, and I encourage all of you to contribute to the development of the Business Plan – either directly to the Europeana Office or via the Network Officers as your representatives.<br><br><strong>Task Forces</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Task Forces are established and will be presenting an update on their work at the AGM in November. If you would like to set up a Europeana Network Proposed Task Force, please fill in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/1050551/Proposal+Form_+Europeana+Network+Task+Force\">this form</a> indicating the subject or area of investigation, the participants and what the finished work will be. The completed proposal form can be sent to <a href=\"mailto:partnernetwork@europeana.eu\">partnernetwork@europeana.eu</a>. The proposal will be considered by the Officers at their monthly meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>European Cultural Commons</strong><br><br>\r\nYou will be aware that at the Leuven plenary I made a commitment to exploring the idea of a Cultural Commons for Europe as a key strand of the Europeana Network. These discussions will continue at a Strategic Briefing event in Cyprus at the end of October. We aim to put forward a firm recommendation for the development of the Cultural Commons for Europe by late November to be incorporated into the Europeana Business Plan.<br><br><strong>Europeana Network on Europeana Professional</strong><br><br>\r\nDon’t forget that you can find out all about the work of the Network from Europeana Professional, including key documents and schedules of forthcoming meetings. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu\">Find out more</a>.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>A guest blog from the Europeana Fashion project. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Fashion project was launched on 1 March 2012. This exciting three-year project, co-funded by the European Commission within the ICT Policy Support Programme, will publish over 700,000 fashion-related digital objects online by March 2015. This will range from historical dresses to accessories, photographs, posters, drawings, sketches, videos, and fashion catalogues. Europeana Fashion is a best practice network of 22 partners, representing the leading public and private museums, archives and collections from 12 European countries. More information about the project is available on the<a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu\"> project website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently at the stage of preparing our content to be ingested into the Europeana Fashion portal, clearing Intellectual Property Rights and organising metadata. We are crafting specific guidelines for all project partners to assist them in managing Intellectual Property Rights. In addition, we are continuing to build a Fashion Thesaurus\_ that is tailored to fashion objects specifically, enhancing the search experience for users in multiple languages. The first launch of the portal is planned for March 2013. In the meantime, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaFashion?ref=stream\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EurFashion/statuses/249099239773306880\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/115879951963722227275/posts\">Google+</a> pages of Europeana Fashion are raising awareness and engaging audiences around the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, all the Europeana Fashion partners got together in Berlin to catch up on the progress of the project. It was great to see all the faces of our project partners from all over Europe, sharing experience, expertise (and some local Berlin cuisine, of course). And now we are even happier to share some exciting updates with you!<br><br><a href=\"http://www.kmkg-mrah.be/\">The Royal Museums of Art and History</a> in Brussels are working on a unique Fashion Thesaurus\_ that is going to make searching on the Europeana Fashion portal a breeze and that will even give you the opportunity to search by colour. Our colleagues at the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/\">Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a> in London are delving into Intellectual Property Rights, so we can share as many images as possible on Europeana Fashion!<br><br>\r\nPartner <a href=\"http://hv.spk-berlin.de/deutsch/index.php\">Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz</a> was so kind to organise this event and took very good care of us. They even treated us to a private tour by curator <a href=\"http://www.adelheid-rasche.de/\">Adelheid Rasche</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.smb.museum/smb/news/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=13023\">Lipperheide Costume Library</a> which hosts an incredible amount of fashion-related objects, even dating back to the 16th century. And the best news of all is that a selection of objects from this massive library collection will be available on the Europeana Fashion portal!<br><br>\r\nView a selection of photos from the private tour and our event in Berlin below or see all of them on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/europeana-fashion/\">Flickr page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Europeana Fashion Workshop, Berlin 6-7 September 2012. © Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz.

        body: "<p>Our developers at Europeana have been working hard on a re-design of the Europeana portal. The new site will be better-looking and more user-friendly. Importantly, it will also be responsive; this means that the display adapts automatically to the size of screen you’re using, which is great news for mobile and tablet users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s a glimpse of what it’s going to look like – you saw it here first!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"New portal screenshot\" src=\"/files/blogimages/New%20portal%20screenshot.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 846px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we launch the new portal, we’d really like your help and feedback on it. We have developed three short tests which record your clicking habits, that is, which part of the portal you click on in order to perform a particular task. Your responses to these tests will influence the decisions we make as we continue the new portal’s design and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you click on the link below, the test will start automatically. Simply follow the on-screen instructions. There are 5-7 questions per test and each test should only take 5 minutes to complete. The first click test is available now (Wednesday 19 September), with two more tests following next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#fff;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 128, 128);\"><a href=\"http://verifyapp.com/x/07016dac9499c0479e3d65666910c60fcdb9827e/\">Take the first test now.</a></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we’d like as many people as possible to take these tests. The more feedback we have, the more knowledge we gain of how you use Europeana and how you expect it to work. So please share the tests with your colleagues and partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much!</p>"

        body: "<p>Europeana runs many events throughout the year; some are open to all Network members to attend, such as the successful Leuven plenary in June, while others have a smaller invite list, allowing us to focus closely on specific topics. All of our events are designed to ensure that partners and Network members have the opportunity to get involved in discussions shaping Europeana’s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we can't invite everyone to every event, I'd like you to know about what's coming up in the last part of 2012, so that you understand what discussions are taking place and how they relate to your own work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana CCPA Annual General Meeting 2011\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana%20CCPA%20Annual%20General%20Meeting%202011.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 253px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Annual General Meeting 2011</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coming Up</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>25-28 September:<strong> Europeana Business Plan 2013 Workshops</strong>, The Hague, The Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These all-day events are designed around the four tracks of the Europeana Strategic Plan: Aggregate, Facilitate, Distribute and Engage. A small group of experts from the partner network will share their ideas and opinions on how to turn strategic issues into concrete actions for 2013. Partner input on next year's Business Plan was also sought at the recent <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/breaking-out-of-the-bubble%3A-the-europeana-project-group-meeting\">Project Group Meeting</a> in The Hague. Whilst this is an invite-only event, its outcomes will be presented at the Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (AGM) in November, with the final Business Plan due for publication in January 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>27 September: <strong>Europeana Aggregator Forum</strong>, The Hague, The Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National and pan-European aggregators (single, cross-domain and those without online portals) will come together to exchange ideas, experiences and best practices. The Forum will air issues related to content, sustainability and partner development and set up recommendations for resolutions. Participants will find out about the Connecting Europe Facility, the deployment of the Europeana Portal API and the Data Quality Campaign, in particular, rights labelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>30 October: <strong>Second European Cultural Commons Strategic Briefing</strong>, Limassol, Cyprus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Selected European national policy-makers will continue discussions on the European Cultural Commons that started earlier this year in Copenhagen. A draft policy paper produced by an expert committee from the Europeana Network will be presented. The aim is to create a set of recommendations for Europe's Cultural Commons for wider discussions at the AGM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is part of a series of Europeana events - including Europeana Awareness and Aggregators round tables - running under the Cypriot EU Presidency and alongside the <a href=\"http://www.euromed2012.eu/\">EuroMed 2012 conference</a> from 29 October - 3 November in Limassol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>27 November: <strong>Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (AGM)</strong>, Berlin, Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ALL NETWORK MEMBERS INVITED</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This key event for Europeana and its Network is organised in cooperation with Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz and Museum für Naturkunde. Participants will reflect on the work of partners and Europeana during the past year and look ahead to the challenges and opportunities for the coming year. In particular, they will focus on the Europeana Business Plan 2013, Task Forces and the European Cultural Commons concept. After each of these thematic blocks, participants can stand up and share their thoughts in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapbox\">Soapbox</a> format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information and to register for the AGM, please visit our <a href=\"http://agm2012-berlin.eventbrite.com/\">Eventbrite page</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Breaking out of the Bubble: the Europeana Project Group Meeting'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>On 10-11 September, representatives from almost 30 <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/projects\" title=\"Europeana Project Group\">Europeana-related projects</a> met at the <a href=\"http://kb.nl\" title=\"Koninklijke Bibliotheek - National Library of the Netherlands\">National Library of the Netherlands</a> (the KB).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/pro_meeting.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 191px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-day event, coordinated by Programme Manager Breandán Knowlton and Programme Assistant Dasha Moskalenko, brought projects closer together, facilitating communication and a greater understanding of the wider Europeana picture. Attendees commented that the meeting helped them to break out of their ‘bubbles’ and to realise that the experiences and challenges that one project manager faces are shared by others too. Communicating with other projects can prevent us all reinventing the wheel! Breandán commented,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>‘We’re all on the same team. 29 simultaneous projects across Europe are digitising cultural heritage and sending data into the Europeana repository. With such a massive scale of work, the opportunities for collaboration are equally massive.’</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Delegates to the event discussed and shaped the Europeana Product Roadmap, the 2013 Europeana Business Plan, and the ongoing development of the Europeana Professional website. One session launched <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blog\" title=\"Europeana Professional Blog\">this very blog</a> with attendees contributing some great ideas – watch this space for their guest blog posts!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recurring theme throughout the event was the impact of opening up Europeana’s dataset and the opportunities for its exploitation via the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/api\" title=\"Europeana Application Programming Interface\">Europeana API</a>. Jon Purday, Head of Communications, said,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>‘Content is now breaking free of the portal and moving in new directions. It is crossing borders, formats, institutions and platforms. The Europeana API pours the content into all sorts of different spaces.’</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Other topics covered included promotion and dissemination, communications and branding, technical research and development, product development, legal issues, post-project planning (which saw the group develop a sustainability plan for a hypothetical and mouth-watering project called Europeana Food), and preparing for European Commission project reviews. Further blog posts on some of these topics to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn’t all work – there was plenty of time for networking and making new contacts, and chance for a spot of hard-earned dinner at a good restaurant in the Hague’s historic Plein square.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/pro_meeting_2.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 253px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The projects team is keen to put on another similar event in the future, so if you attended and have highlights or comments to share, or if you’d like to be involved in the future, please get in touch or leave a comment below.</p>"

For more information, go to ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/terms-of-use.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms of Use’</a>, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/api-terms-of-use.html\" target=\"_blank\">API terms of use’</a>, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/metadata-usage-guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\">Usage Guidelines for Metadata’</a>, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/terms-for-user-contributions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Terms for User Contributions’</a>, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/linked-data-sources.html\" target=\"_blank\">Data Sources’</a>, and our new ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/licensing\" target=\"_blank\">Legal Requirements</a>’ pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Releasing Europeana’s metadata under a CC0 waiver means that it can now be used in <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36752317\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Open Data</a> developments. This holds the potential to bring together data from Europe’s great libraries, museums and archives and data from other sectors such as tourism and broadcasting. The result could be a powerful knowledge-generating engine for the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Chief Executive of Europeana said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>“This move is a significant step forward for open data and a huge cultural shift for Europeana’s data providers. The decision to open up data for re-use is bold and forward looking – it recognises the important potential for creativity and innovation that access to digital data provides. Their contribution to this development means that Europe now sets the worldwide standard for the sector.”</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has worked closely with its partners across Europe to make the descriptive data it holds available under CC0. We’d like to thank all those partners whose hard work, commitment and drive have made this possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Glossary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>API – Application Programming Interface.

        body: "<p>In a video published online over the summer, Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, speaks about the benefits that digitisation and openness can bring for culture, and stresses the importance of Europeana’s digitisation project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The speech was originally given to the event ‘OpenCulture 2012 – The Greatest Collections Management Show on Earth’ at the launch of the cultural Olympiad in London on June 26th 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niD3kgOBhTo\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/neelie-open-culture.png\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 305px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neelie Kroes called Europeana, Europe’s ‘flagship digitisation project’, and stated that it is ‘the most comprehensive and dynamic action of European cultural heritage anywhere online.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmly backing open data, Kroes said that a legal proposal on public sector information would ‘unlock a gold mine’. She said that Europeana’s efforts to build <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/topics?p_p_id=topicnavigationportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_fC66&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-1&amp;p_p_col_pos=1&amp;p_p_col_count=2&amp;_topicnavigationportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANC\">common metadata standards</a> have her full support and that Europeana’s use of open software is ‘pioneering’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She concluded that the combined efforts of governments, the private sector and cultural institutions will ‘stimulate innovation’ and ‘help our cultural sector keep its proud place on the world stage.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niD3kgOBhTo\">View the whole video here</a></p>"

        body: "<p>Things look a bit different around here as Europeana Professional gets a major makeover. The website was set up in 2007 to support the Europeana Foundation, communicate with the Europeana Network and store and make available documentation such as project reports, business plans, and PR tools. That’s a lot of work for one website to do; you can now find a much improved and well-designed site that works for all of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’d like to thank the Europeana Network for their input into the development of the revamped website. It’s the culmination of nine months of development including lots of your feedback. If you came to the Europeana Network Annual General Meeting in Madrid in October, you’ll have seen the beta version. We’ve made further adaptations since then and we will keep on improving the site in the coming weeks. We’re really excited to find out what you think; let us know through the form at the end of this page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what can you\_see?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/newpro.jpg\" style=\"width: 700px; height: 396px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- A clear navigational structure that reflects the Europeana community, whether you’re an individual Europeana Network member, a representative of a cultural institution, or a professional from the creative industries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- A global navigation which unites all of Europeana's products and allows people to navigate easily across our websites</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Clear concise text written especially for the web\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Improved upcoming events section</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Better social media sharing options on the blog</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- No need to log in\_- all content and documents are public</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Integrated information from the <a href=\"/about-us/factsfigures\">statistics dashboard</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Improved search functionality powered by an integrated google enterprise search</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Responsive design for mobile and tablet users</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dasha Moskalenko, Product Developer of Europeana Professional says: ‘We have made a tremendous effort to improve the Europeana Professional website to match your needs and expectations. We particularly focused on improving the findability of content on the site with a new information and navigation structure based on the primary and secondary calls to action. Every use of the search function will improve it even further as it responds to your input - the more the site is searched, the better the quality of its search results!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are interested in your feedback. Take a few minutes to browse through the site and share your opinion through the below form.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=d68c2eed60a74857a238434a8bc51105\"></iframe>"

Members of the Network, new and old, joined in and elected 25 Councillors to form the first Members Council. We want to tell you a bit more about what has happened since the elections, and what is next on the agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(1).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 486px;\">Europeana Members Council, CC0</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Members Council: represent the breadth and diversity of the Network</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana have created the Europeana Network Association to give a clear identity and a formal role to the Network. As part of its governance structure a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/election-results1?p_p_id=56_INSTANCE_q4Bf&amp;p_p_lifecycle=0&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1\">Members Council of 25 Councillors</a> were elected by the Network. In 2015 this will increase to 50 to truly ensure it is representative of the breadth and diversity of the Network. As your representatives, we will be working to ensure that our work is shared openly and regularly. We want to make sure that our decision making is effective and transparent. And most importantly, we will do our best to make sure that the full breadth and diversity of the members of the Network are represented at every opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Management Board: take responsibility for working with the Foundation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To oversee the work of the Members Council, the Councillors nominated a Management Board made up of six Councillors: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/johan-oomen\">Johan Oomen</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/max-kaiser\">Max Kaiser</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/rolf-kallman\">Rolf Kallman</a>. The Management Board are responsible for ensuring that we are all working towards achieving our objectives as well as provide direct input into the governance of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leading the Network: Introducing the Chair, Vice Chair and Treasurer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Fintroducing-the-candidates%2Fmax-kaiser&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvBGiqnJkHn9yldwpjsRcFhAVe1A\">Max Kaiser</a> (Head of Research and Development at the <a href=\"http://www.onb.ac.at/index.php\">Austrian National Library</a>), <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a> (curator of digital museum practice at <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/\">Statens Museum for Kunst</a>) and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/introducing-the-candidates/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a> (director of <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/\">Kennisland</a>). We’ve been appointed to be your Chair, Vice Chair and Treasurer respectively and we’re really looking forward to the year ahead! We want to start the year by passing our thanks, on behalf of the entire Members Council, to Nick Poole and Johan Oomen for their hard work in their previous roles as Chair and Co-Chair of the the Network. We will endeavour to continue their great work in and with the Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Whats on the agenda for February?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the 3rd February the Members Council will have our first official meeting in the Europeana Offices in the Hague. We’ve got a lot to discuss and a few decisions to make. Because we are all new in our roles, there are a number of things we need to decide: how we manage going forward, how we work together and with the Network. Then there is the real business at the heart of the Association - defining our objectives for the year so that they support the objectives of Europeana, putting together working groups and overseeing the work of the task forces. There are some large tasks on our agenda - and we’ll be sharing more about those, and a report on the Members Council meeting, soon. In the meantime thanks for reading, we’re looking forward to working with you in 2015! Best, Max, Merete &amp; Paul</p>\r\n"

        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana has published a new set of recommendations to increase the use of Europeana content in the tourism industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These recommendations set out the changes in thinking and behaviour needed to achieve the systematic implementation of Europeana content in tourism, giving cultural institutions as well as cultural and tourism policy-makers a list of suggested 'to-dos'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(2).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Photo: <a href=\"http://pixabay.com/nl/users/meineresterampe-26089/\">meineresterampe</a>, CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to be successful in this market we must recognise that the tourism industry has its own aims, challenges and rules. We need to incorporate Europeana's offering into the existing tourism ecosystem. One starting point is to take advantage of destinations that put culture at their heart of their marketing strategies because mass tourism activities are absent or simply not possible, e.g. places that lack interesting landscapes, architecture or other specific pulls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director, says, ‘In short, we need to create demand for Europeana in the tourism sector and ensure that cultural organisations can feed in with high quality content. We need to shout about our benefits and best practices and build solid and productive relationships between cultural institutions and the tourism industry. The recommendations outline ways that policy-makers and cultural institutions can begin to do this.’ <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/publication/europeana-for-tourism-policy-recommendations\" target=\"_blank\">Read the recommendations in full</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How can Europeana data be used in tourism?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Several tourism apps and services using Europeana content are already available or launching soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/europeana-beacon/\">Europeana Beacon (eBe) iOS app</a> is a new way of thinking about tourist guides. The app determines the user’s position in a town square, museum room or exhibition, always displaying the correct information about the work of art they’re facing. Users can discover new facts, engage in fun puzzles and quizzes to explore their surroundings, while museum curators or the local tourism bureau gain a deeper insight about what people really visited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=73f70cb4-257f-4222-9bd7-c2083e09d3db&amp;groupId=858566&amp;t=1422458749107\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/TuoMuseo/\">TuoMuseo.it / YourMuseum.it</a>, launching soon, is an app for the whole visitor experience - from pre-visit online planning and discovery, to on-site experiences and then post-visit personal storytelling. Digitised points of interest and real world exhibits are brought together through gamification, allowing cities and museum managers to guide and analyse visitor flow in real time. Missions, quizzes, badges, points, rankings, awards, and a newsfeed encourage positive tourist behaviour, driving them to discover places in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Google <a href=\"https://www.fieldtripper.com/\">Field Trip app</a> will shortly include curated Europeana content to do with archaeological sites, historical buildings and monuments. This mobile app recognises where people are and allows them to explore and discover more about their surroundings. The app has been developed by Google Niantic Labs and is available for iOS, Android and Google Glass in more than 30 languages. For this pilot, we are working with the Swedish National Heritage Board, National Heritage Board of Estonia, National Heritage Board of Poland and Austrian National Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">VanGoYourself.com</a><br />\r\nThe idea behind VanGoYourself is to have fun recreating historical artworks and then share them online or simply keep your creation for yourself. Above all, the tourism sector seeks to provide its customers with great experiences in order to get them to return to a destination or to tell friends and family about it in a positive way. VanGoYourself can help to provide this experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?uuid=6d64d7d2-c018-46e3-b8a0-2ac40b07f046&amp;groupId=858566&amp;t=1422458749107\" /><br />\r\n<em>Bella and Hanna, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg (1783-1853) vanGo'd by Juliette O'Leary - CC-BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens next? </strong><br />\r\nThe relevant ministries will publish the recommendations, stimulating interest and discussion within their national ministries of culture and tourism. Discussions will be held during regular meetings of the Member States Expert Group (MSEG) on Digitisation and Digital Preservation and a review of consequent benefits or take-up will happen during the Luxembourg Presidency in the second half of 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is responsible for the recommendations? </strong><br />\r\nThe recommendations are the product of discussions coordinated by the Europeana Foundation, Culture24, Plurio.net and the National Documentation Centre of Greece (EKT) and involving policy-makers from ministries of tourism and culture across the EU as well as members of DG Enterprise and European Tourism &amp; Travel Advisory Group (ETAG). A draft set of recommendations were proposed under the Greek presidency at a meeting coordinated by EKT in Athens in June 2014 and these were then developed and aligned with the Italian presidency’s own recommendations for tourism and culture.</p>"

        body: "<p>The world of digital cultural heritage is expansive, interdisciplinary and complex. Europeana’s quest to make Europe’s heritage available online for all faces technical challenges that require complex problem solving, technical innovation and collaboration. At <a href=\"http://www.europeanatech2015.eu/\">EuropeanaTech 2015</a> on February 12-13 in Paris, the EuropeanaTech Community will gather at the National Library of France to tackle these issues, and look at the developments and future of a number of major R&amp;D aspects of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(3).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 406px;\" /><br />\r\n<em>Image: Montmartre [le Sacré-Coeur], Public Domain marked.

Following on from last years <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm\">Public Consultation on the review of EU copyright rules</a>, officials got busy reading all 9,500 responses (including ours). <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/docs/contributions/consultation-report_en.pdf\">A summary report of the responses</a> were published and proposals for reform were put on the back burner until the new Commissioners found their offices and set their agendas.

In addition, Vice President for the Digital Single Market <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019/ansip_en\">MEP Andrus Ansip</a>, is charged with coordinating EU digital policy, which includes taking a special interest in the impact of copyright reform. Commission President Juncker, VP Ansip and MEP Oettinger have all promised that reform of copyright is high on their agenda for 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing the recommendations for copyright reform</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) has <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/content/20141216IPR02126/html/Legal-Affairs-New-working-group-on-IPR-and-copyright-reform\">formed a working group</a> on IPR and copyright reform. Coordinated by MEP <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28206/JEAN-MARIE_CAVADA_home.html\">Jean Marie Cavada</a> it meets monthly to hear from academics, expert and stakeholders on the all aspects of copyright reform. Rapporteur of the review of the InfoSoc Directive, <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/124816/JULIA_REDA_home.html\">MEP Julia Reda</a> published a <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+COMPARL+PE-546.580+02+DOC+PDF+V0//EN&amp;language=EN\">draft report</a> on the 15th January discusses and provides recommendations on exclusive rights as well as exceptions &amp; limitations in light of the feedback received during the public consultation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Putting the copyright reform discussion into a broader context of the digital single market, MEP Madelin, VP Ansip and MEP Oettinger are hosting <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/save-date-digital4eu-stakeholder-forum-europes-new-digital-priorities-24-february-2015\">a stakeholder forum</a> at the Commission on February 24th.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>On the Europeana Pro blog, we want to highlight the good work being done by the Europeana Network. This time, Matilda Karlsson, business developer at Swedish Open Cultural Heritage (K-samsök in Swedish) talks to us about their work. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hi Matilda, how are you doing? </strong><br>\r\nGood! All is going well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You work at Swedish Open Cultural Heritage. What are the aims of your organisation? </strong><br>\r\nThe aim of <a href=\"http://www.ksamsok.se/in-english/\">Swedish Open Cultural Heritage</a> (SOCH) is to give people access to cultural heritage that is as usable as possible: as free as possible to use and re-use, containing good quality data, enriched with context, and so on. SOCH is part of the government agency <a href=\"http://www.raa.se/om-riksantikvarieambetet/in-english/\">Swedish National Heritage Board</a> (Riksantikvarieämbetet), whose mission is to play a proactive, coordinating role in heritage promotion and to ensure that the historic environment is preserved as effectively as possible. The Swedish National Heritage Board is also a data provider to SOCH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/SKA129_L.jpg\" style=\"width: 1300px; height: 652px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/91626/tekm_object_TM26011.html?start=24&amp;query=*%3A*&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Swedish+Open+Cultural+Heritage+%7C+K-sams%C3%B6k%22&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Tekniska+museet%22&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Stereoscopic Photograph</a> by an unknown author. Part of the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3a%22Tekniska%20museet%22&amp;rows=24\">Tekniska Museum collection</a>. Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>With how many Swedish institutions are you currently working? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several of the memory institutions that work with us are organised as umbrella organisations, so how many we work with depends on how you count. :-) If we count the ones listed as data providers in our search interface <a href=\"http://www.kringla.nu/kringla/\">Kringla</a>, there are 48 institutions on the list. There's a variety of institutions represented: museums for specific topics, regional and local museums, and also the Swedish National Heritage Board's own databases of monuments and building data plus historic photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOCH provides a lot of records to Europeana, but that is probably not all that you do isn’t it? </strong><br>\r\nNo there are a couple of more things. SOCH consists of four parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Developing and managing the web service (which is also the national museum aggregator for delivering data to Europeana) that harvests metadata from memory institutions in Sweden, creating a platform for cross-searching records from those databases.</li>\r\n    <li>Developing and managing an API that allows third parties to build on the data in the SOCH web service.</li>\r\n    <li>Developing and managing Kringla, a SOCH search application (website on http://www.kringla.nu and an Android app). On the Kringla website, users can link together related objects in SOCH, link to related objects in Europeana, and also link objects to Wikipedia and to Libris, the Swedish national search service for publications. The links that are created there will be available through an <a href=\"http://ugc.kulturarvsdata.se/\">open API</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Developing and managing <a href=\"http://platsr.se/\">Platsr</a>, a website for collecting user-generated content and democratic historiography. Platsr also has an API.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>A large part of the work is not technical in nature, though. We work a lot with digital infrastructure and organisation issues etc, as well as marketing the APIs, web service and applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are you working with Europeana? </strong><br>\r\nBecause we want digitised cultural heritage to be used and re-used as widely as possible. Europeana is an important platform for cultural heritage data internationally, both as a way to reach many people and as a forum for collaboration and interesting projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You are providing a lot of direct links to the material. Was this a deliberate choice, and if so, why? </strong><br>\r\nWe know that people want access to good-quality pictures, and when those pictures are already available through SOCH of course they should be available for use and re-use in as many places as possible. Since it was as simple as supplying an isShownBy field, it was relatively easy to implement. Access to larger images is useful in many different situations, for example in projects such as <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:D%C3%A5_och_Nu?uselang=sv\">Då och nu</a> a contest (organised by Wikimedia Sweden, Europeana and Swedish National Heritage Board) that consisted of taking photos on the exact spot where an old photograph was taken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Swidish_culture.jpg\" style=\"width: 933px; height: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/91622/raa_kmb_16000200001147.html?start=495&amp;query=*%3A*&amp;startPage=481&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3A%22Swedish+Open+Cultural+Heritage+%7C+K-sams%C3%B6k%22&amp;qf=TYPE%3AIMAGE&amp;qf=REUSABILITY%3Aopen&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3ARiksantikvarie%C3%A4mbetet&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Mjällby kyrka</a>. Picture taken in 1917. Part of the collection of the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3a%22Riksantikvarie%C3%A4mbetet%22&amp;rows=24\">Riksantikvarieämbetet</a>. Public Domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the SOCH dataset a wide variety of copyright licenses can be found. Can you tell a bit about how you go about with the licensing? </strong><br>\r\nIt's up to the providers to decide which rights statements they want to use. Many memory institutions in Sweden use Creative Commons licenses, though the most common license in SOCH is the restrictive CC BY-NC-ND so the collections are not as free as they could be. Very little is labelled with full copyright though. (there are graphs in <a href=\"http://www.k-blogg.se/2014/06/17/hur-fritt-ar-det-digitaliserade-kulturarvet/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To deliver data the institutions should follow SOCH's rights model (which is similar to the Europeana one). There are still a lot of unlabelled images in our index though, mostly because some providers haven't yet made policy decisions on how their digital collections may be used. This is also a big issue for memory institutions that don't yet participate in SOCH. The Swedish National Heritage Board tries to promote openness in digital heritage by being a good example, so our own data is licensed as openly as possible (Public Domain Mark or CC BY is the default).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Any things that are particularly interesting to mention that are not included so far? </strong><br>\r\nThe SOCH source code is available to use - it's not yet in any code repository but the code can be <a href=\"http://www.ksamsok.se/api/kodexempel/\">downloaded here</a>. On the same page is the source code for our Android search app which was developed in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thanks so much! Looking forward to working with you in 2015.</strong></p>"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This blog was written by Henning Scholz - Partners &amp; Operations manager at Europeana and Tom Miles - project manager at the British Library.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2013, the British Library <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2013/12/a-million-first-steps.html\">released over one million public domainimages onto Flickr Commons</a>. 60,000 of these images are <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=europeana_collectionName%3A9200387*+&amp;rows=96\">now available in Europeana</a> for your creative re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The images were taken from 17th, 18th and 19th century books digitised by Microsoft and generously gifted to the British Library. This vast release of material was carried out by the British Library’s ‘BL Labs’, funded by the <a href=\"http://www.mellon.org/\">Mellon Foundation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata of the scanned images was sparse - only the title and author of the book were available. Fortunately, Flickr users began tagging the images and by November 2014, more than 100,000 contextual tags had been added to more than 60,000 images. For example, an illustration of a bird like the one below might be tagged with ‘fauna’ and the name of the species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/image/image_gallery?img_id=2425490&amp;t=1421411439959\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(4).jpg\" style=\"width: 1965px; height: 1225px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lesser White-fronted Goose (<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200387/BibliographicResource_3000117290205.html?start=3&amp;query=Anser+erythropus&amp;startPage=1&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Anser erythropus</a>) from ‘A Spring and Summer in Lapland: with notes on the fauna of Luleä Lapmark’ (by H.W. Wheelwright) - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain marked</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The high resolution scanned images are wide-ranging in content, including maps, illustrations, decorations, landscapes, wall paintings, portraits and more. And as they’re in the pubilc domain, they’re perfect for creative re-use. That’s why the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> project wanted to make all the well-tagged images available in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ingestion of these images into Europeana is great news for our creative industry partners. The pilot application for the ‘Design’ strand of the Europeana Creative project is ‘<a href=\"http://spildaftid.dk/culturecam/\">Culture Cam</a>’, a webcam-based similarity search tool offering designers, artists and all creative people the ability to explore and access Europeana images in a fun, playful and intuitive way. The British Library Flickr images will be integrated into the application within the next few weeks, making them available for exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, how did we do it? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British Library prepared the metadata for the images in close collaboration with Europeana and The European Library - the first time Flickr images have been prepared for Europeana. One of the challenges was to ensure that the image links all point to the right place on Flickr. In addition, each metadata record needed to link to the full pdf of the book and the British Library book viewer, so that people can access the book and either download it or read it online, seeing the image in its original context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenge was to make the titles for every object in Europeana as meaningful as possible. At first, we used the first Flickr tag of each image as the Europeana title but many items had the same tag, e.g. thousands of images were tagged ‘map’. So we added the title of the book to add more context. The image above is a good example. The tag from Flickr is ‘Lesser White-fronted Goose (<a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200387/BibliographicResource_3000117290205.html?start=3&amp;query=Anser+erythropus&amp;startPage=1&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Anser erythropus</a>)‘ while the book title ‘A Spring and Summer in Lapland: with notes on the fauna of Luleä Lapmark (by H.W. Wheelwright)’ provides the necessary context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was important to visualise how this data would display on Europeana. Would just one word be sufficient as a title? Could the title be improved by globally combining one field with another? At what point should all this global editing take place? Close collaboration between Europeana, the aggregators and data providers is currently the best way of making the right decisions. Meanwhile, Europeana is working on streamlining and improving the aggregation infrastructure and ingestion workflows to make it easier for institutions to participate and share their best data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British Library Flickr photostream has demonstrated how useful ‘crowd-sourced’ activity can be in enhancing records. On Flickr, many individuals adding tags unknowingly worked as a team. For example, some individuals simply tagged images with the word ‘map’. Others then added geo-references to those images. One individual might tag 100 images as ‘bird’, allowing a more expert user to add more specific information. Crowd-sourcing should not be seen as a replacement to professional cataloguing, rather, a tool in the curator’s workshop to be used with skill and judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get involved </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work demonstrates a new way of creating attractive and re-usable high quality content for Europeana. It also solves a known issue for memory institutions that want to share their precious photo collections with Europeana while hosting them on Flickr. We welcome more data partners to use this approach to feature and share their best material. For any questions, please email Henning Scholz. For any questions about the British Library’s role in Europeana Creative, please email Tom Miles.</p>"

        body: "<p><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> recently <a href=\"https://stateof.creativecommons.org/\">released a report</a> which shows the spectacular uptake of their licenses. At the moment almost 900 million works are licensed using one of the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/\">6 licenses they offer</a>. In Europeana <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*%3A*&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc-nd%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-sa%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc-sa%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%2F*&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nd%2F*&amp;qt=false\">around 8 million cultural objects</a> licensed under a Creative Commons license can be found. This next to another 9 million records that are marked using the Creative Commons Public Domain mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every object you can find in Europeana includes a standardised rights statement that provides information about the copyright status of the work to our end-users. We currently use 13 rights statements that range from no copyright restrictions, to full copyright protection with additional licence requirements. Eight of these rights statements are provided by Creative Commons: 6 licences, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">1 dedication to the public domain</a> and <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">1 public domain declaration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//files/blogimages/image_gallery(6).png\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(6).png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of different rights statements in Europeana on 13-01-2015. Click on image for a larger version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These rights statements show us that one third of the content you can find in Europeana is ‘open’. This means that the material is either in the public domain and free from any copyright restrictions, or the rights holder has made the material available using one of the two open Creative Commons licenses (<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">CC BY</a> and <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">CC BY-SA</a>). The licenses that restrict commercial use (NC) and the creation of derivative works (ND) are not considered open as they do not allow reuse by everyone and are in general not compatible with other open licenses. To learn more about what ‘open’ means, please have a look at <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">the Open Definition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana greatly encourages cultural institutions to use Creative Commons licenses as a tool to open up their collections. The thing here is, that in order to be able to apply CC licenses, you have to be the rights holder in the first place (or you need to have permission from the rightsholder to apply a CC license). If I write this blogpost, it is quite clear that I am the creator. As I write this as an employee of the Europeana Foundation they are the rights holders under Dutch law. This allows Europeana to apply a Creative Commons license on my creative work and share this with you under certain conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural heritage institutions very often are not creators of works, but collectors. This means that in most cases they are the owners of the work, but not the owners of the copyright. This can still be in the hands of the original creator, or their heirs. Applying a Creative Commons license in this case would involve the cultural heritage institution seeking the explicit permission of the rights holders before they can apply a CC Licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it’s not always as simple as asking the rights holder permission. In most European countries, copyright expires 70 years after the death of the author and automatically falls into the Public Domain. In Europeana an institution can indicate that a work is in the public domain by applying the Public Domain Mark, which is a clear way to declare that no copyright exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only if a cultural institution is the owner of the copyright of the digital object, or has explicit permission from the rightsholder, it can choose to use a Creative Commons license. This can be the case because the institution created the work, like a translation of a text, or when the copyright has been explicitly transferred to the institution. This is for example what happened with a large collection of Dutch newsreels that was donated to the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision. Being the owners of both the works and the copyright allowed them to make the material available under a CC BY license on the <a href=\"http://openbeelden.nl/\">Open Images</a> platform and in <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?qt=false&amp;rows=24&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Open+Beelden%22\">Europeana</a>. For most audiovisual works in the Sound and Vision collection this is unfortunately not the case, as there are third-party rights holders. To indicate this the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/rights/rr-f.html\">Free Access - no-reuse</a> rights statement is used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative Commons licenses are a great way to make your creative content available to a wider audience and we are very happy to see the massive uptake of them in the last couple of years. At the same time it is important to know how these licenses work and in what cases they can be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a cultural institution and have questions about using Creative Commons licenses? Feel free to get in touch!</p>"

        title: 'The Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome - paintings with identity problems'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>If a painting has any relevance, you can probably find a digital copy of it on the internet. In fact, you can probably find multiple copies of it in different sizes, resolutions and colour schemes. <a href=\"https://www.google.nl/search?q=The+Massacre+of+the+Innocents+by+Giotto&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RqirVNOCB8asPZWEgNgL&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1233&amp;bih=619#tbm=isch&amp;q=Auvers+Town+Hall+in+1+Vincent+van+Gogh\">A simple Google Image search</a> will show just how many different versions there are on the web of a particular art work. And here comes the problem - it is impossible to know which of the digital versions best represents the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To demonstrate just how difficult it it, museum expert and open culture advocate <a href=\"http://sarahstierch.com/\">Sarah Stierch</a> has started the <a href=\"http://yellowmilkmaidsyndrome.tumblr.com/\">Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome</a> blog where she collects and showcases the wide variety of versions of an artwork that can be found online. The results are quite shocking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/painting_with_identity.jpg\"><a href=\"http://yellowmilkmaidsyndrome.tumblr.com/post/106097597156/kind-of-van-goghs-blue\">Six different version of Self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh</a> (1889). Located in musée d’Orsay. Public Domain</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSo why are there so many different versions of one art work online? Mainly because these were not created and uploaded by the cultural institution holding the artwork, but by users that want to share images online. Often they do not have access to the digitised copy made by the cultural institution, if one even exists, and so they copy it from the Google Art Project, scan it from a book, or find it somewhere else on the internet. Some even take a picture with a cell phone when visiting the museum and edit it afterwards. With no better alternative available, these are the digital representations used to for example illustrate Wikipedia articles, websites about art history, or Pinterest boards - websites with millions of views each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inspiration to start the Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome came from Europeanas’ 2011 Whitepaper: the “<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-problem-of-the-yellow-milkmaid\">Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid</a>”. This discusses exactly the same problem,using Vermeer’s Milkmaid, which is part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum, as an example . Before the museum started to make their own high quality and true colour version of their paintings openly available, all kinds of different digital versions of this painting could be found across the web. It was painful for the museum to see the low quality versions being used everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After releasing a high quality true to life digital image of the Milkmaid, they found that people quickly started using this version for all kinds of purposes. As a result searching for Vermeer’s Milkmaid now will give you the version from the museum as a first hit. Because the museum itself publishes the digital copies of their objects, it greatly helps the user to find and choose for the authenticated version. A pilot mentioned in the milkmaid paper carried out by the National Archive (UK) for example established that users trusted the National Archive data over similar anonymous data 10 to 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://yellowmilkmaidsyndrome.tumblr.com/\">Yellow Milkmaid Syndrome</a> makes quite clear that where a cultural institution does not publish their digital collection, or very low quality reproductions, other versions can probably be found online anyway. In this scenario the institution has absolutely no control what the image looks like, the quality of the images shared, or which versions are being used. Stierch argues that the best way to counter this is not by hiding the collection, but for cultural heritage institutions to take control and publish open access high quality images of their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a daily basis new entries are being added to the <a href=\"http://yellowmilkmaidsyndrome.tumblr.com/\">site</a> and everybody is invited to submit examples of their own. Have fun!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2015/01/daily-dose-of-art-direct-to-your-phone-tablet/\">Yesterday we announced</a> that Europeana is working together with <a href=\"http://www.getdailyart.com/\">DailyArt</a> to bring a selection of the collections found in Europeana to your smartphones and tablets. DailyArt is a free app that publishes one different piece of art every day. But that’s not all – with each update users of DailyArt receive additional information about the artwork; usually a description, where it was created and information about the artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(8).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 328px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To kick off 2015 DailyArt will be regularly featuring collections in their app found via Europeana. The first theme will centre on Vintage Fashion, using images from the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:Europeana+Fashion\">Europeana Fashion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:Rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a> collections in Europeana. To get these daily updates direct to your phone or tablet, we invite you to install the DailyArt app, which is available for both <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/dailyart-daily-dose-fine-art/id547982045?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moiseum.dailyart2\">Android</a> devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DailyArt app was conceived by Zuzanna Stanska from Poland, a young entrepreneur and well-known figure in the field of museum innovations. To celebrate the start of the cooperation, we asked Zuzanna to share with us some background information about DailyArt and the future plans she has for the app. (Please note: this is an extended version of the interview that we published earlier on our <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/\">end user blog</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- What is the DailyArt app? Who should install it? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “DailyArt is a free iOS and Android app that everyday publishes one piece of fine art with a short story about it. The story is not a boring, encyclopaedia-like description but it is always something interesting about the painting itself, the painter, some artistic movement or general broader art or cultural context. DailyArt exists for more than two years now and became quite popular worldwide, especially in USA. It’s a great app for everyone who love art or would like to know more about it and share this knowledge with their friends or family.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Why did you decide to create the app? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “I’m art historian but only because I was lucky enough to have art history classes in high school. There is no art history education in Polish schools and it is such a shame. Someday I realized that maybe you can live without art, but what kind of life is it? With DailyArt I wanted to fill this gap of lack of art history education and give people small dose of art every day – enough to learn something and not too much to overwhelm or exhaust.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- How many people have installed DailyArt, and how many people are actively using it? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “Right now we have more than 180.000 downloads and around ? of this number uses the app every day. “</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- What are your future plans for the app? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “We want to establish more institutional partnerships worldwide (until now we were working with Danish and Polish institutions, e.g with Polish Ministry of Culture showing art looted during II World War). Also we plan to update the apps and give the users some additional features that will make using the app even more plausible. These will be small things but very useful :)”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- Which institutions have participated until now? How can institutions benefit from the app? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “The institutions can gain the access to new audiences interested in art and culture and promote their collections. Our users are great - active on social media, writing a lot to us and demanding their favourite artists or painters. It means that they really care about the app and its content. Until now we were having partnerships with Polish Ministry of Culture And National Heritage, Museum of Modern Art Warsaw, Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow, Skagens Museum, Statens Museum for Kunst in Denmark.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>- What do you think about the new collaboration with Europeana? </strong><br />\r\nZuzanna: “I'm a huge fan of Europeana from the beginning. You're doing great work.

        title: 'Sweden’s museums aid openness of cultural heritage'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This guest blog was written by Karin Nilsson, head of Department of Digital Resources at the Swedish museums The Royal Armoury, Skokloster Castle and the Hallwyl museum (LSH) in Sweden</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>About a year ago, we at the <a href=\"http://lsh.se/en\">Swedish museums The Royal Armoury, Skokloster Castle and the Hallwyl museum</a> (which together constitute a national agency, accountable to the Ministry of Culture) took an important step towards increased openness when we <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Livrustkammaren_och_Skoklosters_slott_med_Stiftelsen_Hallwylska_museet\">made 20,000 high-resolution images available on Wikimedia Commons</a>. This contribution is the largest release from a Swedish museum to Wikimedia Commons and one of the largest worldwide. But more important than the number of images is the way they are put in context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Hedvig_Elisabeth_Charlotta_av.jpg\" style=\"width: 420px; height: 600px;\" /> The wedding dress of Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp worn when she married Charles XIII of Sweden on July 1774. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hedvig_Elisabeth_Charlotta_av_Sveriges_brudkl%C3%A4nning.tif?uselang=sv\">Picture by The Royal Armoury</a> (CC-BY-SA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information about the images comes from a large scale export from the collection database of the museums. Many come with ample information about owners, artists and connected historical events, exhibitions or publications, all of which have been linked to Wikipedia articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the past year, we have reached about 2.3 million visitors with our images, and the number keeps growing every day. Different kinds of users all over the world are replacing the lower quality copies of our collections with better, high-resolution images in different articles on Wikipedia. With this, the quality of our cultural heritage is secured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many benefits of the contribution to Wikimedia Commons is the increased reach of our images, nationally as well as internationally. The possibility of creating links between images, people and historic events enriches information about the museums’ collections. But also, the fact that anybody can edit information contributes to a fuller and better context to the images. When publishing images on Wikimedia Commons, it is essential that the images are being connected to articles on Wikipedia. We believe that two important goals for museums are to make images of good quality available, and to make sure that the information in the articles on Wikipedia is updated, in order to give us a clear perspective on history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we uploaded those 20,000 images a year ago, we have continued to work with the digitisation of the collection. Despite our limited resources, we have photographed 6,000 new objects since then. Mainly of objects that we haven´t had any images of at all until now. An example is the collection of rifles that we now publish. Skokloster castle, but also the Royal Armoury have great collections of weapons from the 17th and the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Swedens_museums.jpg\" style=\"width: 1024px; height: 361px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Octagonal barrel of polished steel. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flintl%C3%A5slodb%C3%B6ssa_1600-talets_mitt_-_Skoklosters_slott_-_98320.tif\">Picture taken by the Skokloster Castle </a>(CC-BY-SA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of those objects are located at Skokloster slott, in a museum environment, which doesn´t allow for a photo studio. Instead, we set up a station for photography a few days at a time, to minimise our disturbance of the activity in the museum. Together, we then registered metadata, photographed and registered the order of the objects. When we photograph the collections, we do it in a standardised way, with a white background, consistent metadata and with open licences. We also shoot one type of object at a time, to avoid unnecessary uninstalling and reinstalling of the photo station during the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the image itself is the main focus while exporting data to Wikimedia Commons, the information about the object and the context provided by the database are essential as well. It is through the information that the image becomes understandable and thereby fully available to he public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em>At the moment - Europeana and LSH are working on a more extensive case study about the effects of opening up the collection of the Swedish institutions. We expect to publish this at the end of February so stay tuned!</em></em></p>"

        title: 'Update on Europeana Cloud''s Technical Infrastructure'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>It has been a while since we updated you on the latest news about the technical infrastructure developed by the Europeana Cloud project. This post shares our recent process and introduces some of our plans for next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, team members from Pozna? (Poland), The Hague (Netherlands), Pisa (Italy) and Milton Keynes (United Kingdom) worked together to build the new infrastructure following <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/1414567/1861920/D2.2+Europeana+Cloud+Architectural+Design\">the design proposed one year ago</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now almost ready for the alpha release of our infrastructure, which will serve as the basis of our first experiments with real metadata and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As proposed in the original design, the system consists of a distributed database for storing technical metadata, a distributed file system for storing metadata records as well as digital objects and several distributed frontend and backend services. The word <em>distributed</em> appears three times in the last phrase for a reason. It reflects our choice of distributed components, in other words components which can run in parallel on several machines. This will help us to build a scalable and reliable infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Frontend Services</em> are made available via a standard API. Using this API, data holders, such as aggregators and data partners, will be able to easily upload content to Europeana Cloud, download it from there and apply standard processing tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Unique Identifiers Service</em> ensures that for every metadata or content record, Europeana Cloud both allocates its own unique identifier and stores the original (local) identifier used by the client who uploaded it. This will allow clients to refer to records using their local identifiers (rather than storing Europeana Cloud identifiers).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Metadata and Content Service</em> is the de-facto uploading and downloading mechanism. It is coupled with the <em>Data Lookup Service</em>, which allows the searching of records by a set of criteria, commonly referred to as Europeana Cloud’s administrative metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the heart of all these services is a simple but powerful data model. Its objective is to allow the building of standard aggregation workflows, so that individual workflows used by current and future partners can be easily mapped to this model and implemented using it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregation workflows will use the <em>Data Processing Service</em>, consisting of two parts. The first one is a standard component <a href=\"https://storm.apache.org/\">Apache Storm</a>. This system (also used by Twitter) can parallelize processing tasks by distributing and managing them over multiple computational resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second one is an API that allows interaction with the first system. The actual aggregation workflows will be implemented separately. The transformation between XML records (XSLT transformation) is already working as a sample workflow and soon we will ensure that more workflows are supported out-of-the-box by the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Notification Service</em> will inform clients about any changes made to records such as new versions created.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the core storage components <em>Apache Cassandra</em> and <em>OpenStack</em>, chosen during the design phase, we have added two more: <em><a href=\"http://kafka.apache.org/\">Apache Kafka</a> </em>for communication between the services and <a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/\"><em>Apache Zookeeper</em></a> to manage groups of services and ensure high availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system implements standard authentication and authorisation mechanisms following common security practices. Permissions on records are stored together with the rest of administrative metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, the emerging system is quite complex but by using standard and open-source components we hope to make it more extendable and configurable in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the operation front, the Pozna? Supercomputing and Networking Center has set up the first instance of a pre-production system which will be used for experimenting with real content as of 2015. Next year we will also start looking at how the new system can be integrated into our existing aggregation flows and fulfill parts of their storage and computation requirements. We will continue to refine the system and make it fit for the big purpose of being the infrastructure of the entire Europeana´s aggregation ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Cloud technical infrastructure is still young but very gifted and dreams of a big purpose. While it is dreaming, we wish you a very Happy New Year!</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>At the EUscreenXL <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/about-4\">conference in Rome</a>, between inspiring talks and innovative projects, people also participated in a workshop on Contextualization, which focused specifically on the question how AV contextualization practices can benefit best from the affordances of online publication. AV contextualization practices are a key part of the EUscreenXL project, reflected, amongst others, in an open access multi-media journal <a href=\"http://journal.euscreen.eu/index.php/view\">VIEW: Journal of European Television History and Culture </a>and the EUscreen <a href=\"http://oldportal.euscreen.eu/exhibitions.html\">virtual exhibitions</a>. Although several tools are currently being developed to explore and analyse digital audio-visual sources (AV), this workshop mainly focused on the next step: how to contextualize and re-use audio-visual materials online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This activity is part of EUscreen endeavours to build a<strong> ‘contextualization community’</strong>, in the sense of a community of content providers, creators, archivists, scholars, researchers, students and the general audience, who would work and explore the audio-visual material offered on <a href=\"http://euscreen.eu/\">euscreen.eu</a>. Their Core Collection will consist of ca. 60.000 historical items gathered from the audio-visual cultural heritage of 22 European countries. The purposes of the ‘contextualization community’ are to enrich and curate such content, as well as to experiment with other creative forms of online multimedia publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about the outcomes of this conference and the outcomes of this workshop you can read the <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/archives/5806\">EUscreen Blog.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What is EUscreenXL?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUscreenXL is a project and best practice <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/project-partners\">network</a> which aims at improving and developing the <a href=\"http://euscreen.eu/\">EUscreen</a> portal. It is a <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/project-partners\">consortium</a>involving European audiovisual and broadcasting archives. EUscreenXL aligns audiovisual collections held throughout Europe and connects them within the audiovisual domain of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>, an online collection of millions of digitised items from European museums, libraries and archives.</p>"

        body: "<p><em>On the Europeana Pro blog, we want to highlight the good work being done by the Europeana Network. This time, Viktorija Jonkut, who works at <a href=\"http://www.ldm.lt/index_en.htm\">the Lithuanian Art Museum</a>, talks to us about their work. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hi Viktorija, how are you? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very good! Thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the your institution and its goals?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lithuanian Art Museum is a public institution and was granted the national museum status by the government of Lithuania in 1997. Originally founded in 1933, the museum is one of the oldest and leading institutions of its kind in the country. The museum aims to collect, preserve, study, research and promote art valuables that are at its disposal. We also organise exhibitions and cultural events and conduct various educational programmes. We are also an approved administrator and a recognised national training centre for implementing and managing Lithuania’s museums digitisation projects. This is organised and coordinated by a department of the Lithuanian Museums’ Centre for Information, Digitisation and <a href=\"http://www.limis.lt/en\">LIMIS</a> (LM CID LIMIS).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(9).jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 750px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2024906/photography_ProvidedCHO_Literat_rinis_A__Pu_kino_muziejus_LIMIS_6733884.html?start=29&amp;query=*%3A*&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Literat%C5%ABrinis+A.+Pu%C5%A1kino+muziejus%22&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=96\">Portretas buvusioje Marku?i? dvaro sodyboje</a>. </em>Unknown author. 1905. From the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3a%22Literat%C5%ABrinis%20A.%20Pu%C5%A1kino%20muziejus%22&amp;rows=96\">Literat?rinis A. Puškino muziejus</a> (Public Domain)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are you working with Europeana?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is one of Europe's biggest digital cultural heritage libraries. And for us as a memory institution, it is important to be part of European culture heritage and be open and visible. We also want to work together with other countries on the preservation and dissemination of culture heritage. Especially since we are a small country, Europeana gives us the possibility to carry out all these activities. Besides that, we are a public body, so our activities of cultural heritage digitisation, preservation and dissemination are partly determined by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania and overall state strategy of these activities, which is formed in regard to the European cultural heritage policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your material is very well accessible via the direct links in the metadata. Was this a deliberate choice, and if so, why? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we provide links to digitised images and the source of the original object, available via the LIMIS information system. Of course we do it consciously, in order to provide more opportunities for people searching for necessary information. There is only a part of the information available in Europeana. We provide an image size good enough for a modern computer screen. At the primary source, there is more information and people can get a really high quality image. Providing direct links facilitates and improves the search process and the distribution of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Lithuanian_art_museum.jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 534px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2024906/photography_ProvidedCHO_Ma_osios_Lietuvos_istorijos_muziejus_LIMIS_12339920.html?start=115&amp;query=provider_aggregation_edm_isShownBy%3A*&amp;startPage=97&amp;qf=COUNTRY%3Alithuania&amp;qf=PROVIDER%3AEuropeanaPhotography&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=96\"><em>Išmestas ? krant? garlaivis \"Roja\" Melnrag?s papl?dimyje</em>.</a> Unknown author. 1932 from the <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?qt=false&amp;rows=96&amp;qf=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Ma%C5%BEosios+Lietuvos+istorijos+muziejus%22\">Mažosios Lietuvos istorijos muziejus</a> (Public Domain)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A lot of material is marked with the Public Domain mark and therefore free to use by anyone. Do you see benefit in this? Is this material for example more accessed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, we have marked a big part of our digital content with the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain mark</a>. This choice is largely determined by our governmental policy of digitisation and cultural heritage. Under the current legislation, digital content created with the financial support from the State or the EU Structural Funds, is open and can be used without restrictions, which is the case for our organisation. It should however be mentioned that we refer to reasonable quality digital images and objects of relevant chronology. We offer the really high quality as an added service. Generally speaking, the Public Domain mark makes digital content visible and more easily accessed. This results in us (the institution, the holders of images and the country) getting more attention and engaged users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does the future of your institution look like? What are your plans?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will continue the long-term activities such as the restoration and renovation of artworks and the museum building. We will strengthen an inter-institutional cooperation, particularly in the field of tourism and education and organise and participate in national and international projects, especially in the regional one. We seek better public and cultural awareness and work on a better infrastructure for social services and a pleasing atmosphere for cultural experiences. We are also working on system improvements, so we can share Lithuanian digital content more effectively with a wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thanks Viktorija!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Viktorija Jonkut\_is EuropeanaPhotography coordinator at the Lithuanian Art Museum.

        title: 'Deciding what to share on Facebook and selecting your best'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana Facebook tip 2/5: <em>A <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/2344803/maximized?p_p_auth=kCeWp4wV\">series</a> by Wiebe de Jager, Marketing Manager at Europeana</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deciding what to share on social media can be a daunting task. Especially if you’re holding very diverse collections and cater to a diverse audience. But even if you’re in a niche market, it still can be difficult to select the right images to surface via your Facebook page. In this blog post, we’ll give you some examples of images that got lots of traction on social media and briefly explain the mechanisms of the attention economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Economy of attention</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day, we see and are exposed to hundreds or even thousands of images and advertisements, both on and offline. On social media, everyone, it seems, is asking for our attention by sharing images: not only friends, family and acquaintances, but also companies and cultural heritage institutions like your own. As a result, our brain starts to automatically filter the images that are thrown at us. We simply can’t notice, absorb, or even judge the personal merit of all these daily visual attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, don’t assume that people will notice each image that you post. Only the most beautiful, engaging, provoking or emotional images will stand out from the noise. From our experience, images that provoke an immediate emotion work best in terms of reach and engagement. From working with <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/\">Retronaut</a> we learned that images that meet the S.P.E.E.D criteria work best:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/8c1692d0-941d-405f-812a-7d1989b9975c.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 136px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s not go into the details here; our upcoming paper on the S.P.E.E.D. model will elaborate on the criteria and explain each factor in detail. For now, let’s focus on the ‘disruption’ element, as we believe that this is the most important factor behind engagement and reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disruptive images are the exceptions, the anomalies, the weird finds. A picture that does not fit with our mental map of history or the world around us will bring us briefly to a halt. By surfacing a disruptive image, we can set ourselves briefly apart from the noise, and in turn be rewarded by the attention from our audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example 1: 1930s nose jobs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example of such a disruptive image is ‘1930s nosejobs’. Not many people know that already in the 1930s, plastic surgery was thriving, as a direct result of the First World War. Many soldiers got face injuries as a result of the trench war. Surgeons gained lots of experience with facial reconstruction and began to apply their knowledge in cosmetic surgery. The image below was selected for its disruptive content and surfaced via Europeana’s blog:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Facebooktip2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>J. Sheehan, Plastic Surgery of the Nose. CC-BY <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/items/show/843\">The Wellcome Library</a>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this image was highlighted via social media, it was shared and liked by thousands of people. Eventually, the mainstream media picked it up and the image was featured on dívány, one of Hungary’s premier news sites:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Facebooktip3.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 431px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Credit: <a href=\"http://divany.hu/tejbenvajban/2013/10/21/nezze_meg_milyen_munkat_vegeztek_a_plaszikai_sebeszek_regebben/\">Divany</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of sharing this one image, for weeks ‘plastic surgery’ was the most entered search query on Europeana.eu. Interest in the Wellcome Library collection increased by 17,000%, generating 57,000 views of individual records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Example 2: the ‘pig rider’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Facebooktip4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Credit: Animaux apprivoisés de Mr Wingfield à Ampthill. <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055656003.html\">National Library of France</a>, Public Domain marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘Pig rider’ image is probably Europeana’s most shared image ever: after surfacing it via <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/2013/10/pig-rider/\">Retronaut</a>, the image got 1,900 likes and 1,500 re-shares on Facebook, resulting in 250,000 impressions, reaching over 100,000 unique users. Just one image did that! The image now even appears in Google’s top image results if you search for ‘pig rider’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you might not have pictures of 1930s nose jobs or kid pig riders in your collections. But in every collection, you’ll have remarkable items. Or remarkable details; zooming in can sometimes help you with identifying the peculiar details in otherwise ordinary objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Images or photos?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the question of what kind of material to share. In August 2014, <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/blog/2149-photos-are-still-king-on-facebook\">Socialbakers</a> reported that 87% of the most engaging posts on Facebook were photos. Their data shows that only 4% of the most engaging content on Facebook is generated by links, another 3% by videos, and 2% by text-only status updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s perhaps not a complete surprise that photos work best on a social medium. Human beings are attracted most to what they recognise and relate to. But that doesn’t mean that all photos are fit for sharing via social media. So, what not to post?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>images of your institute’s building (unless it’s a work of art itself)</li>\r\n    <li>thumbnail images, or photos of poor quality</li>\r\n    <li>photos with watermarks on it</li>\r\n    <li>photos of people in a meeting or conference</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Timing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the content itself, timing of your posts is an essential element of a successful Facebook publishing strategy. This is the subject of the next blogpost in the series.</p>"

        body: "<p>What is European food and drink cultural heritage all about? When we think about food and drink, we imagine traditional regional delicacies, inimitable wines and beers, secret ingredients, intricate production methods and the climatic impact on flavours and aromas. Combined with dining etiquette, eating rituals, emblematic traditions, nostalgic locations and historically meaningful events and occasions, food and drink form the foundation of our culture. From very personal experiences to community specific habits and national traditions, food and drink simply define who we are in all sorts of ways. For centuries, local and national museums, libraries, archives, galleries and other heritage institutions have been collecting artefacts, images, paintings, books, manuscripts, audio videos and other objects to capture the traditions and to document the development of European food and drink culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/db7552ae-ce74-42a1-94c8-c1438724ce51.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 441px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\">Europeana Food and Drink</a>, a sister project of Europeana Creative, promotes the wider re-use of the digital cultural resources and supporting cultural heritage organisations but on the very specific theme of Food &amp; Drink. Digital contents such as long forgotten recipes and cookbooks, images and drawings showing traditional foods and their preparation or remarkable food locations will be provided in the course of the project by our project partners. Furthermore images of vintage tools and artefacts from the food and drink industry as well as sound recordings with traditional songs accompanying hunting and food celebrations and many other digital items harbouring unique stories are waiting to be revealed and revived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to support this creative process, Europeana Food and Drink has also initiated its <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/\">first Open Innovation Challenge “Reusing and promoting Europeana Food and Drink heritage contents”</a>. The desired solutions should help GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives and museums), touristic agencies and the food and drink industry to improve their business and support the promotion of the European food and drink cultural heritage in the modern digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great thing is you can submit the same idea, concept, or products to both the Europeana Creative and Europeana Food &amp; Drink Challenge - maximising your opportunuity to win one of our tailor made incubation support packages or cash prize!

        body: "<p><em>As Nick Poole, our Network Chair steps down this month, we’d like to thank him for his enormous contribution to the Europeana Network.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Nick Stanhope\" src=\"/files/blogimages/c9048e5e-1661-4097-a68f-869830a04f60.jpg\" style=\"width: 348px; height: 468px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nick Poole, Chief Executive Officer of the <a href=\"http://www.collectionstrust.org.uk/\">Collections Trust</a>, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, those who worked closely with Nick reflect on the importance of his role:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘A big thinker, great speaker, master of the pithy quote, a real catalyst for the sector. So many ideas, seen in both the strategy and Network of Europeana can be attributed to Nick, it is difficult to pick out the one ,’ said Europeana Director Jill Cousins. ‘He has been an inspiration and leaves a powerful base on which to build.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Racine, Chair of the Europeana Foundation Board and Président de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France, said, ‘Nick believes passionately in making cultural heritage widely accessible and has been able to galvanise a very broad group of people towards achieving that aim under his chairmanship of the Europeana Network. It’s fitting that he steps down as Chair to make way for a democratically elected Governing board, and a Europeana steadily inching closer to its goals.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco de Niet (Dutch Knowledge centre for Digital Heritage) worked with Nick in ENUMERATE. ‘Through ENUMERATE, Nick has helped create valid statistical data for the digital heritage field that gives us a greater understanding about what is going on at a European level in a sector that has in the past been void of valid data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internationalist and self-confessed culture geek, Nick’s many professional roles bring to the sector a unique and valuable skillset, as some of those with whom he has worked in the past highlight:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Louise Edwards (The European Library): ‘Nick Poole has been an energetic and visionary Chair of the Europeana Network. I've greatly appreciated his foresight on the development of Europeana. He is a gifted orator and I will also remember his brilliant performance at the debate on open content at the Europeana AGM in Leuven - he was awesome.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne Bergman (Federation of European Publishers): ‘Nick is a visionary; being around him is very rewarding. I have been lucky enough to share a few years as his fellow Network officer and I have thoroughly enjoyed the discussions we have had. I also appreciate that Nick comprehends that even with work-in-progress, one needs to understand what the other sectors require to sustain a sound activity. I am hoping we can continue our collaboration for cultural institutions and commercial outfits like publishers.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides being Chair of the Network, Nick served on the Executive Board, contributed to major Task Forces that dealt with the advancement of Europeana. He also made important contributions to the everyday running of the Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank him for all his efforts, and look forward to his continued participation in shaping Europeana.</p>"

        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Without doubt, the First World War at the beginning of the previous century and the fall of the Iron Curtain later greatly influenced the shaping of Europe as it is today. Both historical events have been covered by the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en%20\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">Europeana 1989</a> projects, collecting memories and digitising objects from people all over Europe with the help of Europeana’s partners in each country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a unique event at the European Parliament, MEPs and Parliament staff were invited to bring material related to the First World War and share their memories related to the events of 1989. It was the first time that both projects came together at one location, in the year that marks the centenary of WW1 and the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the collection days on December 2nd and 3rd, several MEPs – including Jávor Benedek from Hungary and Mircea Diaconu from Romania - made contributions to the <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/\">89voices.eu</a> project, which aims to collect oral histories related to the events in 1989 and complement Europeana 1989 with audio enhancements. The sound recordings and transcriptions in both English and the original language will be made available via <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/\">89voices.eu</a> and Europeana 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#ShapingEurope received a lot of mileage via social media. EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Günther Oettinger tweeted:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Preserving our culture is my priority. I support all projects working on digitising <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CulturalHeritage?src=hash\">#CulturalHeritage</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/2OY3Dlw5Ie\">http://t.co/2OY3Dlw5Ie</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShapingEurope?src=hash\">#ShapingEurope</a></p>\r\n— Günther Oettinger (@GOettingerEU) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOettingerEU/status/539820135532736512\">2 december 2014</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>See <a href=\"https://storify.com/Europeana/shapingeurope\">here</a> for more interesting tweets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event - hosted by MEP Sabine Verheyen, MEP Helga Tr?pel, MEP Silvia Costa, MEP Petra Kammerevert and MEP Fernando Maura Barandarián - concluded with a series of speeches by various MEPs and representatives of European cultural institutions, about the importance of culture to the formation of the European Union and Member States’ participation in Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989. Commissioner Tibor Navracsics, Culture, Education, Youth and Sport, Mr Javier Hernández-Ros, Head of Unit, Creativity, DG CONNECT and Ms Taja Vovk van Gaal, Academic Project Leader, European House of History introduced 'The importance of culture to the formation of the European Union'. The event also featured speeches by key representatives from both Europeana 1914-1918 &amp; Europeana 1989 initiatives from across Europe including Mr Bogdan Andrzej Zdrojewski, MEP and former minister for Culture, Poland; Mr Bruno Racine, Europeana Foundation Chair &amp; Président de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France; Mr Patrick Lefèvre, General Director of the Royal Library of Belgium. MEP Sabine Verheyen, member of Committee on Culture and Education said, ‘Today's event Shaping Europe, Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989, as well as the digitisation days, which took place yesterday and today, are an opportunity to bridge two major events of the 20th century (WWI and the fall of the Iron Curtain) and highlight Europeana as Europe's cultural heritage platform where memory institutions and users collaborate to show culture in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The digitisation of memories becomes more and more important… as we lose important contemporary witnesses over time. It is our responsibility to make sure that these memories stay alive and that they will still be present for future generations to come.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Tibor Navracsics, Culture, Education, Youth and Sport, said, ‘We have painful experiences but we have happy moments in our common history. Painful experiences of World War One and happy moments of the democratic transitions of the central and eastern European countries. We have to collect those experiences. The painful experiences in order to learn about the problems, so they won’t be repeated. And the happy moments in order to reinforce identity, democracy commitment and our loyalty to the world, the common world of the European nation. ‘The initiative of Europeana to collect all of these stories, build up the history of the everyday life of the 20th century Europe, is an important initiative to build a common European identity, which can be the foundation of the future European Union, can be a foundation of a community on European level and that's why we welcome this initiative and support it.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/tags/shapingeurope\">Listen to all the speeches on Soundcloud</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, a Europeana partner and active participant in 'Shaping Europe, also organises <a href=\"http://www.kbr.be/actualites/collectionDays/nl.html\">public collection days</a> for Europeana 1914-1918 on 5-6 December.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Henning Scholz, Partner and Operations Manager</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has brought together over 36 million digital objects from the online collections of more than 3,000 galleries, libraries, museums and archives from across Europe. While we will continue to be as inclusive as possible and collect the diversity of digital cultural heritage that is available, we will focus on the improvement of the quality of data; accessibility, accuracy or consistency of metadata and content are key components of the service we want to develop together with our data partners. This focus on improving quality has been highlighted as a key priority in <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">Europeana’s Strategy 2020</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can we achieve this? One of the things that has become clear in our consultation with aggregators and data partners is that there is a lack of clarity about what the minimum standards or acceptance criteria are for publication. Over the years, these acceptance criteria have been discussed and laid down in various documents and policies ranging from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/the-data-exchange-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">Data Exchange Agreement</a> to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">EDM mapping guidelines</a>, but there wasn’t one single document that clarifies all our policies for publication. Therefore, the Europeana Publication Policy brings all of the existing information into one concise document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Publishing Guide is intended to guide and help aggregators and data partners to share their data and improve Europeana in a uniform and consistent way. We developed a set of clear criteria to better understand what we need in order to ensure that our digital data is always authentic, trustworthy and robust. As the acceptance criteria were developed based on real life scenarios, it also facilitates their implementation in the day-to-day work of the Europeana Aggregation Team. In addition, the acceptance criteria were developed based on existing documentation and policies as mentioned above to ensure the Europeana Publication Policy is a concise reference document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope you find this a useful guide on metadata and content requirement for Europeana. If you find something missing or unclear, please let me know.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>Marian Lefferts of <a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/\">CERL</a> (a Europeana Cloud project partner) blogs about some of the content which will be ingested into Europeana Research, to allow academic use of data held in the Cloud we are building.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key strand of the Europeana Cloud project is the creation of services and tools targeted at researchers, collectively labelled Europeana Research, to allow scholarly use and re-use of the data held in our newly-built cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of that goal, much work is done on exploring what material <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> and <a href=\"http://theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a> hold that will be of interest to scholars and how this might be best made available to them. In addition, we are ingesting a great variety of data that we feel will be interesting to academics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is probably not unexpected that this ingestion covers digitised maps, manuscripts, incunables, archival materials, pamphlets, playbills, dissertations and journals, and visual materials such as portraits, architectural drawings, photographs, images of plaster casts, films and videos, further datasets have also been included for their special relevance to scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences (the core target audience of Europeana Research).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(10).jpg\" style=\"width: 792px; height: 576px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diego Ribero's map of the world, 1529. Image by <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006073562.html?start=9&amp;query=maps&amp;startPage=1&amp;qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby%2F*&amp;qt=false&amp;rows=24\">Wellcome Library, CC-BY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project has, for example, ingested the <a href=\"http://www.doabooks.org/\">Directory of Open Access Books</a>, which brings together metadata of Open Access books contributed by publishers who publish academic, peer reviewed books. Aggregators can integrate the records in their commercial services and libraries can integrate the directory into their online catalogues, helping scholars and students to discover the books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Library also aggregated the <a href=\"http://www.base-search.net/about/en/\">Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE)</a> – one of the world's most voluminous search engines for academic open-access web resources. BASE collects, normalises and indexes data repository servers that use OAI-PMH , and currently supports access to over 60 million documents from over 3,000 sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research organisations <a href=\"http://www.dans.knaw.nl/\">DANS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cessda.net/\">CESSDA</a> will contribute further data sets. DANS provides access to thousands of scientific datasets, e-publications and other research information in the Netherlands, while CESSDA is an umbrella organisation for the European national data archives (including DANS). Its major objective is to provide seamless access to data across repositories, nations, languages and research purposes, and to encourage standardisation of data and metadata, data sharing and knowledge mobility across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With all of this ingestion, it is important to stress that we are not only aggregating metadata for digital objects (including the all-important link to the object) but also the actual digital object. Both will be stored within the Cloud, with the aim of creating a supportive environment for innovative exploration and analysis of Europe’s digitised content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment we are speaking with content providers to determine how much content they can make available, what type of content, in what format and how this content can be delivered to the Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A substantial amount of the content will follow the tried-and-tested route of aggregation and enrichment by the team of The European Library, who will then deliver the metadata in the Europeana Data Model (EDM) format to Europeana and will transfer the digital objects to the Europeana Cloud. But we are also exploring how it might be possible to ingest data directly into the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking at issues such as what impact this has on the data ingestion workflows of Europeana and The European Library, how we can organise it so that enrichment of metadata takes place and how we can convert data in the original format (as it is stored in the Cloud) to EDM. This last point is aimed at facilitating integration of data into the tools that are being developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We strongly suspect that content ingestion may have further implications for EDM, specifically in terms of metadata transactions. There will likely be a need for more ‘administrative metadata’ related to the transactions (versioning, who/what/when was data enriched, record management, etc.). The definition of what would be required, and how this could be accommodated in EDM, will be developed in the course of 2015.</p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By the <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\">Europeana Food and Drink</a> team</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana Food and Drink \" src=\"/files/blogimages/db7552ae-ce74-42a1-94c8-c1438724ce51.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 441px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>CC-BY-SA <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\">Europeana Food and Drink</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is European food and drink cultural heritage all about? When we think about food and drink, we imagine traditional regional delicacies, wines and beers, secret ingredients, intricate production methods and the climatic impact on flavours and aromas. Combined with dining etiquette, eating rituals, emblematic traditions, nostalgic locations and historically meaningful events and occasions, food and drink form the foundation of culture. From very personal experiences to community-specific habits and national traditions, food and drink simply define who we are in all sorts of ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For centuries, local and national museums, libraries, archives, galleries and other heritage institutions have been collecting artefacts, images, paintings, books, manuscripts, audio videos and other objects to capture the traditions and to document the development of European food and drink culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/\">Europeana Food and Drink</a>, a project promoting the wider re-use of the digital cultural resources and supporting cultural heritage organisations in development of commercial partnerships with creative industries, will demonstrate that relevant digital content available through <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana </a>can provide a solid basis for the development of innovative and commercially viable applications and services. Digital content such as long forgotten recipes and cookbooks, images and drawings showing traditional foods and their preparation or remarkable food locations will be provided in the course of the project by our project partners. Furthermore, images of vintage tools and artefacts from the food and drink industry as well as sound recordings with traditional songs accompanying hunting and food celebrations and many other digital items harbouring unique stories are waiting to be revealed and revived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to support this creative process, Europeana Food and Drink has initiated its first <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/\">Open Innovation Challenge</a> ‘Re-using and promoting Europeana Food and Drink heritage content’. The desired solutions should help GLAMs (galleries, libraries, archives and museums), tourist agencies and the food and drink industry to improve their business and support the promotion of the European food and drink cultural heritage in the modern digital age. The Open Innovation Challenge is waiting for concepts of all kinds of products and services (videos, mobile apps, games, virtual exhibitions, educational tools, etc.) that can help improve the interactivity between heritage organisations and their audiences. Applicants may use any kind of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> or <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Labs</a> food and drink content. Thanks to Europeana API, you will gain access to more than 2,000 collections that you can incorporate into your products and applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition is open to all representatives of creative industries, start-ups, creative teams and non-profit organisations with ideas for innovative methods and solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until 20 December 2014, the interested parties may apply and submit their proposals through a specific challenge platform. More information on the Open Innovation Challenge, its requirements, guidelines and the access to the challenge platform can be found under: <a href=\"http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/\">http://foodanddrinkeurope.eu/challengeone/</a></p>"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>WW1 and the fall of the Iron Curtain, two events that shaped the Europe we know today will be commemorated at the European Parliament in unique style. A family history roadshow, digitising personal memorabilia of MEPs for these two seminal periods of European history, is taking place in the Parliament.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 2 and 3 December, Shaping Europe will mark the centenary commemoration of WW1 and the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain. Members of the European Parliament and Parliament staff are invited to bring along their personal and family memorabilia to be digitised and to share the stories behind them through Europeana’s two major thematic websites <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en%20\">Europeana1914-18.eu</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/\">Europeana1989.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monika Grütters, the German Minister of State for Culture said at the beginning of this year: ‘Europeana is a great bridge builder. In a wonderful way, it is founding connections between cultural institutions across Europe. It is making an important contribution to European cooperation and understanding across borders and tranches of history.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past three years, Europeana 1914-18 and Europeana 1989 have worked with citizens and our cultural institutions across Europe to create online archives that provide a unique perspective on these two seminal events, which can be shared worldwide. The two collection days at the Parliament, add to 150 held across Europe over the last 4 years and directly connect citizens to their cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana Foundation said: ‘Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989 connects our state history with our personal memories. They show the power of a Europe connected through its cultural institutions and our shared heritage’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEP and one of the initiators of the European Parliament's resolution on European Conscience and Totalitarianism (2009), Mr. Tunne-Väldo Kelam is one of those who have already shared their story through <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/\">Europeana 1989</a> and the 89 voices project. He said, 'One of our main objectives at the European Parliament has been to develop a balanced understanding and approach to European history as a whole. Because we noticed that our colleagues and friends in Western and Southern Europe know very little about what happened in the East. We should establish a political balance to recognise these [totalitarian, Nazi and Communist] crimes and express solidarity with the victims.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Senior representatives from the EU institutions, Member States and cultural organisations will gather at the commemoration, hosted by five members of the European Parliament and its committee of Culture and Education: Ms. Silvia Costa, Ms Sabine Verheyen, Ms. Petra Kammerevert, Mr Maura Barandarián and Ms. Helga Tr?pel. The event will mark the role of these two formative periods in shaping Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 3 December evening, a reception will be held to mark the importance of culture to the formation of the European Union and the role of the Member States in Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989. The reception will be attended by Commissioner Tibor Navracsics, Culture, Education, Youth and Sport and Mr Bodgan Andrzej Zdrojewski, MEP and former minister for Culture, Poland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To follow developments on social media, please use <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ShapingEurope%20\">#ShapingEurope</a>.</p>\r\n"

Then get in touch with Susan to discuss it and set a deadline for your submission. Once your idea is approved, please use the following guidelines to ensure your blog is Pro-ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/c76578c6-582b-415d-bc4f-bee539746411.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 458px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Image: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006113350.html?start=1&amp;query=%22A+Turkish+man+sits+to+write+a+letter+as+two+women+watch+over+his+shoulder.%22&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">T</a><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/BibliographicResource_3000006113350.html?start=1&amp;query=%22A+Turkish+man+sits+to+write+a+letter+as+two+women+watch+over+his+shoulder.%22&amp;startPage=1&amp;rows=24\">he Wellcome Library</a> CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>We believe in brevity. So keep it succinct. We do not give you a word limit, but keep your article only as long as it needs to be.</li>\r\n    <li>If the previous point is too cryptic, a good way to determine the right length is to check if you have answered the who, what, why, when, where and how of your story.</li>\r\n    <li>Write for the layperson. Watch out for that jargon, because our readers come from a range of backgrounds and we want you to keep them in mind while writing. If your topic is about a technical development, then ensure that you have a layperson-friendly introduction explaining the relevance of your news to the cultural heritage sector.</li>\r\n    <li>Use examples to illustrate your points. Or anecdotes.</li>\r\n    <li>Look for a hook - something that will trap your reader’s attention. After all, if you take the trouble to write it, we want everyone to read it.</li>\r\n    <li>Leave out the self-promotion. Yes, you want everyone to know about your cool project. But let your work speak for itself.</li>\r\n    <li>If your blog post is about a development within a project, please ensure that you have cleared the content with all the relevant people.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Images</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>We’ll need at least one image to go with your article. If it is more than 500 words, then at least two. Sound clips and videos are also welcome.</li>\r\n    <li>Examples of such images are screenshots, project or organisation logos, event or group work photos etc. If you are unsure what image to use or cannot find an appropriate one, you could also use creative commons attributed image e.g. from Europeana or Wikimedia Commons. Please be aware that we can only publish images on our blog that are either out of copyright, or under at least a CC BY-SA licence.</li>\r\n    <li>Provide the appropriate attribution for the provided media files. For example: ‘Image: Vinos y Finos : Sanlucar de Barrameda, [1920-1925] Biblioteca Valenciana Digital (Public domain).’</li>\r\n    <li>If you are unsure about this please do not hesitate to ask.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Publishing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to get your article out there while it is still relevant. So please take the deadlines seriously. However, if you know that theres going to be a delay, please let us know as soon as possible. And likewise, we sometimes have to postpone the publication of articles due to external factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissemination</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your blog post is published, we will disseminate it on Twitter and sometimes through our newsletters or the Allez Culture Facebook group if relevant. If you are on Twitter, please do retweet once the blog link is out there. And if your blog is part of a campaign, please share the Twitter handle/ hashtags with us.</p>"

        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>A series of blogs by Wiebe de Jager, Marketing Manager at Europeana</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>#1: Links, texts, images &amp; attribution</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think a moment about the main aim of using Facebook in your cultural heritage institution. You probably want to reach as many people as possible and tell them about your news, or showcase highlights and hidden gems from your collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If maximising your reach is indeed your main goal, it’s very important to keep in mind that the length and ‘interestingness’ of your updates greatly influences the reach of each message you post. In other words: short messages with a clear call to action, accompanied by an interesting image will be seen by more people than long, text-only posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be to the point</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook uses an advanced newsfeed algorithm that determines what is shown in its users’ timelines. Posts that generate lots of engagement right after posting (ie. people liking or sharing the update) have a <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2014/09/18/news-feed-algorithm-change-improving-timeliness-of-posts/\">higher</a> chance of being shown in someone’s newsfeed. Therefore it’s best to keep the text in your updates as short as possible. Make each post relevant to your audience by studying the results of earlier posts and adapt your messages accordingly. And write like a human being, not like an institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some studies <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-ideal-length-of-everything-online-according-to-science\">suggest</a> that Facebook posts with just 40 characters (less than this sentence!) receive 86% more engagement than posts with a higher character count. Want to say more? Then write a more extensive post on your blog and link to it. Be to the point and supress the urge to provide too much context in your social media updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another factor that greatly influences the reach of your updates is timeliness. Facebook has been <a href=\"http://www.insidefacebook.com/2014/09/18/news-feed-algorithm-change-improving-timeliness-of-posts/\">changing its algorithm</a>, boosting posts that are somehow related to trending topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Berlin wall\" src=\"/files/blogimages/ceeaf0be-8abf-44cd-9968-a5e29923f234.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 397px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Europeana/photos/a.209570118667.132127.10261403667/10152550638578668/?type=1\">Europeana</a> CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana/photos/a.209570118667.132127.10261403667/10152550638578668/?type=1\">This post </a>on the fall of the Berlin Wall for example (with the hashtag #BerlinWall25 both in the text and in the image) got more than 259 likes and reached nearly 13,000 people. Compare that to an update about Rembrandt’s self-portraits, posted just a couple of days later: this update only reached about 2,000 people, and got 49 likes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Call to action</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to include not more than one ‘call to action’ in each update: people have to make decisions all day long, so adding more decisions can result in them not taking any action at all. Make the call to action short and clear, and make sure that you put the call to action in the beginning of your message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, and please don’t put #too #many #hashtags #in #your #Facebook #message; in a sense, they’re calls to actions too, diluting your main call to action. And it doesn’t increase the readability of your message either. One or two hashtags like #Onthisday or thematic hashtags such as #WW1 or #Picasso will do, ‘connecting’ your update to those from other people and institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Facebook2a.jpg\" style=\"width: 513px; height: 550px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A typical status update by Europeana – one image, short explanation, one hashtag and a call to action. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana/posts/10152530997133668\">Europeana</a> CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Say it with pictures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we often say that images are the currency of the web. It is <a href=\"http://www.ragan.com/Main/Articles/Infographic_Photo_posts_get_120_more_engagement_on_46290.aspx%20\">estimated</a> that a post with a picture gets 120% more engagement and 84% more link clicks than a post without. For us, surfacing interesting images from our partners’ collections via social media is one of the most important purposes of our social media activities, as our aim is to highlight the most interesting items in existing and new collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We identify images that have the most viral potential using the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/pinterest-facebook-for-heritage-institutions-open-archives-2-1\">S.P.E.E.D criteria</a> (more about this in the next blog post) and publish those on Facebook at regular intervals. We only use openly licensed images, ie. images that are in the public domain or have a creative commons licence. We attribute the creator, the image provider and we provide a link to the source of the image. We want the images we share to speak for themselves, so we don’t use low resolution or watermarked images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Facebook2b.jpg\" style=\"width: 486px; height: 563px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Each update contains an image attribution and link to the source. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana/photos/a.209570118667.132127.10261403667/10152546928098668/?type=1\">Europeana</a> CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have evidence that by surfacing just one interesting image, traffic to a specific collection can increase by over 57,000 percent. We will tell you more about that in a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/2233747/maximized?p_p_auth=ZDQz1ZaQ\">forthcoming white paper</a> about our collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.retronaut.com/%20\">Retronaut</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, on social media, your content is the star of the show, not you. Keep that in mind while composing updates. Always try to think from your target audience’s perspective, and make yourself stand out from the noise.</p>"

        body: "<p><em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/vicky-garnett/20/6b3/766\">Vicky Garnett of Trinity College Dublin</a> (a Europeana Cloud partner) blogs about her recent experience at the <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2014/10/british-library-labs-symposium-2014.html\">British Library Labs Symposium</a> in London, and the relevance for Europeana Cloud.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Cloud is currently investigating the way in which humanities and social science researchers use big datasets from cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with my colleague at Trinity College Dublin, <a href=\"https://www.tcd.ie/trinitylongroomhub/the-institute/people/Edmond.php\">Dr Jennifer Edmond</a>, we’ve been talking to institutions in the GLAM sector to find out what web services they offer (such as APIs). We’ve also spoken to researchers who are actively using the data contained in APIs. Our findings will be presented at a workshop in The Hague in December and included in an upcoming report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the institutions featured in our work is the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a>. We were therefore pleased to be part of a one-day symposium on November 3rd, held to mark the end of the first phase of the <a href=\"http://labs.bl.uk/\">BL Labs</a> project and to present the winners of the BL Labs 2014 competition. Since there are many parallels between the work of BL Labs and that of Europeana Cloud, it made for an interesting day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The winners of this year’s competition covered both the highly practical and the highly whimsical. <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2014/06/text-to-image-linking-tool-tilt.html\">TILT (Text to Image Linking Tool)</a> from Desmond Schmidt and Anna Gerber at the University of Queensland, Australia, offers a practical solution to almost un-OCR-able handwritten manuscripts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVbDawo3Vyc\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digitalvictorianist.com/\">Bob Nicholson</a> from Edge Hill University created a <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/digital-scholarship/2014/06/victorian-meme-machine.html\">Victorian Meme Machine</a>, which aims to use crowdsourcing, data-mining and social media to bring the Victorian sense of humour to the 21st Century. Both used content contained within the British Library collections to bring their tools to life and the development of these tools was supported by the BL Labs team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FN1ZSAz2vMg\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Humanities Scholars Should Remember their Skills </strong><br />\r\nThe uses of digital content and the impact of these increasingly technological methodologies was the basis for <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/history/people/peoplelists/person/336034\">keynote speaker Tim Hitchcock</a>’s lecture, or rather as he put it ‘worrying in public’. He posited his talk through the lens of the ‘macroscope’, a term he used with much caution. Hitchcock worried that in the scramble to find the bigger picture through distant reading - and in the light of all this miraculous and impressive data gathering, and cross-disciplinary work - that Humanities researchers might forget the essence of what makes them ‘Humanities’ researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Methodologies in Digital Humanities are almost moving towards the social sciences, looking at, for example, network analysis, GIS techniques and many other tools that require big data to find meaningful results. This is, Tim says, important and drives knowledge forward. But he urges Humanities researchers to remember the skills they have within their own fields: that of close reading and obtaining and ‘cleaning up’ small data for deeper analysis. The irony for Tim is that in the rush to use big data we miss 90% of what's actually there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the back of these thought-provoking words, the discussion was opened up to the floor, wherein future directions for Humanities were discussed. One commenter suggested that in the ever-increasing fight for funding, those in the Humanities were in a difficult position where they were almost compelled to turn to cross-disciplinary research in order to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The afternoon brought a slightly more upbeat tone, with demonstrations and presentations from some of the ongoing projects between the British Library and the BL Labs project. Daniel Wolff and Adam Tovell from the Digital Music Lab at BL showcased their digital methods for musicologists, while Peter Balman (winner of the British Library’s Innovation Challenge) outlined his work to develop a tool that will analyse the use of British Library digital collections, who is using them, where they are using them and how they are using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Footbridges, not Suspension Bridges </strong><br />\r\nThe next two talks spoke directly about the work of BL Labs, its impact and the lessons that have been learnt. BL Labs Manager Mahendra Mahay began by putting the work of the first two years of BL Labs into the context of the Library and its mission to address the needs of researchers wanting to access the vast wealth of items within both its concrete and virtual walls. Technical lead Ben O’Steen then presented his work to develop ‘footbridges not suspension bridges’ to provide the means for people to access and reuse the data. In other words, a footbridge fulfills the function of a bridge: it gets the user to the other side without getting their feet wet. A suspension bridge does exactly the same job except that there are more people using it and it looks a lot fancier! With so many projects being short-lived and often merely exploratory, O’Steen’s aim is to provide a solution that is functional to the task without over-complicating an otherwise simple requirement. Why build a suspension bridge if it’s only going to be used once and barely looked at?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Five Key Lessons </strong><br />\r\nThe final presentation from the British Library was from the Principal Investigator of the British Library Labs project, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamfarquhar\">Adam Farquhar</a>. He outlined the 5 key lessons that he and his team have learnt so far along the way:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. More is more! </strong>The more digital content you have, the more opportunity you give people to reuse it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Less is more (tools and services). </strong>It is not our job to pick winners but this can conflict with how we develop and deliver tools and services. The answer is not just to provide tools. It’s to provide tools that work for researchers and meet their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Bring your own tools.</strong> Similarly to lesson no. 2, we can’t build everything. We need to let people pick and choose the tools they want to use with our content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. We have to let people be creative.</strong> Put in place the ability for people to create tools, projects or collections themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Allow people to start small and finish big. </strong>Allow and encourage users to start with an obtainable goal but ensure that it can be scaled up if necessary. The scaleable part could be the collection, the methodology or the overall output.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The additional lesson I took from this was perhaps an unintended one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery(11).jpg\" style=\"width: 1600px; height: 1600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Edison Phonograph in action. Photo Vicky Garnett / 2014.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the main symposium, we were invited by composer <a href=\"http://www.sarahangliss.com/biography\">Sarah Angliss</a> to create our own voice recording on a wax cylinder. A few curious but cautious individuals gathered next to her Edison Standard Phonograph, unclear and unsure what we were about to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her partner in crime then played us a wax cylinder of a woman singing from nearly 100 years ago. The sound quality was tinny, and the delivery of the woman’s voice coming out of this spinning black tube was almost a parody of Music Hall, yet as Sarah explained, these were artefacts of the technology and were not necessarily representing the way people truly sounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She further demonstrated this when she changed the phonograph head, replaced the recorded cylinder with a blank one (now made in Brighton) and asked us all to say something very clearly into the phonograph’s horn. We had to speak loudly and clearly, being sure to ‘en-un-ci-ate’ each syllable to ensure the recording head was sufficiently vibrated to capture the sound on the wax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutifully, we all trotted out a line of ‘Mary Had a Little Lamb’ into the phonograph, with much giggling, and showboating. We played it back. We heard nothing. Our attempts at speaking clearly had not caused a big enough ripple. The equipment was all set up, we had shouted about Mary’s ‘snow-white fleeced’ lamb and yet still nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point a few members of the group drifted away. This was a shame but served as a tidy metaphor for technology in general, echoing much of what had been discussed over the course of the day. <strong>Keep it simple. If it doesn’t work first time, people won’t come back for a second try.</strong></p>"

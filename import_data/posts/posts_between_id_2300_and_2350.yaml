        title: 'How we developed the Europeana Foundation Business Plan 2021'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On Europeana Pro today, we launch the ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-business-plan-2021\">Europeana Foundation Business Plan - Towards a digital public space for cultural heritage</a>’. In this post, we look at how we have approached our business planning during these turbulent times.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The business plan outlines\_the areas of work that the Europeana Foundation will focus on - our activities on improving data quality and infrastructures, on improving engagement with our collections and on building capacity for digital transformation. Equally importantly, we outline the philosophies and thought processes that drive us to play our role in supporting the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation. So who decides what’s important to the Foundation? And how are those ideas shaped?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New boards for the Europeana Foundation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the governance structure of the Europeana Foundation changed. We welcomed both a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#supervisory-board\">Supervisory Board</a> of seven, who supervise the management of the Foundation and help set strategy and policy, and an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#advisory-board\">Advisory Board</a> of 17, who represent the sector at large, providing expert insight, knowledge and recommendations relating to the strategic direction of the Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the very first tasks for these new boards was to stop and think about what the Foundation is, what it represents and how we see our role in the sector. Put simply, to think about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">what is important to the Europeana Foundation</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A series of workshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a series of facilitated workshops, the Advisory Board discussed a range of issues related to the world around us and how they affect the cultural heritage sector, including the effect of the pandemic on our institutions and working practices, the implications of climate change, and the sector’s role in developing a digital public space that is equitable, inclusive and green.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We discussed further the issues we felt most strongly about, both within the board and then with groups of Foundation staff in order to start to visualise the world we want to operate in. There were, naturally, many differing points of view throughout these workshops. But through discussion and using a variety of tools, we started to discover common ground, and it is this that lays the foundations for our new business plan, which outlines the themes that will guide us over the next 18-24 months and the activities we’ll undertake this calendar year.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking towards the world we want, we talked about the importance of participation in the enjoyment and use of digital culture, and how we can make it easier for our audiences.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked about collaboration, which is and always has been at the heart of the way the Europeana Initiative works, and how we can deepen our partnerships and use collaboration as a tool for transformation. Europeana is after all, only possible because of\_ the collaboration of three interlinked expert organisations who share the vision of a cultural heritage sector transformed by digital, and a Europe transformed by culture - the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we talked about diversity and inclusivity, and the work we need to do to ensure that everyone feels welcome, represented, equal and safe both when working within the broader Europeana Initiative and when accessing and using Europeana’s digital collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In looking towards the world we want, we have to acknowledge its challenges - such as climate change. That’s important to the boards and to staff, and we are working out what our role is, where we fit, and what concrete steps we can take.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have to see how we fit in the context of our world’s big society, one that is evolving, particularly in its use of digital technologies in every aspect of life. A digital society needs a trustworthy digital public space; it’s an idea that is increasingly coming up both in civic and political forums in Europe and we need to make sure we’re part of it in the way that is most beneficial to the sector and its audiences.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What happens next</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are working through these themes and have agreed to make them priorities both for this business plan and beyond. We are grateful to the Advisory Board and to Foundation staff who have participated in this process so far.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll see the principles of participation, collaboration and inclusivity reflected across all our activities - from our work on content and metadata, to copyright, education, editorial and events. And we’ll continue to work on how to integrate them, developing actionable strategies. Keep an eye on Europeana Pro News for updates on these topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we'll continue to work on how to keep those strong driving forces at the top of our minds even on the days when the deadlines are short and focus is on the detail. Because they really are at the heart of the Europeana Foundation and the good we can do.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why we are running the pilot programme</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From providing tools, services, and resources to organising events and workshops, digital transformation is the driving force of everything we do at Europeana. Our aim is to equip cultural heritage professionals with the skills and expertise to help their own institutions and the sector in its transition to digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.den.nl/den-academie\">DEN Academy</a>, we are delighted to launch the pilot of a Leadership Programme on Digital Strategy &amp; Innovation. It is based on a leadership programme that is already being carried out in the Netherlands and was developed in close cooperation with sector-wide advisory councils, archives, libraries, museums, provincial cultural heritage support organisations and digital cultural heritage hubs.The DEN Academy is founded by DEN, a Dutch knowledge institute for digitisation in the cultural sector, and training bureaus <a href=\"https://www.injoin.nl/\">Injoin</a> and <a href=\"http://mk5060.com/\">MK5060 full circle projects</a>. It aims to inspire cultural professionals to address strategic issues revolving around digital transformation. The pilot of the DEN Academy Leadership programme is part of Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">capacity building activities</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Leadership skills for a digital future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme is offered as a pilot because its goal is to collect recommendations on how to translate programmes to an international context and offer them in a financially sustainable way. Offering capacity building on an international scale presents unique challenges, like having to select the language in which a course is taught, cultural differences among the participants, or even differences in national laws that may affect one’s working environment. We hope to explore these challenges through the pilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pilot will focus on developing the leadership skills necessary to guide a cultural organisation towards its digital transformation. At this stage, it is targeted at decision makers and key stakeholders in organisations with substantial capacity to initiate and lead digital transformation. Participants already possess a high level of digital literacy and are in a position where they can demonstrate leadership in their organisation. The programme will take place during six half-day intensive training sessions in the next three months. It will provide the leaders of the participating organisations with a strategic toolbox, peer group sharing, and plenty of food for thought to equip them to lead digital transformation in a structured and impactful way, driven by the vision that digital transformation in the sector requires decisive leadership and dedicated action.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top down digital capacity building</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through developing expertise, tools, policies, and encouraging partnerships that foster innovation, our aim is to transform the sector and contribute to an open, knowledgeable, digitally savvy and creative society. We always look for ways to accelerate digital transformation within the sector. Our approach is twofold: we offer bottom up support through helping professionals gain digital literacy and fluency, and top down support by encouraging organisations to shift their focus towards digital. For this, an organisational mindset and leadership skills geared towards digital transformation become essential, which is what this programme aims to achieve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The focus of the programme is to empower emerging digital leaders to create a solid digital strategy for their organisation, inspired by research and trends in digital transformation in the cultural sector. Two cohorts will receive training during this pilot. The first cohort is made up of participants of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators Forum</a>. We wanted to work with this group to also get insight into how aggregators could be involved in delivering capacity building opportunities on a national or thematic level. A second cohort will begin in summer 2021, which will be open for all <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> members to apply for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on these workshops, we will publish&nbsp;recommendations about building such programmes on an international scale in summer 2021. Keep an eye on our website and social channels to find out more about the outcomes. If you’d like to be considered for the second cohort of participants, you can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join the Europeana Network Association</a> and stay updated on the next call and much more. If you’d like to hear more about our work on building digital capacity, you can <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=70e7d06bec\">sign up to&nbsp;receive updates</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a graduate of the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Athens I have always been inspired by the cultural sector. Passionate about museums and their important role in cultural and social policies as places for learning, inspiration, democracy, integration, understanding and pleasure, I followed a Masters Course (MA) at the University of Athens in&nbsp;Museum Studies. This was with the collaboration of Department of History and Archeology, and Conservation of Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last ten years I have been actively engaged&nbsp;in cultural management through my experience at the Ministry of Culture and as an active member of European cultural projects and communities. My dream is one day to create my own museum, The Museum of Philosophy, curating and spreading ideas and values that change the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently I am completing my PhD academic research into cultural diplomacy as a soft power in the <a href=\"https://pedis.uop.gr/\">Faculty of Political Studies and International Relationships</a>. I am also working as a museologist and Curator of Public Engagement at the Archaeological Museum of Patras, and at the <a href=\"https://www.culture.gov.gr/en/SitePages/default.aspx\">Ministry of Culture</a>, responsible for audience development, communication and educational activities, exhibitions and cultural tales in the region of Western Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am an elected member of the Directory Board of<a href=\"https://www.diazoma.gr/en/\"> DIAZOMA</a>, a movement of people sharing the same vision for cultural heritage. Our mission is to help, protect, restore and promote monuments especially ancient theatres by mobilizing both citizens and state. I am actively engaged in European programs such as Creative Industries and new models of&nbsp; participatory cultural governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges of your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ι would like to be able to communicate the idea that culture is the living cell for strong ‘immune’ societies. Culture, both tangible and intangible, together with the innovative tools of digital transformation, can promote mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue among citizens and countries. Α big challenge for me is managing to engage an audience less likely to attend or participate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My experience as a curator, of working with different people’s cultural content, has been the part that I love more! From my point of view, cultural organisations, associations and communities must be seen as living laboratories for social innovation, as contributors to sustainable growth, cultural democracy and peace. The cultural heritage sector must be a shared resource and a common place. Our world needs a beating cultural heart to survive!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In last year, the consequences of the COVID-19 global pandemic have revealed the vulnerability of the cultural sector in the world. The reports underline the severity challenges faced by the sector globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe in the vision of Europeana, and now is the moment to encourage Europeans and all world citizens to place culture, together with education, at the heart of&nbsp;recovery and revival. As a source of creativity, innovation and enjoyment, Europeana Initiative projects can shape the global cultural citizenship identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am really excited! At our recent ENA Member’s Council meeting, I had the chance to meet,&nbsp; in the digital space,&nbsp; other members and get to know the great work that has been done so far. I would like to contribute to all discussions and documents about Europeana’s strategies and policies to create a more participatory model. Europeana has the potential to stimulate creativity and innovation and generate community cohesion with a broader participation in the co-creation of&nbsp; its cultural content. And I am here to work&nbsp; in order to share and spread this mission!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>It is time\_to launch the fifth call for proposals within the Europeana Research Grants Programme to support events around the theme Crowdsourcing and Research. This year, part of the programme’s budget (EUR 25,000) is allocated to special prizes for tutorials showcasing innovative ways to use digital cultural heritage in Higher Education.\_<b> </b></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>About the Research Grants Programme</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme began in 2016 as a way to support research projects led by early-career scholars making use of Europeana resources and tools.\_ In 2019, we decided to change its format to foster collaborations between cultural heritage professionals and researchers by supporting events that can bring them together. The response we received was very encouraging, and together with the institutions awarded a grant, we started putting in the pipeline a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-winners-of-the-europeana-research-grants-programme-2019\">series of initiatives</a>, but in a matter of months, the COVID 19 pandemic made in-person events simply unfeasible. We were delighted to see how the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-winners-of-the-europeana-research-grants-programme-2019\">grant recipients</a> were able to adapt their initial ideas, also to digital formats. At the same time, we had to wait, and wait again, before launching a new call. Now we feel it is the time to facilitate opportunities that help us look towards the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 2021 call</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year’s call focuses on the theme Crowdsourcing and Research. The Europeana Strategy 2020 - 2025 foresees crowdsourcing as a way to improve metadata quality on Europeana. The aim of this call is to explore how the cultural heritage sector can make the best use of this participatory method with the collaboration of researchers and for the benefit of them. We have allocated a total budget of EUR 21,000 to assist cultural heritage or research institutions in the organisation of events adopting this perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome proposals for conferences, workshops, seminar series, summer/autumn/winter/spring schools or training activities.\_They can address the needs of a specific sector of cultural heritage or it in general, as well as the needs of specific academic disciplines that use digital cultural heritage as a resource for teaching, learning and research.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are particularly looking for events with outputs that can deliver value to a wider audience for the long term, in written or audiovisual form: from reports and whitepapers to training tutorials and\_video interviews. The grants are for physical events to be held between January and July 2022.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The special prizes\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe in the value of digital cultural heritage for teaching and learning at all levels. Europeana Research wants to do more for Higher Education. This year, part of the overall budget is allocated to two special prizes. They will be awarded to cultural heritage professionals, professors or researchers willing to design and make tutorials that can show the potential of digital cultural heritage and tools. The special prizes are response not only to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has obliged universities to move their courses online, but also to an increasing interest of professors and university students towards Europeana as a provider of resources, services and tools.\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proposals that foresee the reuse of them are particularly welcome. The tutorials can be delivered between October 2021 and March 2022, also in a language other than English; in this case, the video must be accompanied by English subtitles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find out more and apply</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deadline for submissions is 31 May 2021 and the awarded proposals will be announced on Europeana Pro and social media by July 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You apply for and can find out more about the research grants and the special prizes, including eligibility, terms and conditions and how to submit your proposals, through the link below.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\">Enrichment</a>&nbsp;plays a fundamental role in Europeana’s activities. In our context, enrichment can be defined as generating metadata from the data provided by our partners, adding extra value to the data we receive. We use the combination of original and enriched metadata for indexing our records, and this lets us build functionalities that allow people to search and browse our collections, and receive recommendations. Achieving automatic enrichment using machine learning algorithms is one of the objectives of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Europeana Strategy 2020-2025</a><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/EU2020StrategyDigital_May2020.pdf\">,</a> triggering projects such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Saint George on a Bike</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana's R&amp;D team is exploring how computer vision techniques (systems which can make sense of visual data) can improve the enrichment Europeana conducts. We decided to start a pilot on image classification, where we build a model that is able to classify images from digitised cultural heritage objects into a set of predefined categories. We believe that a system trained with the selected categories would prove useful in enriching our collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Deep learning techniques, based on a certain type of mathematical model called neural networks, are the method of choice for this type of problem. In order to train a neural network, we need to obtain a training dataset containing a large amount of images already classified into selected categories. In simple terms: if we show a computer model images of paintings and tell the model that all these images are paintings, we train that model to recognise whether images it has never seen are&nbsp; a painting or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first steps necessary to build the image classification model were to select a target vocabulary and gather a training dataset using the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search\">Europeana Search API</a>; explore how we did this below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Defining a vocabulary for classification</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Controlled vocabularies are sets of predefined and uniquely identified concepts, which can be used to index data and make it interoperable. The use of vocabularies in information retrieval is a convenient way to organise and reference knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we use concepts from vocabularies (identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers, URIs) as part of the metadata for indexing cultural heritage objects. For this project, we focused on a selection of concepts from the Europeana Entity Collection, which have equivalences with concepts from the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT). This vocabulary was originally gathered for organising the sourcing of content for our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections\">thematic collections</a>. We included 20 categories like photographs, paintings, sculptures, clothing, and jewellery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Accessing data using the Europeana Search API</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once we had our vocabulary, we wanted to access images belonging to the different categories for training our model. We did this through the Europeana Search API, one of the many interfaces that allow us to retrieve cultural heritage objects displayed at <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">europeana.eu</a>. Given a query and a set of parameters, the Search API will return a machine readable response containing the metadata of the resulting objects. The API response serves the data following the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our setting, we considered that there was only one possible category for each image. This allowed us to assemble an annotated dataset by querying the Search API for images corresponding to the different concepts in our vocabulary, and using this concept as the label. In this way we assembled the dataset automatically and no manual annotation was necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since we wanted our dataset to follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles, we uniquely identified both the concepts and the cultural heritage objects retrieved, and we only used openly licensed content. The metadata served by the Search API is under an open license, whereas the content of the cultural heritage objects might be subject to copyright. For this pilot we only considered images free of copyright by setting the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search#reusability\">reusability parameter</a> as open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our case, we wanted to retrieve objects indexed with the different concepts of the vocabulary. Instead of using the human readable version of the concepts, we made a query for the concept URI directly by using the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search#sf_skos_concept\">skos_concept parameter</a> (one of the search parameters of the API).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were interested in keeping track of the objects used to assemble our dataset. For each object retrieved we stored relevant information in a CSV file. The images will eventually need to be downloaded and stored in disk for training the image classification model.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The image training dataset can now be used for building an image classification model that will output one of the concepts of the vocabulary given an input image. We are planning to continue our work by evaluating whether this dataset contains enough information for training an image classification model, and assessing whether the resulting model is suitable for automatic enrichment. We will share updates through Europeana Pro news!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope this post encourages engineers and researchers interested in experimenting with cultural heritage to use our Search API for assembling datasets for machine learning, and in particular to use our collections for training and applying computer vision algorithms!

                body: "<h3><strong>In a few sentences, can you describe what Viziel is?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Viziel is a visual information platform, where an image is a unique data point. Every image is accompanied by a few metadata fields and a reference to the source website of the data provider for further details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Where did the idea for Viziel come from, and how did you start working towards making it a reality?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have always been drawn to visual arts, not just from the aesthetic perspective but also because it is a rich and informative medium, with numerous visual details, artistic styles and attached stories and narratives. As a person from the tech industry, it was quite frustrating to realise that now that so much content is within easy reach, the visual arts are often still not considered to be an important enough source of information. Books, music, and film all have a myriad of platforms for discovery and consumption, but the visual arts are still often excluded. This creates a huge gap in knowledge and in the current paradigm of information accessibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is how the idea of Viziel was born. With the research I’ve done, I’ve realised that the solution should not be limited to visual arts but to comprise all visual content with informational value. For instance, you could explore a visual story of calligraphy through time periods, countries, styles, techniques, with every image leading to detailed knowledge from reliable resources. I wanted to include as many relevant options for users to engage with this heritage as well: buying a book, visiting an exhibition, joining an online course.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the beginning of 2021 I bootstrapped this idea into a prototype, showcasing how the subject of European cultural heritage can be explored via image thanks to Europeana’s API.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you choose Europeana as a source of data? Are you looking to integrate more cultural heritage data sources in the future?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Having no background in this area, as part of my research, I attended a few events on the topic of cultural heritage digitisation in the past years, where I first heard about Europeana. Naturally, dealing with a single source that aggregates data from numerous institutions was an optimal choice. Another reason was that Europeana employs cross-disciplinary teams of professionals who were very supportive from the beginning to the launch of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding other cultural heritage resources, as I’ve mentioned, the idea is to present all types of content, so definitely yes. Having more data on a platform enables reaching wider audiences and obtaining comprehensive knowledge on specific topics.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Colleagues at Europeana tried to help you along with using the Europeana APIs, how was that experience for you?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indeed, without the help of technical experts, it would be hard to understand the data structure. Data digitisation is a sophisticated process, not just as data science but also as data quality. During the development of Viziel, API-imported data was normalised in several ways, including removing duplicates and&nbsp;using English as one language for grouping and descriptions, names and dates formats optimisation. And even that was not sufficient to produce desirable results, as often Viziel-important data fields were missing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Are there any improvements you think would greatly improve the experience of using Europeana's APIs?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From my technical background, I can say that Europeana's APIs are very well structured and documented. In the framework of building Viziel, I found certain terms quite tricky to understand. This exactly comes to the point of data quality which is a subject of joined efforts, Europeana, providing institutions and those who use API to build digital products with high user traction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the future of Viziel? What will you be working on in the coming months/years?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Viziel aims to be a source of all information that can be best represented by images. Whether it is artwork, documentary photography, scientific artefacts, caricatures or illustrations, these should all be wired into a centralised AI-powered network of information. After featuring openly licensed cultural heritage the plan is to host copyrighted content. My intention is to convince institutions to open up their copyright-protected images within a safe digital framework in order to enable their global visibility, understand their users via analytics, tell their professional story in the most intuitive simple way and offer direct engagement with sought or just discovered information.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Analysing Intellectual Property frameworks&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/indices\">inDICES project</a> aims to support cultural and creative industries, policy-makers and decision-makers to understand the social and economic impact of digitisation of cultural heritage. This goal is partly being realised through a legal study (shortly available on the inDICES platform) describing how the current and upcoming European Intellectual Property (IP) legal framework affects the activities of cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a previous <a href=\"https://indices-culture.eu/indices-empowering-ipr-for-cultural-heritage-institutions/\">analysis</a> we addressed the impact of different IP regulations and the new rules of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.172.01.0056.01.ENG\">Open Data Directive</a>. Now, we present the findings of our second, most recent, report ‘Legal comparative analysis for multi-level relationship involving CHIs’. It provides an overview of national IP laws applicable to cultural heritage institutions in Belgium, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain and Sweden. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Exceptions and limitations&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We selected and reviewed the following exceptions and limitations to copyright (acts for which no prior authorisation from the rightowners is required) as being most relevant for a cultural heritage institution’s activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the preservation exception, allowing for the creation of copies of works in collections;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the exception that permits the communication of works through&nbsp;dedicated terminals on an institution's premises;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the use of protected works for advertising their exhibitions or sales;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the exception that allows&nbsp;cultural heritage institutions to perform activities of text and data mining.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We found that, because the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:en:HTML\">Infosoc Directive</a> does not oblige national legislators to include these exceptions in their national law, a variety of solutions could be found in the different Member States. None of the countries we examined had implemented all the suggested exceptions. The single exception that has been implemented in all&nbsp;was the preservation exception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the new <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj\">CDSM Directive</a>, once implemented, will improve the situation with regards to both the preservation exception and the text and data mining exception as they will be mandatory and subject to similar conditions for their application.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Types of works relevant for cultural heritage institutions&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second part of the report reviewed the copyright laws in the selected countries by types of works. We focused on out-of-commerce works (‘OOCWs’), orphan works, and the protection of non-original photographs.&nbsp;Our study showed that the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj\">CDSM Directive</a> has set up a new regime allowing for the use of OOCWs which may offer interesting new exploitation opportunities for cultural heritage institutions. However, the concrete application of the regime will depend on national situations, as different rules apply in cases where representative collecting organisations exist or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the harmonisation of the legal framework governing orphan works, the uses of such works remain considerably burdensome in practice and is therefore the subject of much criticism by cultural heritage institutions in all jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The protection of non-original photographs is especially relevant for the creation and/or protection of digital surrogates. The matter, however, remains unharmonised at the EU level which leads to substantial differences in the scope and duration of protection of such photographs in the Member States. This unharmonised situation will change (only in relation to works of visual arts) once Article 14 of the CDSM Directive is implemented at national level, as it precludes protection for non-original reproductions of works of visual arts in the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The report also explores problems resulting from further non-harmonised copyright rules in EU countries that may impact on activities of digitisation, online content sharing and transformative uses of works by and for cultural heritage institutions. Other diverging national provisions relate to differences in the duration of protection for particular works (like posthumous works) and specific regulations diverging the copyright domain that aim at protecting works of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The complexity of copyright rules and the lack of (full) harmonisation of EU copyright law undoubtedly creates obstacles for cultural heritage institutions who want to go digital and to develop their activities in the information society. The inDICEs project aims to help them overcome some of these challenges by providing guidance on how to navigate a complicated copyright landscape, evaluating the current legal framework and providing recommendations. We will carry out research on licensing practices and how cultural heritage institutions share their content online, and will closely monitor the implementation of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj\">CDSM Directive</a> and the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.172.01.0056.01.ENG\">Open Data Directive</a> in the selected jurisdictions. Stay tuned and follow news on the <a href=\"https://indices-culture.eu/\">project website</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more, you can also join the inDICES’ project’s<a href=\"https://participate.indices-culture.eu/conferences/secondconsultationworkshop\"> second consultation workshop on digital transitions in the cultural heritage sector</a>, which will be run through two online sessions on 20 and 21 April. The first session aims to explore emergent forms of digital cultural production/re-production, participation and re-use of content in the Digital Single Market. The second session provides a brief introduction to rights management in cultural organisations, and focuses on sharing collections sustainably and meaningfully.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>How can Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) help us to enrich and research cultural heritage collections? How can ML models be adapted to the complexities of historical and cultural material it has not been trained for? Which biases can we reveal in historical collections? How can we gain new perspectives by using AI in researching cultural heritage data? Our new webinar series will discuss these questions with you and present projects and people who are reflecting on exactly these matters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>‘EuropeanaTech x AI’</strong> will take place every two weeks, beginning on 23 April. Each session will introduce a new project or research topic related to AI in the cultural heritage sector. Every webinar will last around 90 minutes and will be held via Zoom. In the concluding session&nbsp;we will meet with all the speakers in a virtual marketplace to mingle, discuss the projects and exchange ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This webinar series - and especially the concluding session - is a work in progress. If you want to contribute, please <a href=\"mailto:larissa.borck@gmx.de\">get in touch with me (Larissa Borck</a>). We particularly welcome short project pitches or topics for discussion at the virtual marketplace! We are also open to ideas on how to enhance synergies with other efforts within or outside the Europeana community, for example the <a href=\"http://ai4lam.org\">AI4LAM</a> community.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Dates and topics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EuropeanaTech x AI webinars will kick off on <strong>Friday 23 April</strong> with an <strong>introduction to the series and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/saint-george-on-a-bike\">Saint George on a Bike</a> Project</strong>, which aims to use machine learning to improve the quality and quantity of open metadata associated with European cultural heritage. Project partners will present its objectives and achievements, as well as the obstacles it&nbsp;faces, especially with respect to available data sources. You will learn about making Machine Learning work (better) for improving the quality and quantity of open metadata associated with European cultural heritage imagery, and have&nbsp;the opportunity to&nbsp;discuss the challenges of data gathering for AI projects in cultural heritage and how to possibly circumvent them.&nbsp;Speakers will be Maria-Cristina Marinescu, Cedric Bhihe, Artem Reshetnikov and Quim More (Barcelona Supercomputing Center) and Albin Larsson (Europeana). <strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-x-ai-introduction-to-the-series-and-the-saint-george-on-a-bike-project\">Watch the recording</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On <strong>Friday 7 May</strong>, we will explore <strong><a href=\"https://www.cultural-ai.nl/\">Cultural AI</a></strong>, a new lab for culturally valued AI in the Netherlands. The session is titled: 'Cultural AI Lab: Responsible AI and the Politics of Metadata'. The vision of Cultural AI is to accelerate excellent research on the intersection of humanities and artificial intelligence. Core lab themes revolve around public values, like diversity and inclusivity, investigating&nbsp;how technology can deal with biases in data, account for multiple perspectives and subjective interpretations, and bridge cultural differences. At this webinar, the Lab's partners and ancillary research groups will give us an introduction to the project and present examples for the running projects in and related to the Cultural AI Lab. We look forward to hearing from&nbsp;Vendela Grundell&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Gachoud (Stockholm University), Laura Hollink (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />and Cultural AI Lab Director), Marieke van Erp (DHLab and Cultural AI Lab Director), Valentin Vogelmann (KNAW Humanities Cluster), Mari Wigham (Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision), and Cindy Zalm (National Museum of World Cultures, NL) and&nbsp;Johan Oomen. <strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-x-ai-cultural-ai\">Watch the recording</a>.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On <strong>Friday 21 May</strong> we will present <strong><a href=\"https://qurator.ai/\">Qurator.ai</a> - Curation Technologies</strong>, a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. This project is developing an innovative technology platform that supports knowledge workers in various industries to address the challenges they face when curating digital content. In this session, Georg Rehm, DFKI, will introduce Qurator, and we will explore three use cases for AI in cultural heritage curation, including Semantic Storytelling (Stefan Grill, 3pc/Xinnovations); Image Garden (Joachim Quantz, ART+COM); and Qurator in the Library (Clemens Neudecker, Berlin State Library). A panel discussion on AI and digital transformation will conclude the session. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-x-ai-the-qurator-project\"><b>Watch the recording.</b></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A further webinar and social event will take place on&nbsp;<strong>Friday 2 July,&nbsp;</strong>exploring the eScriptorium project, which aims to provide a user-friendly and open platform for the automatic, semi-automatic and manual transcription of texts from digitised images. <strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-x-ai-escriptorium\">Watch the recording</a>.</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us about yourself and your work in education?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I studied Fine Art at Hornsey College of Art in London, after which I taught Art &amp; Design in schools and colleges for 14 years. I was then appointed as Local Authority advisor for Art/Design and ICT, developing expertise in professional computer graphics/design. This knowledge enabled me to train users from industry in Computer Design. I brought this experience to my later work with the University of Hull on a number of national and EU funded research projects involving digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you join the Europeana Education community?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My work with the University extended my interest in the field of digital resources and cultural heritage. During this period, around 2010, I became aware of Europeana. I instantly realised its significance and importance, both in relation to my work interests and for education generally. This encouraged me to join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\">Europeana Education community</a> to learn more, and hopefully, be able to contribute and share ideas with like-minded educators working in education and digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did the Toolkit project come to life? Why did you decide to create this tool?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WELCOME--BIT~34hz3vIW6~tEvdn~kUW0AQ-qjldBSZoWBnvyx3E7GQtE\">Open Content Toolkit</a> project started with an entry to a competition run by the British Library. Although I did not win the competition, my submission was highly commended and this encouraged me to develop my initial idea further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started to create the toolkit as a wiki on the Wikispaces platform. Unfortunately, Wikispaces was closed down, so I had to find another suitable platform. I finally settled on Dropbox Paper because of its flexibility and ease of use. Dropbox Paper enabled me to create links, add resources and publish them instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How will this Toolkit will help educators?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Educators often have difficulty in finding resources they can easily use and integrate in their lessons and learning resources. Two of the main reasons being restrictive copyright and too many resources, (information overload) making it difficult for educators to know ‘where to start’ to find suitable content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The toolkit is designed to make this task as seamless as possible using curated links and showcasing categorised resources. In addition to the resources themselves, there are suggestions and ideas as to how educators can creatively use open content resources and integrate them into their teaching, curricula and educational activities. Ease of use is a priority of the Toolkit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You highlight resources from Europeana on a number of pages in the Toolkit - what value do you think that Europeana has for educators?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because the millions of digital cultural heritage objects provided through Europeana have been carefully curated and organised it makes it incredibly useful, and most importantly, easily accessible for educators. The themed topics presented as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections\">collections</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/galleries\">galleries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions\">exhibitions </a>and <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog\">blogs</a>, together with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/europeana-classroom\">Europeana Classroom</a> and tools such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a>, makes the Europeana website much more than just an online collection or repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently enrolled in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-europeana-mooc-digital-education-with-cultural-heritage\">Digital Education with Cultural Heritage Europeana MOOC</a>, and the course is presenting me with new ideas and approaches to include in the Toolkit. It is exciting to learn how my peers on the course are using Europeana resources, often, in ways I had not previously even considered. This has given me a much wider perspective and new ideas on how to further develop and implement the Toolkit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the next steps? How can other community members contribute to this open resource?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next steps will be to share and disseminate the updated Toolkit resource as widely as possible. I will use educational networks and appropriate social media to increase take up amongst educators and other interested parties. I am currently adding the facility to comment, leave feedback, share resources and suggest improvements. The flexible nature of the Toolkit enables it to respond to new developments in technology, especially in the field of digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am very grateful to Isabel at Europeana for giving me the opportunity to share and discuss the Toolkit within the Europeana educational community. I believe international collaboration is of great importance for education in the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I extend a warm invitation for you to <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WELCOME-qjldBSZoWBnvyx3E7GQtE\">take a look at the Open Content Toolkit</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Tell us about your current role.&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing\">Multimedia Computing Group of Delft University of Technology</a> in The Netherlands. Next to this, I also am active as a concert pianist, most notably in the Magma Duo, together with Emmy Storms (violin).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your career path to your current role?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While in high school, I had a very broad range of interests, but above all, I wanted to learn more about music. Upon graduating, I planned to go to the conservatoire, and I started investigating possibilities for doing a second major next to music studies. At an open day at the Delft University of Technology I accidentally ran into a demo of the Computer Science major, which featured a student project on making an interface more user-friendly. This demo made me realise that computer science could lead to societally useful applications, and this seemed a major I could possibly do in parallel with studies at the conservatoire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During my studies, I noticed that when I did repertoire research online, it still was quite hard to find the resources and recordings I needed. This got me interested in research on music organisation, search engines and recommender systems. I was awarded a Google European Doctoral Fellowship, which enabled me to do a PhD and research this further, and also got me into various internships at the company, where I worked as a software engineer on Google’s music services. When finishing my PhD, I debated pursuing an industry career in Silicon Valley, or staying in academia. However, the Magma Duo was then selected for a national career development trajectory in The Netherlands, and a staff position opened in Delft. So it seems the fates wished for me to stay close to home, and this is how I got into my current role.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you working on right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I work on technologies that enable humans to broaden their horizons when confronted with large information collections. I am interested in questions of validity: whether we can truly measure and optimise for what we intend. In my research, I work on methods that can give us more systematic insight into this, and show us where we still can improve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These interests all have their roots in my music experiences. But beyond researching them in the context of music collections, I am currently working on broader societal applications, including collection-building in public libraries; data-driven candidate screening in job applications; and trustworthy machine learning procedures in the Fintech sector. In all these cases, responsible and trustworthy AI needs to very consciously take human interpretation into account; this is an area where I grew strong sensitivity while working on music.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you think is the biggest opportunity AI presents for the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI can be a catalyst to get more of our cultural heritage out to broader audiences. It can help us in more comprehensively navigating and accessing collections, and making connections and discoveries we otherwise would not have found.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the biggest challenge?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />For a long time in the performing arts I have seen the sector being reluctant about AI and digital innovation. During the COVID-19 crisis, we have been forced into a much more digital way of working and communicating, which has raised awareness that digital innovation may be beneficial and needed. At the same time, because of the damage caused by the crisis, the sector struggles more than ever to keep itself afloat. So now we are in the strange situation that conceptually, there really is a lot of opportunity, but practically, it is hard to lift off digital innovation and AI-readiness within the sector in a structural and strategic way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In five years time, what do you hope that AI has brought to cultural heritage?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In five years time, I hope that we will have created sufficient momentum to have AI enable both broader and more profound connections with cultural heritage resources. I hope that AI can help more of us realise that these resources are not just dusty objects from the past to put on pedestals and watch from a distance, but that they still can really speak to us and shape our perspectives today. Furthermore, cultural resources have intricacies that today still are really hard to do right with AI (like allowing for different parallel human interpretations and perspectives, and not falling into clearly separable categories). These are exactly the intricacies we need to understand better for broader, responsible AI applications. So, I also hope that in five years from now, the AI field will have become more nuanced, thanks to insights we gained in the cultural sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-researchers-gender-imbalance/\">A study from 2018</a> suggests that just 12% of machine learning researchers are women. What do you think can be done to encourage more women into the field?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First of all, I would emphasise what commonly is suggested: foster mentoring, and make the women in the field visible. Highlight their career trajectories and personal stories and experiences, so they can be role models to new generations. Besides this, also keep highlighting and celebrating their technical contributions and their impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next to this, a lot of the current AI and machine learning narratives are about ‘being the strongest’, getting the most accurate models out of the biggest data. To me, this definitely had a bit of an alpha male vibe, that I haven’t always been so comfortable with. When comparing a 90%-accurate model with a 99%-accurate model, the 1% errors made by the 99%-accurate model may very well turn out more catastrophic or less explainable than the 10% errors made by the 90%-accurate model. I’m currently seeing the field develop to indeed become more nuanced about this, and generally be more considerate about impact in envisioned applications; this development is making me feel more welcome in the field, and I could imagine this will hold for more women colleagues.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> was conceived to support cultural heritage professionals in designing, measuring and narrating impact. Since its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-impact-playbook-the-cultural-heritage-professionals-guide-to-assessing-your-impact\">first release</a> in 2017, it has also caught the attention of researchers in the Social Sciences and Humanities, together with organisations like LIBER and infrastructures like DARIAH. This interest has pushed Europeana to start considering how the Impact Playbook could help planning research or assessing research outcomes, also as a significant portion of Europeana’s network is composed of professionals who work in academia and research. We want to bring the impact and research perspectives together and encourage the respective communities to work together in a two-day symposium, which will be held on 11-12 May 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The programme</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The programme has been designed by the symposium scientific committee, which considered&nbsp; a range of the implications that building digital collections and their reuse have: from the choices made by cultural heritage professionals in directing their efforts and resources, to the opening up of research practices for community participation and non-specialist contributions; from the obstacles to creating impact through cultural heritage resources (such as lack of digital literacy or inequalities), to the need for including the perspectives of digital audiences in the cultural heritage discourse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We tried to strike a balance in offering an ambitious, full and diverse programme, while using an agile structure that reflects the potential and limits of digital events. It will cover topics such as policy and innovation; practices of digitisation and re-contextualisation; participatory practices and methods in engagement and impact assessment; digital audiences and new socio-political perspectives. 20 speakers will share their insights and diverse experiences across four 90 minute sessions, two in the morning and two in the afternoon. This will allow the participation of professionals from different time zones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Our goals&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our aim for this symposium is to develop an understanding of how the Europeana Impact Framework can help build capacity in research contexts and so, more broadly, what value thinking about impact can bring to them. The event is the start of a wider conversation looking at three longer-term objectives: to scope potential areas of impact and identify audiences; to find a shared language for impact and grow an evidence basis; to explore how Europeana and research infrastructures can structurally collaborate to develop an impact-oriented approach.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What is a question bank?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A question bank is a resource you can consult when you are designing a questionnaire or interview. It presents a standardised way to ask questions when you are surveying your audience. There aren’t many of these in the cultural heritage sector - in fact, this may be the only such example. There aren’t even many in the wider sector or elsewhere, although Surveymonkey offers a question bank and the British Council also has one for internal use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why create a question bank?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There were a number of reasons that we created this publicly-accessible question bank, which we will continually update and refine. Firstly, we want to reduce duplication of effort and to collect more standardised and comparable data in the Europeana Foundation and across the Europeana Initiative. Secondly, we aim to help identify which data will be most important for future reporting and KPIs in the Europeana Initiative. Finally, we are publicly funded, so our efforts should add value to the wider sector and public. This question bank is one way of doing this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most importantly, having more standardised data collection across the sector is one way in which we can bring more people along in the journey and tell an even stronger story. This tool is there to inspire you, to accompany the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Impact Playbook</a> and to make it even easier to start measuring your impact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does this question bank do?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The resource offers a series of questions arranged in different thematic sections (including each of the five value lenses which offer heritage professionals a framework in which to explore their wider impact) and explainer sections (for example, on GDPR). We also add comments and tips to explain how we’ve used the questions or how we aim to do so in future. Most of the questions included have been used and refined in practice. Others are being developed in response to our work and the conditions in which we and the sector are operating in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The question bank is there to be continually updated as we and our peers improve and refine our approach to measuring impact. The document is open for comments so you can see other people’s feedback and thoughts. The update log will give you an update on what changes have been incorporated, and you can also email us at <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">impact@europeana.eu</a> to share your thoughts!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do I use it?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You might be following Europeana Impact Playbook methodology and consult the question bank as you are designing your questionnaire or interview programme. You might just be looking for question formats for your questionnaire that you’ll send in an evaluation form. Whatever you are using it for, you can take the questions and see if they work for you. Are they relevant to your survey? Could they bring to light the indicators or the change you expect to see as a result of your activity? Would they make sense to the audience that you are surveying? The guidance and tips in the question bank will also help you to understand and answer these questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Every year in March, Europeana celebrates Women’s History with a month-long campaign of editorials, social media games, learning scenarios and partnerships. This year, the Collections Engagement team made a conscious effort to profile a more diverse range of women in our editorials, which you can explore on our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/womens-history\">Women’s History</a>&nbsp;feature page. We also began a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-and-the-khalili-collections-introducing-our-new-partnership\">partnership with the Khalili Collections</a>, who have one of the most geographically and culturally diverse collections in the world. They shared a guest editorial on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/kimono-the-womens-garment-shaping-cross-cultural-exchange\">Kimonos</a> and the women behind them, and will be sharing more great content in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women’s History Month has its roots in Australia, the UK and the US. So to end Europeana’s campaign this year, we thought it appropriate to interview Kim McKay, the first woman Director and CEO of <a href=\"https://australian.museum/\">the Australian Museum</a> in its 191-year history. The Australian Museum is the oldest museum in Australia and the fifth oldest natural history museum in the world, holding over 21 million scientific specimens and cultural heritage objects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our discussion, Kim McKay shares some of her favourite highlights of Europeana’s Women’s History month this year, as well as discussing the extensive and important work the Australian Museum has been carrying out for women, First Nation communities and the environment. Watch the interviews below (full transcripts are available at the end of the post).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Women’s History Month</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What were some of Kim McKay’s highlights of Europeana’s Women’s History Month? Which activities struck her as particularly exciting? How has the role of women and First Nations people been written out of history, and how can we educate people about this?

From the role of the museum as a meeting place to build ties and the importance working respectfully with First Nation and Pacific community objects with often sacred meaning, to the contribution of migrant communities and how to be part of the difficult conversations addressing colonial history,&nbsp;Kim McKay discusses these issues - and more! - in the video below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

I'm the director and CEO of the Australian Museum. It is the nation's first museum. We're now 190 plus years old, which is incredible because if you think about when Australia had white settlement from 1788 to the present day our museum is one of the oldest in the world. In fact it's the fifth oldest natural history museum in the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have a collection that is completely extraordinary. It is both a cultural collection from Australia's First Nations people and First Nations people from across the Pacific. As well as quite an eclectic world collection too. And then a collection of our natural fauna, the animals of Australia and the fish and the birds which is second to none. It's got over 21.9 million objects and specimens in that collection. So it's the largest in the southern hemisphere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And so we are both a natural science and culture museum and a research institute where we research the collections and we have over a hundred scientists working for us full time. So we have around 300 people at the museum, all incredibly experienced. And I have the great honor of leading that team. And we've just set up a whole new direction for the future which embraces climate change, First Nations agencies, so our Indigenous people of Australia have a much greater voice in the museum, which is incredibly important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We're a colonial institution which did a lot of wrongs. And as part of our, our own reconciliation, at the new entrance to the museum, we've just rebuilt a big part of the museum, we talk about the wrongs done to the past to our First Nations people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So it, we're really on a new quest, I think, to not just highlight the critical instances of the fauna. Australia has a terrible biodiversity record for our mammals, the worst biodiversity record in the world for extinction. And of course, climate change plays such an impact on our vast country. You would have all heard about in recent years the horrific bush fires we've had here, the floods we've had. It really is akin to a very famous Australian poem by Dorothea MacKellar that said, \"I love a sunburnt country, land of sweeping plains of rugged mountain ranges and droughts and flooding rains.\" And that's exactly our nation and what we're dealing with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But at the same time, we're dealing with a lot of social issues with the place and recognition of First Nations people. We're one of the only Commonwealth countries that does not have a treaty with it's First Nations people. So we have a lot of work to do in that regard. And we have a lot of work to do around climate change and protection of our environment further. We're fortunate to live in a beautiful country. And I see the museum as playing a really critical role in all of this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The museum is a trusted place. Museums around the world are actually. They're usually the most trusted institutions in any society. And this is an extraordinarily important role that we can play in communicating information that will help influence the society in which we live and improve it. My goal with the Australian Museum in the future is that we should play an integral role in stimulating debate and conversation about the issues of our times. And I think we're starting to do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So Kim, we've highlighted what we've done this month for women's history month. Could you tell us something of your favorite elements of our campaign?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sure, well firstly, I think the celebration in women's history month of women in arts and culture is just a fantastic thing. There is no doubt around the world that women's voices and roles in art and culture are often diminished. I see that in my own country in Australia where historically the history books were written to highlight men and their role in shaping modern Australia. But in fact, every step of the way there has been women.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I created a gallery, believe it or not at the Australian Museum, our treasures gallery. Where we have more women and more First Nations people highlighted for the roles they've played in shaping our nation than have been on any other list of 100 people. Normally it's a list of men. So we're very much committed to bringing out the stories and the contribution of women right across the arts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think some of the things you've really done is tap into the zeitgeists. I mean, during the COVID period, of course a lot of people have been working from home. So you've enabled people to take onboard the <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=d2b7ca3067\">email course</a> for example, delivered to people's inboxes. So it's very easy to participate no matter where they're located. So that I think is a really great initiative. And we're all working differently now and we're all learning differently than ever before. So I think the easier access to this information for the broadest number of people possible is fantastic. So that really did strike me as something being incredible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also the images that you've highlighted, these <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/colorourcollections-our-new-colouring-blog-about-women-in-history\">color images</a> and also the people highlighted, the women artists highlighted through the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303670/World_of_Art__learn_with_Jigsaw_Puzzles/\">app puzzle game</a> is a great initiative. I mean, we all like playing with new apps and we all like puzzles. And I think as a learning mechanism it's a great way to engage people and also with a younger audience too. So these sorts of initiatives, I think, really make the whole program really sing in a different way and really connect with people in a contemporary way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And I think, you know, there's a lot of connection. We talk about STEM and STEAM. About the arts connected to science and there is a direct connection there. There's a wonderful intersection between art and science and I'm very interested in that intersection. And I think this project by highlighting women artists and scientists and others helps highlight that intersection as well. So the entire program, I mean, it has much more to it than the things I've just noted, but it really does focus on something incredibly important in our times right now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a lot of discussion globally about the role of women and the agency given to women and also the agency given to women from diverse communities. And this program underscores that I think by highlighting the role women have played in history. Women, as I said, have been written out of history. I know here in Australia they have been completely written out of our history. You would think women never were here in the way it's been described. Or that indeed First Nations people were never here either. So I think the more focus that can be brought to bear so that people understand that, in our particularly male dominated world in which we still live, there's still a long way to go. But we can be inspired, I think by these early trailblazers who are, despite their gender, were able to embark on careers as artists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first female artists in New South Wales, where the Australian Museum is based were two sisters, the <a href=\"https://australian.museum/learn/collections/museum-archives-library/scott-sisters/\">Scott sisters</a>, and they were illustrators of natural history of flora and fauna. And they were the first paid women artists in New South Wales back in the mid 1800's. So they were literally scientists, in fact our scientists still use their beautiful illustrations to this day because they were so scientifically accurate. And the sisters' names were Harriet and Helena Scott. And their works are now included in the UNESCO register because they're so extraordinary. And Harriet Scott said ‘how I wish sometimes my name was Harry because I could have then gone to university’. And of course women were precluded attending Sydney University at the time. So it's a very important program that you have to highlight the role that women have played in our history. And for younger women, especially to understand that these are centuries long struggles by women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- I really like what you said about kind of connecting the art and sciences, because I know about Scott sisters, I'm personally interested in this kind of botanical drawings, let’s say. But our exhibition that we created about pioneers, so women in history, we feature Maria Sibylla Merian who was a similar person, actually, she was also -</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>a scientific illustrator and the first person to actually go and research insects and plant life in Latin America. And she had the very same story that she was a single woman in like, you know, traveling, which was totally unseen. And in a way you don't need Indiana Jones, you don't need like the fake story, because this women where there, only so little people know about that.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- That's right, and they experienced a lot of hardship doing that as well at the time. And in fact, it's very sad that both Harriet and Helena Scott who tried to make a living out of their artwork both ended their lives in abject poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- Yeah which just also like shows that there was so much resistance. And being a woman in those times was extremely difficult and every step was very difficult and extreme in the world of men.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- And yet it's not that long ago in the scheme time frame of history is, it that these women existed. And it's 150 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- Yeah, for these ones.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- So we're talking about maybe four generations, three to four generations only. And the change that has occurred in that time, but boy we still have a long way to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- So you mentioned a bit about the collections featuring women, are also the curators in your museum, do you have like balance between men and women? Is it something that you focus on?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Well it is something that we focus on at the museum. I am in fact, the first woman to lead the Australian museum in 190 odd years. Before then it was totally male. Before then the executive team of the museum was entirely male. Now it is 60% female, 40% male in our make up of numbers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our management team, again, it's 68% female. And that is quite a difference from many other cultural institutions and museums, which have traditionally, always had men leading them. There seem to be a thought at some point that only British men could lead museums here in Australia. And so I'm proud to have proved that wrong for the time being at least anyway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we have a very strong female voice within the museum, but also amongst our curators. And this is very important because when you look at who our audience is, it's primarily families often led by women who bring the children into the museum and also among adults, it's tourists. Although through the COVID period we're not getting any tourists at the moment but we're seeing increased numbers of people now come into the museum at the time I'm speaking now, of course, where Australia is pretty much nearly COVID free at the moment. But that's because we've had very closed borders. So in Sydney, for example we have no COVID outbreaks at the moment at all. And we're leading a pretty normal life, which is extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So the museum has re-opened and we've reopened free to allow complete access to everyone no matter what socio-demographic group they come from. So I'm very proud to have been the director who abolished charges at the museum to allow it to be free, so access for all. But women are encouraged. I actually, when I joined the museum sector seven years ago, now, I was surprised at how few women in Australia ran museums. Of the 22 major museums in Australia and New Zealand at the time only two were led by women. And I thought what's wrong with this picture? So with another female museum director we established a mentoring program for senior women in museums across the country. And so far we've had over 80 women go through that program and reported over 70% of them have since been promoted. So it's been, I've always been a great believer in mentoring and lifting women up. And to do it you need, you need to do it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the great things about being in charge of an institution is I get to make decisions. So I can make decisions that help advance women's careers. I can help make decisions that help advance First Nations people's careers as well. And these are really important things because what I've discovered since being in this role is being the director or CEO gives you enormous power. And why not exercise that power to make effective change?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- Do you have women who inspired you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- There are many women who I'm inspired by. When I was a little girl, my first true inspiration was Florence Nightingale the British nurse. And I wanted to be a nurse at that time. I used to wrap my dolls and teddy bears up in bandages constantly. Because when I was very little at about age five, I read a book, a Ladybird book about Florence Nightingale. And what I loved about her was that she affected change against all the odds and against her own illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She changed the way in which hospitals treated the wounded you know, through the, in war. And she made such a difference to the survival of soldiers. It was extraordinary. And what I always then at age five wanted to be the matron of a hospital. And of course I've ended up as the matron of a museum really except all my candidates inside are dead and stuffed, with our animals and our taxidermy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But look, it is, so I think as a little girl, the first person I remember inspiring me was definitely Florence Nightingale. After that time here in Australia the woman who led the suffragette movement in Australia. Most people don't know that Australia was the second country in the world after New Zealand to give women the vote. And a woman called Mary Lee led that suffragette movement. Yet she's pretty much unknown in Australia. And we don't learn about her at school and we should. She was an extraordinary woman based in South Australia in Adelaide. And she really advocated for women's rights not just through suffrage, but also helping women who were left homeless when they were abandoned by their husband. Who suffered, you know, as they got older and had nowhere to live, she set up homes for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So somebody like Mary Lee who, against all the odds, again, really fought to give women their rights is incredibly inspiring. And I've read, when you read her speeches today they're as relevant today as they were at the turn of the century when suffrage was granted here. So that was pretty, she's one who stands out for me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And it would be trite to say it, but even my own mother, you know, I have, I live a life that is about 100% different to that of my mother in one generation. My mother left school at age 14, she was a very bright woman, but she was determined that my sister and I had an education. So again, at age five or six if you'd asked me what I was going to be other than a matron I would have said, well, I'm going to university. My mother understood that education was the game changer for women early on. And my father too. And so they really sacrificed everything to ensure that we got a very good education and that we were able to improve our lives through that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And you see it everywhere. Every time a woman is educated the difference it can make in a community, in a society. And today we need that. We're having a very deep conversation in Australia at the moment about how we haven't come far enough and how women are being treated even in our federal parliament. And it's somewhat shocking, really when you realize the deep sexism that exists in our culture and why does it still exist in this way?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So there's a lot of work to be done here and a lot of work for young women to make sure that they don't have to put up with the abuse. And it is abuse, it's the verbal abuse I'm mostly talking about in the workplace. From when I was very young, every single woman I know has stories about this. And let's hope that the dialogue that's happening now can help change that.</p>\r\n"

                title: 'Transcript - The Australian Museum’s work on Community'
                subtitle: ''
                anchortitle: ''
                templates: collapsedcontent
                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>﻿- Tell us a bit more of some other steps that the museum has taken to be closer to the community.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Well, the first thing in terms of First Nations agency, I've just appointed a woman, Laura McBride, as the new Director of First Nations for the Australian Museum. So that that's an executive level position. We have a collection of over 20,000 First Nations objects dating back to the beginning of white settlement here. And Laura has established amazing relationships with the local community. In addition to that, we have a collection of over 60,000 Pacific objects. And so, we work closely with Pacific communities as well. If you can imagine here on the East coast of Australia, bordering the Pacific, we have a huge Pacific diaspora living in Sydney and on the East coast. So we have a lot of people from all the islands across the Pacific who are very, very keen to be engaged with their culture, and these objects embody that culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And I guess that's the difference really between a museum like ours, which focuses on culture, on natural science, is that we're talking about ways in which people lived, rather than just looking at something as an artwork that you might do in an art gallery. We are talking about cultural practices, some of which are very secret and sacred to those communities, so having that understanding and respect. So we're trying to embody that right across the museum and an understanding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, even at the moment, we've just embarked on having all of our staff go through anti-racism training so that they understand that sometimes in these old colonial institutions, without realising it, there can be systemic racism, and so we want to acknowledge that that could exist and we want to make sure that our staff are well equipped to play a positive role in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We've also just commissioned, and Laura McBride, our new Director of First Nations is the curator of it, perhaps the most important exhibition we've ever done in our history. It opens in May this year, and it's called Unsettled. And it really does discuss the role of First Nations people in Australia and what happened to them after the columnists first arrived. It started with Captain Cook on the East coast of Australia in 1770. And then of course, in 1788 after the British lost the War of Independence with America, they needed to send their convicts somewhere, and based on the journals of the original visitors on Cook's voyage, they decided the East coast of Australia would be a good dumping ground for convicts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And so, that's when the first fleet arrived in 1788. The land was never ceded in any way. There was never a treaty. So, Aboriginal people regard this as an invasion. And today stories have been passed down. Now, we learn a story in school, which is quite different to the story that First Nations peoples hold and that has been passed down from generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So in our exhibition Unsettled, we reveal that for the first time for many people. We talk about genocide. We talk about the frontier wars that have occurred, things that have been brushed over in white colonial history. And really, it's going to be a difficult exhibition for a lot of people to see, it's quite confronting, but it's timely. And Australia now is in that conversation about do we have a treaty? Do we have reconciliation?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For it to occur you have to have truth telling first. So we hope we'll play a role in that truth-telling moment, and I'm pretty moved by what the team, our First Nations team has come up with. We have allowed them full control over the messaging, and it is extraordinary. So I'm pretty excited that the Australia Museum is involved in that, and we're making it free, just as general entry to the museum is free. It's a major exhibition, and it will be free so that every Australian can come and visit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I don't, it's so important, every school child should see it if they can. So that's an exciting moment for us, I think, and an example of some of the things we're doing. Because through that, we're very much highlighting women. Women played an extraordinary role in First Nations communities. They were the fisher women here in Sydney, across Sydney Harbor, they were called the Mahn, M-A-H-N, and they fed the families this way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, a really extraordinary role of women apart from bringing up the children. And they also had the skills of weaving, which have been passed down from generation to generation. So for example, we'll be running these wonderful <a href=\"https://australian.museum/exhibition/bayala-nura-yarning-country/#gallery-204-5\">weaving workshops</a> with elders in the community, so that they can impart these skills on on white women in Australia. Really great, because I think the more we understand, and sit down, and have a yarn with people about these issues, the greater understanding, and the ties that are built between us, and that does break down those barriers. You know, it's interesting that we can use a museum as a place, as a meeting place to create that greater understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- That's really fantastic to hear. And I'm just curious for myself, is this exhibition also gonna be online? Because I'd love to see it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Yeah. We're putting a lot of it online so that people can share in it that way. And there's a lot written about it. There's a beautiful catalog being produced as well. I think that we are so excited by this, that I think that it will have many other opportunities to be seen, and read about, and heard by people because there's so much depth to it. And so much of history being revealed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And our First Nations curators went back to a lot of source documents that were held in British archives to demonstrate what orders were given by the crown at the time. So that, you know, these things did not happen by accident here. There were orders, and most Australians don't know about that. And also, we have a very big migrant population here too, who love being in Australia and want to understand this country and culture in any way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So I'm really hoping through this exhibition, too, we can really engage with a wide range of immigrant cultures to Australia, you know, like America, we're an immigrant nation now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- And so, you are very bold about all these activities in order to be inclusive, get the community involved, but a lot of institutions don't know where to start. If you could give one advice on what would be the first step?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- I think you need to be brave. And I also think don't ask permission, ask for forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think that we have been able to define, or redefine what the role of our museum is in the last few years as I've gained the confidence, maybe from not just my trustees who administer the museum, our board, but also the government that funds it. So as they've gained more confidence in the work that I lead at the museum and our team is doing, you can do a bit more, you can push the agenda a little bit further than before. And we've been able to get the support of donors, too. So a lot of philanthropists, and corporations too, who believe in what we're doing. And I think if you can just keep progressing. So, you know, and not be afraid to make a mistake. I mean, look, I keep joking and saying, \"Well, no one's fired me yet\", so I must be doing something right, you know? But, so I know that what we're doing is at a particular time in history, is incredibly important, and don't miss that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So if you're running an institution, and you see an opportunity there and you feel in your soul that you should be doing something more, then do it. Don't let history pass you by, be part of it, and be part of the conversation, and be part of the change, you know, that is happening around you. And that makes institutions relevant. You know, we often have discussions in the museum world about, are museums relevant for the future? You know, or are we just big store houses of historical objects?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And we have an enormous relevancy for the future, especially in museums like ours, because we have the stories of the past, but we can tell so much about the future too. You know, who would have known when all of those natural science objects and specimens were collected, that today we would have the resources of DNA to pull out the true history and to help us understand the future? And what impacts of climate change may be on different species, for example.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So there's a lot we don't know yet because we can't predict the future. We don't know what will be invented. So museums really, they're like the arc of humanity. I like to think of them in that way, is that, you know, there's a thought that around the world, all the big natural history museums maybe hold over 90% of everything ever found on the planet, which is extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So they're incredibly important, not just as warehouses or store houses, but as research institutions and also for the public to engage. I mean, museums are often the first places that young people really engage with both art and science at the same time. You know, I love seeing the kids come into the museum on school excursions, and their little faces light up, and you see the spark off of recognition, that light bulb goes off, and that's incredibly exciting. And we can be, therefore, very influential in children's lives and their careers in terms of what they pursue.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>﻿- Knowing that you are also an environmentalist, what ways have you or the museum integrated environmental preservation, into the museum's mission and goals?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Well, it's one of our five major goals, is work on climate change. I don't know if you're aware, but Australia has been very slow to the table on climate change regulation. It has a lot to do I think with tyranny of distance, but also we've relied on our fossil fuel industry for a very long time. We've had a very productive coal industry, we are a major exporter of coal around the world, and of course that has made Australia a very wealthy nation. But at the same time, it's put us in a terrible bind, where we're so reliant on that. Renewable energy of course is moving ahead in leaps and bounds because a business wants it, economies of the world know that it's incredibly important. Yet we have no incentives here for example, for electric cars, it's crazy. So one of the things we've done at the museum has made awareness of climate change really important, we've done it in a few different ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One is through a citizen science project called<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/au/app/frogid/id1176329797\"> FrogID</a>, where Australia has about 240 different species of frogs, which is, which is a vast number. And frogs are identified by the call they make, not by what they look like. And yet no one knew what was happening to frogs, now, frogs are among the most endangered groups of animals, or species of animals in the world, they're incredibly impacted by changes in climate and biodiversity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So our chief herpetologists, Dr. Jodi Rowley, came up with the idea that if we could get citizen scientists, i.e. the public, to count frogs, you know, to listen for them then we could maybe get an idea. So with IBM, we created an app, an amazing app called FrogID. And you record the frog calls, and you record that call and it's uploaded to us, the GPS coordinates are also recorded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And so far we've recorded well over, a couple of hundred thousand frogs around Australia. We know exactly what's happening to those frogs, what communities frog species are under threat, what ones are thriving, and believe it or not when those horrendous bushfires struck the East coast of Australia a couple of years ago, what happened to the frogs? Everyone was very worried, well, of course, we had the only, set of data, available on any group of animals that was complete, and so we were able to actually monitor after that all the work we're doing back in the field now about what happened to the frogs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fortunately, there's some good news there, that number of them were able, to burrow into the ground and survive that way, where many other species couldn't, of course. But the reason FrogID is a climate change project, is it’s sort of climate change by stealth. We have hundreds of thousands of people in the community now recording frog calls for us. And yet it's not promoted as a climate change project, but that's exactly what it is. And people love doing it, families love doing it, schools love doing it, and it's a great way to contribute in a very positive way to science and scientific research, so that's just one thing we're doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another thing we've done is to make sure our own house is in order, of course, which means that our entire sustainability plan and looking at the UN's sustainable development goals as part of that. And we have ensured that everything across our organisation is being pushed to the limits of how we can be even more sustainable each time. So given we’re a very old institution and have a number of heritage buildings, it's always more challenging, but we've been able to install solar panels on parts of the roof to offset our energy, we’re a big user of energy, because of course we have to keep the collections, at a constant temperature all the time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we're always looking for ways to reduce the impact, our environmental footprint there. Just all of our practices, we just built, as I said, we did a big building project recently, a renovation of the museum and 94% of the building materials that in the demolition were diverted from landfill and reused. And that used to make me so excited every day to see the little skips full of, you know, different types of metal and the builders sorted everything. So the days of just shipping it off to landfill are gone, so I'm thrilled to say that&nbsp; 94%, of the materials were diverted from landfill and there was a lot of stuff, and it really makes you think about building renovation, and the amount of embodied carbon in those materials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So that's another way we've done it to get our own house in order. But the thing that, I guess I'm most excited about right now is we're launching the Australian Museum Center for Environmental Solutions. We've brought Tim Flannery back into the fold, Tim Flannery is one of the world's leading climate change advocates, he's well-known as writing The Weather Makers over a decade ago. And Tim spent 15 years at the Australian Museum, as head of mammalian biology originally before he became a climate change advocate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So he's rejoined us as our climate change fellow, and we're establishing this center, which will highlight all of the technological developments happening. Because we've done a lot of research and worked out that the public, who is still a bit skeptical on the issue of climate change here, if we show them what those new technologies are, and how exciting the space is, and how there are, possibilities to change things in the future, an economic opportunity out of it, we believe will go a long way to changing and influencing public opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And that was the brief I gave to our team was, I only wanna do things which change the dial, which get more people to understand that not only is climate change real here in Australia, but what the impacts of it are and what our mitigation strategies will be. I mean, being an island nation, we have a coastline of over 37,000 kilometers, which could be hugely impacted by climate change, and given over 88% of our population lives in the coastal zone, you know, incredibly impacted by sea level rise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we really need to be thinking about the future, but the way to do that, I think is to cast it in a positive way, to say, look there are technological solutions, there are steps we can take. We've just opened a new <a href=\"https://australian.museum/capturingclimatechange/\">climate change gallery</a>, at the museum, so there's a permanent gallery where people can go and find out the latest information as well, and the impact on our biodiversity, our way of life in general. And we're seeing that, I mean the huge bushfires here, they weren't usual bushfires, it was at an intensity never seen before.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And we think, well over a trillion animals were lost during that time, and it's because of the insects, you know, the insects of the scaffolding of biodiversity. And the loss of those insects, you know, the loss of birds, the loss of mammals, it is just extraordinary that those impacts and I've been out into many of the bushfire affected areas. And the devastation that was wrought was significant, and we had all the museums of Australia join together and issue a statement about it, to say that, in our research, in our times, we have never seen such destruction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we've got a voice, an advocacy voice, within a museum to play and there many museums now, around the world joining up together to become advocates for climate change. And we hope we're leading the way there and we're sharing our information with museums right around the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- You told us quite a bit about inspiring people to act, could you tell us a bit more about your project, 1 Million Women.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- I'm very fortunate to be an ambassador for <a href=\"https://www.1millionwomen.com.au/\">1 Million Women</a>, it was created by a wonderful friend of mine, Natalie Isaacs and Natalie has done a remarkable job to sign up women to climate change action here in Australia, and now in other countries as well. She believed, you know, she was a woman who hadn't thought much about climate change in her life, but when she sort of had her epiphany moment, she thought I'm going to take action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And she realised that as women, as the basic consumers in the household, we’re the ones who go out and do the shopping, that we are the ones who could make a really big difference very easily, at a local level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So Nat got a group of friends around her, who all supported this concept, and she has really enjoyed a lot of success with the campaign, about inspiring women to make a difference themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, you know, for all of us, it's only a decision we make every day about how we live. It's not that hard, and if you make it part of everyday life, you know, whether it's cutting, you know, looking at the ways you get to work, so using more public transport, rather than driving to work, or using less electricity in the home, because you've got solar panels, whatever it might be, whatever those easy things are to do, we can all do them. Of course, we know that if we all became vegetarians, we'd go a long way, to reducing greenhouse gases within the community as well, so, I'm trying to only eat meat a few times a month now. I don't wanna go vegetarian entirely, I don't think I'm quite there yet, but we'll see how we go. But so 1 Million Women is a wonderful campaign about community action making a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- And I know you wrote a series of books, with advice on how to live better, and more in a better way for the environment, and one of them was for children, and how does it communicate this kind of things to children?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- That was so much fun, so we started writing a series of books in 2007 under the <a href=\"https://truegreengroup.com/\">True Green banner</a>. And we had True Green home, and True Green life and True Green for kids. And it was tremendous actually, to work with children on the sorts of activities that they could engage with, and we wrote it for both use by schools, but also in the home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And as we just saw with COVID, it was so interesting, parents were having to, come up with ways of teaching their kids all the time, and we had a lot of people approach us and say, \"Can we use your True Green kids information again?\" Because it's timeless, and just lots of ways in which you can, children are very concerned about climate change and the environment, you know they like, what person doesn't love going out in the natural environment, and enjoying it and enjoying the wildlife.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So there were lots of projects that kids could do in their own backyards, as well as things for them to make, and why is that they could come up with reducing their own footprint, and that was everything. Here in Australia, we don't usually buy our lunch at school, we take our lunch to school with us. So it was about how you take the lunch to school, so that you're not using plastic wrap all the time, that you can use paper wraps that can go into landfill easily and be compostable, or not needing wrapping at all, with different reusable containers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just little things like that but there are lots of ways kids can engage, and it was a really fun project, and I really enjoyed doing the research for that book of working with kids and finding out the sorts of things that they love doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- So you've told us some really important things on the ways museums can fight climate change, and the important roles especially with your museum as well, and the work you've done, the work the museum has done, the work some museums around the world are doing as well. But for museums that might not know where to start on and find it important to be part of this change, where do you think or how do you think such museums could take that step?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- We'll they can join with us, so we have a wonderful leader of our climate change programs, Dr. Jenny Newell, who has also got a voice at many international museum forums on this. Jenny was a Pacific expert to begin with, but through that, she started working with First Nations people in the Pacific and discovered that their livelihoods were already being directly impacted by climate change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And of course many Pacific nations will lose their countries due to sea level rise, I mean, we already have climate change refugees coming into New Zealand and Australia from the Pacific, so this is something real it's happening now. So for those museums around the world who would like to engage more with climate change they can contact the Australian Museum.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They can also contact a wonderful virtual museum in New York, it's <a href=\"https://climatemuseum.org/\">The Museum of Climate Change</a>, in New York city. And it's not a venue, it's a community of people, and they run different events at different times. But we're all linking up to show that this is an agenda item that is so relevant for museums in this day and age. And so if anyone wants to be part of it they can reach out to the Australian Museum and we can put them in touch with everyone and help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- Do you think the institutions when working together and across kind of the world, can they make a bigger change? What would be the way for like, you know, different museums across the world to work together on different causes, for example, the climate change?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Well, I think we already are, I think a number of us are working together now, and yes the more the merrier, the more people, the more organisations who joined together and committed to action around climate change, the stronger we will be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I mean, the British Natural History Museum has an extraordinarily good project around climate change, the Natural History Museum in New York does too, and I just think the more of us, who can work together the better. I mean we're seeing now museums of the Anthropocene develop in Europe and also in Brazil, there is an incredible museum along this line, looking at the age in which we live now, dominated by climate change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So I think together, we can be quite a strong voice, you know, as I said earlier, we are the most trusted of institutions, Natural History Museums in particular, and that comes out of research in the U.S and in Europe. And that is because I think we grow up visiting museums, we enjoy them as kids, but we trust the information imparted, the only agenda we have as an institution is to tell the truth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You know, I'm not interested in people's politics, I'm interested in putting the science out there, the truthful science, and I'm interested putting it out there in a really engaging way for people. And I think we can be very effective at doing that, the more of us who do it together, so I urge everybody if you're in a small museum even, there is a role for you to play.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oh, well thank you for having me talk about the Australian Museum and our worth, but also I think the important role that museums play globally in terms of engaging with the public and continuing to be relevant, and I think there's a vast opportunity for us to do that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But I think it's also through storytelling and that's exactly what your organisation is helping with, is telling us stories of extraordinary women, out there who are making a difference, whether it's in the world of art or in the world of science or culture. It's fantastic to empower women in that way, but through storytelling and the more we hear these good stories and the more we see the good films, about them and the more we see great exhibitions, the more inspired you can be, and there's nothing better than I said, than seeing a young person with that light bulb go off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>- I think we made a very nice connection between different issues, which are very important now 'cause we spoke about the environment, we spoke about women leadership, which is very different from what we are used to from history, but you inspired us, and hopefully you will inspire the members of our networks, our colleagues, who are also young cultural professionals, and we'd like to make a change, but need to know how and need a little push in it. Is there anything we didn't ask you about, what you'd like to talk about?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">- Running an institution like the Australia Museum is an incredible privilege, and I do recognise that, and that I'm at a particular time in history where the decisions I make for the museum, and that my trustees make, will influence, how we can influence others in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, you know, recognizing, that you're at that critical juncture in history on a few key issues is incredibly important. And I think the support that I get from the government here, in New South Wales and those around me, really enables our team to blaze a new trail, and that's what we're very committed to doing.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a career in academic publishing, working with scholars across the globe to publish their research in the area of international law and human rights,&nbsp;I joined The European Library in 2012. As many in our network will remember, The European Library was Europeana’s dedicated library aggregator that provided the digital collections from all of Europe’s national libraries to Europeana and one of the largest contributors of data to Europeana. I have been in the cultural heritage sector ever since, working with cultural heritage organisations to make their collections more accessible to wider audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Product Manager at the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> I work on a wide range of national and international projects, including going back to my roots as a publisher overseeing two open access journals published by our institute, <a href=\"https://www.viewjournal.eu/\">VIEW Journal of European Television History and Culture</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tmgonline.nl/\">TMG Journal for Media History</a>. In support of heritage institutions in The Netherlands that hold AV collections, I am managing <a href=\"https://www.avanet.nl/\">AVA_Net</a>, the network organisation focused on gathering and sharing knowledge around audio-visual archiving processes. We organise regular (online) knowledge sharing sessions and an annual Symposium (24 June, 2021) for the network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alongside these activities I am working on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport</a> CEF Generic Services project and <a href=\"https://blog.euscreen.eu/medianumeric/\">MediaNumeric</a>, an Erasmus+ project that our institute is very proud to coordinate. It aims to educate a new generation of journalists and multimedia makers, giving them the tools to help create a user-driven, fair and balanced, economically sustainable and technologically advanced European media ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am also actively involved in the <a href=\"https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/\">Dutch Digital Heritage Network</a>, under which umbrella we are developing a Makers Programme together with <a href=\"https://hetnieuweinstituut.nl/\">Het Nieuwe Instituut </a>to encourage makers to work with the beautiful collections of our heritage institutions and to ensure that institutes are better equipped to work with makers. Creating and inspiring the world with new stories and insights!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digitisation is changing society and the impact of heritage is bigger than ever so, the biggest challenge is that there is so much to do and we never seem to have enough time! On the other hand, what I am working on is incredibly rewarding, particularly working cross domain, nationally and internationally across projects. Learning from each other and making a difference is what gives me energy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the moment I am excited to launch a <a href=\"https://netwerkdigitaalerfgoed.nl/activiteiten/makers-programma/\">Makers Programme</a> in The Netherlands that we are kicking off with some cool online sessions for makers and cultural heritage institutions. I am of course also very much looking forward to the summer of sports (Tour de France, Olympics, European Football Championship) and the stories we can tell around this theme! Did you know that this year marks the 125th anniversary of the Olympics? Together with the Europeana Foundation Collections Engagement Team we are cooking up some nice ideas, so keep an eye out for a shot of sporting culture on Europeana!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe in the Europeana Initiative and I feel passionate about making culture accessible for all, having seen what Europeana can do for the sector. Having worked within the Europeana eco-system for eight years I believe in empowering each other, sharing best practices and interacting; sometimes painful and sometimes challenging, always rewarding!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Members Councillor I will work to engage, involve and connect people and knowledge, discuss and make visible what the sector is truly in need of and ensure Europeana is there to support and inspire. I will work on supporting heritage institutions in making their digital collections more accessible, telling stories with their collections, allowing others to work with their collections and showing how essential digital and culture are for society and our wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I second my fellow Members Councillor, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/professionals-in-focus-cosmina-berta\">Cosmina Berta from the DDB</a>, in saying that it is time for the second wave, 10 years after the EU’s call for a ‘New Renaissance’ that brought us Europeana. Therefore to see Europeana being positioned at the heart of a data space for cultural heritage in the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme\">new plans of the European Commission</a>, as well as cultural heritage playing a key role in the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/about/about-initiative_en\">New European Bauhaus</a> initiative confirms what I have known for some time now, what better advocate for digital cultural heritage could the sector ask for than Europeana! #AllezCulture!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We all know that Europe has had a tough couple of years and that we need to work hard and work together if we want to see a recovery that delivers real improvements to people’s lives, and a future in which we live in harmony with our planet. The New European Bauhaus wants to put sustainability, inclusivity and beauty at the heart of Europe’s future, and it wants culture to help make that happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of Bauhaus, and you might think of German modern art, design and architecture - a movement to find new solutions for a new era. Now, 100 years on, the European Commission has initiated a New European Bauhaus movement to shape future ways of living that answer the big challenges we face today. Think green, sustainable and affordable, alongside accessible, inclusive and beautiful and impacting all aspects of how we live together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New European Bauhaus calls for new and diverse perspectives to shape the concrete actions that will improve our everyday life. It asks for design, art and culture to work alongside modern science and technology to provide collaborative solutions for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital cultural heritage already makes this connection and our sector can play an important role in this initiative, and in shaping the heritage of tomorrow. Over the summer of 2021, New European Bauhaus is in a co-design phase - calling for contributions from citizens to creators, and across society and sectors to help shape what happens next.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is Europeana involved?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To support our sector’s involvement, Europeana will promote awareness and discussion of New European Bauhaus activities and opportunities throughout the year. We’ll focus on highlighting how the cultural heritage sector can contribute, and collaborate&nbsp;with other sectors including, for example, education, smart cities and the creative industries, to rethink and reshape how we live, and how we can use digital heritage to support that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ll help start a conversation but more importantly we want to help promote your discussions and contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Find the latest on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus page here on Europeana Pro</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Our series of Europeana cafes on the New European Bauhaus supported cultural heritage professionals to be part of the conversation. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-european-bauhaus-europeana-cafe\">Watch again now.</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tell us if you have New European Bauhaus events planned through our <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/84546d814bad4e0e96c3b98a2f102c69\">events form</a>, to be featured on our Events page.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Look out for a New European Bauhaus feature page soon on the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana website</a>, highlighting relevant editorial (blogs, galleries and exhibitions) and educational content on green and sustainable themes.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join the conversation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus wants to hear from you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The New European Bauhaus is about how we live together, our values, our common spaces of work and leisure, our collective and private experiences,’&nbsp; says Elisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you have inspiring examples of spaces, services and practices that contribute to an inclusive, beautiful and sustainable society? Our cultural institutions and heritage sites play an important role in doing just that, while access to digital cultural heritage helps us all to connect with history and with each other, to shape how we live and work.&nbsp;The New European Bauhaus wants to know about these examples to help pave the way for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/select-language?destination=/node/11\">Share your examples</a> of the cultural heritage sector in action via a dedicated Europe-wide platform.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Or if you want to go even further, you can enter yourself or your organisation in the New European Bauhaus Prizes 2021. The Prizes recognise and celebrate beautiful, sustainable, inclusive places and practices that already exist in our communities, as well as concepts or ideas from young people (under 30) that can pave the way to the future. There are 10 categories including ones dedicated to cultural heritage, the mobilisation of culture arts and communities, and interdisciplinary education models.&nbsp; The prizes are worth up to 30,000 Euros each, and the deadline is 31 May 2021.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/select-language?destination=/node/121\">Find out more and enter the New European Bauhaus prizes</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is digital storytelling?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Humans have always told, retold and listened to stories. They allow us to make sense of the world, to learn, and to empathise and connect with each other. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital storytelling is simply this age-old act of storytelling but using digital media, perhaps introducing elements of images, audio, video and interactivity with the more traditional text or narrative. It is employed widely by cultural heritage institutions to attract, engage and inspire audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Technology supports new ways of telling stories</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Visiting a cultural site in the company of a guide who tells fascinating stories about the exhibits becomes a memorable experience. When human guides are a scarce resource - or doors to a museum or gallery are closed as we’ve experienced recently - digital technology offers the chance to bring these experiences to a wider audience as well as a welcome invitation to discovery. Ways of enjoying works of art have been reinvented so that cultural institutions can continue to offer themselves as restorative, but also inclusive, user-centre oriented and participatory environments.&nbsp; Take for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/actualidad/multimedia/las-hilanderas-una-historia-en-imagenes/39def9b0-fa00-4121-ad78-1deacb907f3b\">Las hilanderas. Una historia en imágenes</a> (Museo del Prado, Madrid) - an interactive image viewer is used to highlight details and reveal the narrative behind a famous painting by Velázquez. And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/07/arts/design/hokusai-fuji.html\">A Picture of Change for a World in Constant Motion</a> (New York Times) - a storytelling text sidebar links to a dynamic image gallery that zooms in on Hokusai’s Ejiri in Suruga Province as you scroll, revealing the details at the same time as you are told about them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We all know by now that the current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated cultural heritage institutions to share their collections and stories online, featuring a variety of formats, media and platforms and targeting different segments of the public. A <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3jjkW1A\">survey from the Network of European Museum Organisations </a>(NEMO) revealed that during the lockdown in Europe, over 60% of museums increased their online presence. The most popular activities, according to ICOM, were live events and online exhibitions, with an increase respectively of 12.28% and 10.88%. And if you’d like to explore some of those, check out <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mapping-museum-digital-initiatives-during-covid-19\">Mapping museum digital initiatives during COVID-19</a>, it’s a great overview of various digital initiatives launched by museums during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What makes a story memorable and engaging?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So what’s at the heart of a good story, digital or otherwise? Emotional connection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapping into our emotions is what creates that powerful experience and a sense of psychological proximity. It makes sense that people are more interested in events that happen to them personally than those that happen to others or to strangers. What skilled storytellers do is create characters and journeys that other people can easily relate to - so that the story is as close to the reader or viewer as possible. The more we empathise with the characters, the more interesting the events happening in the story are to us. When we put ourselves in the place of the characters, psychological proximity is really tight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories about cultural heritage are very effective from this perspective because by connecting the audience to the characters and events of the past, they often trigger our own personal memories, emotions and experiences, generating empathy and fostering that sought-after sticky engagement. For example, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/en/oal\">A Closer Look</a> (Louvre, Paris) - this experience invites people to look closely at a high-resolution image of a single artwork, before telling the story of its subject and creation and providing interesting comparisons with other works. And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/themerl/status/1099661508852752390?lang=en\">‘There is a bat in the library’</a> (Museum of English Rural Life, Reading) - this Twitter thread uses an informal event to entertain and then inform people about bats and their conservation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">More from the Task Force</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we have been <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/what-is-digital-storytelling-and-what-has-it-got-to-do-with-cultural-heritage\">thinking about digital storytelling</a> for some time, and in September 2020 were delighted to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-task-force-launches-europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">launch a Task Force</a> on the topic, run by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Community</a> with 26 members from 16 countries. We have spent the last six months analysing examples of online digital storytelling from the cultural heritage sector that our members have found and loved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our next posts, you’ll find out more about the longlist of great practice examples we’ve looked at and will be able to explore them yourselves, as well as our three detailed case studies and our seven tips for digital storytelling with cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope that the outcomes of this Task Force - which show that the great digital storytelling we have discovered doesn’t necessarily rely on fancy formats or big budgets - will help Europeana to support institutions to develop their capacity for developing and using digital storytelling practices, whether their final publication place is on Europeana or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested? Then keep an eye on Europeana Pro News for more from the Task Force and register for our webinar on 9 June, when we’ll hear more from the Task Force and are delighted to welcome expert storytellers from the sector to share their experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if that's not enough storytelling for you,&nbsp;check out the <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival\">Digital Storytelling Festival</a> - a creative competition from Europeana and the Digital Heritage Lab on Medium and social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

The most popular activities, according to <a href=\"https://icom.museum/en/covid-19/surveys-and-data/survey-museums-and-museum-professionals/\">ICOM</a>, were live events and online exhibitions, with an increase respectively of 12.28% and 10.88%. And if you’d like to explore some of those, check out <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mapping-museum-digital-initiatives-during-covid-19\">Mapping museum digital initiatives during COVID-19</a>, it’s a great overview of various digital initiatives launched by museums during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What makes a story memorable and engaging?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So what’s at the heart of a good story, digital or otherwise? Emotional connection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tapping into our emotions is what creates that powerful experience and a sense of psychological proximity. It makes sense that people are more interested in events that happen to them personally than those that happen to others or to strangers. What skilled storytellers do is create characters and journeys that other people can easily relate to - so that the story is as close to the reader or viewer as possible. The more we empathise with the characters, the more interesting the events happening in the story are to us. When we put ourselves in the place of the characters, psychological proximity is really tight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories about cultural heritage are very effective from this perspective because by connecting the audience to the characters and events of the past, they often trigger our own personal memories, emotions and experiences, generating empathy and fostering that sought-after sticky engagement. For example, take a look at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/en/oal\">A Closer Look</a> (Louvre, Paris) - this experience invites people to look closely at a high-resolution image of a single artwork, before telling the story of its subject and creation and providing interesting comparisons with other works. And&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/themerl/status/1099661508852752390?lang=en\">‘There is a bat in the library’</a> (Museum of English Rural Life, Reading) - this Twitter thread uses an informal event to entertain and then inform people about bats and their conservation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">More from the Task Force</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, we have been <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/what-is-digital-storytelling-and-what-has-it-got-to-do-with-cultural-heritage\">thinking about digital storytelling</a> for some time, and in September 2020 were delighted to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-task-force-launches-europeana-as-a-powerful-platform-for-storytelling\">launch a Task Force</a> on the topic, run by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Community</a> with 26 members from 14 countries. We have spent the last six months analysing examples of online digital storytelling from the cultural heritage sector that our members have found and loved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our next posts, you’ll find out more about the longlist of great practice examples we’ve looked at and will be able to explore them yourselves, as well as our three detailed case studies and our seven tips for digital storytelling with cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope that the outcomes of this Task Force - which show that the great digital storytelling we have discovered doesn’t necessarily rely on fancy formats or big budgets - will help Europeana to support institutions to develop their capacity for developing and using digital storytelling practices, whether their final publication place is on Europeana or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interested? Then keep an eye on Europeana Pro News for more from the Task Force and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/storytelling-with-digital-culture\">register for our webinar on 9 June,</a> when we’ll hear more from the Task Force and are delighted to welcome expert storytellers from the sector to share their experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And also - check out the <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival\">Digital Storytelling Festival</a> - a creative competition from Europeana and the Digital Heritage Lab on Medium and social media.</p>\r\n"

These communities are often overlooked by the cultural heritage sector, but are a powerful creative force when reusing and remixing cultural heritage to power bold new games, architectural designs, or other creative projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The V4Design project started by recognising the barriers between someone discovering a great piece of digitised cultural heritage and being able to reuse that digital cultural heritage in 3D designs. While it is a straightforward process to download, open and edit&nbsp;2D images, the process isn't as simple in three dimensions. A lot of cultural heritage content hasn't been digitised into easily re-usable 3D objects (see the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">final recommendation</a> of the 3D content in Europeana Task Force), severely restricting the data sources that architects, video game creators and creative designers can use. V4Design solved this problem by creating a pipeline that supports the integration of 3D cultural heritage objects into the daily creative workflows of these professionals, by making it easier to generate 3D models from video input.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through V4design, Europeana aimed to broaden the scope of its audiences for reuse of digital cultural heritage, giving creative designers the tools they need to reuse the past in their own innovative work. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Throughout the project, Europeana provided more than 370.000 digital cultural heritage objects that can now easily be discovered and reused in the V4Design platform. Explore further&nbsp;innovations below!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

If you have or make a video of any object, moving around it to get all angles, you can import that video into the V4Design pipeline which will extract usable 3D models from it. This shortens the time needed to go from physical object to 3D model, making it easy for anyone to take anything from their environment and import and reuse it in their 3D projects. An example of this in practice was showcased by Herzog de Meuron, an architecture firm based in Basel, Germany. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Cp-iFdv77s?t=848\">Find out how they used V4Design in their work</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Analyse and enrich data and metadata</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help with the 3D pipeline, and to know where to transfer textures onto, the project developed several machine learning algorithms. Some models look at still images to extract textures and patterns that can then be transferred to a 3D model or a 2D image.</p>\r\n"

We set up a form, having brainstormed the type of information we wanted to collect. And we asked members to be selective - we wanted the final longlist to be both inspirational and useful (easy to search and explore), rather than encyclopedic and exhaustive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longlist is presented in two ways - as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RtLsy4tQyziYY8DYkmScNlZrC8mdhtuyWuMD2e7XIz4/edit?usp=sharing\">a spreadsheet</a> containing all the information collected, which can be used to search for specific information, like examples in a particular language or examples that use audio. And as a <a href=\"https://padlet.com/lisa_peter/EuropeanaTF\">Padlet</a> - a more visual resource with thumbnails and including the reasons why the examples were chosen - our members’ personal responses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What did we discover?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The longlist contains a broad variety of experiences, from the high-profile and mainstream, such as the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories\">Stories element from the Rijksmuseum website</a>, to the more quirky, including a <a href=\"https://skrecok.sng.sk/\">guided tour of Slovak art told by a hamster</a>, to <a href=\"https://www.bpb.de/veranstaltungen/dokumentation/314735/go-east\">13 hours of streamed train journeys through Europe</a>. For each example, members answered questions ranging from the basic - like what is it and who made it - to the more detailed - such as how much agency does the audience have? While a detailed analysis will be available in the Task Force report when published, some key points are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There is no one singular format or genre style that appears to be more successful than another. Instead, we see a range of approaches, with a trend to using more visual content over text-based content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The storytelling examples appear to aim to inform or educate, and then entertain, and are generally aimed at a broad audience of the general public who are already invested in cultural heritage, rather than at particular demographic groups.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The narrative style tends to be informal, personal and expert, with a specific topic as its focus.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Almost none of the examples are multilingual in design. 70% were available in one language only, with a heavy leaning to English.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There is a broad range of results in terms of the level of interactivity in the experience. Some examples are linear with no interactivity. Others are complex with multiple options, giving the viewer greater control over the journey.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Three case studies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The longlist showed us that there is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to storytelling with digital culture in terms of format, content and approach. However, we see that our examples lead the viewer to feel that they are informed and want to know more. To find out more, we then looked in detail at three examples of very different digital storytelling experiences covering a range of formats, target audiences and resources. We used the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a>’s Empathy Map to identify the emotional engagement members felt, and to discuss how the experience led them to feel that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/07/arts/design/hokusai-fuji.html\">A Picture of Change for a World in Constant Motion</a> is a long-form text/image blog ('close read') from Jason Farago of the New York Times, focusing on Katsushika Hokusai's woodblock print ‘Ejiri in Suruga Province.’ The storytelling is perceived by the audience as very engaging and inspiring. Its&nbsp;style of narration and language is&nbsp;informal, personal and evocative (multisensory). Image&nbsp;are presented&nbsp;with a close-up technique that produces compassion for the characters and makes the audience feel like they are travelling through the time and the space with the author.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Hear speakers Alicia Desantis and Gabriel Gianordoli from the New York Times talk about the Close Reads series in our webinar.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/online-features/metkids/\">#MetKids</a> is a digital resource from The Metropolitan Museum of Art in&nbsp;New York City composed of an interactive map and a digital storytelling discovery strategy made for, with and by kids 7-12 years-old. The emotional engagement #MetKids&nbsp;produces is based on creating connections with the past, involving the audience actively, fostering a sense of wonder and the thrill of getting close to an object in order to discover the hidden stories behind it.&nbsp;<em>We hear from Sofie Andersen and Benjamin Korman from The Met in our webinar.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EghamMuseum/status/1311453097462575104\">‘You are Flora Seville’ from the&nbsp;Egham Museum</a> is a choose-your-own-adventure Twitter experience following the fictional Flora Seville, illustrated with the museum's collections. The story of Flora Seville is well-structured; readers feel immersed in the historical context in which Flora lived through the museum’s showcased collections, and drawn into her personal (fictional) life through the informal, personal style and the agency to choose what Flora does next. There is an element of surprise along with the possibility to choose how to continue the story. <em>Steven Franklin tells us more about Flora in our webinar.</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the Europeana Aggregators Forum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aggregators work with cultural heritage institutions to gather authentic, trustworthy and robust data, and to make it accessible for people to enjoy, use and reuse online.&nbsp; The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators?utm_source=share-your-data%2Fprocess&amp;utm_medium=Find%20an%20aggregator&amp;utm_campaign=internal_link\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> is a network of organisations who work with cultural heritage institutions to provide this content and metadata to Europeana. The Forum comes together to share knowledge, ideas and best practices, and the Aggregators’ Fair is an opportunity to find out more about the work they do!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us on 16 and 17 June 2021</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On 16 and 17 June 2021 the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum will open their virtual doors to cultural heritage professionals and anyone with an interest in high quality, open cultural heritage content. Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Aggregator_Forum/EAgg-Fair-2021-Programme-Public.pdf\">exciting draft programme</a> gives participants the opportunity to listen to inspiring speakers, join panel discussions, take in training webinars and ask questions of the people working in aggregation. It will be a great opportunity to find out more about how high quality cultural heritage content is being made accessible to new audiences through Europeana, and how you can get involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Fair&nbsp;will highlight the current state of affairs in the aggregation of digitised cultural heritage to Europeana and we aim to have plenty of interest for both newcomers as well as longtime partners. In parallel sessions you will hear from national and thematic aggregators on how they have developed their activities, and work with Europeana to share and enrich digital content. As well as hearing from the Dutch, Greek, Irish and German national Aggregators, these talks will also cover audiovisual archives, architecture and archaeology, and tools for aggregation. And if you are interested in reuse best practices, and keen to hear more about building capacity for aggregation and developing and producing training, don’t miss the three panel sessions covering these topics. Finally, a series of ignite talks will provide an opportunity for a quick dive into the world of aggregation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interested?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tickets for the Aggregators’ Fair are free and now available via Eventbrite, so don’t miss your chance to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Aggregator_Forum/EAgg-Fair-2021-Programme-Public.pdf\">explore the draft programme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-aggregators-fair-tickets-153273277499\">register for the Fair</a>!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Storytelling Task Force had its kick-off meeting at the end of September 2020. Usually, this would be an in-person meeting, perhaps timed around the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference\">annual Europeana conference</a>. But 2020 had other ideas and so all the meetings the Task Force organised were done virtually. But the restrictions on our movement provided us an opportunity - without needing a budget for travel and accommodation, we could allow more than the usual 8-12 people who normally form a Europeana Network Association Task Force to take part and welcomed 26 people from 14 countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>One step at a time</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pandemic shaped how the work was divided. We split our activity into a number of smaller tasks, each set out clearly from the start with a schedule of meetings, start dates and end dates. With the uncertainty of everyone’s working situations in various countries in Europe and beyond, this allowed members to select which tasks fitted around their interests, lives and the restrictions and challenges in place at any time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Within each task, members were invited to step forward and help to coordinate the activity, or to participate at their own level.&nbsp; There were smaller activities that all members could contribute to - for example, finding examples of storytelling with digital culture that they enjoyed and providing information about them, or joining a discussion to analyse a particular case study.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These tasks were designed to be collaborative but not overwhelming for members. We also wanted them to be enjoyable, and the atmosphere within our workshops and discussions to be welcoming and friendly to allow everyone to feel comfortable to participate. We encouraged collaboration through online tools which provided digital alternatives to physical meetings. Tools like Jamboard, Padlet and Mentimeter were really helpful for collecting and displaying information, and we used the Google suite, Zoom and Basecamp to hold our meetings and communicate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>So why join a Task Force in the middle of a pandemic?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">English teacher at Polo Liceale ‘P. Aldi’ – Grosseto (Italy), Milena Lato, helped coordinate&nbsp;our analysis of three case studies. Milena says, ‘I heard about digital storytelling in online seminars for teachers. I began to use it and noticed how students got really interested by personifying a story, animating an adventure or combining photographs, videos, sound, music and texts. I was very interested in knowing more about digital storytelling through exchange with other professionals coming from all over the world.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cristina Iona Roiu, Head of the International Marketing Department at the Library of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, has been working on Europeana projects for 11 years including Europeana 1989, Europeana Migration and Europeana 1914-1918. ‘The crowdsourcing projects showed me the great desire people have for telling their family’s stories,' says Cristina. 'And so it became very important to me to learn more about digital storytelling. A good story behind any item or activity always has a greater impact on the audience.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not all members were so familiar with working with Europeana. Eleanna Avouri is an Early Stage Researcher/PhD Fellow at the Digital Heritage Research Lab, Cyprus University of Technology, whose experience with Europeana was as a user and avid blog reader. She says, ‘Digital storytelling in the field of cultural heritage has been an active part of my academic and research interest for some years now. The Task Force was an excellent opportunity to exchange ideas and experience with researchers and practitioners from various fields.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was the Task Force experience like?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cristina says, ‘I have learned a lot and enjoyed the work with so many people across Europe. I admired the carefully thought-out planning of every activity and the useful tools that made our work more interactive and participatory. Often, our working sessions were for me the most beautiful time of the day. Every session was challenging, innovative, creative and a beautiful journey through storytelling.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Milena too, found it a worthwhile experience, ‘I found this experience very interesting, useful and enjoyable, too. Exchanging good practices in such a professional and relaxed way was great! I learnt about new cultures, teaching/learning tips and tools, and how the Europeana website, materials and community are so effective for professional development and the spread and protection of cultural heritage.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And for Eleanna, ‘I gained many different insights and perspectives regarding digital storytelling, from fields that were relatively new to me, such as theatre and science. The work I did for the Task Force had a very positive impact on my personal research work in terms of content and methodology.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why join a Europeana Network Association Task Force?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/task-forces\">Task Forces</a>, the Europeana Network Association helps to solve specific issues and challenges affecting the digital heritage field, and it is an experience that Storytelling Task Force members seem to recommend! Milena says, ‘I would surely recommend it because a piece of work made collaboratively by people with different experiences and expertise is a complete one.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cristina says, ‘Working with different types of participants on the cultural act is an enriching experience and the process builds valuable multinational cooperation that can then continue after the completion of the Task Force’s work..’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And Eleanna describes how, ‘For young researchers, like myself, it is a very educational experience.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you would like to be involved in Task Forces, and be the first to hear about new ones,<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\"> join the Europeana Network Association today</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if you would like to find out more about the work of the storytelling Task Force, don’t miss our webinar on 9 June!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why was the New Professionals Task Force formed?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The origins of this Task Force developed out of discussions at Europeana’s annual conference in Lisbon in 2019, where a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-conversation-on-inclusivity-and-diversity-reflections-from-europeana-2019\">session</a> was dedicated to discussing ways to improve inclusivity and diversity in the Europeana Network Association (ENA). Conversations continued between ENA members, guided by the Impact Community Steering Group and Europeana Foundation staff, recognising the network could be more open, inclusive, and engaging to young, new and emerging members. From there, the New Professionals Task Force was born.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the context of this Task Force, new professionals were considered to be any person, of any age, early in their careers, studying, working or intending to work in, with, and around cultural heritage. The Task Force wanted to look at the challenges and barriers facing new professionals, while also identifying opportunities to include and support them within the ENA. This, in turn, aimed to increase spaces for new voices in the ENA and its communities, to help support a more diverse, inclusive, and sustainable network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who took part in the New Professionals Task Force?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nine cultural heritage professionals and students formed the Task Force, many of us new professionals in the cultural heritage sector ourselves. While some of us were involved in Europeana before the Task Force, some were also new to the Initiative, and it was great to listen and learn from these perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carlota Marijuán Rodríguez, Task Force Member and member of the European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage (ESACH) says, ‘I am really grateful that ESACH was invited to be part of this journey. Participating in the Task Force was a great experience in itself, showing the value of networking across disciplines and countries. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic provided us with an opportunity to explore how these networks can be maintained even remotely!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Laura-Ioana Luca, Task Force Member and former member of the International Council on Archives New Professionals Programme says, ‘The opportunity to share my experiences of being a new professional, and having those valued within this Task Force was incredibly rewarding. I’m so pleased to have been part of an initiative that has begun to create a kind, welcoming, and fruitful environment within Europeana for emerging professionals!’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were also pleased to have a number of reviewers who contributed to and enriched the final report, and would like to extend our thanks to everyone who was involved!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did the Task Force work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we met regularly online to discuss, plan and action different aspects of our work. Researching existing initiatives, as well as relevant reports, articles and better practice in this area, was a key activity of the Task Force, but we also considered individual perspectives. We shared our own experiences, and reached out to both emerging and experienced professionals in the sector to find out more. At Europeana 2020, we ran a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-professionals-cafe-what-would-a-europeana-new-professionals-programme-look-like\">session</a> to encourage reciprocal sharing of knowledge and expertise between these two groups, and to gain insights into how we can better support each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This session included a presentation from Laura Millar, Coordinator of the International Council on Archives New Professionals Programme, and her insight into this<a href=\"https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/npp_overview_2020_eng.pdf\"> New Professional Programme</a> provided much food for thought for the Task Force. Indeed, establishing connections with other individuals, initiatives and organisations supporting new professionals was one of our key activities, particularly as two Task Force members were ESACH members. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/european-students-association-for-cultural-heritage-talks-to-the-new-professionals-task-force\">Read their reflections on working with the Task Force</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The approach that we took was indebted to the guidance and resources of the Europeana Foundation and Impact Community Steering Group. We are particularly grateful to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a>, and to Europeana Foundation Impact Adviser Nicole McNeilly, who guided us through it in an online workshop, where we created a Change Pathway to help us think about the constructive change we wanted our recommendations to have on the Network, the sector and society!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also prioritised an intersectional approach, considering the multidimensionality of people’s experiences and identities, and taking into account the many different manifestations of discrimination that can create barriers for new and emerging professionals in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What recommendations did the New Professionals Task Force make?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of the activities undertaken by the Task Force fed into our final report. We made several interlinked recommendations on how the ENA can do more to include, support and encourage new professionals within the network:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Cultivate ENA intergenerational exchange (for example, through mentoring, conference buddies and a dedicated New Professionals Programme).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Support inclusivity for new professionals within the ENA (for example, by offering dedicated ways to welcome them into the network and identifying funding opportunities to support them).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Create spaces for new professional visibility, autonomy and collaboration (for example, through dedicated editorials and events).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Foster an open and inclusive ENA, enabling new professionals to thrive (for example, by reviewing the Code of Conduct and offering dedicated training to support inclusivity and diversity action in the ENA).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Build sustainable, community-centered partnerships (with many of the groups the Task Force collaborated with).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Support proposal for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ena-membership-working-group\">ENA Membership Working Group</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were delighted to see that since the Task Force report was completed, this Membership Working Group has been established, and will be primarily responsible for delivering these recommendations. If you would like to join this Working Group, please email <a href=\"mailto:network@europeana.eu\">network@europeana.eu</a> to express your interest and find out more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We invite you to dive in to read and download the full report from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/new-professionals#report\">New Professionals Task Force page</a>! And keep checking Europeana Pro, where we will share further updates about our work for new professionals.</p>\r\n"

They work closely together to set long-term goals to be addressed by the Council to advance the work of the European Union. The three Member States prepare a common agenda covering major topics and issues, with each country setting its own detailed six-month programme focussing on areas that reflect its own priorities and passions.

Its <a href=\"https://www.2021portugal.eu/en/programme/programme-for-the-portuguese-presidency-of-the-council-of-the-european-union/\">policy programme</a> looks towards a new future for Europe, paying attention to the implementation of the EU recovery plan in the cultural and creative sectors with focal points on access to culture, participation in cultural life and the relationship between the arts and education. The programme also has a focus on the role of digital transformation in this context and on creating a European digital identity that promotes access to quality data, and supports the role of digital in a democratic, open and sustainable society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enhance and underpin this, Portugal is also running a <a href=\"https://www.2021portugal.eu/en/presidency/cultural-programme/\">cultural programme</a> including concerts, art installations and exhibitions. It is using theatre, cinema, music, dance and the visual arts, to confirm the importance of a resilient, social, green, digital and global Europe. The cultural programme demonstrates how culture and cultural activities are relevant to and can be used to shape high level policy thinking, and to drive policy in a range of areas.</p>\r\n"

We want them to understand the challenges and needs of the sector and to make decisions that support its development. Events organised as part of Member States’ Presidency programmes give us a platform to do just that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cooperation supports our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/member-states\">outreach to Member States</a> and provides opportunities to meet with high-level policymakers from European ministries of culture, representatives of the European Commission and the DCHE Expert Group, as well as experts in the topic at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The topics of Europeana’s Presidency events reflect both the sector’s priorities and those of the Presidency itself. In the past, they have covered topics such as copyright, national infrastructures, culture and education,&nbsp; and multilingualism. Through Europeana’s events, we have the opportunity to ensure that culture is at the heart of policy-making - whatever lens the Presidency is looking through.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Europeana and Portugal host two-day capacity-building event</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In collaboration with the Portuguese Ministry of Culture and the National Library, Europeana is running a two-day online event on 3-4 June 2021, with a focus that couldn’t be any closer to our hearts: exploring digital capacity building in the cultural heritage sector and putting cultural heritage in the spotlight as part of Europe's recovery.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our event programme focuses on what digital transformation and capacity building really mean, the importance of building capacity and a vision for common approaches towards it.

                body: "<p>Amidst accelerating technological innovation and the impact of COVID-19, memory institutions across the globe are being urged to embrace <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/defining-digital-transformation-for-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">digital transformation</a>. Many are investing more in digital projects for long-term preservation and to make heritage resources more widely available. Yet how can we know whether financial and human resources are being used effectively? Are our digital resources having societal impacts that align with an organisation’s mission? What forms of evidence can project teams use to improve quality and to ensure resource sustainability?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developing holistic indicators that will help governments and memory institutions assess the multidimensional impact of digital heritage resources is one way to address these important questions. My PhD research investigates how to best assess the impact of digital heritage and focuses on digital museum resources in China - explore how I carried it out, and my findings, below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Developing multidimensional impact indicators&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on <a href=\"https://www.bvimodel.org/bvim/index\">the Balanced-Value-Impact (BVI) Model</a> and the framework adopted by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact#impact-playbook\">the Europeana Impact Playbook</a>, I took a mixed-method approach, combining desk research, survey and interviews. I used&nbsp;tools that accompany Phase one of the Impact Playbook, which help heritage organisations to consider the bigger picture (Strategic Perspectives) and more granular impact areas (the Value Lens).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After reviewing a wide range of source materials I developed four sets of indicators of impact each under the Strategic Perspectives of economic, social, innovation and operational. An indicator of economic impact could be tourism - promoting museums and local culture through digital resources and thereby attracting tourism; of social impact could be accessibility - an increase of public access to heritage resources through the internet; of innovation could be creativity, seeing the stimulation and development of public awareness of innovation and creativity; and of operational, effectiveness - an associated growth in the effectiveness of museum resource management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To understand whether stakeholders found these indicators useful and their perceived importance, I conducted a survey (via an online questionnaire) of two groups and gained 494 perspectives from the wider public (the audience for heritage organisations) and 43 perspectives from museum professionals across China. I also conducted 30 follow-up interviews with 20 public participants and 10 museum professionals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings and implications for heritage professionals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both groups found the indicators I developed useful in demonstrating the various impacts digital museum resources can have; however, the importance given to the impact indicators varied between the two, offering some of the following conclusions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The operational impact of digital heritage resources is becoming more important.</strong> Museum professionals rate operational impact the highest, while the public group rates rate social impact as the most important. However, there are increasing concerns among museum audiences about the operations of heritage organisations. Although 37.9% of the public participants rank operational impact the lowest, another 33.8%, (mostly young people), consider it the most important dimension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improvements should be made to increase the outward innovation impact of digital heritage resources.</strong> Although both groups ranked innovation impact the second most important dimension, they consider this type of impact to be more inward-facing and rate ‘Creativity – Stimulate and develop public awareness of innovation and creativity’ the lowest among all innovation impact indicators. In the follow-up interviews, participants from both groups suggested that digital resources are more useful for data management than for stimulating innovation in the way people live and work or their way of thinking. A recommendation is to develop more interactive digital resources and embed them in creative activities such as games and self-made artworks or creative adaptations online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More convincing evidence should be generated to support economic impact claims.</strong> Both groups agree that economic impact is the least important dimension. Several interview participants mentioned that there hasn’t been enough convincing evidence to support the economic impact claims and expressed concerns about heritage organisations focusing too much on economic gain. This points to ongoing debates around the role of today’s museums as both educational institutions and economic engines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We should adopt a more nuanced approach to understand the beneficiaries of digital impact rather than considering them as a homogeneous community.</strong> Delving deeper into the data, I found that the closer an individual lives to rural areas, the more they find digital heritage resources impactful. This echoes the data on frequency of museum visits: almost half of the participants living in villages or rural areas have never been to physical museums. Due to limited access to physical heritage resources, they are more likely to benefit from digital resources. It is therefore important for heritage professionals to ask not only who made the impacts but also who benefits from the impacts and to what extent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cultural context matters when understanding the values of digital heritage resources.</strong> I asked both groups to rate in order of importance the five Value Lenses. Education value was rated the highest and community value the lowest by both groups. This echoes the low average scores of indicators that embody the community value of digital museum resources. This may be due to the specific cultural setting of this research, as ‘community/community-building’ is not a familiar concept in China. It is important for heritage professionals to always take cultural context into account when understanding the values of digital heritage resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have any questions or would like to know more about the project, please get in touch with me at <a href=\"mailto:yangyiman.fu@kcl.ac.uk\">yangyiman.fu@kcl.ac.uk</a>.

                body: "<p>There is an exciting - and sometimes overwhelming - array of possible storytelling methods available online. But while digital storytelling can take many different forms, the best examples all engage people on a personal and emotional level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Audiences want to feel informed by digital stories, but also curious, immersed, inspired and connected by them. It is this that sets storytelling apart from other content types; and it is this that gives storytelling such a role to play in engagement and community-building across the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based on the emotional engagement experienced by Task Force members and the trends identified in the numerous examples we considered, we recommend the following tips for creating emotionally engaging storytelling with digital culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Consider the human significance of cultural artefacts and sites. Help people imagine themselves in someone else’s shoes. We like:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://yourstory.tenement.org/\">Your Story, Our Story</a> (Tenement Museum, New York), <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/stories\">Wellcome Stories</a> (Wellcome Collection, London) and <a href=\"https://izi.travel/it/b0b9-le-storie-del-museo-archeologico-nazionale-delle-marche/it#a7d2-brocca-con-bocca-obliqua-da-conelle-di-arcevia/it\">The stories</a> of the National Archaeological Museum of the Marche.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Be informal but expert</strong>: People want to learn from experts, but it shouldn’t be a chore. As long as the content is well-informed, the format and tone of your story can be experimental and playful. Finding the right balance is important. We like: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/themerl/status/1099661508852752390?lang=en\">‘There is a bat in the library’</a> (Museum of English Rural Life, Reading) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I&amp;t=1s\">The Royal Game of Ur</a> (British Museum, London).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Tell those hidden stories</strong>: So much cultural history remains untold. When choosing subjects, consider who is missing from the picture, and try to give a voice to a range of people and communities.&nbsp; We like <a href=\"https://peoplenotproperty.hudsonvalley.org/\">People Not Property</a> (Historic Hudson Valley, USA), <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/JewsOfLebanon\">Minority Report: The Jews of Lebanon</a> (Arab News) and <a href=\"https://www.rgs.org/about/our-collections/online-exhibitions/hidden-histories-of-exploration/\">Hidden Histories of Exploration</a> (Royal Geographical Society, London).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Illustrate your points</strong>: A key strength of the cultural heritage sector is its wealth of visual imagery. Long written or spoken narratives can be hard to engage with. Breaking up the story with visual (or audio) material, and building in time to reflect on it, can enrich the experience. We like <a href=\"https://www.museodelprado.es/actualidad/multimedia/las-hilanderas-una-historia-en-imagenes/39def9b0-fa00-4121-ad78-1deacb907f3b\">Las hilanderas. Una historia en imágenes</a> (Museo del Prado, Madrid), <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/online-features/metkids/\">MetKids</a> and <a href=\"https://buntegoetter.liebieghaus.de/en/\">Gods In Color</a> (Liebieghaus, Frankfurt).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Signpost your journey</strong>:The best stories take people on a clear journey. In digital storytelling - particularly on complex or experimental platforms - clear narrative structure is essential. Keep the navigation simple, so the visitor always knows where they are. We like <a href=\"https://thingsthattalk.net/\">Things that Talk</a> (Things That Talk Foundation) and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/07/arts/design/hokusai-fuji.html\">A Picture of Change for a World in Constant Motion</a> (New York Times).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Be specific</strong>: Specific topics can still engage a broad audience. Start from a particular detail that lies at the heart of your story, then move to the bigger picture. Personal stories and well-chosen images can help keep your focus. We like <a href=\"https://www.artuk.org/discover/stories\">Artwork in Focus</a> (Art UK) and <a href=\"https://www.louvre.fr/en/oal\">A Closer Look</a> (Louvre, Paris).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Be evocative</strong>: Cultural history stories need to be based in fact, but the facts don’t need to be dry. Don’t be afraid to use descriptive and evocative imagery and approaches and invite the viewer to place themselves within the scene. We like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EghamMuseum/status/1311453097462575104\">You Are Flora Seville</a> (Egham Museum), <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/events/faint-signals\">Faint Signals</a> (British Library, London) and <a href=\"http://80s.nyc/#show/40.6943/-73.9851\">80s.NYC</a> (New York City Municipal Archives’ Department of Finance Collection).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can view these tips as an <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/learn-to-create-better-stories-with-our-tips-a37ca83b2a84\">infographic</a>, or as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbSB2H59GYo&amp;t=32s\">recorded presentation</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-lZW3h3otGKGjbTeJLUeQf3xIjSKN8u2cVDqkxg0gnA/edit?usp=sharing\">slidedeck</a>, or find an <a href=\"https://medium.com/digital-storytelling-festival/7-digital-storytelling-tips-for-the-cultural-heritage-sector-8e701a439dd6\">extended version of this article on Medium</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And if you would like to find out more about the work of the storytelling Task Force, don’t miss our webinar on 9 June!</p>\r\n"

The labels or categories from the training dataset are also known as the ‘ground truth’, meaning that those are the true or correct labels for the given images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We used a type of convolutional neural network as our classifier for the images, which is a mathematical model with a layered structure inspired by the functioning of the brain. A convolutional neural network is a deep learning model designed to extract relevant information from images, and they are the usual choice for computer vision applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our case, the input of the model was an image, and the output was a probability distribution over all the categories of the target vocabulary. It gave each category a number between 0 and 1 that is often interpreted as a confidence score. This model was then trained by iteratively predicting images from the dataset, and correcting the resulting predictions by comparing them with the actual ground truth.</p>\r\n"

While it is far from perfect, the model can learn from our enriched collections, and can be applied to new images to generate potentially useful metadata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main limitation of our approach is that the concepts of the vocabulary are not exclusive, and this doesn’t align well with a single class per image. For example, an image can be a photograph and contain both a building and a sculpture, but due to the single label approach we can only train and evaluate our model to identify one of these aspects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This gives us a model that often outputs a high confidence score for only one of the categories, with the confidence for the rest of the categories low. By setting a low threshold for the confidence scores of the output, we can get more than one label as the output. However, this approach is not ideal since all the confidence scores need to add up to one (as in any legal probability distribution), which prevents high confidence values in the case of a vocabulary with multiple categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ideally, our model would be a multilabel classifier - a model that is trained with more than one label per image and that is able to output high confidence scores for several categories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is also worth mentioning that our dataset has been assembled without human supervision (we didn’t review the images obtained or checked whether or not they are indeed aligned with the categories). This means that the quality of the dataset will depend on the metadata associated with the cultural heritage objects and on previous <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment#automatic-semantic-enrichment\">automatic enrichments</a> based on metadata. In practice not all the images from the training dataset were aligned with the correct categories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are currently assembling a training dataset for multilabel classification, and will share our work and approach in a future Pro news post - stay tuned! In the meantime, you can explore our <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/rd-img-classification-pilot\">Github repository</a> for the pilot,and this <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B3S_DYQ6UtCYGaScygcf_BZa0Ifml4SR?usp=sharing\">Colab notebook</a>, where you can make your own queries to Europeana Search API and apply the single label classification model.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Feel free to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:rd@europeana.eu\">rd@europeana.eu</a> if you have any questions or ideas!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The CDSM Directive aims to harmonise certain aspects of EU Member States’ copyright legislation and to provide legal certainty to digital and cross-border uses of copyright protected works. More specifically, the CDSM Directive has important provisions that seek to facilitate text and data mining, the use of copyright protected works in digital and online education, digital preservation, the online publication of out of commerce works, and to safeguard the public domain online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its introduction, months of frenetic lobbying and regular updates at the European Union level on the Directive were followed by two much quieter years. In June 2019, the focus moved to the national level, where Member States have been working to adapt their legislation to the objectives of the Directive. The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted priorities and reduced capacity, and relevant transposition guidance has not been delivered, resulting in most Member States having barely moved from square one in the transposition game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Out of the 27 Member States, only The Netherlands, Hungary and very recently Germany have fully adopted the Directive; France has adopted some of the provisions and some additional legislative steps for the remaining ones; Italy has also gone through some legislative steps and a Government Decree is underway; Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Luxembourg and Romania have issued draft laws; and the other fifteen Member States have only made a timid start through for instance a public consultation. Norway will also adopt the provisions in the Directive, whereas the United Kingdom has indicated that it will not be transposing it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the meantime, a few things have happened alongside progress at the Member State level. The European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), in charge of developing a portal for out of commerce works as envisaged in the Directive, has been working and consulting stakeholders to have a <a href=\"https://euipo.europa.eu/out-of-commerce/#/\" target=\"_blank\">first version of the portal available</a>. In the realm of the very controversial Article 17 of the Directive, the Commission held several stakeholder dialogues in view of providing guidance which was only <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/guidance-article-17-directive-2019790-copyright-digital-single-market\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a>&nbsp;on 4 June 2021. At the same time, the Polish Government requested the annulment of parts of this article to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The ruling has not yet been issued, and a decision by the Advocate General is awaited.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Netherlands: the first full transposition</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As early as 29 December 2020, the Dutch implementation law was published in the official journal, with an indication of its entry into force today. As the first full transposition, its approach is likely to be taken as a reference by other Member States, although the text barely moves away from that of the Directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is one particularly positive policy choice in the transposition text: digital educational activities used in copyright works are covered by an exception and not a licensing scheme. The exception does however not contemplate cultural heritage institutions as beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/be-part-of-the-discussions-on-out-of-commerce-works\">Stakeholder dialogues</a>, where relevant parties in the discussion will dive deeper into practical questions related to the making available of out of commerce works and the use of text and data mining, have recently started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hungary: legal certainty for digital education during the COVID-19 pandemic</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In April 2020, the Hungarian government amended their educational exception to cover digital and cross-border uses of copyright protected works, adopted as an emergency measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by a consultation proposal on the transposition of the rest of the provisions, which were accepted by the Parliament at the end of April 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Germany: just in time</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Germany adopted the draft law transposing the Directive just in time to meet the deadline. While most of the provisions are close to the text of the Directive, there are two unexpected aspects in the realm of out of commerce works: firstly, the (for several reasons unfortunate) decision to subject the exception for out of commerce works to remuneration, which did not make it to the final text, and secondly the (rather positive) clarity that out of commerce works can be displayed on the EUIPO portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There continue to be <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explainer-what-will-the-new-eu-copyright-rules-change-for-europe-s-cultural-heritage-institutions\">high stakes</a> for the cultural heritage sector in the transposition of this Directive: what could look like small tweaks or additions to the text at the national level has the power of either hampering or facilitating the use of text and data mining technologies, the making available online of out of commerce (including orphan) works, the use of educational material in online settings, or the reusability of public domain material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While 7 June 2021 was initially seen as the end of a process, it is clear now that copyright conversations at the Member State level have only just started. Engaging in policy discussions remains essential.

It’s an integral part of our cultural heritage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Storytelling through sporting heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Throughout the summer and beyond, Europeana will feature digital storytelling about sporting heritage in a number of formats.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Editorials on the Europeana website will illustrate the story of European sporting heritage through a variety of remarkable cultural heritage objects that showcase the geographic and cultural diversity of Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blogs and galleries will feature a wide range of sports - from football and athletics to less-played sports like futnet and surfing. We will feature the lives of both famous and unfamiliar men and women who have played sports, as well as describing sports you may not have heard of, such as ploughing. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />All the editorials will be gathered on a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/sport\">specially created page on Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the Europeana website, keep an eye on our social media profiles to discover interactive features highlighting sporting heritage. We’re planning regular games and quizzes to&nbsp; engage audiences in new ways, including an email course at the end of the summer. To start, you can follow our alternate arts and culture European Cup&nbsp;tournament, a virtual equivalent to EURO2020 - more information will be available soon on our <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\">Instagram</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sharing stories&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the same way that Europeana 1914-1918, Europeana Migration and Europe at Work gathered personal stories from the public, partners in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport project</a> will gather personal stories of sporting activities and achievements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Events - both in person and online - will take place over the next months. Our partners are planning events in France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Scotland and Spain, in venues such as stadiums, schools, museums and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some events have already taken place - Biblioteca Județeană 'Octavian Goga'&nbsp;in Cluj-Napoca, Romania hosted <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/search?query=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22Europeana%20Sport%20collection%20day,%20Cluj-Napoca,%202021-04-15%E2%80%932021-04-16%22\">two collection days in April and May</a>. The next event will take place in EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum in Dublin later in June.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Orphan works and a black hole of cultural heritage</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Orphan works (referred to in a broad sense and not necessarily in the sense of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012L0028\">Orphan Works Directive</a>) are works in copyright where the rights holders are either unknown or cannot be traced. Across EU heritage institutions, there are probably hundreds of millions of orphan works, sometimes <a href=\"https://naomikorn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SCA_CollTrust_Orphan_Works_v1-final.pdf\">representing up to 40-50% of collection items</a>. Due to their nature, the requirements of copyright law and the lack of fit for purpose solutions, orphan works represent a massive issue for the mass digitisation and publication (including online) of assets owned by cultural heritage institutions across Europe. The lack of access to orphan works has created a black hole of cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For many years, risk management has provided the only possible option for cultural heritage institutions to make their orphan works available online. The 2012 Orphan Works Directive was an important development in providing a solution to help open up online access to orphan works held by heritage institutions across the EU and facilitate mass digitisation of the treasures in their collections. It requires reasonable searches to establish if rights holders could be located and if not, heritage institutions can register details of their orphan works on an EUIPO Orphan Works database. Once this is done, orphan works can be published online with little risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The ongoing relevance of risk management</strong><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Disappointingly, due to a number of issues the EU Orphan Works Directive has not been as widely used as hoped, and risk management remains an important consideration for institutions, including in the UK and those across the EU not using the Orphan Works Directive. Notably, until the UK left the EU on 1st January 2021, UK heritage institutions had used the Orphan Works Directive to publish some of their orphan works online. When the cross-border copyright arrangements unique to EU member states stopped, UK heritage institutions who had already used the Orphan Works Exception were no longer able to use it as a basis for their online reproduction of orphan works, and could no longer consider its use for any future online publication of their orphan works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking ahead, the EU Copyright Directive includes important provisions and exceptions for cultural heritage institutions, libraries and archives which enable the online reproduction of out-of-commerce works, including orphan works. While countries across the EU are currently implementing the Copyright Directive, unfortunately, UK institutions will not be able to benefit from these provisions because of the UK leaving the EU and choosing not to implement the EU Copyright Directive. In addition, the UK’s Orphan Works Licensing Scheme, run by the UK Government, only covers the use of orphan works in the UK, which does not eliminate the legal risk entirely if something is made available online and is therefore accessible and used from a country other than the UK. Consequently, for UK institutions and those across the EU not using the Orphan Works Directive, risk management becomes an even more important consideration in opening up access to their orphan works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A checklist for risk management&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to stress that risk management is an institutional choice. It should always be carefully considered against any likely risks and costs, as well as documented. If your institution decides to reproduce its orphan works, then the following risk assessment checklist could be useful:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Keep records of all attempts made to contact the rights holders.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Accompany the reproduction of orphan works with attribution statements where known.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Introduce notice and take down policies and procedures to enable the removal of orphan works should the rights holders come forward.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Reproduce images in low resolution.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Assess the specific risks of reproducing orphan works on a case by case basis, for example, according to the type of work, subject matter and age, to reduce the risk of high profile rights holders coming forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Restrict any use to 'Non-Commercial research or private study.'</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Put money aside in case rights holders come forward and/or take out insurance</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Carry out reasonable searches. These can include image Recognition Software – use free sites like <a href=\"http://www.tineye.com\">TinEye</a>&nbsp;and Advanced Google Search.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check the acknowledgements and notes of published works/exhibition catalogues about the author.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check the internet for information about the creator of the material and keep a record of all searches where appropriate.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check the WATCH file on the Internet for information about artists and writers (entered through <a href=\"https://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/watch/\">WATCH</a>).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check other organisations which might hold works by that artist/creator and contact them to see whether they can provide any information about the rights holder.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check with collecting societies.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Establish whether the work has been lent/bequeathed/given by the rights holder. If so, can the person who gave the material provide any contact information for the rights holder?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check whether the material is held in a Picture Library or stock photography agency.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Check if the work by an academic, student, member of support staff or anyone else directly (or indirectly) connected with your organisation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Place an advert in a relevant trade journal or magazine in order to trace the rights holder.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">If the artist or author is still living, then you may be able to find their contact address through online directory enquiries.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to find out more about copyright and the cultural heritage sector,<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\"> join the Europeana Copyright Community</a> through the Europeana Network Association!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Why did you feel there was a need to develop a storytelling manual?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2017, IFLA started to explore challenges and opportunities for the library field around the world through its <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/globalvision\">Global Vision discussion</a>, bringing together more than 30,000 librarians from all continents to discuss actions to meet future challenges and make use of opportunities. <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/node/11905\">Key findings from this work</a> sparked the idea about some kind of a resource supporting storytelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, the Global Vision conversation revealed that we need to understand our community needs better and design services which have a measurable impact on people’s lives. We also need to ensure stakeholders understand our value and impact, and we believe that making a stronger case for the ability of libraries to provide value will build recognition and support among decision-makers. And we need more and better advocates at all levels who not only understand the need for advocacy in improving perceptions but have the capacity and skills to ultimately achieve their advocacy goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the same time, IFLA ran its<a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/libraries-development\"> International Advocacy Programme (IAP)</a>, a capacity-building programme designed to promote and support the role libraries can play in achieving the UN 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Together, these two initiatives – the results of our Global Vision and our International Advocacy Programme - informed and inspired both the creation of space for<a href=\"https://librarymap.ifla.org/stories\"> SDG Stories on the Library Map of the World (LMW</a>) and the development of the <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/publications/libraries-and-the-sustainable-development-goals--a-storytelling-manual?og=7409\">SDG Storytelling Manual</a> – a guide for librarians and library advocates to support them in their advocacy efforts.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>&nbsp;Could you give us a few details about how you put it together?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Manual is a product of collaboration and co-creation. The LMW team worked with the team of the IAP Programme and a group of Associates of IFLA’s <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/leaders\">International Leaders Programme (ILP).</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I led a group of co-authors who each brought their unique experience and expertise. These ranged from measurement and impact evaluation, dealing with pictures and videos for digital stories, copyright and licensing, to community engagement and advocacy. We were a really diverse group of people coming from different countries including Argentina, China, Colombia, Egypt, Latvia, Philippines, Senegal, Serbia, Mexico, and the United States of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Manual needed to be a practical help guide containing tips and useful information. We wanted to keep it simple, not too long, but at the same time provide guidance through the most important parts. We included links to further information online, or to easy-to-use digital tools. The structure for storytelling that we offer can be used for any type of storytelling but it becomes even more important when it is SDG storytelling for the LMW&nbsp;because we want to make sure we are able to back up our story with some impact evidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are&nbsp;your top tips for successful storytelling?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, include impact planning and data collection from the beginning of your activity, project or programme. If you have defined what you want to achieve, it will be easy to collect data on that. And consequently, you will have data and evidence not only for storytelling and advocacy but for your future project planning and management. Crucially, in our SDG stories, we want to switch focus from libraries and what we do to why and how we do it, and what change it brings to people’s lives, communities, and development, or in other words, what is our impact?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, do not forget to take good pictures or make a video. Visual material brings the whole story to life. Articles with an image once every 75-100 words get double the number of social media shares than articles with fewer images (see page 14 of the Manual).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Third, keep track of copyright and licensing of your visual material. Sometimes I deal with cases when it is hard to find out who the author of a photograph is and consequently, we cannot start the conversation about the licence or ultimately use some very nice visual elements which would add to the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a story is published, our communications team create a short video - but we can only do this if we have good pictures with open licences (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV81siTMahbu7D0ApWj1OoFUXflaGncWg\">check out our SDG stories playlist on YouTube).&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n"

We actually ran out of printed copies very fast! However, even 30 pages, which is quite little for a topic like this, can sometimes be too much. So we created a one-page version of the most important things- the <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/publications/node/92032?og=7409\">SDG Storytelling Flowchart (available in seven languages)</a>. By answering yes or no to the flowchart questions, people can see if their story is suitable for the LMW and&nbsp;check if it has all the required elements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We learned that even if everything is well-explained in the Manual, it is very challenging for many people to keep their story short and to talk about important things – our impact, our communities and people, rather than simply about libraries. So, instead of asking our contributors to write the story and fit within our word limits etc.,we decided to draft the story narratives ourselves, based on the information received from contributors. Now, everyone engaged is happier – contributors spend less time in preparation and submission of stories, and the LMW team can get more stories online faster. We now have close to 50&nbsp;stories to explore and inspire you, all showcasing the impact libraries have in achieving SDG .</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e94cb63f-7fff-b3cb-9da7-efbb6d4f2a92\">Thank you Kristine, for sharing your experience with us!

The perspectives offered by the speakers and participants contributed to our shared understanding of capacity building in the sector and how Europeana can support it. Through the workshop sessions, roundtable discussions and case study presentations we explored the multifaceted nature of capacity building. It’s the process by which individuals and organisations obtain, improve, and retain skills, knowledge, tools, and other resources - with&nbsp; no universal approach that fits all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The participants suggested that a range of considerations are critical to support digital capacity building, including: integration of cultural heritage goals into national strategies, clear policy direction, advocacy for the sector, allocation of sufficient funds to the cultural sector and its digital transition, the European Commission’s support and leadership, training, multilinguality, collaboration within the sector and cross-sectoral collaboration at local, national and European level. The variety of these considerations from various perspectives reflect the multi-faceted nature of digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Manuscripts on stage Transcribathon&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In conjunction with the conference, our first fully online Transcribathon - <a href=\"https://europeana.transcribathon.eu/runs/manuscritos_no_palco_pt/\">Manuscritos non palco</a> - running from 31 May to 7 June saw 30 participants use the Transcribathon platform to transcribe over 1 million characters from texts from the digital collection of the National Theatre D. Maria II. The event was organised under the auspices of the Portuguese Presidency with the National Library of Portugal, Europeana, Facts &amp; Files and the Teatro Nacional D. Maria II as part of its 175th anniversary. The winner João Oliveira transcribed 332,757 characters and added 2,069 enrichments. The award for best presentation went to Andrea Valencia and Marcos Cavalho.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the coming months, the Europeana Initiative will continue to reflect on and facilitate conversations on capacity building, building on the outcomes of this meeting.

                body: "<h3><strong>What is the European Heritage Label?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/cultural-heritage/initiatives-and-success-stories/european-heritage-label-sites\">European Heritage Label (EHL)</a> was established as an EU initiative in 2011. It aims to harness the potential of heritage sites to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the Union, as well as their appreciation of national and regional diversity, mutual understanding and intercultural dialogue. To this date, 48 sites have been awarded the Label across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Label is awarded to sites that have a symbolic European value and develop a project to promote their European significance. In particular, EHL sites aim to raise awareness and understanding of the history of Europe, particularly through educational activities, and improve accessibility by promoting multilingualism and exploiting opportunities offered by new technologies and digital means.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under the European Heritage Label action, sites can be monuments; natural, underwater, archaeological, industrial or urban sites; cultural landscapes; places of remembrance; and cultural goods and objects and intangible heritage associated with a place, including contemporary heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The network of EHL sites covers over 100,000 years of European history, starting with<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/european-heritage-label/krapina-neanderthal-site\"> Krapina Neanderthal Prehistoric Site and Museum</a> where visitors can discover how the first human communities in Europe lived.

The network also includes sites that have played a direct role in the European integration process, including the<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/cultural-heritage/initiatives-and-success-stories/european-heritage-label/european-heritage-label/european-district-strasbourg-strasbourg-france\"> European District of Strasbourg</a>, the<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/cultural-heritage/initiatives-and-success-stories/european-heritage-label/european-heritage-label/village-schengen-luxembourg\"> Village of Schengen</a> and the<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/cultural-heritage/initiatives-and-success-stories/european-heritage-label/european-heritage-label/maastricht-treaty-netherlands\"> Treaty of Maastricht</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Heritage Label is open to heritage sites located in the Member States of the European Union, and the following Member States have shown interest in taking part in EHL: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia. <a href=\"https://geo.osnabrueck.de/ehl/EN/map\">Explore the EHL sites’ map</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>European Heritage Label and digital tools</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A key element of the EHL is raising the profile, attractiveness and accessibility of the sites on a European scale through the possibilities offered by digital tools, and EHL sites have varied steps to incorporate digital into their activities. The examples reported in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/document/european-heritage-label-panel-report-monitoring-2020\">2020 monitoring report</a> particularly focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Digitisation of collections, including by the <a href=\"https://www.uc.pt/en/bguc\">General Library of the University of Coimbra</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.culturaydeporte.gob.es/archivos-aca/portada.html\">Archive of the Crown of Aragon</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Presentation of complex heritage using virtual reality, for example at the <a href=\"https://www.carnuntum.at/de\">Archaeological Site of Carnuntum</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.cluny-abbaye.fr/\">Abbey of Cluny</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Educational projects and material, such as that developed by The Heart of Ancient Athens’ <a href=\"http://theheartofancientathens.gr/en/pageorigins\">Origins</a> project, University of Tartu’s <a href=\"https://www.muuseum.ut.ee/en/node/293\">European heritage stories</a> virtual map and more recently Fort Cadine’s <a href=\"https://www.cultura.trentino.it/eng/Events/Back-to-Europe\">Back to Europe</a> online course. These actions are all funded through the European Heritage Days framework under the joint action of the European Commission and the Council of Europe.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another major achievement of the European Heritage Label has been the promotion of multilingualism online, including through the <a href=\"https://geo.osnabrueck.de/ehl/EN/map\">EHL sites’ map</a>, hosted by Münster and Osnabrück – Sites of the Peace of Westphalia, which is available in all official languages of Member States participating in the action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EHL action seeks to further exploit the opportunities provided by developing digital tools&nbsp;through the growing network of sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Joining the network of EHL sites</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pre-selection of sites for the European Heritage Label is organised by National coordinators in each participating Member State. The final selection of sites for the attribution of the label is carried out at European Union level every two years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information, please visit the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/cultural-heritage/initiatives-and-success-stories/european-heritage-label-sites\">European Heritage Label website</a> or contact the European Commission, Directorate-General Education, Youth, Sport and Culture at <a href=\"mailto:EAC-EUROPEAN-HERITAGE-LABEL-COORDINATION@ec.europa.eu\">EAC-EUROPEAN-HERITAGE-LABEL-COORDINATION@ec.europa.eu</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more examples of how digital can be used to support and enrich built heritage, explore Europeana’s page on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The needs and resources of cultural heritage institutions and the professionals who work for them are many and varied. When it comes to working with digital material and transforming working practices to take advantage of digital technologies and processes, what stands out is the richness and complexity of today’s networks, and the variety of digital practices. Organisational digital strategies can help an institution to manage its activity in this area, as well as the expectations of its stakeholders and the skills development of its staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today we talk to Céline Leclaire from the National Library of France (BnF) about its new digital strategy, what it means for the organisation and how they’ve used a novel visualisation of it to engage staff and stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First of all, please share a little bit about yourself and your day-to-day role.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2015, I’ve been in charge of designing, writing and disseminating various strategic media, mainly dealing with digital issues, on behalf of the Services and Networks Directorate at the National Library of France (BnF). This Directorate is composed of about 600 people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector mean to you, personally?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It represents an amazing opportunity to thoroughly explore new content, to offer audiences continuous collections all over the world, and, thus, to meet otherness through totally different ways of thinking and creating. It is also a challenge: people need support to shift towards digital tools and practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What led the BnF to creating this 2021 digital strategy?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As digital technologies and projects constantly evolve at the BnF (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/pioneering-ai-for-digital-cultural-heritage-an-interview-with-dr-emmanuelle-bermes\">see Emmanuelle Bermès</a>&nbsp;interview on Europeana Pro), we decided at the beginning of 2019 to reconsider the <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/en/schema-numerique-bnf-2016\">digital roadmap launched in 2016</a>. It was not the Library’s first roadmap in this field: the mapping process began in the late 2000s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/sites/default/files/2021-04/SN%202020_poster_BAT_ANG%2003.pdf\">2020 Digital Roadmap</a>&nbsp;is the result of a ground-breaking collective approach involving about 150 people and it brings out the increasing importance of issues related to the working environment at the Library, for both staff and users - something we were already thinking about before the 2020 lockdown.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the key points of the new strategy?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Five strategic priorities have been defined:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Managing the evolution of work</li>\r\n    <li>Studying, examining and anticipating uses</li>\r\n    <li>Sharing infrastructures, know-how and skills</li>\r\n    <li>Managing information technology applications</li>\r\n    <li>Overcoming the digital divide</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>They are complemented by a five-fold vision for the future (<a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/en/digital-roadmap\">see more</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana and the BnF have worked together for over a decade.&nbsp; How is the partnership reflected in the strategy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look closely, you will see partners right in the middle of the map, just near the cartographers at work… Partnership is indeed a key point of the Library’s digital strategy. Europeana &nbsp;is one of the best examples, as stressed in the fact sheet dealing with IIIF (<a href=\"https://www.bnf.fr/sites/default/files/2020-11/bnf_Schema_numerique_2020_.pdf\">in French</a>), a technology that helps make any <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/iiif-datasets-in-europeana-a-scholar-s-delight\">digital library more user-friendly</a>. Topics such as putting content in perspective or developing tools to explore content also echo the Library’s multifaceted work with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What change do you hope to see for the BnF as a result of the new digital strategy?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This strategy rests on core concerns such as access, finding tools that meet current needs, and engaging audiences. So the 2016 Digital roadmap isn’t completely outdated! The 2020 Roadmap displays a panoramic and comprehensive view of the Library’s digital life in order to help people find their way and work together in this complex ecosystem day-to-day. What is important is to stay curious, smart and resourceful in such areas, and to be ready to go further, to deepen your knowledge. In that respect, the 2020 Digital Roadmap represents an invitation, first designed for the BnF’s staff but also available to anyone, worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does the strategy address building capacity for digital skills?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, we quickly realised that it wouldn’t be enough to launch a document: you have to organise workshops and presentations so that people can talk together. A human approach is necessary when dealing with skills improvement, especially in the digital area. Indeed, the map has already been proven to be a relevant background for debates and explanations. For instance, at the Library, the roadmap has been added to the ‘welcome kit’ for new staff members. One of the major strategic axes of the Roadmap is ‘Managing the evolution of work’ and relates to training and recruitment processes, but the Roadmap itself also contributes to such an evolution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You’ve used a very visual approach to promoting the strategy - with a map and a set of cards. Why did you choose this approach and how have staff and stakeholders reacted to it?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The medium chosen in 2020 is quite unusual, drawing inspiration from both the Library’s collections of maps and plans, and from card games. People are seduced by the beauty of the map (you can see it on the walls in many places in the Library), they reuse its drawings in other documents and want to play with the cards. The method is very inspiring too and gives new ideas to our colleagues. But people also tell us that the map is not so easy to understand. We considered making the whole medium interactive, but we also wanted to offer something that could be held in your hands. We hope we’ll soon have the opportunity to propose this rich material to design students: we’ll see how they transform it!</p>\r\n"

The model we developed was able to classify images into categories from our target vocabulary, but only identified one aspect (or ‘label’) of&nbsp;each image. So we then began to work on training the model to classify an image with more than one label - so concepts like ‘photograph’ and ‘sculpture’ could be identified in the same image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In order to train this multilabel image classification model, we had to gather a training dataset containing images with multiple labels in their metadata. We made use of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search\">Europeana Search API</a> by searching for&nbsp;objects indexed with more than one concept from our vocabulary, resulting in 9,000 objects in total. As with our previous single label classification effort, we didn’t review this dataset, so the quality of the labels depended on the quality of previous enrichments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the case of multilabel classification, the correct metadata (or ground truth) contained more than one label for each image. We trained a convolutional neural network to classify the images&nbsp;and then used the resulting model on objects obtained from the Search API.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />You can see some of the examples with their predictions, confidence scores and interpretability maps below.</p>\r\n"

The multilabel approach is more helpful than using single labels since it can apply several labels to each image with high confidence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the interesting results, the performance of the resulting model is far from perfect, and we can attribute this to several factors. The most important is the relatively low quality of the dataset gathered. We found out that many of the images retrieved don’t have correct metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, most of the data used for training was provided by the <a href=\"https://digitaltmuseum.no/\">Norwegian DigitalMuseum</a>. This means that the training data does not reflect the entire data distribution at Europeana, causing the model to be biased towards the data it has been trained with. The biases of the training data will translate in a lack of generalisation for the rest of images from Europeana. In simple terms, the model will perform well on images similar to the ones contained in the training dataset, but it will fail if the images are too different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, our training data is good enough for the model to learn some basic patterns. The model did well despite the challenging setting of using data with incorrect labels. However, the quality of previous enrichments is not suitable for using them as training data for building a model to enrich our collections. A solution to this is to create a higher quality training dataset, to ensure that our model is presented with the right labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future work: crowdsourcing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After training and evaluating the multilabel classification model, we have concluded that assigning multiple labels to the images from our collection is more suitable than enriching them with a single label.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are considering expanding the vocabulary by including other terms relevant to cultural heritage. More importantly, we are planning to review and expand the training dataset, with the goal of identifying and correcting possible biases and errors. We would like to ensure that our model is presented with the right labels, which is expected to perform significantly better than when trained with 'noisy'&nbsp;labels. We have launched a <a href=\"https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/rd-europeana/europeana-image-classification-pilot/classify\">crowdsourcing campaign</a> for building a high-quality annotated dataset with Zooniverse, and we welcome contributions from our community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can follow our work in this <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/rd-img-classification-pilot\">Github repository</a>. We also invite you to experiment with this <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SKPKiUfLDtqg_gW5D3lR37spwd13_LTr?usp=sharing\">Colab notebook</a>, where you can make your own queries to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/search\">Europeana Search API</a> and apply the multilabel classification model.

                body: "<p>The Presidency’s cultural programme included concerts, art installations and exhibitions. It used theatre, cinema, music, dance and the visual arts&nbsp;to confirm the importance of a resilient, social, green, digital and global Europe. The cultural programme demonstrated how culture and cultural activities are relevant to and can be used to shape high level policy thinking, and to drive policy in a range of areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How was the National Library of Portugal involved in the Presidency?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Library of Portugal (NLP) was involved through the organisation of the Europeana conference as an official event of the Portuguese Presidency. NLP has also been involved in some other initiatives related to the Presidency, such as the transcribathon Manuscripts on stage organised with Teatro Nacional D. Maria II. This was an excellent opportunity to highlight the importance of actively engaging the public in the enrichment and reuse of European cultural heritage, towards an effective democratisation of culture.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>We can see that the Presidency really put culture at the heart of both its policy and its event programming - why is that?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Portuguese Presidency has made a strong statement about the importance of culture throughout the semester, highlighting the essential role that culture plays in promoting social, territorial and economic cohesion, as well as the potential of cultural activities and assets for the economic recovery in the post-pandemic context. That is the reason why Portugal has put culture at the heart of the Presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was the most important issue for you in the policy programme?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Promoting the role of culture and media in building inclusive and cohesive societies has been one of the main priorities for the Germany-Portugal-Slovenia agenda for 18 months, demonstrating the importance of culture in the future of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another aspect to underline is the transition to a greener, more digital and more resilient economy&nbsp; - the main goal of the recovery and resilience plans. The Presidency is a unique opportunity to push forward the digital transformation in culture that the cultural heritage sector and Europeana have been working on in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Portuguese Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), for example, will include a significant component to support promoting the digital transition of cultural heritage institutions. The RRP will support digital network activities and funding for the digitisation, accessibility and reuse of Portuguese cultural heritage. These investments will also be crucial for the conservation of&nbsp; heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did incorporating a cultural programme shape the discussions taking place throughout the event?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cultural programme was essential to get a wide variety of communities involved and to elicit discussions and other forms of participation that otherwise would not show up in the political context of the Presidency. And it provided an international opportunity to showcase&nbsp; Portuguese heritage and cultural life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To find out more about the Europeana Portuguese Presidency event on building digital capacity for the cultural heritage sector, watch <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/towards-recovery-digital-capacity-building-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">our videos from the event!&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n"

Europeana will feature digital storytelling about sporting heritage, from collection days to blogs and galleries, while the new <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/nl/sport\">Sports Stories page</a> on Europeana gives a global audience direct access to wonderful sporting material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The season coincides with the Europeana Generic Services project, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-sport\">Europeana Sport</a>, which aims to deliver new digital objects relating to sporting heritage to Europeana. Among other Generic Services projects, <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en\">The Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision</a> is a partner in Europeana Sport as well as the coordinator of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX</a>, focusing on the 20th century’s social, political and economical changes. Bringing these projects together, Sound &amp; Vision teamed up with Dutch sport historian Jurryt van de Vooren to explore how to tell the story of 125 years of Olympics through both a Dutch and global lens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Researching the rich collections on Europeana we realised that there was something missing: the beautiful collection of <a href=\"https://www.nocnsf.nl/\">NOC*NSF</a>, the Dutch Olympic organisation. With the help of <a href=\"https://erfgoedgelderland.nl/\">Erfgoed Gelderland</a>, we approached Bernard Hilgers, Conservator Olympic Sport Heritage, at NOC*NSF and asked if it would be possible to open up their rich collection for inclusion in Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is quite a long story! In my teenage years I wanted to study piano, but there are many interesting coincidences in my life which somehow played the role of life direction-changing milestones. For example, my dad brought a Commodore 64 computer from a trip to the UK in the early 1980s. Programming was only part of the curricula of schools specialising in mathematics at that point, but I taught myself and my younger brother how to write programmes in BASIC, and my school thesis was on automated segmentation of Latin words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From that point onwards, I was always curious how new technologies can support ‘doing’ with historical and cultural material. I did a MSc in Informatics, then joined the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. I earned my PhD degree in Informatics (1999) with digital humanities research in Eastern Europe. I served as the founding head of the first Digitisation Centre in Bulgaria (2004), which collaborated with the National Library Ivan Vazov, the State Archives and other institutions from the heritage sectors. From 2008 - 2011 I worked at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, where I was a principal investigator in research projects in user experience and in digital preservation. From 2012 - 2017 I was a resident Associate Professor in the Media and Knowledge Science Faculty of the University of Malta, where I spearheaded an update and expansion of the portfolio of programmes in library, information, and archival science (LIAS). In addition, I brought the first EC-funded project to LIAS, <a href=\"https://www.civic-epistemologies.eu/project/\">Civic Epistemologies</a>, which developed a roadmap for citizen science in digital heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After these experiences in the far west of Europe, and then in the most southern part of it, I moved east. In 2017, I joined University College London&nbsp;in its campus in Doha, <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/global/regional-focus/ucl-qatar-2010-2020\">UCL Qatar</a>, where I hosted a booksprint which produced the first guidebook in this domain,<a href=\"https://glamlabs.pubpub.org/\">’Open a GLAM Lab’</a> in 2019. In&nbsp;October 2020, I moved back to Bulgaria.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently working on a reintegration grant supported by the Bulgarian National Science Fund in my home country, Bulgaria. I am based in the <a href=\"https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/bg\">Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Sofia University St Kliment Ohridski</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/bg/faculty/milena-petrova-dobreva\">my project (DISTILL)</a> is exploring what can be disruptive in the GLAM sectors - what developments change the way these institutions function.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One concept I am investigating around this is heteromation. We all are familiar with crowdsourcing and citizen science, but they are just instances of heteromation. The term was coined by the cognitive scientist Bonnie Nardi as a comparison with the term automation. In automated environments the machines are doing part of the human work. The term heteromation captures those situations when humans are contributing to automated work in ways which may be hidden and uncompensated. In GLAM institutions, people who contribute with transcription, tagging and other activities which enrich digital content are not being paid but usually have a deep interest and participate on a voluntary basis. Such contributions generate value and there is more work to do in understanding the actual economic dimensions of such activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I always worked alongside colleagues from the GLAM sectors. It is very rewarding to identify how researchers can support development in this sector, but it also requires extensive communication and learning to understand each other’s professional languages, concerns and points of view. I particularly enjoy being a connector between the two communities, a role I played when a group of 16 international experts wrote the book <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/innovation-through-glam-labs\">‘Open a GLAM Lab’.</a> We followed the unconventional method of writing a book in a week in a process called a ‘booksprint’, supported by a company with the same name. This was one of the most challenging weeks in my life, but the book was a tremendous success and has been translated into <a href=\"https://qspace.qu.edu.qa/handle/10576/13484\">Arabic</a>, <a href=\"https://clada-bg.eu/images/PDFs/web_ISBN_9786192450939.pdf\">Bulgarian</a>, <a href=\"https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/110281/1/Open-a-GLAM-Lab.pdf\">Spanish</a> and <a href=\"https://qspace.qu.edu.qa/handle/10576/17196\">Russian.</a></p>\r\n"

I should say I was never a fan of the quantitative push, but the contribution of Europeana to the domain of big cultural data has&nbsp;been second to none since it also had to resolve multiple issues around the use of digital material from thousands of institutions. I think one of Europeana’s greatest achievements was in mobilising professionals from multiple institutions to do more in the digitisation and popularisation of their collections. This was a tremendous shift in the digital cultural heritage and scientific domains which gradually created a sizable community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an ongoing process and I thought my experience with different communities around Europe and beyond would be helpful. I should say that as a voluntary role, it is quite demanding - Europeana is a melting pot of new initiatives developing with an impressive intensity and speed. We need more people to help shape this work - and I hope more fellow Association members will consider how their unique knowledge and skills could also help in discussing not only the future of Europeana, but also spearheading the developments in the digital cultural heritage domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor and Management Board member?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am still integrating into the Europeana Network Association work - it is really impressive <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/categories/network\">how much is happening</a>! From the autumn I would like to explore putting in place a series of podcasts to discuss different aspects of inclusivity, diversity and intersectionality, to not only promote a healthy dialogue, but also help to develop new solutions which capture the diversity of viewpoints in the way we present heritage digitally. Europeana is collaborating with multiple stakeholders, and this line of work is vital for heritage institutions, but also for all users of digital heritage content.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Europeana works with heritage institutions and digital heritage to connect communities with their environment and their heritage, across generations. This project shows how digital heritage and cultural heritage institutions can support the development of enriching and inclusive social experiences in a community. It also demonstrates how cultural heritage institutions can work with other actors to play an important role in connecting communities to places in their localities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work</a>&nbsp;brought stories of the personal working lives of citizens across Europe together with archive material on industrial and labour-related heritage. Because work and our places of work aren't just about what we do. It’s often who we are and where we’ve come from. It’s an integral part of our cultural heritage and our connection to our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through Europe at Work, Europeana, the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland, and partners including the Electricity Supply Board and its Archives, came together to engage their wider communities around the history of Ireland’s first national renewable hydro-electric scheme, the advent of which transformed Irish society forever.&nbsp;People were invited to share and digitise their personal memorabilia and stories of the generations of those that helped shape the scheme and contribute to the development of sustainable energy in Ireland. The collection and digitisation of these stories and items took place both onsite at the impressive Shannon Hydro-Electric plant and online, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In one story shared at the event, Marie Dennehy talks about her family’s contribution to the Shannon Scheme. Her father Jack was a foreman, and her brother John Joe worked on the scheme too. But the family involvement didn’t stop there. Jack’s wife, Ellen, took in other workers as lodgers and also ran a shebeen (an unlicensed bar). The death of one of his team members in the construction of the plant deeply affected Jack, but more positively, he used the skills he learned building the plant for the rest of his working life. Through Marie’s story - and many others - we all now have access to heritage that shows how this feat of industrial and sustainable engineering played an important role in the lives of this family and their loved ones, their community, as well as in the history of Ireland itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Peggy Ryan, from the Hunt Museum, describes the importance of this connection, ‘The national significance of the Shannon Scheme since its inception has been well documented. What has been missing is the individual and interpersonal stories of the people that shaped this great project. Stories forge connections among people and convey the culture, values and history that generations can relate to and identify with, especially in relation to large-scale projects.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project is one way Europeana has worked with heritage institutions and digital heritage to connect communities to their environment and their heritage, across generations.</p>\r\n"

Despite this context, the event was able to reach almost 1,650 people who registered to attend the conference, with an estimated 60% (998 participants) attending at least some part of the 11 hours and 20 minutes of formal conference programming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There were three conference themes for each of the three days of the event: bridging digital divides, agency for change, and collaboration. Over 70 speakers joined the event. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/catch-up-with-europeana-2020\">Find out more</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A post-event questionnaire was distributed to all attendees shortly after the event, and a reminder was sent after one week. 224 responses were received which, out of an estimated attendance of over 998 participants, represents a satisfactory sample of around 23%. We found a small bias towards Network members responding. Data were analysed using Excel. All open text responses were left as they were originally written.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Registration data were also analysed to understand better the gender split of registered attendees, the country they were joining from, their gender and age, and if they had any access requirements for the event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following in the footsteps of our work for Europeana 2019, we continued to investigate the environmental impact of our largest annual event. The methodology changed because the format of the conference changed from in-person to completely digital. Having assessed the audience’s likelihood to attend Europeana 2020 had it been in-person together with the expected method of travel, we calculated an approximate carbon footprint for air travel. At the same time, we used three estimates of CO2 emissions caused by online meetings to come up with a scale for Europeana 2020’s digital footprint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Increased accessibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana 2020 was an opportunity for Europeana to welcome almost 1,000 people in attendance at its annual conference, with participants joining from 60 countries across the world (in comparison to 38 countries in 2019).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This wider accessibility was also reflected in increased representation of non-Network members registering for the conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This increased visibility led to a very significant increase in visits to Europeana Pro, where 40,631 sessions were registered in November 2020 (almost 12,000 more than any other month previously).</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Some participants who attended might not have been able to attend had the conference not been digital - with travel, cost and limitations on attendance being some of the potential barriers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The digital format was also more accessible because participants could pick and choose the parts of the event which were most relevant for them to attend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Creating value for participants</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We see an increased literacy in the key themes of the conference, particularly around collaboration as a tool for finding shared solutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">88% of participants reported that Europeana 2020 had value for them personally or professionally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">77% gained skills or knowledge that they can apply in practice (an increase of 27% from 2019).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">63% of participants who want to make a change in their organisation after the conference (also a significant increase from the year before). However, only around half of participants feel empowered to take action, suggesting further capacity-building needs to translate inspiration into tangible action that can support digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Of the three conference themes, the theme of agency for change was also the theme that participants were least likely to have become more familiar with. A longer-term impact assessment perspective would be particularly beneficial in this regard as well, to track if inspiration does result in tangible change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">One questionnaire respondent wrote: ‘The most important take-away for me, personally, was the feeling of being part of a community, with similar goals and values, but also facing the same challenges.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Creating a sense of community but fewer new contacts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Despite having an online format, Europeana 2020 helped to create a sense of community and importantly, the majority (86%) of participants enjoyed themselves (this was the first time we had asked this question).&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">69% of non-Network members who attended Europeana 2020 agreed that the conference had motivated them to become members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">74% of participants felt like part of a community around digital cultural heritage (a 5% increase). However, in comparison to 2019, there was a decrease in the number of new contacts made and much lower ratings for network development outcomes.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital or remote participation nevertheless comes at a price</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dissatisfaction with the online format was particularly evident when people spoke about the lack of opportunities to build a network. Others found it to be less enjoyable. Several participants expressed dissatisfaction not with the quality of the online format (which was rated highly) but the necessity to use an online format. In this sense, they say that conferences should be in-person again after the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">There were strong concerns about one of the keynotes and the lack of in-person opportunities to manage and respond to attendees’ concerns about this can be seen as another challenge of the digital format.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A digital conference results in a smaller carbon footprint</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Holding Europeana 2020 digitally resulted in a significantly smaller carbon footprint. We estimate that the environmental impact of participants travelling by air to Europeana 2020 would have been 123 metric tonnes of carbon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Attending Europeana 2020 digitally was anywhere between 15 and 149 times less detrimental to the environment than the air travel alone that would have been required to attend the in-person event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">In terms of supporting the capacity-building of the sector through the acquisition of knowledge that can be used in practice, providing the inspiration to create a positive professional change or innovation, and strengthening a sense of a community, the first all-digital Europeana 2020 was a success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">While network development opportunities and outcomes were significantly lower, there were increases in other key outcomes including, for example, gaining knowledge or skills that can be applied in practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The conference reached a much wider audience in terms of numbers and geography but potentially also in terms of the audience’s familiarity with and literacy in digital heritage and digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana 2020 created significant savings for the annual conference’s estimated carbon footprint. Combined with the demonstrable increase in outcomes for participants, future event formats should weigh up the inevitable environmental impact caused by travel and whether the depth and quality of the experience and outcomes desired for the participant can be delivered in a digital or hybrid format.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report will be shared with colleagues within the Europeana Foundation who worked on Europeana 2020, Europeana Foundation’s senior management team, the Programme Committee shaped to deliver Europeana 2020 and the Europeana Network Association’s Members’ Council. Feedback will be solicited to support the interpretation of the data presented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Europeana 2019 in Lisbon was the first rebranded, reconfigured annual public conference of Europeana Foundation, giving a new dynamic to what had previously been known as the Annual General Meeting (AGM). It is notable for its repositioning of Europeana as a (leading) convener of the wider digital cultural heritage sector as opposed to a convener of its already established network. Though the two overlap, the idea was to reach a broader audience through this approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This impact assessment of the event has focussed on two stakeholders - the participants at Europeana 2019 and the local city. A mixed methods approach was taken, combining a post-event questionnaire with short interviews during the conference, in order to get multiple perspectives on the areas of investigation. An environmental impact assessment was also conducted to try to evaluate firstly, the negative carbon footprint of the event, and secondly, the actions Europeana took in advance (including limiting the use of single-use plastics, having a predominantly vegetarian menu and investing in carbon off-setting) to mitigate the environmental impact of the event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">85 responses were received to the post-event questionnaire, a good response rate of 36%. The questionnaire sample seems broadly representative when compared to the registration data (for example, in terms of Europeana Network Association membership rates and geographic location). Short interviews also gathered views from 12 attendees who had a variety of experience within the Europeana Initiative, ranging from non-ENA members to Members’ Council representatives. It is felt that a balanced sample of those familiar and not familiar with the Europeana ecosystem were reached. The data were analysed after the event and the findings are presented in this report.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Foundation uses the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> methodology to better understand the impact of Europeana’s services on core stakeholders, who we understand as the beneficiaries of our activities; and predominantly, cultural heritage institutions (CHIs). Following this, for Europeana 2019, Europeana Foundation colleagues collaboratively designed a Change Pathway that set out the areas in which outcomes were anticipated for event attendees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2019 welcomed 238 attendees from 38 countries. 33% of attendees had not been to any other Europeana events and therefore constituted real new-comers to Europeana. 86.4% of the attendees were ENA members. Most attendees are from a heritage background and classify themselves as a member of a Europeana community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our findings demonstrate where Europeana 2019 had an effect on participants and/or on wider society, the environment and the economy. The findings are mostly positive, balanced with a view of the negative environmental impact caused by the physical convening of professionals from across Europe and the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Growing attendees’ networks&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Network growth emerged as the area of strongest impact for Europeana 2019 attendees. 89% of attendees of past annual conferences said that this was the strongest outcome for them previously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Participants made a median average of seven new contacts, and anticipate that they may work in future with around three of these people. A network analysis shows us that some participants also made new connections with professionals from their own country.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Physical events offer the opportunity to meet peers and project partners face-to-face (where this otherwise may not happen), reported by over 50% of those who attended previous AGMs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Gaining and sharing knowledge and skills&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">51% of respondents reported gaining skills or knowledge that they can apply in practice. Participants also gained less tangible benefits from the conference, such as new perspectives, empowerment and inspiration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Looking back at the outcomes experienced by attendees of past AGMs/annual conferences, 74% of respondents suggested that they shared information they had gained with others after past AGMs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Inspiring attendees to take action or to change something in their professional practice or organisation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Between a fifth and quarter of Europeana attendees are likely to change their activity or take action in some of the ways we expected. For example, 25% of respondents want to change how their organisation uses digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Respondents are most likely to take action in relation to education and digital cultural heritage (e.g. use heritage in an educational setting), followed by collaborating with others at the conference, stimulating new projects or to be more involved in projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana’s approach to mitigating the negative environmental impact of the conference inspired three participants to take some degree of future action relating to climate change. This was an unexpected outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Contributing to the feeling of a community around digital cultural heritage&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana 2019 enabled 74% of respondents to feel more connected to the work of one or more of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">Europeana communities</a>, and 69% of respondents feel like part of a community around digital cultural heritage. ENA community members are 14% more likely to report feeling like part of a community around digital cultural heritage than the general questionnaire sample.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From the small number of respondents who are not yet ENA members, the majority felt encouraged to join the Network as a result of Europeana 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Environmental impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Europeana 2019 is estimated to have had a negative environmental impact through air travel emissions equal to 100.7 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions. This is equal, for example, to the same energy required to charge over 12,750,000 smartphones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Attendees at Europeana 2019 reacted positively to actions to offset the negative impact of Europeana 2019 - 34% of respondents said that it was extremely important to work on this issue, and on average, it was rated 7/10 in terms of importance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The data show that Europeana inspired a small number of attendees to take action regarding climate change. With this in mind, Europeana should consider how to share its lessons learned with others in the cultural sector, noting this is still a very new area of concern for many.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Economic impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The positive economic impact for Lisbon was calculated by assessing additional ‘tourism’ nights accommodation and additional daily spend, as well as the hotel and daily spend directly associated with the conference. The data show that 39% of guests stayed for additional tourism days. During these days, they also spent more money than usual during the conference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">With a confidence level of 95%, we calculate that between €82,000 and €98,000 was invested into the Lisbon economy as a result of Europeana 2019 conference catering, hotel spend and additional tourism hotel and daily spend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The impact assessment of Europeana 2019 considered for the first time the economic and environmental outcomes of the annual conference. From this impact assessment we learn a lot about what happens when you convene the professional heritage community around a discussion of communities in digital cultural heritage. However, a key limitation to this impact assessment is that, at the time of reporting, we were unable to monitor long-term change for Europeana 2019 attendees. Tracking a cohort of attendees at events may be an approach that can be adopted in future to track long-term change, where capacity allows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As well as feeling more connected to Europeana’s work with its specialist communities and as part of a community around digital cultural heritage, the benefit of convening a community can be seen to ripple beyond the immediate participants to the wider cultural heritage community. Attendees of past AGMs told us that they shared knowledge with others, and we anticipate that this will be the case for Europeana 2019. We won’t know if this will also be the case with this cohort but Europeana 2019 created the conditions for this to happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This impact assessment acts as a baseline in terms of both learning, networking and environmental outcomes. We see a negative side in terms of the environmental impact. With COVID-19 later putting a stop to all in-person events, digital events had to be explored as mechanisms to bring together the community. It will be important to track to what extent these outcomes can be delivered in all-digital or other hybrid formats in order to balance the environmental cost with the impact for heritage professionals and wider society that Europeana is tasked to deliver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validation and next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report was shared with the Members Council of the Europeana Network Association for validation. It has been published alongside <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-europeana-2020\">the report of the Europeana 2020 conference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can download and read the full report through the link below.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Meeting together as a Forum</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF) advocates for and coordinates the activities required to make data from cultural heritage organisations throughout Europe available through Europeana. In May, the aggregators who make up the Forum joined our regular biannual meeting. It was fantastic to see 83 participants from 21 countries come together for two days to discuss the Forum's governance and explore new opportunities relevant to sharing the wealth of Europe’s cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the meeting, we announced the election of our new Steering Group members: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nicole-emmenegger\">Nicole Emmenegger</a> (Beeld &amp; Geluid, representing EUscreen as an audiovisual aggregator and Digitale Collectie, the Dutch national aggregator) and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marie-veronique-leroi\">Marié-Veronique Leroi</a> (French Ministry of Culture, representing Moteur Collections), who was elected as Chair. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kerstin-herlt\">Kerstin Herlt</a> (DFF - German Film Institute &amp; Film Museum, representing the European Film Gateway) was elected Vice-Chair. On behalf of the EAF, the outgoing members and Chair, Marco Rendina and Sara Di Giorgio, welcome the new Steering Group members, and the new Steering Group give a huge thanks to Marco and Sara for all their work on behalf of the Forum!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the meeting we also approved the accreditation of two new aggregators for Cyprus and Estonia, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/cyprus-ministry-of-education-and-culture\">Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/estonian-e-repository-and-conservation-of-collections\">Estonian e-Repository and Conservation of Collections</a>. The new aggregators will offer new opportunities for cultural heritage institutions in these countries to share data through trusted partners, and hopefully bring more collections to Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Together with the Europeana Foundation, the Forum then spent time exploring the opportunities presented by the European Commission's Recovery and Resilience Fund and the activities being undertaken that support the development of Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) across the Europeana Initiative. The second day of the Forum is always dedicated to building capacity and knowledge among aggregators on a specific topic, and this spring the focus was on artificial intelligence. Aggregators explored a number of tools and practices which could support the improvement of metadata quality and multilingual access in cultural heritage collections, and heard from leaders in this topic from within the Forum. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/ai-theme\">Find out more about AI and the cultural heritage sector on Europeana Pro news</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sharing our work through the Europeana Aggregators’ Fair</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Forum’s meeting in May was organised only for Europeana’s accredited aggregators, in June we were delighted to bring our knowledge to wider audiences through the first ever Europeana Aggregators’ Fair! Organised with the Europeana Foundation, this event was an opportunity to throw open our virtual doors and share our work, expertise and activities through a diverse programme of panels, presentations and lightning talks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were delighted to see participants from around the world join the Fair, which kicked off with a positive and inspiring panel discussion around audience engagement with cultural heritage collections. There was a consensus that while the pandemic had forced institutions to focus on enhancing the digital visibility and accessibility of spaces, there is still more that can be done to support access to, and engagement with, online collections. A quick poll revealed that the majority of participants believed that community engagement activities like crowdsourcing campaigns, collection days and pop up exhibitions would be a key way to do this in the future. The importance of investment and action to enable access to collections was a theme which continued into the parallel sessions of the day, which covered topics from archaeology to audiovisual archives!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second day of the Fair explored a similarly wide range of topics, beginning with a panel on capacity building for aggregators. We discussed the distinctions between capacity building for organisations and capability building for individuals, focusing on the importance of training and personal development alongside sharing common goals across our network. A further key theme which emerged in this panel discussion - and continued to feature in later parallel sessions - was collaboration. As noted by speaker <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/maria-drabczyk\">Maja Drabczyk,</a> Project manager at the National Film Archive – Audiovisual Institute in Poland, this theme also seemed to be reflected by the event itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She said, ‘To me, every opportunity that creates space for us - the community - to share our experiences, exchange knowledge and to network is of great value. And this is exactly what the Fair has offered to us all over the past two days. We have witnessed how much we can learn from one another and that this impressive mix of skills and competences can lead to amazing new collaborations. And we should use these, we need to remain connected, create synergies between our work. Also to show the general value and impact of our actions as aggregators.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to everyone who participated in the Fair!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recordings of the panel discussions and sessions from the Europeana Aggregators Fair are available to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-aggregators-fair\">watch on Europeana Pro!</a> And if you would like to find out more about sharing data with Europeana through the Aggregators’ Forum, visit our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/process\">Share your data page</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Something borrowed, something new…</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the copyright mechanisms available to ensure people can use copyright protected content for purposes like freedom of expression, access to information and&nbsp;right to education are ‘exceptions and limitations to copyright’. In order for these exceptions to be functional in the context of online use, they need to be uniform throughout the EU, which at present, they are mostly not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2019, the EU legislator attempted to harmonise and modernise the European copyright framework through the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</a> (CDSM Directive). One of its goals was to ensure the proper functioning of digital and cross-border teaching and learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Article 5 of the 2019 Directive provides for a mandatory exception for the purpose of ‘illustration for teaching’ in the digital environment. Illustration implies the use of parts or extracts of works (but also entire works when they are smaller or cannot be divided) within educational materials, or other uses in the context of teaching and learning. However, the new provision may not be the best solution for the challenges faced by educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It should be noted that an exception for ‘illustration for teaching’ already exists on EU level in Article 5.3(a) of the InfoSoc Directive of 2001. The InfoSoc exception allows for the creation of copies and communication of protected works by anyone to the extent justified by the (non-commercial) purpose. This pre-existing exception is relevant to cultural heritage institutions because it has no restrictions in terms of who can benefit from it. So in countries where the exception is fully implemented, cultural heritage institutions can make use of the educational exception within their activities, including for courses and educational events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fragmented legal landscape</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The problem with the InfoSoc educational exception from 2001 is that it is optional. This means that Member States are allowed to restrict it on a national level, or even not implement it at all. And while <a href=\"https://copyrightexceptions.eu/#Art.%205.3(a)\">all Member States have pre-existing provisions</a> which in some way encompass educational uses based on the exception, most have not transposed it in full.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many jurisdictions <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/15casesin15countries_FinalReport.pdf\">limit its application in various aspects</a>, such as subject matter, but also types of usage, payment of compensation and beneficiaries. While most Member States allow all users, including cultural heritage institutions, to use the educational exception, some of them restrict the coverage to educational establishments only. For example, in Poland the express exclusion of cultural heritage institutions from the scope of educational establishments is confirmed by national courts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enter the new CDSM exception, which was designed to work as a mandatory minimum of user rights protection where educational uses were concerned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The new Article 5 – how mandatory?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, Article 5 of the CDSM Directive has a rather narrow scope. It covers use from educational establishments only, leaving out cultural heritage institutions and those engaged in non-formal education, and is limited to digital uses, creating fragmentation across Member States and between types of activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, the nature of the new exception is not indisputably imperative. The Directive allows for Member States to limit application partially or even fully, either upon the availability of ‘suitable’ licences or at their full discretion. Member States may provide for the exclusion of certain types of works, such as materials primarily intended for education, and can determine that only a part of a work can be used. They can provide for a ‘carve-out’ concerning specific uses as well as for fair compensation to rights holders. Even the whole exception may be removed if ‘suitable’ licences are available. One has to wonder why the exception is even labeled as mandatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital use – yay or nay?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, the language and rhetoric of the CDSM Directive exception seem to have led to misconceptions about the pre-existing InfoSoc ‘illustration for teaching’ exception which affect the implementation of the new directive into national law. National legislators seem to approach the pre-existing exception with the vague sense that it is inapplicable to digital uses. This misconception is largely spurred on by Article 5 of the CDSM Directive’s title – ‘Use of works and other subject matter in digital and cross-border teaching activities’ - and by non-binding text in the CDSM Directive suggesting that some digital uses for education might not be covered by the pre-existing EU exception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the inherited InfoSoc ‘illustration for teaching’ exception is not limited to analogue use. Under the InfoSoc Directive, the provisions of Article 5(3) are technologically neutral. Therefore, the previous educational exception already should cover digital, as well as cross border uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This has resulted in Member States introducing the new CDSM exception in parallel with the existing InfoSoc one. In most cases they already have a rather broad, technology neutral pre-existing ‘illustration for teaching’ exception that will be left intact, creating uncertainty about how the two overlapping exceptions will interact and apply.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>O harmonisation, where art thou?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ultimately, the CDSM Directive’s approach does not differ significantly from the InfoSoc one. Even though it is declared to be mandatory, the new exception gives Member States enough options to have flexibility when it comes to implementation. If harmonisation of a clear legal safeguard to use in-copyright material for education is to be achieved, it will probably be either in the form of narrowing down the scope of the existing InfoSoc transpositions on national level, or in creating two parallel overlapping exceptions with no clarity on how to apply them whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What does that mean for cultural heritage institutions? The risk for national courts to conclude that since the new educational exception covers digital uses, the inherited InfoSoc one must be restricted to analogue use, seems rather high. Unfortunately, the lack of consistency of the reform does not bode well for the goal pursued by the EU legislator —simplifying digital and cross-border educational uses, and ultimately, for legal certainty.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Over the last couple of months, the expression ‘easier said than done’ has taken on new meaning in my life. From now on, it’ll be impossible not to associate it with creating podcasts and vlogs (video blogs), an effort in which I’ve been involved in the scope of the Europeana Generic Services project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX - Century of Change</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Passionate for pods</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There’s a big benefit to storytelling through podcasts: episodes easily span half an hour, allowing us to share audiovisual (AV) heritage and dig deeper into topics than other editorials usually allow for. And vlogs are a natural fit for the AV collections at the core of Europeana XX, so we decided to experiment with this format as part of the project as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, none of the project team had any substantial experience with creating vlogs or podcasts as our work kicked off in spring 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Helicopter crew</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In December 2020, we took specialised producers on board. Why? It proved challenging to even start planning work without fully grasping the different elements and stages involved in the creative process. And time was lacking to implement a trial-and-error methodology, or to go and acquire the necessary skills ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://casparstalenhoef.nl/\">Caspar Stalenhoef</a>, a producer with years of experience in creating podcasts on cultural heritage, came recommended by partner <a href=\"https://jhn.ngo/\">Jewish Heritage Network </a>and possessed all the skills to take us from storyboard and recording studio to distribution platform. Filmmaker Eleni Stergiopoulou stepped on board&nbsp;'team vlog'&nbsp;to take on a helicopter view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rights and ruminations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the decision to devote the first podcast series to iconic Nobel prize winners and three vlogs to the topic of emerging consumerism, work on the scenarios and content commenced in early 2021: a co-creative process that unfolded smoothly until copyright issues came into sight. AV collections are often (heavily) copyrighted. The use of such materials in traditional editorial formats, published in the secure Europeana environment, doesn’t pose insurmountable problems. Yet with podcast and vlog episodes hosted externally - on <a href=\"https://www.buzzsprout.com\">Buzzsprout</a> and YouTube respectively - several hurdles occurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ‘non-commercial’ use prohibited by copyright labels attached to many a video and audio fragment urged the creative team to review the content selection repeatedly. In some cases, extensive negotiations with rights holders ensued and multiple-option-scenarios were drawn up to allow the team to deal with all possible outcomes. As for the vlogs, even videos out of copyright and labelled as CC0/Public Domain often weren’t downloadable. Jens Kösters of <a href=\"https://www.tib.eu/en/\">TIB</a>, who took on the video editing, stumbled upon several such cases. Result: the writing team had to reignite its hunt for content and rewrite the scripts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The issue of copyright arose again in a series (<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/true-colours\">True Colours #1, 2 and 3</a>) unfolding the story of the iconic fashion brand Missoni, whose artistic director Luca Missoni stepped forward as an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/in-conversation-with-commissioner-mariya-gabriel-europeana-xx-ambassador-of-change\">Ambassador of Change</a> for the Europeana XX project. Missoni was followed and interviewed in the company office, archive and production unit, resulting in many hours of brand-new footage. Yet Anna Carniel, who coordinated the production for <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/\">European Fashion Heritage Association</a> (EFHA), found that additional archival content was needed. ‘For that we had to diligently clear the rights, as a deep respect for the history of the Missoni brand and the family was always our vantage point’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Layer cake</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The storytelling formats we chose - in all cases multi-layered with the aim of attracting various target audiences - posed challenges as well. ‘I think it would have been easier if I had interviewed one person instead of three,’ says Sasha Goldstein Sabbah, digital curator at <a href=\"https://jck.nl/en/page/admission\">Jewish Cultural Quarter</a>, who worked on one of the podcast episodes. ‘I also found the creation of the narrative part challenging: writing the script is fine but to record and edit oneself is difficult.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The editing process, indeed, is challenging: stitching video fragments together into a dynamic compilation with well-paced subtitles and intro/outro slides, or moulding a podcast episode out of narration, interviews and AV-content is time-consuming and requires a plethora of editorial decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The phased process of researching, sourcing and clearing content, script writing, interviewing, recording, editing, branding, contextualising, publishing and promoting the editorials proved to be even more daunting in this particular project’s context, as every step required the involvement of different teams at different partner institutions. ‘Working with a big team, even multiple separate teams, all based at home, is very different from my usual routine, where I perform all the tasks involved myself,’ confirms podcast producer Caspar Stalenhoef.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>(Pod)casting on</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That’s why, in podcast series 2, we’ll take a more focused approach involving scripting and recording by Caspar and myself. This time, we will be interviewing authors of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/highlights-from-the-20th-century\">Europeana XX blog posts</a>, investigating the complementarity of the written and the spoken word. We’re eager to add an extra dimension, more depth and a personal flavour to the sort of stories Europeana visitors know so well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the struggles and hurdles, XX-curators and editors are enthused about the experience. ‘I really enjoyed the mixture of media,’ Sasha Goldstein-Sabbah agrees, ‘as well as sourcing documents and images in Europeana, and then interviewing experts about the story they convey’. Seeing the concept come to life through the collections we hold so dear, is a fascinating and rewarding experience indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All our podcast and vlog episodes are available to be reused and the Century of Change podcast and Story Flix vlog series will be expanded with new episodes. So please explore them all on our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/highlights-from-the-20th-century\">20th Century feature page</a>, or - why not? - try creating dynamic editorials yourself. Easier said than done, admittedly, but where there’s a will, there’s a way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Can you tell us about your role as Chair of the Europeana Network Association (ENA)?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a> is a democratic community of experts working in the field of digital cultural heritage, united by a shared mission to expand and improve access to Europe's cultural heritage. I took on the role of Chair six months ago, and was lucky to be able to join an impressive team of Board Members together with a talented group of Councillors who commit their time and energy to lead the Network on our creative and inspirational journey together.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Management Board quickly set ourselves a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/support-collaboration-and-growth-the-europeana-network-association-in-2021\">series of strategic priorities</a> which include; supporting Europeana’s capacity building and digital transformation, a drive towards inclusivity and diversity, dedication to transparency, and an emphasis on accountability and democracy; and, last but not least, a goal to realise a clearer insight into our 3,000 strong membership and seek new ways to harness the potential of ENA members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is the New European Bauhaus relevant to the work you and ENA are doing? What role do you think that cultural heritage networks can play in the initiative?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Drawing on the Bauhaus tradition and from my own experience, I feel that there is much to be learned through the knowledge we have gained from working with and the teaching of hand-worked crafts. This experience could be easily transposed onto digital crafts, especially as we recognise the urgent need to upskill ‘young’ people (of all ages) to be able to function in a digital world. This is not merely the need to function pragmatically, but the need for digital creativity – the empowerment gained through the principles of design and aesthetics. The Europeana Network Association is ideally located to lead such a drive. Nestled in Europe’s cultural institutions and embedded in the day-to-day digital transformation of the institutional activities, Europeana can foster digital transformation on the ground and inspire new generations of citizens to be not only digitally productive but digitally creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To someone living and working in Israel, Bauhaus is a household name. Known as the White City, Tel Aviv&nbsp;is home to one of the best-preserved collections of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bauhaus-center.com/\">Bauhaus</a>&nbsp;and International Style architecture in the world. It is recognised as&nbsp;a <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/tag/unesco/\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>, and protected as an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century. When I think of the Bauhaus my personal association is all about art and especially crafts. I was familiar with the numerous artists in the Israel Museum collection where I worked for many years whose artworks figured prominently in our education activities and programmes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">I would like to share a personal story – my own moment of digital transformation – which came back to me recently in sharp focus during one of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-european-bauhaus-europeana-cafe\">Europeana New European Bauhaus Cafés</a>.&nbsp;Many years ago, I was a weaver by trade and exhibited as an internationally recognised textile artist. I created all kinds of colourful items of clothing, to sell in craft shops, to pay for more wool and more time to weave. It was never a profitable artistic career or cost-effective industry, so, as most artists and artisans do, I turned to teaching. This was how I first came to work in the Israel Museum – as head of the weaving studio. Inspired by the Bauhaus spirit, we believed in the purity of crafts; to be able to engage with the world through form, texture, and colour. We felt that it was the Museum’s responsibility to make sure that our students could take home a skill that would set them up for a creative and productive life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, some time in the late 1980s we realised that these traditional kinds of skills were no longer attractive to our students, and, in a pioneering move, Nurit Shiloh Cohen, Chief Curator of Education, decided that what we needed was a New Media studio! I was sent out to retrain and we purchased our very first set of Macs. From the early 1990s our little&nbsp;studio in the heart of the Museum trained students in the basics of digital production.&nbsp;Only several years later were we able to go online with our little shrieking modem and began to teach web design.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In a not-too-distant future shaped via the New European Bauhaus, what do you hope visiting a cultural heritage institution will be like?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am waiting for the time that we remove the term ’digital’ from our lexicon and come to terms with the realisation that this is simply the way we do things; in libraries, museums, and archives across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can the sector support this vision?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It isn’t a vision; it is a reality and the less we concern ourselves with worrying about it the better we can integrate this way of doing things to become productive and creative individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New European Bauhaus encourages interdisciplinarity - Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has described it as ‘a bridge between the world of art and culture on one side and the world of science and technology on the other’. How can the cultural heritage sector work with other sectors to make a contribution to the initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my role as a Senior Curator of New Media at the Israel Museum I realised over the years that each of these worlds spoke their own language and it was up to my team and I to find a shared vocabulary to enable fruitful conversation. In the museum we really had to bridge the different mindsets. Curators were speaking in jargon when they described their collections and the tech team had their own language and terms. It meant we had to constantly shift between the two worlds. That’s the lesson that could inform the digital cultural heritage sector as we work cross-sector on the New European Bauhaus - acting as a bridge to listen, and learn from one another in order to travel together in an informed and creative shared journey.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The impact assessment of Europeana 2019 was our first in-depth look at one of our annual conferences, offering us a snapshot into life pre-COVID-19 and setting in place a baseline for assessing our first all-digital conference, Europeana 2020. How did the two events compare?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building communities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘Connect communities’ was the theme of Europeana 2019, and unsurprisingly, professional network growth was the strongest outcome for attendees and for 89% of those surveyed who had been to past conferences. We also measured network development, finding that participants at Europeana 2019 made a median average of seven new contacts, and anticipated that they may work in future with around three of these people. In comparison, this declined to three and one respectively for Europeana 2020 attendees. Network development was not a core objective of Europeana 2020, so this in itself isn’t surprising.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What Europeana 2020 helped to create - despite the online format and despite participants creating fewer new contacts - was a sense of community. 74% of participants felt like part of a community around digital cultural heritage - a 5% increase from 2019. Having had a tough year, we were thrilled to see that 86% of participants reported enjoying themselves as a top outcome of their participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Increasing accessibility and growing the Network</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital format of Europeana 2020 meant that almost 1,000 people attended from 60 countries across the world, in comparison to 238 participants from 38 countries in 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some participants who attended Europeana 2020 might not have been able to attend had the conference not been digital, with travel, cost and limitations on attendance being potential barriers. The digital format was also more flexible because participants could pick and choose the parts of the event which were most relevant for them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana 2019, we estimated that fewer than 15% of attendees were non-Network members. The increased accessibility of Europeana 2020 meant that this increased to 48% just one year later. Importantly, 69% of non-Network members agreed that the conference had motivated them to become members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>For the first time, and thanks to the recommendations of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/supporting-new-professionals-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">New Professionals Task Force</a>, we asked participants about how long they had been working in the sector. The data suggests that there is a roughly even split across participants in terms of their sector experience. We feel that, compared to past in-person conferences, the digital event is likely to have attracted an audience with less sector experience. We will track this at future in-person and digital events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Building capacity and creating change</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In impact assessment, we want to know about how participants might go on to create change as a result of an activity. In our 2019 impact assessment, we learned that 74% of attendees of past annual conferences shared information they had gained with others. We know that Europeana 2020 had value in some way for the vast majority of participants. But what did this look like and how did it change from 2019?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was an increase in participants gaining skills or knowledge that they can use in practice. 88% of Europeana 2020 participants reported that the conference had value for them personally or professionally. They gained benefits such as new perspectives, empowerment and inspiration. There was also a significant increase in participants wanting to change how their organisation uses digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We don’t have a long-term perspective on what this change might look like. We also saw that where 63% of participants wanted to make changes to how their organisation uses digital cultural heritage, only around half of participants feel empowered to take action. This suggests that there is still work to do to match changing mindsets with the tools and agency needed to create change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Better understanding environmental impact</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding Europeana 2020 digitally resulted in a significantly smaller carbon footprint. Europeana 2019 was held in Lisbon and over 90% of attendees were estimated to have travelled by air. If we had been able to hold Europeana 2020 in the Netherlands as planned, we estimate that the environmental impact of participants travelling by air to Europeana 2020 would have been 123 metric tonnes of carbon. Putting this in perspective, attending Europeana 2020 digitally was anywhere between 15 and 149 times less detrimental to the environment than the air travel alone that would have been required to attend the in-person event.</p>\r\n"

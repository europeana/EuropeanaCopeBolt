        body: "<p>Combining digital and applied learning is a major inspiration for one of Europeana’s 2016 Challenge winners, Italian startup <strong><a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories</a></strong>. Their first step in this direction was a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/art-stories-faces-used-in-holiday-villages\" target=\"_blank\">partnership</a> with tour operator <a href=\"https://www.alpitour.it/gruppo-alpitour/chi-siamo\">Alpitour</a> - a project that will result in approximately 4,000 children playing with the Art Stories learning apps throughout summer 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the startup has been testing a combination of digital and real life methodologies in several primary schools in Milan. This led to the development of <strong><em><a href=\"http://www.bartolomeo.education\" target=\"_blank\">Bartolomeo</a></em></strong>: a web-app where teachers receive suggestions on how to use digital resources to enhance learning experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An online environment where primary school teachers will find digital games, lesson plans and hands-on activities for their pupils, Bartolomeo’s aim is to help teachers to use art history and digital cultural heritage in everyday lessons. You will also be able to easily use the app for many other curriculum subjects, such as history, geography, science, and maths. This project will make use of Europeana’s <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">free to reuse content</a> to enhance learning experiences. We’re thrilled that Art Stories FACES will be used in this new project as part of a game on portraits where children learn the basics of visual art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bartolomeo has been<a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/art-stories-at-milan-games-week/\" target=\"_blank\"> tested by a group of primary school teachers</a> in May at the <a href=\"http://www.salonelibro.it/it/\" target=\"_blank\">Salone Internazionale del Libro</a> in Turin (where there is a wide area dedicated to digital). It will go live at the end August – ready for the new school term!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stay up-to-date on Art Stories developments, follow them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtStoriesItaly\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>! Find out more about Europeana’s <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/use-our-data/education/educationalpartnerships\" target=\"_blank\">educational partnerships</a> and help us inspire learners and educators everywhere with digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

This recognition highlights the exciting work of Europeana at the interface of technology and cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://t.yesware.com/tt/d13dffac412d1f3aa56cc7b88425b7a2cf56626d/d8a1d56e1848ccaa861c2d6827c9ee99/27bdae7f4a2a8c754cf80e6e73e27cb3/apiawards.co/\" target=\"_blank\">API Awards</a> will take place in September during the <a href=\"http://t.yesware.com/tt/d13dffac412d1f3aa56cc7b88425b7a2cf56626d/d8a1d56e1848ccaa861c2d6827c9ee99/e0485a0cffdf660c5c193988793f14c8/apiworld.co/\" target=\"_blank\">API World 2017</a>, the world’s largest API conference and expo with 3,000+ attendees. Among hundreds of nominations, the API World advisory board selected the Europeana API based on three criteria: reputation in the API industry, recent media coverage, and innovativeness of the API initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana REST API allows developers to build applications that use the cultural heritage objects stored in the huge Europeana repository. It is open source and the code is available on <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. The metadata information is structured in the Europeana Data Model (EDM), an open flexible data model featuring various types of resources and relations between them, allowing anyone to search and filter on anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, our API has supported <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps/historiana\" target=\"_blank\">Historiana</a>, a digital learning platform for history educators, and the new <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-content-via-the-new-creative-commons-search\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons Search tool</a> which lets people search a variety of open repositories through a single interface. Check out our <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps\" target=\"_blank\">Apps gallery</a> to explore more exciting examples of API implementations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The API World 2017 award is a great recognition of the efforts of our API team. We are proud to have built a unique API for the cultural heritage sector that spans thousands of institutions across Europe, in several languages!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Try our API by <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/registration\" target=\"_blank\">registering</a> for a free API key and share your projects on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\" target=\"_blank\">@europeanalabs</a>.

In a dedicated blog series, we will feature our content picks to inspire new designs and business projects. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can hardly imagine our daily lives without the precise location information we have at our fingertips – on the screens of our mobile phones or computers. The last century is considered to be a <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/maps/articles/the-map-of-the-world-in-the-20th-century\" target=\"_blank\">golden age of map-making</a>. It has transformed our everyday lives and knowledge of the world, and the digital revolution continues!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, before globetrotters could trust digital maps to guide them to faraway places, early explorers had to resort to much simpler representations of the world, often drawing the maps themselves throughout their travels. If you’re fascinated by maps and their history, join us as we outline how early cartographers represented the world as they knew it.

        title: 'Deal with tour operator sees Art Stories FACES used in holiday villages this summer'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Developing educational apps that introduce children to the delights of art, history and architecture has been the mission of Italian startup <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories</a> from the get-go. The team has carried out various projects to bring their mission into reality: from winning the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/europeana-labs-challenge-2016-winners-announced\" target=\"_blank\">first Europeana Challenge of 2016</a> to partnering with the tourism group <a href=\"https://www.alpitour.it/gruppo-alpitour/chi-siamo\" target=\"_blank\">Alpitour</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art Stories was selected as one of the 2016 Europeana Challenge winners for their <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/apps/faces/\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories FACES</a> project. A digital game for school-age children, Art Stories FACES is the first test for an Art Stories virtual museum. In a kind of digital playground, kids are encouraged to learn the basics of visual art. So far, the game has had about <strong>5,000 downloads</strong> and was a featured app on the Apple store in multiple countries and categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Our apps, including FACES, serve as introduction to a great variety of themes: they provide content and inspiration for addressing kids about wider themes (such as art, or traveling the world)’, according to Art Stories co-founder, Federica Pascotto.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embeddedContent oembed-provider- oembed-provider-youtube\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"349\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dNzziil73L4?wmode=transparent&amp;jqoemcache=kXV7R\" width=\"425\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>To encourage children to discover digital cultural heritage through play, the startup continues to increase their reach through partnerships. They signed an agreement with the Italian tour operator Alpitour to use their educational apps, including Art FACES, in a number of holiday villages, such as Cala Verde in Ibiza; Agua Verde in Menorca; Coralejo in Fuerteventura; Princess Lindos in Rhodes; Agua Marina in Menorca. Some <strong>4,000 children</strong> are expected to be playing with the apps throughout summer 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The villages have specialized areas for kids, where Art Stories’ digital games will be used as a bone structure for workshops and hands-on activities. ‘Alpitour embraced our philosophy, where digital screens and traditional play go together for providing larger and deeper experiences to kids’, informs Pascotto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following weeks, we’ll hear from Art Stories about their latest venture, a new web-app dedicated to teachers: <a href=\"http://www.bartolomeo.education\" target=\"_blank\">Bartolomeo</a>. Stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Would you like to teach your children about art through cultural heritage? Download the digital game! Art Stories FACES is free and available both for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/art-stories-faces/id1113488508?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artstories.faces\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a>.</strong></p>"

        title: 'What happens when #HeritageMeetsMakers: Stories from Mallorca'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>In partnership with <a href=\"http://platoniq.net/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Platoniq</a> and the <a href=\"http://artikcenter.com/fablab-palma/\" target=\"_blank\">Artik Center FabLab Palma</a>, Europeana invited a small group of makers to a co-creation workshop on 22 and 23 June at the Makerspace of the Artik Center in Palma de Mallorca. The participants explored Europeana Collections and prototyped new ideas for the creative reuse of digital cultural heritage using Platoniq’s innovative “Co-creation made agile” <a href=\"http://wotify.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">methodology</a> and the 3D printing facilities of the Artik Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The makers varied in specialisation (designers, artists, teachers) but they all shared a passion for experimentation and strong interest in applying new ways of working, such as co-design and novel technologies (3D printing and laser cutting, for instance) into their practice. Most of them weren’t familiar with Europeana and got truly inspired by the richness of our collections and their great potential as a resource for diverse makers projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first day started with introductions into partners’ resources, followed by intensive brainstorming, development of various scenarios and their evaluation according to key criteria, such as novelty and feasibility. After a peer review and voting, the best four ideas were selected for rapid prototyping on the next day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> The workshop ended with a showcase of culinary, fashion and two educational projects which all shared a strong 3D component (virtual reality or 3D print). Below the projects profiles: </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PROJECT #1 Cooking History </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Project leader: Tina Codina, Aida Alvarez</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Project objective: Create new recipes inspired by Europeana images using the existing culinary community of el-recetario.net. By selecting and publishing Europeana food &amp; drink related images, the community on <a href=\"http://el-recetario.net\" target=\"_blank\">http://el-recetario.net</a> is encouraged to (re-)discover historical recipes and experiment with new ingredients and combinations of flavors. In addition, the community members are encouraged to identify antique pots/pans/molds in the Europeana images that cannot be found anymore and recreate them using 3D printing. The latter could be also an interesting activity for families and schools. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PROJECT #2 Heritage Avatars </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Project leader: Luisa Fernanda Zárate </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project objective: Create a handcrafted mascot to tell the story behind a museum piece. The project will combine handmade crafts with cultural content and new technology. An example is a doll that has its hair complements inspired by Europeana images and 3D printed, and has an audio chip that tells the story behind those complements. Museums can offer workshops to create such mascots, or/and have the mascot as a “presenter” of a particular museum piece. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/collage-workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 560px;\"></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2> PROJECT #3 Fabuloscopio </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Project leaders: David Canat / Pau Andreu Sitjar</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Project objective: Create “A Museum Magic Box” using 3D cultural heritage images and simple Virtual Reality headsets (for instance, Google Cardboard). The box can be bought at the museum to motivate children to explore and have fun during their museum visit. Museums can also offer workshops for schools to build such magic boxes inside a special room called “Museum FabLab” which will have all the tools and materials necessary to create the virtual reality cameras. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>PROJECT #4 Plug Art </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Project leader: María Jesús Joya Cuerva </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project objective: Create designs out of Europeana images that can be used as tattoos and/or piercings. The first step is to produce design templates using Europeana content and make these available online to designer communities. Users can then (3D) print them, or modify the templates and create a more diverse set of designs. </p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Go crowdfunding </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a next step, the project leaders attended a crowdsourcing workshop offered by Goteo on 29 June in Palma de Mallorca where they learned how to design a successful crowdsourcing campaign and secure vital funding for bringing their prototypes to market. Two of the projects - Cooking History and Heritage Avatars - are getting ready to launch their crowdfunding campaign very soon.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>For the past two months, educational projects selected in <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/call/europeana4education\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s first match funding call</a> (a joint initiative with <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Goteo</a>) ran <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/projects-madewitheuropeana-go-crowdfunding\" target=\"_blank\">two crowdfunding rounds</a> to finance their original ideas. These teams mobilized their networks, organized fundraising events and turned to social media to get maximum support from the crowd. Of the three teams that raced for crowd donations, two made the cut. Your contribution helped these educational projects to reach their financial targets and created the conditions to inspire learners with digital cultural heritage across the world!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The results </strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by the <a href=\"https://surianoservizieditoriali.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Associazione culturale Se</a>, a project aiming to develop the ebook <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/project/gli-animali-nella-grande-guerra-animals-in-the-gre\" target=\"_blank\">Animals in the Great War</a> received <strong>€3,042</strong> during the crowdfunding rounds. A bilingual eBook in Italian and English, <em>Animals in the Great War</em> will be available for free download from the Se website. Free to reuse resources catalogued in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> database will be used in this initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/project/capturing-fashion-in-the-20th-century-with-frieda\" target=\"_blank\">Capturing the 20th Century Fashion with Frieda Dauphin-Verhees' Study Collection</a> is a joint initiative of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp Department of Costume Design and the <a href=\"https://www.momu.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Fashion Museum of Antwerp</a> (MoMu) that received <strong>€12,060</strong> during the two crowdfunding rounds. MoMu will preserve the fashion collection of the costume design teacher Frieda Verhees and create a documentary on 20th century fashion. This documentary will be used for teaching, research and creative projects. Additionally, the Study Collection of Frieda Verhees will be promoted as a secondary education tool at MoMu’s “Teacher Days”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations to the two teams! Europeana has matched each Euro donated by the crowd (up to a maximum of 100 EUR per individual donation). Because one of the projects was not able to reach its minimum target during the first crowdfunding round, the Europeana match funding capital reserved for them was allocated to the remaining two projects entering the second round. The successful projects will now receive financial support from Europeana and must develop and deliver their product between July and December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you for your spreading the word and supporting these campaigns! Stay tuned and follow us via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> to stay up to date on their future developments.</strong></p>\r\n"

        title: '#MakewithEuropeana: Art Nouveau mastercrafts'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is the last in a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/makewitheuropeana-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">series of blogs</a> dedicated to Art Nouveau and highlighting Europeana content to inspire commercial creative reuse by makers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excellent craftsmanship and innovation marked the mastercrafts produced during the <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> era. These two traits are of vital importance to any professional, but could be especially meaningful to makers - a community that brings together both amateur and professional arts, crafts and technological practitioners - who wish to transform digital cultural heritage into new designs, products or business during the information age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this blog post, we will highlight elements of ceramics, glassware and metalworks produced by Art Nouveau practitioners. If you would like to find out more about mastercrafts from this popular style, take a look at our <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style/mastercrafts\" target=\"_blank\">Art Nouveau exhibition</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ceramics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Art Nouveau ceramicists experimented with new forms and innovative glazing techniques. Malleable clay was the perfect medium for realising the characteristic forms of the Art Nouveau aesthetic. The item displayed below - a vase with arrowhead, water lilies and butterflies - is a fine example of Art Nouveau ceramics. Find other beautiful ceramics items in our dedicated <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-ceramics/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/90402-bk-1968-65.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 682px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/BK_1968_65.html?q=Brantjes#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Vaas met pijlkruid, waterlelies en vlinders</a>. Brantjes en Co., Firma Wed. N.S.A. 1895-1904. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Glassware</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Glassmakers returned their work to the furnace many times, adding layers of textures and decorative elements. Historical techniques were revived and new ones invented, creating radiant colours and iridescence. Take the drinking set below, for instance. This beverage kit used the painting technique to portray a typical motif of the time: <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/makewitheuropeana-art-nouveau-patterns\" target=\"_blank\">flowers</a>. See more highlights of Art Nouveau glassware in our dedicated <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-glassware/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/image-8-.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 732px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026107/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_www_esbirky_cz_63022_63028.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Nápojová souprava</a>. 1900. Uměleckoprůmyslové Museum V Praze. CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Emile Gallé</strong> (1846-1904), a French glassmaker, ceramicist, and furniture designer, became one of the most influential figures within Art Nouveau and the French decorative arts. Take a look at the vase below. Like this vase, you can see that this fantastic piece depicts a lathraea, a type of flowering plant. We’ve collected more glassware by Gallé in a dedicated <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/%C3%A9mile-gall%C3%A9/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/m57d2eaaf25c9a.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 750px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048429/item_AD6KDXLDWNI5ZYNOTKJKQN6XPCLYEL7R.html?q=Emile+Galle\" target=\"_blank\">Stangenvase mit Schuppenwurz und einem Vers von Victor Hugo</a>. Émile Gallé. 1899. Museum Für Kunst Und Gewerbe Hamburg. CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Metalworks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of metal decoration in plant forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items (see the chocolate pot with a molinet, a stirrer used to make the cocoa frothy, below).The firm of <a href=\"http://www.macklowegallery.com/education.asp/art+nouveau/Artist+Biographies/antiques/Decorative+Artists/education/Cardeilhac/id/146\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Cardeilhac</a> produced the pot and it was known for developing a more accessible form of Art Nouveau silver. The company’s designs are characterized by a combination of nature motifs in a repetitive pattern, in this case stylized thistles.

        title: '#MakewithEuropeana: Art Nouveau architecture and interiors'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is the third in a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/makewitheuropeana-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">series of blogs</a> dedicated to Art Nouveau and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire commercial creative reuse by makers. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the influences and concepts that guided creatives during the <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> movement, one ideal prevailed: the principle of a <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> or a ‘total work of art’. Functionality allied to beauty. The union of fine and applied arts to create a powerful and fascinating environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Art Nouveau era, private and public spaces were enhanced by luxury. Decorative richness was the rule. A result of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style/origins-of-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">rapid industrialisation</a> during the 19th century, new materials and technologies allowed for a sense of modernity and also for the development of an aesthetic unique to that time. This approach to interior design and architecture - one that strived to generate a captivating experience for everyone experiencing it - represents a distinct take on creativity and serves as inspiration for <strong>makers</strong> who want to use cultural heritage to engage their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opulent facades were a key architectural element of embellished Art Nouveau buildings. The city of Aveiro, in Portugal, has some of the finest examples of striking façades. For instance, the building of the former Cooperativa Agrícola displayed below, combines hand-painted tiles and masonry sets representing lilies.

Horta used curved ironwork, inspired by natural forms, in the interiors and exteriors of his buildings.

        body: "<p><em>On Europeana Labs, we are constantly seeking to inspire and encourage you to reuse Europe’s shared cultural heritage in new products, businesses and designs. Until the end of 2017, we will organise <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/blog/makewitheuropeana-art-nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">three campaigns</a> in which we’ll hand-pick cultural objects from our vast online repository and feature them in a dedicated blog series and on Twitter. The first campaign addresses the popular style of Art Nouveau and will run until end of May. The selected items are all suitable for commercial creative reuse and, we believe, can motivate makers everywhere to develop unique concepts. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daisies, carnations, tulips or poppies represented in a rhythmically repeating pattern. Greatly <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/art-nouveau-a-universal-style/inspired-by-nature\" target=\"_blank\">influenced by nature</a>, <strong>Art Nouveau</strong> designers created compelling effects by using stylized floral and organic forms in decorative pieces. The sumptuous motifs developed by Art Nouveau’s practitioners have the potential to inspire today’s makers on the look out for new artistic perspectives to evoke through their creations. In this blog, we will direct our spotlight to the beautiful patterns that were applied to pattern books, wallpapers, textiles and tiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Pattern books</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Analytically precise botanical drawings may sound like unusual inspiration. Nevertheless, Art Nouveau designers found beauty in them and transposed these motifs into design sourcebooks. Swiss-born artist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Grasset\" target=\"_blank\">Eugène Grasset</a> (1845-1917) and one of his pupils, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Pillard_Verneuil\" target=\"_blank\">Maurice Pillard Verneuil</a> (1869-1942), developed some of the finest sourcebooks of that time. Below, you will find an example of an ornamental print taken from a pattern book. Discover a collection of drawings illustrating plants and their ornamental application in our dedicated <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-plants-and-ornaments/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/pattern-2.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 562px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__3709.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Umbellated Rush, La Plante et ses applications ornementales, Paris : Librairie Centrale des Beaux-Arts</a>. Maurice Pillard Verneuil. 1896. Schola Graphidis Art Collection, Hungarian University Of Fine Arts - High School Of Visual Arts, Budapest. CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestly, these volumes were studied beyond Europe’s fine art and architecture colleges: they were also used in industrial drawing schools across the continent’s major cities, including Vienna and Budapest. On Europeana Labs, we have featured, for instance, a <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data/art-nouveau-ornamental-motifs-in-hungarian-style\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a> that includes over 100 floral prints showcasing Hungary’s ornamental art from the Art Nouveau movement. An example of one of these designs is displayed below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/motif.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 434px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064110/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Schola_Graphidis_Art_Collection__Hungarian_University_of_Fine_Arts___High_School_of_Visual_Arts__Budapest__8307.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A%282064110_HungarianUniversity_FineArts%29\" target=\"_blank\">Design for Ornamental Motifs in Hungarian Style</a> by István Gróh and His Pupils, 1907.

CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wallpaper and textile designs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many textile companies produced Art Nouveau motifs, but one of them stood out for its intriguing new patterns. The <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Studio\" target=\"_blank\">Silver Studio</a></strong> was an influential textile design studio in the United Kingdom that reflected characteristics from the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/a/arts-and-crafts/\" target=\"_blank\">Arts and Crafts Movement</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wallpaper design below, for instance, was created for the Silver Studio in about 1900. The pattern uses highly stylised pink roses with green leaves on a pale background. Light coloured wallpapers such as this were popular in living rooms and bedrooms in Britain in the early twentieth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2026101-partage-plus-providedcho-museum-of-domestic-design-architecture-middlesex-university-sd8548.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 530px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Museum_of_Domestic_Design___Architecture__Middlesex_University_SD8548.html?q=who%3A%28Silver+Studio%29\" target=\"_blank\">Textile design</a> by Silver Studio, 1897-1903. Museum of Domestic Design &amp; Architecture, Middlesex University, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of textile design created by the Silver Studio is the print below which features sprays of stylised flowers and leaves in shades of green and yellow, arranged in vertical lines. In the late nineteenth century, green and yellow were fashionable colours among British consumers. The popular colour scheme was jokingly known as 'greenery-yallery’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2026101-partage-plus-providedcho-museum-of-domestic-design-architecture-middlesex-university-sd8457.jpeg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 527px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Museum_of_Domestic_Design___Architecture__Middlesex_University_SD8457.html\" target=\"_blank\">Textile design</a> by Silver Studio, 1899. Museum of Domestic Design &amp; Architecture, Middlesex University, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other textile and wallpaper designs, check out our special <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/art-nouveau-textile-and-wallpaper-designs/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Ceramic tiles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Other sort of factories also excelled in their Art Nouveau productions and became fashionable at the time. The <strong><a href=\"https://www.visitportugal.com/en/NR/exeres/2A52DF23-F91B-4FD2-BE89-02A13A8DC1C2\" target=\"_blank\">Sacavém Factory</a></strong> in Portugal is an example. Below, you will find one of the factory’s creations which used the movement’s typical dark colours and floral themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2026120-partage-plus-providedcho-aveiro-city-museum-an-654.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 334px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026120/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Aveiro_City_Museum_AN_654.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tile Art Nouveau</a> by Sacavém Factory, Portugal, 1900/1920.

        title: 'Find inspiring Europeana content via the new Creative Commons Search'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>A tool for discovery, collaboration and re-use, <a href=\"https://search.creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CC Search</a> enables users to search a variety of open repositories through a single interface to find content in the commons. Developed by <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons</a>, the current CC Search tool is used by nearly <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/new-cc-search/\" target=\"_blank\">600,000 people every month</a>. The new beta version of the project, which was released in early February, includes simple, one-click attribution making it easier to credit the source of any image. CC Search beta also provides social features, allowing users to create, share and save lists as well as adding tags and favorites to the objects in the commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beta version of <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CC Search</a> has recently integrated 470,00 images from Europeana into its database, which already incorporates artworks provided by cultural institutions and repositories from across the globe. This variety of content includes February’s landmark release from <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/07/met-announcement/\">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> as well as large collections of freely licensed images from 500px, Flickr, Rijksmuseum, and New York Public Library. Europeana’s new addition brings the number of searchable objects on CC Search up to 10,022,832, making Europeana its second main provider, and allowing the discovery of major works by masters of European art as well as photographs, prints, drawings, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this initial phase, CC Search beta focuses on photos as its first media and uses open APIs (including the <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana API</a>) to index the available works. Search filters allow users to search by license type, title, creator, tags, collection, and type of institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below an example of Europeana content discovery through CC Search beta: a search for a common term such as “Paris”, would suggest more than <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/?page=5&amp;search=paris&amp;licenses=ALL-%24&amp;licenses=ALL-MOD&amp;providers=europeana&amp;search_fields=title&amp;search_fields=creator&amp;search_fields=tags&amp;per_page=100\">500 results</a> - including this <a href=\"https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/image/detail/2uR-nuaDO7qWZzr-6O_QFw==\">portrait</a> of Paris in the 20th century, accessed via Europeana, and open for re-use! These records can all be used for commercial purposes, and they are also open for modifications, adaption, or to be built upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/ccsearch-paris-example.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 350px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/916118/S_TEK_photo_TEKA0118646.html?utm_source=api&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_campaign=fjqyYDAFX\" target=\"_blank\">Skioptikonbild med motiv från Paris. Bilden har förvarats i kartong märkt</a>. Tekniska Museet. Public Domain Marked.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try out the CC Search beta and be amazed by the hidden gems Europeana Collections can bring you! Or help us make commons material more attractive and usable by providing your feedback in the <a href=\"https://github.com/creativecommons/open-ledger\">Github repository</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Europeana Treasures is a series of blogposts introducing the Europeana Research case studies. Their name is inspired by the fact that they shed light on important research findings and unknown sources that have been discovered by researchers in the rich library of Europeana. Alongside the research projects that have been developed by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/french-poetry-music-research-and-interactive-maps-europeana-research-2016-grant-winners-final-reports-published\">winners</a> of the Europeana Research Grants 2016, two more complementary case studies have been developed by the Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C. in the context of the DSI2 project. This blogpost is the second of its series, introducing the case study on the year 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the events of 1968. Archives across Europe and the world hold evidence and testimonies of this period in various types and formats. This material is fragmented and scattered, making visibility to research and creative communities limited. The idea behind this case study was to investigate and identify Europeana-held material relevant to this recent turbulent period of human history, so that all interested communities of practice and relevant networks are enabled to work with them meaningfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nInitial and somewhat superficial research within Europeana produced hardly any satisfactory results. However, once we started using search terms in different languages, results retrieved surprised us tremendously: Europeana not only holds an invaluable amount of digital objects related to this seismic period in history, but it also offers an insight to objects from beyond the European landscape, all the way across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nDigital objects - both content and metadata - cover all types: text, video, image and sound, while they span from across European countries (Poland, Czech Republic, France etc.), to the other side of the world (Vietnam, USA, Mexico etc.). Of particular interest are digital cultural objects pertaining to the influence of May 1968 to the arts. Europeana results span across all object types and could be potentially useful to related research disciplines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nCurrently, the Digital Curation Unit / ATHENA R.C is undertaking research on how to enhance visibility of 1968-related digital material to research and creative communities, after identifying existing communities of practice to existing 1968 content and metadata and matching them to digital methods, tools, and services. This research is largely relying on NeMO, the <a href=\"http://nemo.dcu.gr/\">NeDiMAH Methods Ontology</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-09/webmedia.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 692px; margin: 20px 40px;\"><br><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022091/data_hope_981.html\">Source</a>: Backing Britain Campaign, 1968, TUC - Trade Union Congress Library, United Kingdom, In Copyright.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme was first launched in 2016 and proved hugely popular. Digital humanities researchers applied with projects that addressed research questions by using Europeana data. The high volume of proposals proved just how important it is to make heritage data available. And the wide variety of ideas showed the depth of potential in Europeana Collections material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grants were awarded to three projects, and in this mini blog series, we’re sharing their final reports with you, finding out what they’ve achieved and where they’ll go from here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second project is Mapping a Colony, from Nanna Thylstrup (University of Copenhagen), Lene Asp (author), and Mace Ojala (IT University of Copenhagen).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/nanna.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 320px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/lene-asp.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 275px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: middle;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>Download Mapping a Colony’s <a href=\"files/research.europeana.eu/2017-09/research-grants-final-report-thylstrup-092017.pdf\">final report</a>.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost 250 years, Denmark colonized what is now the US Virgin Islands (St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John), until the territory was sold to the United States in 1917.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Danish administration left the islands, all official archives, including images, photographs and maps went to Copenhagen, where the documents became part of the National Archives as well as the Image and Maps Collection at the Royal Library. These archives are presently being digitized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mapping a Colony seeks to create an interactive map of Denmark and the US Virgin Islands, which highlights and investigates the Danish colonial heritage with a specific focus on the Danish West Indies, as it manifests itself historically and/or presently in these areas. In doing so, it will create a deeper understanding of how the colonial past is still very much present in our contemporary society and landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does it use Europeana Collections?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The team used images from Europeana Collections that relate to the Danish colonial past and engaged with the Europeana API to dynamically augment the website with content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What did the project achieve?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A prototype map has been developed and is available at https://blogit.itu.dk/mappingacolonyen/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 63 points on the map generate relations and strings of stories, ranging from the era of Danish colonial rule and up to the present day. By relating history to present human, material and cultural conditions, it encourages and contributes to a conversation on the influence and (in)visible consequences of the Danish colonial rule from multiple perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nanna says, ‘While we intended the project to be a decolonial mapping endeavour, we quickly realized that we could not honour this aspiration fully. There are many reasons why we failed to offer a fully decolonized map, from the funding infrastructure to the composition of the research group to time limitations and the cultural form of the map. Yet, working in the framework of productive failure we expect meaningful discussions to emerge from the project in dialogue with others who have sought to work with the material in a decolonial way.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the future of the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The project is still ongoing and will be officially launched in October 2017 with a workshop at the Royal Library of Denmark. Lene Asp, Nanna Thylstrup, and Mace Ojala will also explore opportunities for additional funding for developing the project into a PhD project for Lene and a journal article that will provide new discussions points for how to work with contested heritage in the digital sphere based on the experiences of Mapping a Colony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-research-grant-winners-nanna-thylstrup-and-lene-asp\">explore an earlier interview</a> on this project and <a href=\"https://blogit.itu.dk/mappingacolonyen/\">visit the project website</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Since its conception in 2011, the international community of the International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>) has taken important steps in improving the way cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) present images on their digital collections platforms.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Since its conception in 2011, the international community of the International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>) has taken important steps in improving the way cultural heritage institutions (CHIs) present images on their digital collections platforms. Proper access to digitised heritage, as the IIIF Consortium acknowledges, is fundamental for research communities in a great variety of fields and one of its aims is to “give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world” (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/about/\">Source</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has also taken part in this initiative and is advocating the implementation of IIIF for digitized cultural heritage collections as a member of the IIIF Executive Committee. Since 2016 it is possible for institutions to deliver their IIIF resources to Europeana through the IIIF profile in the Europeana Data Model (EDM) (find the Guidelines <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Share_your_data/Technical_requirements/EDM_profiles/IIIFtoEDM_profile_042016.pdf\">here</a>). This does not only facilitate the sharing of images but also give the user a richer viewing experience on the Europeana portal with deeper zoom. These resources are also accessible through our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">APIs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-09/gogh.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 388px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Detail from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064116/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Nationalmuseum__Sweden_18806.html\">The Cornshocks</a>, after a painting by Van Gogh, 19th century, Nationalmuseum, Sweden, Public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that an ever increasing amount of CHIs are implementing IIIF for their collections, the number of cultural heritage objects aggregated in the Europeana portal following this protocol continues to grow. These are important steps in the ongoing process of providing users with better quality digitised heritage such as paintings, manuscripts, printed books, archaeological and archival material, etc. The work of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-6-iiif\">IIIF Taskforce</a>, furthermore, makes vital contributions to the future of IIIF in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s entry and role in IIIF has positive effects for all parties. Not only will it help establish IIIF implementation across the Europeana Network but it bridges connections between US and EU based research and heritage institutions fostering more direct collaboration in terms of open source software development, data sharing, and technical interoperability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only is this a significant improvement for the general user, but the benefits for the scholarly community are even greater. A more uniform and richer experience while accessing image-based resources is indispensable in making collections more interoperable and accessible to empower research. This protocol is of interest for many fields of scholarship, from researchers studying materials such as manuscripts, paintings, photographs, to incunabula, historical newspapers, and other archival documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-09/manuscript-zoom-iiif.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 337px;\"><br>\r\n<em>Detail of the Commentarii in somnium Scipionis cum glossis by Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius, 1st half of the 13th century, Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/07932/diglit_salXIV36.html\">Cod. Sal. XIV,36</a>, CC BY-SA. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>IIIF is not merely limited to opening up material to deeper zoom. Other possibilities, depending on the viewer used, include the ability to rotate, adjust colour composition (such as saturation), compare side-by-side, and create and share annotations. Furthermore, there is the possibility of copying the manifest(s) (a JSON-LD document) into a viewer of your own choosing and annotate, create custom collections and showcases for teaching or research purposes. Depending on the IIIF-viewer, other options for interacting with the images are available (see the options and demos <a href=\"http://iiif.io/apps-demos/#image-viewing-clients\">here</a>). Europeana Collections has implemented Leaflet.js with a IIIF-plugin to display the resources; the manifests can be picked from the JSON (read more about it on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/building-a-rich-media-experience-with-the-europeana-api-and-iiif\">this </a>page).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a continued effort from the Europeana ingestion team to work closely with aggregators and CHIs to increase the number of records on Europeana Collections with IIIF resources. At the moment more than 300,000 records are available on Collections, with more to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the broad range of ‘IIIF-ified’ collections that Europeana offers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Universit%C3%A4tsbibliothek+Heidelberg&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=grid\">Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Nationalmuseum%2C+Sweden&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=grid\">Nationalmuseum, Sweden </a> (see also <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-6-iiif#Article3\">this </a>blog written by the Nationalmuseum)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=e-codices&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=grid\">e-codices - Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=University+College%2C+Dublin&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Archdiocese+of+Dublin&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">Archdiocese of Dublin </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Irish+Architectural+Archive&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">Irish Architectural Archive </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=UCD+Archives&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin Archives </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=UCD+Library&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin Library </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=UCD+School+of+History+and+Archives&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin School of History and Archives </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=UCD+College+of+Human+Sciences&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin College of Human Sciences </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=UCD+School+of+Irish%2C+Celtic+Studies%2C+Irish+Folklore+and+Linguistics&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=list\">University College Dublin School of Irish, Celtic Studies, Irish Folklore and Linguistics </a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Biodiversity+Heritage+Library&amp;q=sv_dcterms_conformsTo%3A%2Aiiif%2A&amp;view=grid\">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> (BHL)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These datasets contain, among others, a mix of archeological finds, newspapers, maps, paintings, medieval manuscripts and charters, manuscript fragments, and (early) printed books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme was launched for the first time in 2016 and proved hugely popular. Digital humanities researchers applied with projects that addressed research questions by using Europeana data. The high volume of proposals proved just how important it is to make heritage data available. And the wide variety of ideas showed the depth of potential in Europeana Collections material.<br>\r\nGrants were awarded to three projects, and in this mini blog series, we’re sharing their final reports with you, finding out what they’ve achieved and where they’ll go from here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/photograph-of-caroline-ardrey-28high-res-29.jpg\" style=\"width: 260px; border-width: 0px; height: 173px; margin: 10px; float: left;\">First up, it’s Visualising Voice, a project by Dr. Caroline Ardrey. Since 2015, Caroline has been working as a Research Associate at the University of Birmingham, as part of the AHRC-funded<a href=\"https://www.baudelairesong.org/\"> Baudelaire Song Project</a> (directed by Prof. Helen Abbott). Caroline is a researcher at the University of Birmingham specializing in 19th- century French poetry and the way in which performance changes the way we read a particular poem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Download Visualising Voice’s <a href=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-08/research-grants-final-report-ardrey-082017.pdf\">final report</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Visualising Voice, an off-shoot of the Baudelaire Song Project, sought to address three questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>How do features of speech affect the way we read and interpret poetry?</li>\r\n    <li>How can listening to someone else reading a poem shape our own understanding of the text?</li>\r\n    <li>How do our own interpretative decisions colour the way we use our voices when reciting a poem?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does it use Europeana Collections?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Collections has a rich body of spoken performances of poems by nineteenth-century French poets, waiting to be discovered, explored, and used for research. These recordings were the key to addressing the lack of studies of spoken word performances of poetry in French, and to kick-starting a more general awareness of how performance affects our interpretation of a particular poem, across a wide range of languages and cultural traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the context of this project, Caroline chose to study the performances of three poets from nineteenth-century France whose work is now canonical - Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), Paul Verlaine (1844-1896) and Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What did the project achieve?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The project created a visual tool, a bit like a musical score, to show how speakers in the various recordings handled aspects of poetry, from pronunciation and stress, to speed of delivery and punctuation. The Visualising Voice tool allows us to mark the beginning and end of each syllable, creating a timestamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-08/ardrey-website-example.jpg\"><br>\r\n<em>Waveform view of the visualisation of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000134383581.html\">Alain Cuny, reading Baudelaire’s “L’Albatros” in 1961</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the future of the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Caroline says, ‘Thanks to the Europeana Research Grants, we’ve been able to kick-start what I believe is much-needed research into the spoken performance of poetry. Within my own department, we’re already using the results of the project, and the tools developed in our teaching. In the future, I’d like to develop the project further, allowing general users to record and upload their own performances, encouraging others to engage with Europeana resources in their homes and places of study.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-research-grant-winners-caroline-ardrey\">explore an earlier interview</a>\_on this project and\_<a href=\"https://www.baudelairesong.org/\">visit the project website</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<h2>“Europeana is much more than a library, it is a veritable dynamo to inspire 21st century Europeans to emulate the creativity of innovative forbears like the drivers of the Renaissance.”</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>José Manuel Barroso, President of the EC<br>\r\n20 November 2008</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-07/dpassh-2017-logo-col-300x165.png\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 110px;\"><br>\r\nJune 14 and 15 2017 saw the second Digital Preservation for Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (DPASSH) conference, which took place at the University of Sussex. Hosted by the Sussex Humanities Lab and the Digital Repository of Ireland, the conference brought together a wide range of specialists in Digital Preservation, Archives and Digital Humanities from across the globe. The event was attended by the three Europeana Research Grants Winners — Dr Nanna Bonde Thylstrup, Dr Timothy Duguid, and Dr Caroline Ardrey — who presented on their Europeana-funded projects, as part of an expert panel on the second day of the conference, named <em>“More than a library”: Exploring the public value of Europeana.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DPASSH 2017 began with welcomes from Dr Sharon Webb, from the University of Sussex, chair of the organising committee and from Dr Natalie Harrower, director of the Digital Repository of Ireland and founder of the DPASSH international conference series. Professor Adam Tickell, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sussex, offered opening remarks and a warm welcome to Brighton, before the conference officially got underway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentations began with a keynote speech, given by Professor Lizzy Jongma, Senior ICT Project Leader at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and a Europeana Members Council representative. In this far-reaching talk, Jongma addressed some of the challenges facing specialists in digital preservation and scholars working with digital archives. Highlighting the benefits and importance of open access, this excellent keynote also touched on the impact of copyright and individual privacy rights on preservation of and access to archival documents from the not-so-distant past. The keynote was both fascinating and very relevant, pertaining to some of the topics which had influenced and affected the work carried out by the Europeana Research Grants winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On day two, the three Europeana Research Grants holders came together for the expert panel <em>“More than just a library: exploring the impact of Europeana”</em>. The session was chaired by keynote speaker Lizzy Jongma, with an introductory paper by digital policy and diplomacy specialist and Europeana Network Association member, Dr Natalia Grincheva, from the University of Melbourne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natalia’s paper outlined the place of Europeana in the cultural and political landscape of digitization. Natalia discussed the implications of digital data aggregation, cultural reproduction, and digital reconstruction of the historic past for creating new cultural and social capital, as far as digital heritage is concerned. She offered an overview of the diverse ways in which users can interact with the Europeana platform, and with the vast range of resources held by Europeana partner institutions. Natalia concluded by underscoring Europeana’s innovative approach to making the platform accessible and enriching for end-users, by connecting researchers and a general-public audience with their cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Timothy Duguid, from the University of Glasgow, took over, discussing the MuSO project. His presentation outlined the history of the project and its connection to the Advanced Research Consortium. Other presentations at DPASSH and earlier discussions had highlighted the need for a method of preserving born-digital content rather than simply digitised content, and his presentation built on this perceived need by showing MuSO to be a discovery platform for born-digital content alongside digitized content. His presentation discussed how the MuSO project has used the Europeana Music Collection to build an RDF schema that will allow for the aggregation of both types of digital content while also working across disciplinary boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, Caroline Ardrey, based at the University of Birmingham, presented her project, Visualising Voice, which showcases visual representations of spoken-word performances of poetry. Caroline emphasised the wealth of spoken-word audio resources held by Europeana collections, and highlighted the cultural and educational importance of encouraging users to engage with these resources in innovative ways. She also noted the gap in the research market for studies which consider poetry as a performative medium, linking to newly-developed studies in word-and-music relations, such as the Baudelaire Song Project, of which Caroline is currently Research Associate. She highlighted the challenges presented by copyright laws when working with digital audio material, and explored ways of managing these. Caroline ended her talk with a call to consider the pedagogical aspect of working with digital audio materials, making annotation practices and research findings accessible beyond the scope of the academic community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Nanna Thylstrup from the University of Copenhagen rounded off the panel with a presentation of her project, Mapping a Colony, which is dedicated to exploring, mapping, and connecting stories about the Danish colonial regime in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) from a combined Danish and USVI perspective, via an interactive map. Nanna’s talk centered on questions of how to reuse and mobilize Europeana’s archival objects and infrastructures in digital humanities projects in an ethical and meaningful way. Showcasing the work of Mapping a Colony, Nanna in particular highlighted the need to further discuss and explore suitable models of how to decolonize archival work in European digital infrastructures such as Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the winning projects are different in nature, the panelists also shared common experiences working with Europeana, and the panel provided a good forum for discussing the potentials and limitations of working with the Europeana platform. Key topics raised by the panel, and addressed by the grants-holders’ papers and subsequent discussions included issues surrounding data visualisation, interoperability, cross-institutional work, indexing systems, and the limitations imposed on research by copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DPASSH 2017 offered a fantastic opportunity for the three Europeana Research Grants winners to come together to share and discuss their research. The conference opened up important questions surrounding the challenges and the value of working with Europeana for academic research - both for the grants holders and for the wider scholarly community. In particular, the panel and dialogue with other delegates allowed for a fruitful exploration of ways to work with Europeana in a sustainable, ethical and pragmatic fashion, while also utilizing and further developing its great potential for supporting and driving digital archival research.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<h3>Since the foundation of various libraries close to the university in the 14th and 15th centuries, the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg has housed many important collections. The datasets that have been delivered to Europeana hold over 25,000 records including treasures such as manuscripts, manuscript fragments, charters, and early modern and modern printed books and magazines. The subject areas and the source language of the objects vary widely, including, among others, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. All the material is available under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/\">CC BY-SA license</a>, allowing for free re-use.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-aligns-with-the-international-image-interoperability-framework-iiif\">implementation of the IIIF Framework in Europeana</a>, we worked on the ingestion of material complying to these new standards. As the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg had implemented IIIF resources into their metadata, it proved to be a good candidate. We therefore focussed on this institution with the hopes of improving its collections in Europeana thanks to IIIF. The work that was done, which is has been published as a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/universitatsbibliothek-heidelberg-case-study\">case study</a>, went further as we managed to improve data quality because of the approach taken in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A data quality plan was set up to improve the metadata of the two datasets delivered to Europeana by the Universitätsbibliothek (<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A07931*\">07931</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A%2807932_L_DE_UniLibHeidelberg_handschriften_IIIF%29\">07932</a>). An analysis of the data was made and work undertaken to provide researchers with more meaningful metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variety of improvements were implemented, some of them include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Standardisation of mandatory or meaningful fields (e.g. date, type, and subject)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Populating additional fields (e.g. description, spatial information)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Standardisation of creator and contributor fields</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Incorporation of hierarchical relationships</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-06/textimage.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 677px;\"><br><a href=\"%C2%A0http://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/07932/diglit_cpg848.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A%2807932_L_DE_UniLibHeidelberg_handschriften_IIIF%29\">Source</a>: Graf Konrad von Kirchberg on f. 23r, Große Heidelberger Liederhandschrift (Codex Manesse), 1300-1340, Germany, Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg, CC BY-SA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dataset is of particular interest not only to digital humanists, but also to palaeographers, codicologists, book historians, philologists, medieval or early modern historians, and many other scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implemented data quality improvements of these datasets are now offering a much wider array of use cases for researchers, would they would want do a quantitative or qualitative research of the objects. Also, by accessing the API, querying and harvesting selected records, it is possible to do a data analysis or visualizations.

        body: "<p>Europeana has progressively adopted the principles of Linked Data for representing, aggregating, and enriching the metadata it collects from the Cultural Heritage institutions of Europe. Its foundation is the Europeana Data Model (EDM) which enables the representation of links between cultural heritage objects and the entities surrounding them (people, places, concepts, timespans). This vision of a network of metadata has a strong impact on the data aggregation flows designed for Europeana. While we adopted a centralised approach to data aggregation, the Web and its technologies invite us to look at these processes from a different angle. Can Linked Data support innovative metadata aggregation flows, making them less centralised and more flexible? How do Web technologies change our approach to data management?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We attended the Seminar Linked Data in Research and Cultural Heritage organised by <a href=\"https://dans.knaw.nl/en\">DANS</a> last week with these questions in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part of the Seminar focussed on research use cases. Ruben Verborgh (Universiteit Gent) provided some recommendations on how we should develop APIs providing access to our data and how we can support a more decentralised approach to data queries which is not limited to aggregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussing data access also raised questions about the reliability of the data being published on the Web. Nanopublications was presented by Tobias Kuhn (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), as a way to assert the provenance, the semantic integrity and the permanence of research data. Data Quality is another important challenge: the FAIR principles presented by Michel Dumontier (Universiteit Maastricht) provides the framework to evaluate and rate the quality of research data publication services. Those are prerequisites to enable the \"Linked Research” approach defined by Sarven Capadisli (University Bonn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the seminar explored use cases from the Cultural Heritage domain. We presented the Europeana work towards <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/NunoFreire2/new-approaches-for-data-acquisition-at-europeana-iiif-sitemaps-and-schemaorg-dans-seminar-2017\">new approaches for data acquisition at Europeana</a> using technologies such as the International Image Interoperability Framework (<a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>), Sitemaps, and <a href=\"http://schema.org/\">Schema.org </a>. These experimentations are geared towards a new vision of data aggregation which also underlies the approach taken by the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/ennomeijers/20170501-distributed-network-of-digital-heritage-information\">Dutch Network for Cultural Heritage</a> presented by Enno Meijers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other technologies such as <a href=\"http://linkeddatafragments.org/\">Linked Data Fragments</a> or <a href=\"http://mementoweb.org/guide/howto/\">Memento</a> were presented as ways to improve search, access, and usability of cultural heritage and research data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c086f159-f12a-1015-3954-ce1d875871e2\">All the presentations given at the event are available at <a href=\"https://dans.knaw.nl/en/current/events/seminar-linked-data-in-research-and-cultural-heritage\">https://dans.knaw.nl/en/current/events/seminar-linked-data-in-research-and-cultural-heritage</a> </b></p>"

        title: 'Europeana Treasures #1: Creating a narrative of children’s literature books and illustrations'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana Treasures is a series of blogposts introducing the Europeana Research case studies. Their name is inspired by the fact that they shed light on important research findings and unknown sources that have been discovered by researchers in the rich library of Europeana. Alongside the research projects which will be developed by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-research-grant-winners-nanna-thylstrup-and-lene-asp\">the winners of the Europeana Research Grants</a>, two more complementary case studies have been developed by the Digital Curation Unit, ATHENA R.C. in the context of the DSI2 project. This blogpost is the first of its series introducing the case study on children’s literature books and illustrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring Europeana can often lead the user to sources he had no idea of, and yet digital. Apart from discovering these treasures, the user is now able to access and use them, having always in mind the individual access rights that the providing institution has licensed. Such treasures have been traced within Europeana in the context of the case study “Creating a narrative of children’s literature books and illustrations”. The journey on researching about children’s literature within Europeana began in 2015 in the context of the project Europeana Cloud. Back then, the aim was to approach different sub-disciplines by exploring different <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/children-s-literature-in-europeana-research\">topics</a> and assessing the current research requirements, available tools and resources for that topic. The research findings and suggestions gathered then fed into the current case study in terms of measuring the development of the state of the art of this particular topic in Europeana today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first developments documented in comparison to the 2015 research findings was that the number of relevant resources increased. Despite the fact that the topic of children’s literature has not been addressed yet among the Europeana Collections, it is now evident that Europeana can support such a thematic presentation. Apart from the wealth of the relevant content, which can not be measured in its entirety, it is also useful to note the different resource types that have been identified. From journal articles to films of fairy tales, Europeana is a pool of diverse content which can thus appeal to different types of audience, different research aims and can lead to different outputs. An example of such an engagement of researchers with Europeana content on the topic of children’s literature is a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/reuse-of-europeana-content-for-fun\">knowledge testing game</a> that has been produced in the context of the ARK4 project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/ch.lit2.jpeg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 441px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/el/record/90402/RP_P_1996_69.html?q=aesop+fables\">Fabel van de vogelaar | Gheeraerts, Marcus (I), Rijksmuseum, Public Domain Marked</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned as we explore our possibilities for creating a digital narrative of children’s literature and we welcome feedback on new topics that you would like to see listed among the Collections of Europeana Research in the future!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Find out more about how to take advantage of the Generic Services funding.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Linked to Europeana’s European Union funding under CEF, the European Commission has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2017-cef-telecom-call-europeana-cef-tc-2017-3\">published</a> a public call for Generic Services to create tools for cultural heritage end-users and reusers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tools, products or services funded under this call may be external (e.g. stand-alone applications or integrated in national infrastructures or thematic aggregators) or integrated in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would very much like the Europeana Network and other colleagues to take advantage of the new funding, and would love to support good ideas that help users access the rich material held in our cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More specifically, the project call calls for projects that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>provide tools for end users to highlight, share or enrich material accessible through Europeana, such as tools to list personal favourites, share discoveries on social media, upload personal memorabilia or enrich descriptions;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>produce concrete examples of re-use of the material accessible through Europeana in other sectors, such as in research, education, creative industries or tourism.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The first category would be tools that function on Europeana Collections or on our thematic collections. The second would develop applications that make use of Europeana’s data via the API. The funding rate for this call is very attractive with 75% of costs funded by the Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you considering applying for this call? At Europeana, we are willing to assist you in creating a good project proposal, helping you with ideas and finding suitable project partners. The deadline for submission (to the European Commission) is <strong>28 November 2017</strong>. So please starting thinking about this now!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, if you would like to learn more about this call, you can join the Virtual Info day organised by the Commission on <strong>12 September 2017</strong> that will take place via live web streaming - participants can register<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/registration-form-cef-telecom-2017-3-virtual-info-day-12-september-2017\"> here</a>. The event will explain the policy context of the calls, give information about the evaluation process, and provide valuable tips and tricks on writing a good proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking forward to hearing your ideas!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Research 2016 grant winners’ final reports published'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme was launched in 2016 and proved hugely popular. With the 2017 Grants Programme just around the corner, here's a quick recap of last year's winners.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme was launched in 2016 and proved hugely popular. Digital humanities researchers applied with projects that addressed research questions by using Europeana data. The high volume of proposals proved just how important it is to make heritage data available. And the wide variety of ideas showed the depth of potential in Europeana Collections material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grants were awarded to three projects, all of which have now published reports on their work. A <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=meet+the+research+grants+winners\">Europeana Research mini blog series</a> covers what they’ve achieved and where they’ll go from here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For music lovers…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Music Scholarship Online (MuSO) is a new virtual research environment dedicated to born-digital and digitized scholarship in music. It contributes to the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC), an organization promoting digital scholarship and incorporating increasingly diverse content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project brought together an early modern music and digital humanities scholar, a digital humanities librarian with a degree in vocal studies, a music special collections librarian with a background in jazz, and an alternative academic professional with no prior experience in music, but a wealth of knowledge about aggregation, digital resource discovery, and ARC metadata.<br><a href=\"/post/europeana-research-grants-2016-outcomes-the-muso-project-by-timothy-duguid\">Read the MuSO blog and final report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For poetry lovers…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Collections has a rich body of spoken performances of poems by 19th-century French poets, waiting to be discovered, explored, and used for research. For the Visualising Voice project, these recordings were the key to addressing the lack of studies of spoken word performances of poetry in French, and to kick-starting a more general awareness of how performance affects our interpretation of a particular poem, across a wide range of languages and cultural traditions.<br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-grants-2016-outcomes-ardrey\">Read the Visualising Voice blog and final report</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For map lovers...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost 250 years, Denmark colonized what is now the US Virgin Islands (St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John), until the territory was sold to the US in 1917. Mapping a Colony seeks to create an interactive map of Denmark and the US Virgin Islands, which highlights and investigates the Danish colonial heritage with a specific focus on the Danish West Indies, as it manifests itself historically and/or presently in these areas. In doing so, it will create a deeper understanding of how the colonial past is still very much present in our contemporary society and landscapes.<br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-grants-2016-outcomes-thylstrup\">Read the Mapping a Colony blog and final report</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Mapping a colony\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/mapping-a-colony.png\" style=\"width: 601px; height: 433px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://blogit.itu.dk/mappingacolonyen/\">Mapping a colony prototype</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Keep an eye out for the 2017 Grants Programme announcement in the following days if you want to enter this year's contest!</h2>\r\n"

        title: 'What does open education look like from a Brazilian perspective?'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>How a photo contest in Brazil is raising\_awareness of open education within a university community.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Open culture is a global movement - as you’ll be seeing for yourself if you’re following our feature on the <a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/\">Year of Open</a> website this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, we’re looking at how a photo contest in Brazil aimed to raise awareness of open education within a university community, encouraging students to see themselves as part of a collaborative learning community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unisul.br/wps/portal/home/unisul-virtual\">UnisulVirtual</a> is the distance education campus of the Brazilian <a href=\"http://www.unisul.br/wps/portal/home/\">Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina</a>. UnisulVirtual ran a competition this summer as part of its seventh Cultural Exhibition, which, because 2017 is the ‘Year of Open’, was themed ‘Open education in focus’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contest was aimed at amateurs and asked them to share photos of spaces, events, attitudes, forms of expression, experiences, people or situations that represent how they feel about open education. Entrants were invited to represent a subjective, objective, poetic, or metaphorical interpretation of the theme because, as the organisers said, ‘Creative freedom goes hand in hand with Open Education’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three winners received up to 50% reduction on their UnisulVirtual undergraduate tuition fees for a term. That’s quite a prize! So, what does open education look like to the competition winners? Family and technology come through as strong themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Argemiro da Rosa Rocha won first place with his photo entitled, ‘Connection, Knowledge and Equality’ - see above.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Argemiro says, ‘The idea of free and open sharing is the most basic feature of education. The photo shows mother and daughter learning together in order to overcome their limitations (material and immaterial ones) and, by means of a global connectivity, to explore a universe rich in creative possibilities. Having education anywhere and accessing and sharing knowledge at any time means to evolve and to have in one´s hand the power to change one´s reality in the pursuit of a more just and egalitarian society.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In second place, Guilia Goulart submitted this shot of a grandfather and grandson.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Guilia Goulart's entry\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/Winner02.JPG\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 392px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in third place, an image from Ariel Santos Silva contrasts traditional pen and paper with the glow of technology.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ariel Santos Silva's entry\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/Winner03.JPG\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The winning photos, all released with a CC BY licence, will feature in the virtual learning environment of each of UnisulVirtual's courses, on Unisul’s social media, and will be displayed during the II SIPPE – <a href=\"https://iisippe.wordpress.com/\">Symposium on Innovation in Research and Extension Practices</a> in November.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Read about the outcomes of our teacher's validation pilot</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over 2016 and 2017 (DSI2 project), <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> (EUN) led a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana4education-europeana-taster-for-teachers\" target=\"_blank\">teacher's validation pilot</a> which has now been evaluated. The aims of the pilot were to develop and test pedagogical scenarios and learning activities using Europeana content, and to provide recommendations for policy makers, educators, cultural heritage institutions and Europeana to help <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/help-shape-inspiring-education-join-us-as-we-launch-europeana4education\" target=\"_blank\">mainstream</a> the reuse of digital cultural content in primary and secondary schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The workshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>20 teachers from 10 European countries and a wide mix of disciplines and educational levels were brought together at EUN’s offices in Brussels for a workshop in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana4education-final-teachers-workshop-1\" target=\"_blank\">November 2016</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana4education-europeana-taster-for-teachers\" target=\"_blank\">February 2017</a>. Over the course of two workshops, the teachers explored how to use Europeana content in education and developed learning scenarios that they would then test in their classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUN qualitatively evaluated the full programme and have published a short brochure highlighting the main outcomes and recommendations. You can download both on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What did we learn?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some findings were not so unexpected. For example, the teachers were more likely to use images from our collections than sounds, 3D objects, videos or text. They liked having ready made materials or resources available. These ranged from our curated exhibitions to the various apps that can be used in education, like <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/apps/faces/\">FACES</a>, <a href=\"http://vangoyourself.com/\">Van Go Yourself</a> and <a href=\"https://colourapp.eu/\">Create</a>. From this, we know that we should work better to make other media formats available for educators, and that curated resources are vital for time-poor teachers who want to bring cultural heritage into the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report details some fantastic outcomes. After phase 2 of the project (on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the highest score), teachers would recommend the Europeana platform to other teachers (8.94 points) and to students (8.21 points). 16 of the 20 teachers declared that there was a positive change in their pedagogical approach after having participated in the pilot. Some teachers consider that they have progressed in designing more personalized student activities and in giving more responsibility to students for their learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachers gave feedback on what they thought of our site. They enjoyed its usefulness for educators and students, as well as having more content open for reuse in education, broadening the choice of resources for pupils and educators. Language and multilingual searching is important to them, as well as having content of national relevance. We’ve taken this onboard and we will do what we can to make our site as useful as possible for educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find out more in the teacher case studies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re delighted that EUN were able to make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtA54levDap3HpzRgOxm_EZZwUp1NXCJL\">short case study videos</a> about a few of the teachers who used Europeana to develop learning scenarios in the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUWfnSfooms\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay up to date with all of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Education community</a> news and explore our new pages on Europeana Pro.

        title: 'New Europeana Pro - the Beta version is out for your input'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Welcome! As you can see, the new Europeana Pro website is now live in Beta. Let us introduce you to some of the changes - and we really hope you will be our friendly critics. \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>All Europeana’s professional services in one place</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you want to read about the data guidelines or the latest copyright reform updates, you are still in the right place. But you might have noticed that Pro is addressing more than the Network Association and data ingestion: we have integrated Europeana Labs and Europeana Research, previously living on separate websites. We now give you an integrated picture of what Europeana is and does: whether you work in academic research, education, a cultural heritage institution or the creative industry, you are part of a wide community of professionals that make this digital cultural heritage revolution happen. We hope this move will reinforce the work done by all our different communities, and that you will enjoy learning how everyone’s efforts can make a difference in the digital cultural heritage world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A redesigned website placing people first</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main reasons for this redesign was to place people first. We wanted the new site to be more ‘people’ oriented to highlight our close relationships with institutions, which means that you can find out more about our staff and partners, and get to know the people behind the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been working hard on simplifying your journey on Europeana Pro, making it more functional and easier for you to find the resources you need. There’s now more than one way to find the info you want - use the traditional menu navigation (which include our new categorizations), or browse any of the landing pages, all arranged to give you an overview of what’s available at a glance. And of course there’s a hard-working ‘search’ function too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only will your experience of Pro be more streamlined, but also more visual: we have been rethinking the design to showcase more content from our collections. So you’ll see inspiring imagery showing how cultural heritage material can give life to other products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/233468737\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/233468737\">Welcome to new Pro</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A collaborative process</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been working closely with our Network to get to this new version. A Pro Working Group has been involved in the development of the site, to advise on the customer journeys. For <a href=\"/person/wietske-van-den-heuvel\">Wietske van den Heuvel</a>, Project editor at the Digital Heritage Netherlands (DEN Foundation), it was important that ‘the new Pro was not only about individual projects, but presenting Europeana as a whole brand. There is a lot of information, but things are easy to find.’ <a href=\"/person/julia-katona\">Júlia Katona</a>, Head of Collection at the Schola Graphidis Art Collection in Budapest, agrees that documents and resources are more accessible thanks to the new menu structure: ‘as a researcher, I will be able to easily access the information I need related to grant funding, for instance’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will keep on updating the new Pro, so watch this space, and we would love to get your feedback.

        title: '#EuropeanaInspires - Meet design projects from LUCA, School of Arts, Brussels'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>This is a guest blog post by <a href=\"http://www.nathalik.be/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nathalie Kronal</strong></a> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.luca-arts.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">LUCA</a></strong> (School of Arts, Brussels).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>New technological changes have emerged in rapid succession, blurring the distinctions between physical and digital world, and forming new creative and digital communities as a result. We can harness this change to bring our shared European cultural heritage closer to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Europeana has been inspiring creatives and developers to reuse their openly licensed content in innovative ways, our school, <strong><a href=\"http://www.luca-arts.be/en\" target=\"_blank\">LUCA</a></strong> (School of Arts, Brussels) has encouraged students to think of possible reinterpretations and reuses of Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The assignment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the second semester of the 2016-2017 school year, second-year bachelor's students of <a href=\"http://www.luca-arts.be/en/afstudeerrichting/graphic-design-1\" target=\"_blank\">Graphic Design</a> were asked to remodel a part of the Europeana collection into an interactive and immersive digital experience that was intuitive and pleasant to use. The goals of the assignment were to create new insights, reveal connections that were invisible before and let users engage more deeply with the content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students started the assignment by analysing the content provided on the platform and looking for items that inspired them. They quickly began to see opportunities in the extensive collection and ideas began to grow. We encouraged our students to experiment continuously and start with rapid prototyping early in the process. For about twelve weeks our students immersed themselves in design research and development: user flows, paper and dynamic prototyping, functional and graphic design and user testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results are quite diverse, from useful tools in the form of an app or website, to playful installations where the user needs to move around to discover the collection. Some exciting projects came out of this and we selected three student projects we’d like to share with the Europeana community - see below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The projects</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<strong>ARTO​ </strong><strong>​</strong>by<em> Nabil El Hajjouti</em>\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/screen-shot-2017-06-22-at-01.56.24.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 533px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>ARTO by Nabil El Hajjouti.

The goal of the game is to match random given popular film quotes with paintings available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\n<strong>Colour Meets Sound </strong><em>by Matti Verbanck</em>\n</h2>\r\n\r\n<address></address>\r\n\r\n<address></address>\r\n\r\n<address><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/matti2.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 326px;\"></address>\r\n\r\n<address>Colour Meets Sound by Matti Verbanck.

This project has actively sought contributions from the public across Europe, providing a unique resource from all sides of the conflict. This now amounts to over 14,000 stories and 140,000 items. Items range from diaries and personal photographs to images of objects related to the conflict.

Increasingly these are being made available in high resolution and with open licenses, and new features in the Europeana Collections website and Europeana API allow users to find exactly what they are looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Europeana <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/collections/art-history\" target=\"_blank\">Art History Collection</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Europeana <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/europeana/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest boards</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Search for openly licensed, high-resolution images of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BIMAGE_SIZE%5D%5B%5D=extra_large&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;q=what%3A%22painting%22\" target=\"_blank\">paintings</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Explore new <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/browse/colours\" target=\"_blank\">colour search</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Featured open datasets: <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=art\" target=\"_blank\">Art</a>, <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=design\" target=\"_blank\">Design</a>, <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=maps\" target=\"_blank\">Maps</a>, <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/data?tag=fashion\" target=\"_blank\">Fashion</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Example API queries: <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/api/console?function=search&amp;query=*:*&amp;reusability=open&amp;qf=IMAGE_SIZE:extra_large&amp;profile=facets\" target=\"_blank\">Openly licensed content </a>with direct access to &gt;4-megapixel images and Colour search: add e.g. &amp;colourpalette=%23A52A2A</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Europe’s Music Heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europe is steeped in musical heritage and this diversity is well reflected on Europeana. The Europeana Music Collection provides access to over 200,000 items, including images, text, video and of course sounds, representing nearly every European country (plus a few more!). Whilst we have a few <a href=\"http://labs.europeana.eu/apps?category=audiovisual\" target=\"_blank\">examples</a> of audiovisual creations using this material, specific examples on the theme of music are poorly represented.

        title: 'Cultural heritage data for the social sciences and humanities'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Bridging the Europeana and CLARIN infrastructures</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> is the European digital platform for cultural heritage. <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu\">CLARIN </a>has been involved as a partner in Europeana's <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi-2\">Digital Service Infrastructure</a> (DSI) from the start of this project in April 2015. CLARIN stands for \"Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure\". It is a research infrastructure that was initiated\_from the vision\_that all digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a\_<a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/glossary#single_sign-on\" title=\"Access to multiple systems by logging in once\r\n\">single sign-on</a>\_online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During DSI-2, the recently completed second iteration of this project, CLARIN established an integration of Europeana data into its infrastructure. As of September 2017, the project is in its third phase (DSI-3, see also this <a href=\"http://www.photoconsortium.net/europeana-dsi-3-has-started/\">post</a> from Photoconsortium, one of the DSI partners).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana provides access to digitised cultural resources from a wide range of cultural institutions all across Europe. Its aim is to give users the possibility to search and access knowledge in all the languages of Europe, either directly via its web portals, or indirectly via third-party applications built on top of its data services. The Europeana service is based on the aggregation and exploitation of (meta)data about digitised cultural heritage objects (images, text, audio, video and even 3D models) from very different contexts. Europeana has developed infrastructures and workflows for ingesting, indexing, normalising and publishing data, providing seamless efficient services on top of this. The Europeana Network has defined the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) to be used as its model for metadata exchange within the Network and with other communities. To achieve this wide range of interoperability, EDM was designed in line with the vision of linked open vocabularies. One of the lines of action of Europeana is to facilitate research on the digitised content of Europe’s galleries, libraries, archives \_and museums, especially for the digital humanities and the social sciences. This work is conducted in the scope of <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Research</a>, where issues affecting the research re-use of cultural heritage data and content (e.g. licensing, interoperability and access) are addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Completed work in Europeana DSI</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In DSI’s first phase (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi\">DSI-1</a>), which ran from April 2015 to June 2016, CLARIN contributed (with most of the work carried out at the centre at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities) to the Europeana Research distribution plan, which describes the task of “[placing] Europeana data in CLARIN infrastructures” (Dunning, 2015). An analysis was carried out that resulted in a selection of relevant data sets. CLARIN also carried out an analysis of the outcome of the digitisation of historical newspapers that took place in the context of <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers. </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second phase (DSI-2), which ran until August 2017, a pipeline of harvesting Europeana metadata (using OAI-PMH) and metadata conversion (via XSLT) \_and metadata import \_into the Virtual Language Observatory (VLO) was implemented. Records from a selection of collections can now be found in the <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu\">VLO</a>. The included resources have been selected on the basis of their relevance to the CLARIN community, the quality of the included data and metadata, and suitability for machine processing, and they cover \_scanned and OCR'd newspapers from Austria, Slovenia and Finland, historical Travel books from Hungary and Slovenia, Finnish travel brochures and audio recordings of Romanian poetry from the 1960s. Many of these resources can already be processed with tools that are listed in the <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/switchboard\">Language Resource Switchboard</a> (LRS). For such resources, users can open the LRS directly from the VLO, choose a tool that supports it format and language, and then immediately trigger that tool with the selected resource. The principles and workings of the LRS are explained in detail in this <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/zinn-CLARIN2016_paper_26.pdf\">paper by Claus Zinn</a>; you can also watch a video of this <a href=\"http://www.videolectures.net/clarinannualconference2016_zinn_language_resource/\">presentation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI-2/Milestones/ms2.2-results-and-impact-of-sharing-europeana-data-with-clarin.pdf\">report</a> for milestone 2.2 \"Results and Impact of Sharing Europeana Data with CLARIN\" lists a number of recommendations for improving the content provided by Europeana (both metadata and data) and the infrastructural components upon which the integration between Europeana and CLARIN as well as other potential infrastructures is built. These improvements would contribute to the inclusion of larger amounts of Europeana records into CLARIN's infrastructure, and will allow for a better integration with other infrastructure components such as the LRS.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Future and ongoing work</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In DSI-3, which runs until the end of August 2018, CLARIN and Europeana will improve and expand upon the integration established during DSI-2. Limitations of the current state of integration will be assessed and, wherever possible, addressed in cooperation with the data and tool providers in order to support functional discovery and processing in a way that is both 'deep' (working seamlessly from resource querying to the retrieval of processing result) and 'broad' (working for many resources and tools, covering a large portion of languages, resource formats and processing types). In addition, we aim to add many new good quality resources from different collections to the set that is directly accessible through the CLARIN infrastructure. Within the same project phase, Europeana will also continue working with <a href=\"http://www.dariah.eu/\">DARIAH</a>, and investigate connections to other large research infrastructures, such as the <a href=\"https://ehri-project.eu/\">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the additional data now accessible through the VLO, there are millions of other resources, including paintings, photographs, audio and video recordings, that can be accessed through Europeana's collection browser and search facilities at <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">europeana.eu</a> - something we can highly recommend doing. Chances are that you will stumble upon data relevant to your area of research while you're at it!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Flowing London Style Master: Gina Fratini'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Gina Fratini was a British fashion designer whose naively elegant style was very popular during the sixties and seventies in London.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Gina Fratini was a British fashion designer whose naively elegant style was very popular during the sixties and seventies in London. Born Georgina Caroline Somerset Butler in Japan, she was raised between the Middle East and India, but chose England as her basis, and soon became on of the ‘hot names of the British fashion scene’. Her interest in design took her to study at the prestigious Royal College of Arts, then she travelled with Katherine Dunham’s dance as costume designer, she came back to London and set up her eponymous fashion house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048213-item-o138382.jpeg\"><br>\r\nVelvet smock dress designed by Gina Fratini, London, 1972, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gina Fratini made of flowing, multi-layered, soft dresses with delicate prints her signature. All her inspiration came from the material she had in her hands, as she could nearly feel the potential of that fabric and enhance it with apparently simple dresses cut to enhance the intrinsic characteristics of the material she was dealing with. She had been capable of seizing the zeitgeist of her time, feeling the shift of taste from the close fitting, short designs of the 1960s to a more relaxed and retro look, which will become the image of 1970s ‘Britishness’, epitomised by iconic ‘hippy’ designers as Zandra Rhodes and Barbara Hulaniki. “I think I was the first to believe that amusing fabric is more important than close fit. I like soft fabric, but only natural ones like pure silk or pure cotton. I cut everything in bias and just let it fall into the person. I like movement. There’s nothing more fascinating than a woman flowing instead of walking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/fashion/2017-09/2048213-item-o153492.jpeg\"><br>\r\n'Henry' ensemble by Gina Fratini, 1973-75, Courtesy Victoria and Albert Museum, CC-BY</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fit was the issue of an argument with one of her famous clients, Princess Margaret. ‘She insists on a fitted bodice. That really goes against my grain, so we compromise on the issue.’ The list of personalities who dressed in Fratini’s creations is long and filled with ranting names, such as Princess Anne, Ursula Andress, Raquel Welch, for whom Fratini not only provided everyday clothes, but was also requested by the actress herself as her personal costume designer for the movie ‘Bedazzled’.<br>\r\nPrincess Diana continued to be faithful to Fratini’s designs even after the shut down of her fashion house in the 80s; and even Elizabeth Taylor, known for her preference for flowing, flouncy gowns and caftans, chose Gina Fratini to design the dress in which she married Richard Burton for the second time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I believe Elegantes want to dress up even if they are headed for the kitchen. A firm fashion attitude makes living palatable.’ Gina Fratini firmly believed elegance had to be a way of life: an attitude coming out naturally every moment of every day, and not a superficial apposition to put on and off when the occasion requested.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Over these two days, we will familiarise the participants with the\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/blogpost/an-impact-playbook-for-cultural-heritage-this-ain-t-gonna-be-easy\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Impact Framework</a>\_and explore potential impact goals for Digital Cultural Heritage to agree on and implement. The output of this session will be a set of actionable policy recommendations for further development under the\_<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/european-year-cultural-heritage-2018_en\" target=\"_blank\">European Year of Cultural Heritage for publication during the Austrian Presidency in 2018</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event will start in the afternoon of 4 October with keynote presentations and case studies from experts and practitioners. It will be followed by dinner in the evening, giving participants the opportunity to discuss ideas and thoughts with colleagues. On 5 October, we will continue looking practically at how to implement the framework within your ministry or institution. We will also consider ways of creating a European wide standard for calculating Impact that helps prove the worth of Digital Cultural Heritage, and have a common reference point for each institution and country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that event attendance is by invitation only to ensure that the meeting focuses on high-level policy priorities around education and cultural heritage.

        intro: "<p>At least 8 positions are open for application: read more and get involved in the elections! \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over the last 3 years we have been working on making the Europeana Network Association a highly transparent, representative and collaborative body. We do so to encourage \_professionals from various sectors to become active members of our vibrant community. Each year, our members can elect their representatives in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, who then speak and make decisions on their behalf when it comes to core Europeana activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m proud to have been one of them for the past three years, and as the Chair of the Association’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Governance Working Group</a>, I am happy to \_kickstart the 2017 elections today! From now until 13 November we are inviting all the Network Association members to come forward as Members Council candidates to fill at least 8 open seats. The current Members Council is composed of 36 representatives, 8 of which have to step down this year. As a result of the decision of the last Members Council meeting the amount of Council seats in 2018 will remain the same as in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is in it for you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a Councillor means formally representing the interests of the Europeana Network Association as well as those of your wider professional network in Europeana's decision making. You elect the Association’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a>, support creation of the annual <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/spreading-the-word-business-plan-2017\">Business Plan</a>, put forward proposals and lead <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/task-forces\">Task Forces</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/working-groups\">Working Groups</a> that address issues relevant for Europeana and your community. In short, you help shaping the future of Europeana. You can actively contribute to an increased MC engagement within the Network by championing particular matters. In our monthly Network newsletters, each Councillor has the opportunity to speak directly to members and take on general ambassador role of Europeana.\_Take a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/Councillor%20Terms%20of%20Reference.pdf?b62509c75b\">Councillor Terms of Reference</a> to get an overview of all the responsabiltiies of a\_Councillor.\_You can\_find out more about\_the work of the Members Council\_over the past year in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mc-meeting-in-copenhagen-getting-ready-for-the-european-year-of-cultural-heritage-2018\">blogs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and sectors relevant to Europeana as long as they are a member of the Europeana Network Association. If you’re not a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/let-s-make-next-key-decisions-together-renew-your-membership\">registered member</a> yet, there’s still time to sign up in order to run in this year’s elections - you can do so before 1 November!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/426d0ec65af54b33b103c312e03467fc\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://dabuttonfactory.com/button.png?t=Submit+your+candidacy&amp;f=Open+Sans-Bold&amp;ts=24&amp;tc=fff&amp;tshs=1&amp;tshc=000&amp;hp=20&amp;vp=8&amp;c=5&amp;bgt=unicolored&amp;bgc=e11d53\" style=\"width: 313px; height: 40px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Coming up next</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Please send us your candidate profile and submit your candidacy via the button below by 13 November the latest, explaining why you are running, what you stand for, and what you wish to work towards. We will formally announce the candidates and kick off the campaigning on 20 November, inviting each candidate to promote themselves and the issues they wish to put forward. You can follow the campaign using the hashtag #EuropeanaElects.<br><br>\r\nThe voting will begin on 6 December during the meeting of the General Assembly at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/agm2017\">Europeana AGM</a> in Milan. All Association members will then have until 14 December to vote for as many candidates as there are seats available. The voting process is entirely anonymous. During the voting procedure of the General Assembly, you’ll also have the opportunity to decide on other key matters, including the budget and policy for 2018, the 2017 annual report, and improvements in the Association’s Statutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voting and elections procedures will be overseen by a Voting and Elections Committee, which consists of Councillors <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/barbara-fischer\">Barbara Fischer</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jef-malliet\">Jef Malliet</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/francesca-di-donato\">Francesca di Donato</a>, and myself. We will keep you posted and guide you through the elections until the announcement of the final results before Christmas. If you have any questions please get in touch with us at network@europeana.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are very much looking forward receiving your candidate profiles!</p>\r\n"

Awarded as a part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-generic-services-opportunity-to-fund-a-thematic-collection\">2016 Generic Services call</a>, it aims to identify, select and digitise collections and make them available on Europeana through a thematic collection dedicated to the theme of migration to, from and within Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Towards our next thematic collection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On 18 and 19 September, a first meeting gathered the six project partners: <a href=\"https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/cs/onderzoek/cs-digital\">KU Leuven</a>, <a href=\"http://mnl.gov.hu/angol\">National Archives of Hungary</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fina.gov.pl/\">National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute Poland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lnb.lt/\">National Library of Lithuania</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nb.rs/\">National Library of Serbia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the session, we introduced them to Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/thematic-collections\">thematic collections strategy</a>, our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services\">publications strategy</a> and editorial features such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/online-exhibitions\">exhibitions</a>, galleries, and blogs. The project partners then presented their collections focused on migration, and particularly relating to artists and scientists. We were impressed by the variety of materials, ranging from historical maps showing the dwellings of migrant populations in Romania to the archive of Polish film director Krzysztof Kieslowski and videos witnessing major social movements of the 20th century. The diversity of content - from letters, posters, photographs to film and musical scores - promises to make a fascinating prospect for users to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This thematic collection will source new content, via the project participants and their networks and new and existing Europeana data providers, of audiovisual material, archival content and textual collections, and will be the first time that these collections relating to migration will be gathered in one platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"MigrationArtsSciences\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/MigrationArtsSciences.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Foundation. CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This meeting kickstarted our work with our Migration in the Arts and Sciences partners to unlock digital heritage. The launch of this new collection will be accompanied by a series of promotional and participatory activities throughout 2018, in which Europeana and our network will focus on the ways migration has helped to shape our shared European cultural heritage. More details will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are delighted to be collaborating with our six partners, and we are also interested in hearing from more cultural heritage institutions with digitized content relating to migration. If your collections are relevant to this theme, we could include them in the thematic collection. Get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:Adrian.Murphy@europeana.eu\">Adrian.Murphy@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Sharing is Caring: open access insights from the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg tells us how its shares its collections with the world.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>With approximately 500,000 objects from 4,000 years of human history, the <a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg</a> (MKG) is one of Europe’s most important art and design museums. To celebrate the recent publication of its wonderful collections into Europeana, we spoke with <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/antje-schmidt\">Dr. Antje Schmidt</a>, Head of Digital Cataloguing and MKG Collection Online at the MKG, a member of the Europeana Art Advisory Board and Members Council, to find out how the museum shares its collections with the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A recent <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-43/2013-2015_progress_report_18528.pdf\">European Commission</a> report praised the MKG for publishing a substantial \_part of its collections into the public domain and available to download in high-quality. How and why did your museum adopt\_this policy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that the collection of the MKG belongs to all of us. The museum was founded in the 19th century to share examples of human creativity and related knowledge with as many people as possible. One of the main aspects was to let the collections be a source of inspiration for new creations. In the digital sphere, we want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to reuse digital images of works of art that are already in the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to other museums considering a similar policy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenge for many museums is to clear copyright and related rights and to clearly communicate how images and metadata can be reused. But if museums consider publishing their collection online they have to do it anyway. I would recommend starting with those parts of a collection that are already identified as being in the public domain and to make sure that no new rights are produced when they get digitized. This is recommended by the European Commission and explained in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/rights/public-domain-charter.html\">Europeana Public Domain Charter</a>. It doesn’t mean that there have to be thousands and thousands of objects. We started the <a href=\"https://sammlungonline.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\">MKG Collection Online</a> with the small amount of 3,000 objects, now there are more than 12.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Turner am Barren, Hamann, Heinrich, Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, CC0\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/Turner%20am%20Barren.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/heinrich-hamann#lg=1&amp;slide=5\"><em>Turner am Barren, Hamann, Heinrich, Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, CC0</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We're thrilled to have the MKG in Europeana. What do you hope to achieve through our partnership?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to make the MKG more widely known and encourage the use of its digitized holdings for research, creative projects or just for fun. Europeana is one of our most important partners, because it creates new content based on MKG’s digital images and metadata and share it online via social media or projects like <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/03/art-up-your-tab-heritage-in-your-browser/\">Art Up Your Tab</a>. Furthermore, it \_opens up new connections with content from other European cultural heritage institutions, and helps to get connected with other institutions to foster cooperation for funding opportunities. As <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/learnings-from-the-met-open-access-reasons-why-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-is-opening-up-its-collections\">Neal Stimler from Metropolitan Museum</a> pointed out, when it comes to engaging with a collection, it doesn’t matter if you visit the museum’s own site or find the content elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Which audiences are you trying to reach?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone interested in cultural heritage and creativity. We not only offer images for download to inspire makers and designers, but also provide metadata in machine-readable form via <a href=\"https://github.com/MKGHamburg\">Github</a> to encourage developers or data analysts to work with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the MKG’s policy compare with other German museums?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most German museums are still hesitant to clearly label their artworks and objects that are already in the Public Domain (PD) in physical form as PD after digitisation.\_The\_Representative for Cultural and Media Affairs (BKM)\_and the respective ministries in the federal states should raise awareness why contributing to the Public Domain is a benefit not only for the museum but for society at large, and clearly demand an ‘open by default’ policy following the Commission’s recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our future goals is to publish an API that makes it easier for others to reuse MKG Collection Online’s content. We would also like to find out more about the needs of the users, and to extend our cooperation with the Wikipedia community by continuing to contribute <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Museum_f%C3%BCr_Kunst_und_Gewerbe_Sammlung_Online\">MKG’s collections to the Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you share some examples of projects using these resources?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One example is the <a href=\"https://codingdavinci.de/projects/2016/zeitblick.html\">Zeitblick-App </a>that was created during the Coding da Vinci Nord Hackathon in 2016. Users take a selfie and the app shows them a matching portrait from MKG’s historical photography collection. They then get additional information about their historical self and get to know the collection in a playful way that doesn’t require any previous knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Schmidt and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy\">Douglas McCarthy</a> will be speaking at <a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">Museums in the Digital Sphere: Opportunities and Challenges</a> on 6 October at the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>From 1-31 October, all GIF-­makers, history nuts, cultural heritage enthusiasts and lovers of the internet are invited to take part in the fourth annual <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GIFITUP2017\">GIF IT UP</a> competition.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Tuesday 26 September </strong>- From 1-31 October, all GIF-­makers, history nuts, cultural heritage enthusiasts and lovers of the internet are invited to take part in the fourth annual <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GIFITUP2017\">GIF IT UP</a> competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competition encourages people to create new, fun and unique artworks from digitized cultural heritage material. A GIF is an image, video or text that has been digitally manipulated to become animated. Throughout the month, they can create and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GIFITUP2017\">submit</a> their own, using copyright-free digital video, images or text from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a>, <a href=\"https://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</a>, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\">DigitalNZ</a>.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All entries help promote public domain and openly licensed collections to a wider audience, and increase the reuse of material from these four international digital libraries, including Europeana Collections. The contest is supported by <a href=\"https://giphy.com\">GIPHY</a>, the world's largest library of animated GIFs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2017 competition will have a special focus on first-time GIF-makers and introduce them to openly licensed content. A GIF-making workshop, providing tools and tutorials to help visitors create their first artworks, will be held on 14-15 October in cooperation with THE ARTS+, the creative business festival at the Frankfurt Book Fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury, made up of representatives from GIPHY, DailyArt and Public Domain Review, will be awarding one grand prize winner with an <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/102763305\">Electric Object - a digital photo frame especially for GIFs - </a>sponsored by GIPHY. Prizes of online gift cards will go to three runners-up as well as winners in a first-time GIF-makers category. Special prizes will be allocated in thematic categories: transport, holidays, animals and Christmas cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are also invited to take part in the People's Choice Award and vote on the competition website for their favourite GIF, which will receive a <a href=\"https://www.giphoscope.com/giphoscope\">Giphoscope</a>. All eligible entries will be showcased on the <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifitup\">GIPHY channel</a> dedicated to the competition, and promoted on social media with the hashtag #GIFITUP2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"GIF IT UP 2017\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/gif_it_up_2017.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIF IT UP started in 2014 as an initiative by the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and DigitalNZ, and has since become a cultural highlight. 368 entries from 33 countries are featured on the <a href=\"http://gifitup2016.tumblr.com/\">GIF IT UP Tumblr</a>. In 2016, the grand prize was awarded to ‘<a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/gifitup-gif-it-up-3oz8xOg31IhaWkJXag\">The State Caterpillar</a>’, created by Kristen Carter and Jeff Gill from Los Angeles, California, using source material from the National Library of France via Europeana. Nono Burling, who got awarded the 2016 People’s Choice Award for <a href=\"https://gifitup2016.tumblr.com/post/151292480306/gif-it-up-2016-entry-by-nono-burling-of-olympia\">‘Butterflies’</a>, said: “I adore animated GIFs made from historic materials and have for many years. The first contest in 2014 inspired me to make them myself, and every year I try to improve my skills.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Results of the 2017 competition will be announced in November on the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GIFITUP2017\">GIF IT UP website</a> and related social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS<br><br>\r\nMedia contacts:</strong><br><br>\r\nCamille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu<br><br>\r\nEleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu<br><br><em><strong>Notes for the editor:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Europeana</strong> is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive. From books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects, Europeana Collections provides online access to a vast store of cultural heritage material from across Europe for everyone to find, use and share: for research, for learning, for creating new things. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaeu\">@EuropeanaEU</a>)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)</strong> connects people to the riches held within America’s libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions. All of the materials found through DPLA—photographs, books, maps, news footage, oral histories, personal letters, museum objects, artwork, government documents, and so much more—are free and immediately available in digital format. The cultural institutions participating in DPLA represent the richness and diversity of America itself, from the smallest local history museum to the nation’s largest cultural institutions.

Launched in 2009, Trove is now many things to many people: a community, a set of services, an aggregation of metadata, and a growing repository of full text digital resources. Trove is a platform on which new knowledge is being built. It is a collaboration between the National Library, Australia’s State and Territory libraries and hundreds of cultural and research institutions around Australia, working together to create a legacy of Australia’s knowledge for now and into the future.

Cultural heritage can play a key role as a means of building, negotiating and asserting identity’ (2017, page 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage applicants to come up with individual research projects which make use of <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana Collections content</a> to showcase and explore the theme of intercultural dialogue. Applicants should employ state-of-the-art tools and methods in digital humanities to address a specific research question. We expect to see applications employing as much of the Europeana platform (e.g., <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">the API</a>, metadata,) as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Who can apply?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You should be a postgraduate or doctoral student, or an early career scholar (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a>) in any field within the humanities, social sciences, archival or information sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>How will Europeana Research be involved in your project?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You will be in charge of your own project and free to pursue it according to a schedule you define, provided that you complete the project by 1 May 2018. Selected members of the Europeana Research team and Advisory Board will be available to offer guidance and advice, based on their area of expertise and in accordance with your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What funding is available?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Funding is available for<strong> up to 8,000 euros</strong> per successful project.<strong> Up to three </strong>successful proposals will be funded. Funding can be used for the buyout of researcher time, travel, meetings, or developer costs. This funding does not include overheads</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What are the important dates that you should keep in mind?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The deadline for applications <strong>has been extended to 12 November</strong>. Proposals will be reviewed by <strong>early December 2017</strong> and the list of successful projects will be announced shortly thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What should\_the duration of the projects be?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Each project will be funded for one to six months, but all final reports should be submitted in English by <strong>1 May 2018</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>How should you apply?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=researchgrants2017\">Fill in the submission form via Easychair </a></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What should be included in the proposal document?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your proposal should include your research question, your methodology, what (digital) tools you’ll use, what parts of the Europeana platform you’ll use, a work plan, and any engagements that will form part of your work (speaking, outreach, dissemination engagements or publications).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>What should the work plan contain?</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The work plan will be used to see if the project is feasible and well-thought out in terms of schedule and resource allocation. Submitting a Gantt chart or an equivalent work plan would be preferred. It should contain a clear breakdown of tasks, with the funding allocation spread over those tasks, resulting in a transparent workflow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have a question? Then don't hesitate to send us an e-mail about the Research Grants Programme at<strong> <a href=\"mailto:EuropeanaResearchGrants@europeana.eu\"> EuropeanaResearchGrants@europeana.eu</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"fn1\">1. We don't want to put a strict limit on how long our applicants have been researchers. As long as you can legitimize why you think Europeana funding would help you with your project, or you can explain how you wouldn't be able to find the needed funding for your project in your own institution, we do accept researchers that may in general not be considered 'early career'.\_<a href=\"#ref1\" title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">↩</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Introducing the Rise of Literacy Generic Services project: digitizing Europe’s textual heritage'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Read about our kick off meeting to create text based collections</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Written by <a href=\"mailto:Renata.Solar@nuk.uni-lj.si\">Renata Šolar</a>\_and <a href=\"mailto:Andraz.Magajna@nuk.uni-lj.si\">Andraž Magajna</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 18-19 September 2017, the 13 partners of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">the Rise of Literacy </a>Generic Services project met at Europeana’s offices to discuss our project to create text-based collections to showcase our rich, pan-European history. Making these resources available online and for free, we aim to demonstrate the power of the written word and the impact literacy has had on Europe’s people and societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Broadening the open textual cultural heritage you can find on Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This kick-off meeting brought together all partner institutions (full list below) for the first time since presenting their project proposal to the European Commission’s Generic Services call earlier this year. This initiative was designed to support collaboration around the digitization and enrichment of important cultural heritage, with the goal of making even more high quality and open digital cultural heritage available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this, the Rise of Literacy project proposes to digitize rich textual materials from all partners and enrich material already on Europeana. This new material includes medieval manuscripts from the 4th to 15th century, printed books from the early 16th century until the end of 19th century, and periodicals and newspapers from the 17th to the mid-20th century. The Rise of Literacy will also make use of rich textual material already on Europeana from other providers, where this meets quality criteria (e.g. Tier 2 content). If you have any collections that are relevant to this theme, let us know!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the meeting, we brainstormed the best ways to promote this material to users. This includes high quality curated collections on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\">Europeana Exhibitions</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/\">blogs</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries\">galleries</a> that will draw the expertise of the project partners into one place. We discussed themes (like philosophy and propaganda), their target audiences, value propositions and anticipated reach. Europeana introduced their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/thematic-collections\">thematic collections </a>and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services\">data publication</a> strategies. Importantly, we also discussed how the partners could provide as much open content as possible that could be used by Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do\">priority markets</a> and in particular, by education and research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Beginning is the most important part of the work (Plato)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that you will be able to see the first outputs of our work on the Rise of Literacy in the Spring. Until then, have a lot of work to do. It has been said that no good ending can be expected in the absence of the right beginning. We’re happy to report that this was a great start, so we are looking forward to working together and in bringing Europe’s rich cultural heritage to the world. As <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3137672.David_Petersen\">David Petersen</a> puts it, there is no such thing as a leap into literacy! Rise with us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Alice's adventures in Wonderland\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-09/aliceinwonderland.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/91912/0C1DCBE32155DFA806AF71D3EE19947716DC5FE1.html\">Alice's adventures in Wonderland</a>.

        intro: "<p>Read about the outcomes from 2016 Europeana research grants winner Dr Timothy Duguid, University of Glasgow, UK.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana Research Grants Programme was first launched in 2016 and proved hugely popular. Digital humanities researchers applied with projects that addressed research questions by using Europeana data. The high volume of proposals proved just how important it is to make heritage data available. And the wide variety of ideas showed the depth of potential in Europeana Collections material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/research.europeana.eu/2017-03/duguid.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 193px; float: left; margin: 10px;\">Grants were awarded to three projects, and in this mini blog series, we’re sharing their final reports with you, finding out what they’ve achieved and where they’ll go from here. Our last project is The MuSO Project (Music Scholarship Online), by Dr. Timothy Duguid, University of Glasgow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Download The MuSO Project’s <a href=\"http://research.europeana.eu/files/2017-09/research-grants-final-report-duguid-092017.pdf\">final report</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Music Scholarship Online (MuSO) is a new virtual research environment dedicated to born-digital and digitized scholarship in music. It contributes to the Advanced Research Consortium (ARC), an organization promoting digital scholarship and incorporating increasingly diverse content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project brought together an early modern music and digital humanities scholar, a digital humanities librarian with a degree in vocal studies, a music special collections librarian with a background in jazz, and an alternative academic professional with no prior experience in music, but a wealth of knowledge about aggregation, digital resource discovery, and ARC metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How does it use Europeana Collections?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>18th-century material from the Europeana Music Collection was pulled into the Advanced Research Consortium. This was possible thanks to the fact that over the years, Europeana and partners have worked hard on developing a standardized way of dealing with data. This project generated guidelines - an ‘RDF schema’ - for music content and a way of transferring it - a ‘crosswalk’ - into ARC.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What did the project achieve?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Observations and solutions that the team came across in developing the ‘crosswalk’ will have a more wide-reaching effect on ARC in general, with the MuSO team now able to propose a series of changes to enable it to better incorporate music-related data while also enhancing its existing content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the development of the RDF schema and crosswalk, the material from the Europeana Music Collection was successfully ingested into 18thConnect - an online portal for 18th century digital scholarly resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s the future of the project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As the project transitions to another stage of development the team will continue to explore questions raised by this first stage. Questions such as: If we craft our discovery tools to reflect the ways that specific disciplines conduct research, do disciplinary boundaries necessarily mean that each discipline needs its own schema? Do these tensions mean that literary studies and music studies are fundamentally different? Or can a schema, especially a schema that relies on existing vocabularies and links to existing datasets, help humanists approach a satisfying global schema for digital cultural objects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team will continue to work with the ARC community to establish workflows for evaluating and curating multidisciplinary digitized and born-digital content. They will also bring the whole of the Europeana Music Collection together with other digitized collections and born-digital content from around the world, in an effort to provide scholars with a portal for discovering high-quality music scholarship and resources: MuSO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-research-grant-winners-tim-duguid\">explore an earlier interview</a>\_on this project and\_<a href=\"https://muso.arts.gla.ac.uk/index.html\">visit the project website</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>In the first of our 'open culture' blog mini-series, let's start by seeing\_what open culture means to members of the Europeana Network Association.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We’re now running up to one of our most important events of the year - the Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (6 December - <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-network-association-agm-2017-tickets-35932193157\">register now</a>!). And to make the most of that, we all need to remind ourselves of what it is we’re doing, why we care about it and why we do it better together. In essence - what is this thing we call ‘open culture’ and what and who is it for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back when the sun was still shining strongly, some members of the Network Association got together in Malta to discuss the use of digital cultural heritage in education. We took that opportunity to corner them with a video camera and ask them what they thought about open culture - because that’s what’s at the heart of everything Europeana strives for on behalf of the people and cultural institutions of Europe. Here’s what they said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/230752047\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/230752047\">What is open culture?</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does open culture mean to you? Tweet us @europeanaeu with #openculture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This video formed part of a global perspective on open culture that we presented with the Open Education Consortium on the <a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\">Year of Open</a>\_website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Video transcript:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture is I think culture that’s accessible for everybody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture is the sea of possibilities but you really need to know what you are looking for in that ocean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture for me is the future of learning and equality in learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With open culture, I understand culture that’s not imposed from above, but it’s also a process of democratization, it’s the culture of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, it has a legal connotation so open culture is culture that you can use, that you can reuse and you can share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have storage spaces full of objects that people never knew about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to get great quality out there. We want to make our collections, that we are so devoted to in our museum, or any museum, available to anybody who wants or needs them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is really a chance to make it accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re completely 100% sure of the benefit to society of such projects and such approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think you would need to start also young by exposing students to culture so that later on, they will pay that back in a way, they will go to museums if they are familiar with museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open educational resources are a key factor in this sense, they provide vast material to make this change happen and to enrich teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objects themselves, they don’t tell you much. You need context, you need help to open it up. To make connections. To tell stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s not that easy to work with digital materials. I mean, digital objects are having different opportunities. So you really need to provide new kinds of skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that policymakers, policies and public institutions have to give the way to give an access of the materials, the resources, the cultural resources for all and especially for pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internet is full of low-quality materials with mistakes. That’s why well-curated websites with educational materials are very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We really need to discuss copyright. It’s complicated even for lawyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to make an effort for educators to understand what they can do and what they can’t do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because without knowledge about copyright, you can not use digital objects in an interesting creative way without consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are continuously competing and bombarded by the pressures of sustainability, financial sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best case scenario - all the curators, in all the museums, all the libraries all across Europe or all over the world have dedicated themselves to 20 hours a week just to digitize their collections. And once they’re online with good metadata, and linked open data with highly organized metadata in terms of connecting to other collections, their collections can go out into the big world wide web and be available to everybody.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Discussing Digital Strategies for Cultural Heritage Institutions at the Frankfurt Book Fair</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>A digital strategy should no longer be an add-on for any organisation. A modern cultural heritage institution needs to operate on three platforms: the building, online and its network, creating opportunities to learn, share and participate. In this way, it can be a centre of learning and civic life. A multifaceted destination that attracts, educates, and inspires people through participation. Its audiences are partners and collaborators, true stakeholders in its future, its content, its impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living in the age of participatory culture is a challenge that our museums, libraries, archives and audio-visual collections are having to rise to. They were conceived as top-down institutions whereas innovation tends to come from the bottom up. From individuals solving problems, from communities wanting to change and participate, to take ownership of their culture. Making use of this eager volunteer network, keeping it engaged has to be integral to the three platforms.

        posttype: News

        intro: "<p>Continuing our mini series on 'open culture', with an interview with Jill Cousins, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/open-culture-cultural-heritage-professionals-tell-us-why-we-should-open-up-glam-collections\">first blog</a>, we found out\_what Europeana Network Association members think about the topic of open culture. Now let’s hear from the person who’s been at the helm of Europeana since its very beginning. Here’s Jill Cousins, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, on why open culture is always in her heart and mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/230736351\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/230736351\">What is open culture? Interview with Jill Cousins</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does open culture mean to you? Tweet us @europeanaeu with #openculture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This video formed part of a global perspective on open culture that we presented with the Open Education Consortium on the<a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\"> Year of Open</a> website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Video transcript:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture is important to me for many reasons, probably mainly because I really do believe that it has the power to transform the world. I think Jean Monet, one of the architects of the European Union, was right when he was looking back and he said, ‘If I had to do it again, I would start with culture’. It feeds, from my point of view, our souls and creativity, which will lead to wealth creation and a stable Europe. And the more we understand of each other, the better we can work together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original purpose of Europeana was to showcase Europe’s patrimony, to prevent an Anglicization of the web and to do this and to do it across borders, the material has to be open. For it to be able to work in education, in the creative industries or in research, it needs to be unfettered by secondary rights, if you like. Not those of the original creator anyway. Some things in copyright should be respected by means of paying the creator but adding more rights because you are the holding institution of the material adds a barrier to access.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’d like the future of open culture to be that we make sure every child in every school was able to access it. They are the creators of our future so rich inspiration will produce rich imaginations. And more Leonardo da Vincis, Mozarts, Baudelaires and the like. But we need to make the world of education aware that there is this incredible, rich resource available to them and in reverse, we need to make sure that the cultural heritage institutions are responding to the needs of the world, and particularly, those of education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As a manager with a strong Library and Archives background, I believe in the interoperability of data, but also of teams and skills. People are always more connected to cultural content, but not willing to pay for culture. My goal is to encourage the sharing of skills and actions towards ‘niche’ communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The teamwork behind digitization\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I currently work for the University of Bordeaux, as a library curator. I am heading up a small team responsible for historical and rare collections. The University was created in 1441 and some of our old books date from that time. We have <a href=\"http://bibliotheques.u-bordeaux.fr/Les-bibliotheques/Patrimoine-documentaire/Fonds-documentaires-patrimoniaux\">collections of rare books</a> as well as <a href=\"http://bibliotheques.u-bordeaux.fr/Les-bibliotheques/Patrimoine-documentaire/Archives-et-manuscrits\">archives and manuscripts</a>. Of course, this includes a digitization process. We have our own digital library, <a href=\"http://www.babordnum.fr/\">Babordnum</a>, which is harvested by other portals (Gallica for instance) and mostly driven by the needs of local research. One of the most interesting aspects of these projects is team work: researchers with history skills have to speak with librarians with cataloguing tasks and computer scientists or operators in the digitization processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Opening up archival records</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I formerly worked for the <a href=\"https://francearchives.fr/\">French Archives</a> (Archives de France). And here is some good news for the Open Data community: in 2017, we opened several million archival records in Encoded Archival Description, with an open license,<a href=\"https://francearchives.fr/fr/open_data\"> as described here</a>. They include a dozen partners, and more are on their way. From 2009 to 2013, I was a Curator at <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">the French national Library</a> (BnF), as head of the BnF's<a href=\"http://data.bnf.fr\"> Linked Open Data project</a> which received the Stanford Prize for innovation in Research Libraries in 2013. This project brought together data automatically extracted from catalogues (MARC), archives (EAD) and digital resources (DC). Data.bnf.fr gathers descriptive information, and links directly to online catalogues and digital documents. The first goal of the project is to make the information compliant with the ‘semantic web’ standards, by providing persistent identifiers for the resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Usual cataloguing and innovative trends</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During previous roles, I also worked on the curation of an antique weapon collection (Clermont-Ferrand, 2006), the cataloguing of Jean-Martin Charcot's collection of rare books (UPMC, Paris, 2007), the record management for the Public Transport services of Paris (RATP, 2007), and on the European Library application profile (The Hague, 2009). I first got in touch with Europeana as an intern in 2009. Back then, the technologies were not as stable as they are today. \_But the benefits of digitization were more obvious: everybody wanted to put content online. In a way, it has become harder to digitize new content, because digitization in itself is not so innovative. But we need to keep bringing new content online. Lots of our documents are not, and sometimes they are not even properly described. Currently, the issue of data quality is critical, and our digitization programs have been relying on the quality of the cataloguing work that was done in the past decades. We have a lot of ‘usual’ cataloguing to do if we want to improve our digital libraries, as much as we have to keep identifying trends.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet Elisabeth Niggemann, elected Chairman of Europeana Foundation'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We are delighted to announce that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/elisabeth-niggemann\">Elisabeth Niggemann</a>, Director General of <a href=\"http://www.dnb.de/DE/Home/home_node.html\">Deutsche Nationalbibliothek</a>, was elected as the new Chair of the Europeana Foundation on 28 September 2017, taking over from <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/person/jan-muller\">Jan Müller</a>.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Elisabeth was the first chair of the Europeana Foundation between 2007 and 2011, launching and consolidating Europeana. Her election comes at a significant moment in the development of Europeana towards procurement, its new funding mechanism under the current European Commission’s multiannual financial framework. She will lead the Board of the Foundation towards fulfilling the great promise of all-embracing access to cultural heritage, with determination and, in her own words, vision for a sustainable Europeana which <em>‘shares our rich and diverse common heritage, preserves this heritage for future generations, protects the interests of European creators, nurtures creativity, contributes to education and spurs innovation and entrepreneurship.</em>’ Elisabeth is a co-author of <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-11-17_en.htm\">The New Renaissance</a> a report of the ‘<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/comit%C3%A9-des-sages-calls-new-renaissance-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-online\">Comité des Sages</a>’ on Bringing Europe's Cultural Heritage Online. We are excited to welcome her back and work together with her for wider access to culture and knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth has led the German National Library as Director General since 1999. The German National Library is one of the main pillars to the <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/?lang=en\">Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek</a> (DDB) and host to the service desk and the project coordination. Being an important national contribution to realise the shared vision of free access to cultural heritage, the DDB is an important partner to Europeana. Both already co-operate in many fields. In 2010 Elisabeth was a member of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/comit%C3%A9-des-sages-calls-new-renaissance-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-online\">Comité des Sages</a>. She is currently a member of the <a href=\"http://www.cenl.org/\">Conference of European National Librarians</a> which she chaired between 2005 and 2011. She was a member of the <a href=\"https://www.oclc.org/en/about/leadership.html\">OCLC Board of Trustees </a>from 2005 to 2012. She \_is also an editor of the <a href=\"http://zfbb.thulb.uni-jena.de/receive/jportal_jpjournal_00000014\">Zeitschrift für Bibliothekswesen und Bibliographie</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth succeeds Jan Müller, former CEO of Beeld en Geluid and former President of FIAT/IFTA, who is now leading the <a href=\"https://www.nfsa.gov.au/\">National Film and Sound Archive of Australia</a>. Jan’s contributions to Europeana have been remarkable. We thank him for being a leader in our mission. Jan will remain an ambassador for Europeana and will support and promote Europeana from afar.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Teaching Migration: six actions to make cultural heritage fit for education'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>‘Teaching migration’ was an important and timely theme for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/migration-and-culture-how-can-our-past-educate-our-present\">Europeana strategy meeting </a>scheduled during the Maltese Presidency in May 2017. Bringing migration into the classroom is fraught with many difficulties, not least defining what migration is and the differing national reactions to the crisis.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Choosing migration as a case study</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana used the topic of migration as a case study for several reasons. Firstly, to explore how it can be used as an examplar for what educators mean when they ask for “fit for purpose cultural heritage”. Secondly, to explore what materials are needed to tackle this subject in class. Lastly, to demonstrate how Europeana, ministries of Culture and Education, and cultural heritage institutions can help them teach with more resources of higher quality, and with the nuance that can be provided by history, society, and culture. As a result of the meeting, we present six actions that build on the 2015 <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">Europeana for Education Recommendations. </a>T<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">h</a>e<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">y</a> a<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\">i</a>m<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-for-education-policy-recommendations\"> </a>to create better access for educators to all types of migration-relevant digital educational material held in our cultural heritage institutions. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying actions to implement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During our meeting, representatives from ministries of Culture and Education, cultural heritage institutions, the education sector and Europeana discussed best practice examples of migration being addressed by the use of culture and heritage in formal and non-formal educational settings. These <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/jamdots\">six identified actions</a>\_relate to funding, resource gaps and the need for best practice guidelines, co-created search vocabularies, increased digitisation, more content made available for educational reuse, and the creation of learning resources and cohesive collaboration among all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"900\" src=\"//jamdots.nl/view/311/Europeana---Migration---Culture\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><em>Visual by JAM Visual Thinking - CC-BY-SA</em>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The actions therefore present a model that can be used not only for the topic of ‘migration’ but for almost any subject area. If we get educational access to the subject of migration right, we can apply it for other topics and improve the use of digital cultural heritage by education. As next steps to these actions, Europeana will facilitate networking and collaboration between the players by introducing processes and developing communities through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/education\">Europeana Education</a>. Europeana will also encourage and share best practice, and track and record the implementation of these actions through the measures the ministries, cultural heritage institutions and educators take in each Member State across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are hoping for the full participation of all relevant stakeholders to affirm a strong commitment to implementation of these actions.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Fostering Digital Humanities projects in the Dutch heritage sector'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The<a href=\"https://www.kb.nl/en\"> National Library of the Netherlands</a>, in cooperation with the University Libraries of Leiden and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, take\_a page out of the international promotion of Digital Humanities projects in libraries and archives with crash courses on digitization and its applications through <a href=\"https://dhclinics.github.io/\">Digital Humanities Clinics</a>. Inspired by initiatives likes <a href=\"https://programminghistorian.org/\">the Programming Historian</a> and<a href=\"https://librarycarpentry.github.io/\"> Library Carpentry</a>, they cover theory and practice of digital humanities in libraries with five days of lectures and workshops.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h2>Day 1: Digitization and Databases</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the top floor of the beautiful Utrecht University Library, Uithof, the first DH clinic kicked off with a lecture on digitisation by Marco de Niet (Leiden University Library). He laid bare the opportunities and challenges of digitizing cultural heritage in the context of the Dutch heritage sector. Not only is there a huge backlog of un-digitized cultural heritage, but little effort has been taken to preserve the huge influx of born-digital cultural objects within the Netherlands. On top of that, almost 50% of digitized objects are kept in-house or are inaccessible due to copyright claims. De Niet explained the need to at least make the metadata produced by cultural heritage institutions freely accessible, as well as focusing on user-centred cataloguing and design. The second lecture, given by Marnix van Berchum (Utrecht University, Huygens ING), drilled down into the specifics of using databases in a library setting. His talk served as an introduction to what databases are, what kinds exist, and how they can be used to digitize cultural heritage. Accompanying his talk was a hands-on workshop 'SQL for librarians', an introduction to SQL using SQLite. This workshop used the lesson package provided by<a href=\"http://data-lessons.github.io/library-sql/\"> Library Carpentry</a>, which provides several different lesson packages for training and re-training library staff for digital humanities work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Attend one of the DH Clinics</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the background knowledge the DH Clinics provide, librarians and other players in the cultural heritage sector are better prepared to develop and maintain DH projects within their own institution. The clinics are completely free of charge, but there's a maximum number of participants. If the clinic you want to attend is fully booked, be sure to put yourself on the waiting list, since often people cancel a few days before the session, and the organizers try to limit the number of people that attend from the same affiliation. All information on the DH clinics can be found<a href=\"http://dhclinics.github.io/\"> Here</a>. Be sure to follow the discussion on Twitter with the hashtag #dhclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By Jolan Wuyts</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><em><a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/sessions/unchartered-territory-land-ahoy/\">Unchartered Territory</a> </em>is a special session at <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/\">THE ARTS+</a> Salon on 11 October (10:30am-12:00pm), as part of the Frankfurt Book Fair. It will focus on what the cultural sector and publishers can learn from thought leaders and pioneers about fitting digital into their strategy. The speakers are from world-renowned cultural heritage institutions and will discuss digital transformation in museums and libraries with journalist Michael Gubbins (Sampomedia). \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Cultural heritage institutions should probably not only focus on their digital strategy, but also create integrated experiences for their visitors which fully incorporate today’s participation culture. The session hopes to inspire some new business models that make full use of the building, online channels and an ever increasing network of friends. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This highly interactive session will look at how to develop an integrated strategy and the opportunities that digitization and new technologies provide, such as reaching new audiences, creating new experiences, and making our cultural content count in society. See the full agenda <a href=\"https://app.slidebean.com/p/vAGhEP2SfR/-Uncharted-Territory\">in this slidebean</a>. The session will be followed by a Q&amp;A. The most promising approaches and results of the event will be published on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Pro</a> and by THE ARTS+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unchartered Territory will share the work and knowledge of experts and major European cultural heritage organizations. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pier-luigi-sacco-1\">Pier Luigi Sacco</a> (IULM University Milan, Culture 3.0) and Michael Edson (UNLive – museum of the United Nations) will discuss participation strategies to engage people in culture and sustainable development goals for the good of society. Reinhard Altenhöner (Berlin State Library, Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/saskia-scheltjens\">Saskia Scheltjens </a>(Rijkmuseum) and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-antje-schmidt\">Antje Schmidt</a> (Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg) will be sharing case studies from their libraries and museums at different stages of implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event is organized by Europeana for THE ARTS+. Jill Cousins, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, says: <em>‘Living in the age of participatory culture is a challenge that our museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections are having to rise to. They were conceived as top-down institutions whereas innovation tends to come from the bottom up. Unchartered Territory looks at new ways of working as inspiration for how to move from bricks to bricks and online, where the power of people interacting with our cultural heritage is mobilized.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wed 11 October 2017, 10:00am – 12:00pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE ARTS+ Salon, Hall 4.1, Frankfurt Book Fair, Ludwig-Erhard-Anlage 1, 60327 Frankfurt am Main</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Free to attend, and visitors can register <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/workshop-digital-strategies-for-museums-and-cultural-institutions-tickets-38143061925\">online</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDS<br><br>\r\nMedia contacts:</strong><br><br>\r\nCamille Tenneson - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Camille.Tenneson@europeana.eu<br><br>\r\nEleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu<br><br><em><strong>Notes for the editor:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Europeana</strong> is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

        intro: "<p>The newest publication in Routledge's 'Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities' Series.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Title: Cultural Heritage Infrastructure in Digital Humanities<br>\r\nPublisher: Routledge<br>\r\nSeries: Digital Research in the Arts and Humanities<br>\r\neditors: Agiati Benardou, Erik Champion, Costis Dallas, Lorna Hughes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the leading tools and archives in digital cultural heritage? How can they be integrated into research infrastructures to better serve their intended audiences? In this book, authors from a wide range of countries, representing some of the best research projects in digital humanities related to cultural heritage, discuss their latest findings, both in terms of new tools and archives, and how they are used (or not used) by both specialists and by the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work is of special interest to Europeana Research since three out of the four editors of the book actively contribute to Europeana by being members of the Europeana Research Advisory Board. Furthermore, chapter 10 of this publication is called \"From Europeana Cloud to Europeana Research: Tools, Users and Methods\", and was written by Agiati Benardou and Alastair Dunning.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the description of the chapter:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>This chapter presents Europeana Cloud, a Best Practice Network coordinated by the Europeana Foundation, which aims at setting the foundations and building Europeana Research, a platform allowing third parties to develop tools and services based on Europeana content. Through a collaborative, user-centred and a mixed methods approach, we have tried to identify the needs of researchers in the fields of the Humanities and the Social Sciences, while attempting to actively engage various sub-disciplines in the course of our work.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We're very proud to see this foundational work for Europeana Research appear in this publication, collaboratively written by members of Europeana's network.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'GIF IT UP is back: throughout October, turn cultural heritage into GIFs!'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>GIF IT UP 2017 is on and we’ve already received first entries. Learn more about the fourth edition of the international GIF competition, and get inspired!</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>GIF - the language of the web</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format ) is the second most popular image format used on the Internet after JPEG. While GIFs have been around for about 30 years, the trend became very popular in 2010s, together with the rise of social media - especially Tumblr. Oxford Dictionary even named the GIF the <a href=\"https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/word-of-the-year/word-of-the-year-2012\">Word of the Year </a>in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they’re easy to use and universally supported, GIFs are everywhere. They are used to compliment conversations, convey reactions, show important moments from pop-culture and illustrate things in a quick and simple way (at Europeana, for example, we used GIFs to explain <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/europeana-l4q8jWtZs6b6v7bcQ\">tagging</a> on Europeana Radio). But they’re becoming an artform as well. \_And no need to be a master: creating a GIF is quick and simple- there are are plenty of online tools and apps making it possible to create a GIF in a few clicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using GIFs special\_power to spread all over social media to populate the Internet with cultural heritage, openly licensed content and creativity seemed like a great idea. And we’re so happy that <a href=\"https://dp.la\">DPLA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.digitalnz.org\">DigitalNZ </a>came up with it in 2014. Since then, GIF IT UP has been a yearly highlight for all GIF-­makers, creatives, history nuts, animators, and lovers of the internet. Our partnership with GIPHY, the biggest online database and search engine helps spread the word: GIF IT UP has its own <a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifitup\">GIPHY Channel</a> that exposes the participants’ creations to millions. It’s also very easy to share them on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Slack and many more social networks and pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/l3vR4bb6QGjfovCoM\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/gifitup-water-woman-l3vR4bb6QGjfovCoM\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GIFted participants</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the main idea remains the same: \_making the best GIFs from openly licensed cultural heritage material - every year we like to try new things. In 2016, we asked participants to create GIFs from artworks submitted by EU Member States for the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/art-history/Europeana280.html\">Europeana 280 campaign</a>. This year, we focus on first-time GIF-makers. We created a special prize for them. In this category, the jury will focus on content selection and originality of the idea rather than technical execution. To help the first-timers create their first entries, we’ll publish a series of tutorials presenting basic GIF-making techniques. The first one, showing how to make a GIF from vintage newsreels from <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision\">Dutch Institute for Sound &amp; Vision</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/10/make-a-gif-from-a-vintage-video/\">is already available</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we’re always happy to see the returning participants, some of them professional animators and mixed media artists and their little masterpieces. No matter the skill level, we’re always impressed by the enthusiasm and creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We love to read about the participants’ content choices - some of them decide to animate their favourite artworks:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“The potato eaters has always been my favorite artwork.[...] It was my pleasure to create my first GIF with this artwork… ( A hot potato has been included to add some fun)”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>María Rocío Moreiras Plaza</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others just browse until they find an image that speaks to them:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Having at your disposal all of these free to use images is a Max Ernst’s dream come true. I just browsed the collections at random, and worked on whatever gave me the right feeling.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gualtiero Bertoldi</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A feast for openly licensed content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in GIF IT UP, people have to use an openly licensed piece of content from Europeana Collections, DPLA, <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au\">Trove</a> or DigitalNZ. This is a perfect opportunity for our organizations to showcase the materials we give access to and feature our partner institutions and their collections. We’ve created a list of resources and we promote specific collections on social media. It’s been great to see that artworks from our newest partner institution, \_<a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/09/the-mauritshuis-arrives-in-europeana/\">the Mauritshuis</a>, were used in two GIFs in the days following the kickoff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"462\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3o7aCQODYj8KVXCqUE\" width=\"480\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/gifitup-europeana-gifitup2017-3o7aCQODYj8KVXCqUE\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we plan to feature partner museums, libraries and archives through the month, we loved the initiative of <a href=\"https://wellcomelibrary.org/\">the Wellcome Library</a> (one of the favourite sources of content in the previous editions) recommending their <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/search?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=permission&amp;q=Mauritshuis\">GIF-ready content available on Europeana</a>, that’s the spirit!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>We have many images <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@europeanaeu</a> you can use for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/gifitup2017?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gifitup2017</a> -read all about it! <a href=\"https://t.co/89SwjQaMPk\">https://t.co/89SwjQaMPk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BXmUawyUO0\">pic.twitter.com/BXmUawyUO0</a></p>\r\n— Wellcome Library (@WellcomeLibrary) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WellcomeLibrary/status/915551534611607553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2017</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>So, would \_pieces from your institution’s collection available on Europeana, DPLA, DigitalNZ and Trove make great GIF-materials? Let us know, and we'll feature it on social media!</p>\r\n"

The first step in this endeavour is the definition of generic principles that CHIs and researchers could both adhere to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The present survey aims at gathering feedback from the various communities of interest as to the relevance of the proposal made by the engaged institutions and projects.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On the occasion of the centenary of WWI and as part of <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en/explore\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, we challenged Wikimedia affiliate organisations to create a portfolio of their activities related to 1914-1918. 13 Wikimedia affiliates from across the continent took part in this <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18\">Wikimedia 1914-18 Europeana Challenge</a>. Each of their portfolios demonstrated the potential of open-access heritage to help understand European history through diverse, innovative and qualitative projects.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We are now proud to announce the winners:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>best Partnership project with a Europeana partner - <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_Romania\">Wikimedians of Romania</a>. Wikimedians of Romania have also been awarded the overall prize for best portfolio in this challenge.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>most Innovative project - <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_%C3%96sterreich\">Wikimedia Austria</a>;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>most Diverse portfolio of projects - <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_UK\">Wikimedia UK</a>;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>highest Quality produced - <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_Norge\">Wikimedia Norway</a>;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Special mentions also went to <a href=\"https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipeedia:GLAM/Europeana_1914-18/EN\">Wikimedia Estonia</a> for its innovative use of the Wikipedia platform to curate a multilingual virtual art exhibition; to <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_Italia\">Wikimedia Italy</a> for the quality and diversity of the content produced; and to <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_CH\">Wikimedia Switzerland</a> for its detailed and beautifully produced portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Best Partnership project with a Europeana partner: \_Wikimedians of Romania</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_Romania\">Romanian Wikimedia community</a> ran a Wikisource/Transcribathon project; uploaded Wikimedia Commons from Europeana 1914-18 crowdsourced material; and contributed their own material to the Europeana 1914-18 platform. They also entered the <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/\">Europeana Transcribathon</a> as a 'team'; and improved the categorisation and Wikipedia usage of Europeana 1914-18 material which had already been shared. This impressive portfolio was created by an entirely volunteer team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Măcreanu Iulian, Coordinator of the Wikimedians of Romania portfolio, said: '<em>We have been working for more than three years on developing a project dedicated to the participation of Romania in the First World War. [With this competition] we discovered that Europeana had a huge amount of valuable resources that we could easily use and bring to a new level. We learnt that it was easy to develop similar projects both on Wikipedia and Europeana, as they are very complementary.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Most Innovative project: Wikimedia Austria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" Edit-a-thon des Lehrgangs WS 2015 \" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/editathon.jpg%20\" style=\";\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Editathon_-_Uni_Wien_Lehrgang_Schipper_Oktober_2015-0728.jpg\"><em>Edit-a-thon des Lehrgangs WS 2015 - Propaganda: Bis zum ersten Weltkrieg, Dr. Schipper. Universität Wien, Institut für Publizistik und Kommunikationswissenschaften</em> <em>by Hubertl (2015) CC BY-SA 4.0</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming first in the ‘most innovative project’ category is <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_%C3%96sterreich\">Wikimedia Austria’s portfolio.</a> Based on a partnership with the education sector, it highlights the use of various media to investigate propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beppo Stuhl from the Wikimedia Austria Board of Trustees explained: <em>‘We felt we could provide a new point of view to the centenary of WWI in writing articles in Wikiversity and Wikipedia about the media and items collected during Europeana 1914-1918 campaign. To get new insights, we partnered with different institutions including museums, libraries and archives as well as the University of Vienna.

The challenge was an opportunity to bring those various projects together and showcase the work we’ve been doing with our partners. We’re proud of how we’ve been able to work with the likes of Bodleian Libraries and the University of Edinburgh to shine a light on aspects of the war which don’t get as much attention.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Highest Quality produced: Wikimedia Norway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury noted that <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1914-18/Wikimedia_Norge\">Wikimedia Norway’s portfolio</a> showed direct engagement with Europeana content (especially through the <a href=\"http://transcribathon.com/en/\">Transcribathon</a> platform), extensive outreach to partners, and hosting of events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astrid Carlsen, Executive Director of Wikimedia Norway, said that this project has led them towards further cultural partnerships: <em>‘We now have experience on transcribing projects, and we are looking into working further with GLAMs and our communities on the topic of 1914-1918.We are currently applying for funding from The Arts Council to run a project aiming to transcribe handwritten descriptions of images from Armenia from around 1915.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wikimedia 1914-18 Europeana Challenge was part of<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/new-recommendations-outline-ways-to-strengthen-europeanas-future\"> Europeana’s long-term strategy</a> to engage the Wikimedia community and integrate Wikimedia content into all our major projects.

        title: 'Introducing Europeana Trusted Bloggers programme: ‘it''s all about making meaningful connections’'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-24f31d77-0ac3-0289-031f-c1ff19faab67\">Europeana is teaming up with bloggers with an interest in arts, culture, history or education to launch the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/europeana-brand/writing-guidelines#trusted-bloggers\">Trusted Blogger programme,</a> Our ambition is to share the content of Europeana Collections with new audiences, and establish long-term engagement with a network of culturally involved bloggers, who, in return, will gain visibility on the landing page of <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections blog</a>.\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/peter-soemers\">Peter Soemers </a>tells us more about this initiative. \_</b></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>What is your experience with blogs, on a personal and professional level?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As an Application Manager working for the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs, culture and blogs are no issue in daily working life. Art, museums, cultural blogs, and Europeana are filling my spare time - I can't have enough of that! I'm writing blog posts myself, but the frequency is so low that I don't dare to call myself a blogger. You can find <a href=\"https://www.tanjapraske.de/author/peter-soemers/\">my posts</a> on <a href=\"http://www.tanjapraske.de\">Kultur-Museum-Talk</a>, hosted by freelance art historian Dr. Tanja Praske. She is always looking for what culture means to people in daily life, and discussing the opportunities social media and the digital world are offering for culture and its dissemination.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the main interest of this programme?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a great common goal, shared by both Europeana and these bloggers: promoting culture and cultural heritage, with a special attention to the opportunities offered online. The bloggers will get to know Europeana Collections and projects. They will get international reach, and access an ocean of free-to-use materials. In getting involved, they are joining forces to promote culture on an European level, and the 'participatory' thinking core to Europeana. I'm convinced their practical experience with the development of digital concepts, and their presence in regional or more specialised communities could contribute a lot to the work done by Europeana. It's all about making meaningful connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you identify the first Trusted bloggers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am acquainted the most with bloggers in Germany and Austria. I invited some of them to take part in a brainstorm meeting at Europeana. We were aiming for a small group of three bloggers from one language area in order to dive deep in barriers and opportunities. It demonstrated the strength of their network throughout Germany and Austria, as many of them suggested potential representants in favour of 'open' and 'digital' cultural heritage. To kick off the programme, we have <a href=\"http://www.kulturtussi.de\">Anke von Heyl</a>, very engaged in art and museums education, <a href=\"http://www.kulturfritzen.wordpress.com\">Anne Aschenbrenner</a>, a cultural journalist, and last but not least historian <a href=\"http://www.moritz-hoffmann.de\">Moritz Hoffmann</a>, advocate of digital Public History and a keen fact checker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/TrustedBlogger.png\" style=\";\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What influence can bloggers have in a culture and arts lovers community?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural bloggers do \_a big deal of essential 'marketing' for cultural heritage and events. The freedom in their personal tone of voice and opinions usually appeals more to readers than matter-of-fact reports or case studies from institutions. It doesn’t mean that we don't need the study; but that we need this sensitive 'translation' to the outside world in order to help people discovering their personal 'taste' for cultural heritage. There is a lot of storytelling about cultural heritage objects on blogs by cultural workers. It makes it much easier to understand what's going on behind the walls of institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Did you have interactions with bloggers that proved to be useful in your involvement with Cultural Heritage Institutions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before using social media and reading blog posts, I was the classical museums visitor, entering the building, looking at the artworks, buying a catalogue and going home. Now, I got acquainted with many museums people and bloggers. I’m engaging not only with artworks, but also with people working in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the<a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/\"> first posts here,</a> and find out more to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/europeana-brand/writing-guidelines#trusted-bloggers\">become a Trusted Blogger yourself!</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Reading the Councillors’ blog posts on Europeana Pro, you will notice that they are all people with a mission, with a passion, and that it always has something to do with publishing and sharing as much information about Europe’s cultural heritage as possible. Well, in that sense, I am not any different.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Putting content quality first</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a historian involved in the <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/\">Archives Portal Europe</a>, one of Europeana’s domain aggregators, I made it my mission to open up the wealth of archival material stored in European archival institutions, making it available online. Both in our own portal for diehard researchers, and in Europeana for anyone who isn’t that familiar with the specific methods archivists use to describe archives and collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/plakkaat.jpeg\" style=\";\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Minuut-plakkaat van de Staten Generaal betreffende de vervallen-verklaring van de koning van Spanje van de overheid over Nederland, Nationaal Archief, Den Haag, Public Domain. On <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048359/providedCHO_1_01_01_01_1_01_01_01___254G\">Europeana</a>, on the <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/NL-HaNA/type/fa/id/1.01.01.01/unitid/1.01.01.01+-+254G\">Archives Portal Europe</a>.\_See also: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Abjuration\">Wikipedia – Act of Abjuration</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been cooperating with the Europeana team since 2008. My focus has always been a rather technical one: getting the information on digitised archival material from European archival institutions published in Europeana in the best possible way. But recently, I realised that this is actually a bit short sighted. Of course, getting content in Europeana in accordance with its technical specifications is an important aspect of our aggregation relation. But for both our endeavors, it’s even more important that the content we give access to can really be put to good use. That’s why I fully supported <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Content%20Strategy.pdf\">Europeana’s new content strategy</a> to go for quality rather than quantity and also why I pushed forward on drafting, discussing and approving a new <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu/images/docs/New_ArchivesPortalEurope_Europeana_Content_Policy_20170426.pdf\">Archives Portal Europe-Europeana content policy</a> within the European archives community, based on this thinking. \_\_\_\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/PublicationOfElectionResults.jpg\" style=\";\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Publication of Election Results, L-Arkivji Nazzjonali Ta' Malta, CC BY-NC-ND.

It’s my firm conviction that a good knowledge of history makes us understand today’s world better. In my opinion, large-scale and free access to information on cultural heritage is very important for a society in general and the European one in particular. Not only to provide impetus for the economy sectors of the creative industry and the information technology, but also to lead to more awareness on what Europe is about, on what topics the current European society is struggling with, and how we can address those and why we should deal with those, simply by providing the right historical context. In that sense, the cultural heritage sector can contribute massively to a reality that is here to stay: the further unification of Europe, by raising awareness about its cultural diversity and identity.<br><br>\r\nFor these reasons, I asked the Archives Portal Europe and Europeana teams to center upcoming campaigns on topics that are currently being debated within Europe. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AllezDemocracy&amp;src=typd&amp;lang=fr\">#AllezDemocracy</a>, started this month with a focus on the history of Democracy in Europe. It will highlight relevant documents from the collections of both portals, and will be promoted via their social media channels. If you share my passion for history and for Europe, then please take part!<br><br>\r\nYou must have figured out by now that I didn’t sign up for the Members Council because I am fond of administrative tasks, far from that actually. I decided to join, and even to sign up for a second term, because I think the Europeana initiative as a whole is an important one, \_with opportunities to really make a difference. It needs every support it can get: if you agree, please join the Europeana network and help us make a difference! \_\_\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The image recognition app Vizgu launches with SMK - The National Gallery of Denmark to provide instant art info'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The National Gallery of Denmark (SMK) collaborated with a group of Danish developers to release <a href=\"http://vizgu.com/#/home\">Vizgu</a>, an app that comes up with related art information - descriptive text and audio - whenever a visitor points his smartphone at an SMK painting. <a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/instant-smk-art-info-theres-an-app-for-that-81a836e17eed\">Jonas Heide Smith</a>, Head of Digital, tells us more about this innovative visitor guide which launched in September.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>What was the museum's role in the development of the app?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have been mostly involved in supplying data and discussing logistics. When we first started talks with Vizgu, they were at the late prototype stage, and were very responsive to our suggestions and requirements. We were the largest ‘content partner’ at the time of launch.<br><br><strong>How many artworks can be seen through the app? What material does it give access to?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty much every single artwork on display at SMK - including sculptures - can be scanned. But the amount of information varies a lot. The most extensively described artworks will have an official image, core metadata, a text description, an audio guide file and links to further info. Oh, and for works without official audio files, you can get a nice robot reading the text, allowing you to keep your eyes on the art. It is only available in English for now, \_as Danish machine readers are not too literate yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/37076173346_5c62d1fa9e_z.jpg\" style=\";\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Jonas Heide Smith, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/gp/jonassmith/dcaF2Y%20(\">Flickr</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All images are stored in the app's database. Are there other content partners involved?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vizgu has also teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.ccandratx.com/en/c1/home.html\">CCA Andratx</a>, a contemporary art center in Mallorca - and they have ongoing talks with other institutions. The data clearly calls for linking, to allow visitors to access other museums’ collections, but the details are still being considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does Vizgu differ from traditional ways of using the museum?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We see it as an opt-in layer which broadens the range of ways to use the museum and its collection. Using your phone, you can choose to study background material while sitting down (instead of standing by a wall), or even bring it home to go in-depth from your couch. It doesn’t change things radically, but it adds a great deal of new flexibility.<br><br><strong>What is the connection between Vizgu and the SMK Open Project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way, the Vizgu collaboration is ‘core’ <a href=\"http://smk.dk/smkopen\">SMK Open</a>. We want to turn the museum into a platform by supplying data for others to use and build upon. And that’s exactly what Vizgu has done. So it wasn’t one of our planned SMK Open products, but it’s exactly the kind of thing\_we’ve been hoping would happen!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Open culture in Australia - an interview with Trove’s Cathie Oats'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/open-culture\">open culture' blog mini-series</a>, we talk to Cathie Oats, Director of Trove, the digital arm of the National Library of Australia.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This is a shortened version of an interview that we presented on the<a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\"> Year of Open</a> website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is open culture important to you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can go anywhere by sitting at your desk. Museums, galleries, archives, libraries and research institutions have provided a new level of access. Not only do I get to think about the most beautiful objects in the world all the time, I get to think about how people would like to find out about them, engage with them and actually use them themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who benefits from open culture and how?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone. It’s not only about people who benefit right now but who is going to benefit in 20, 30 or even 40 years’ time. The week of this interview, it’s <a href=\"http://www.naidoc.org.au/2017-national-naidoc-theme\">Naidoc</a> (National Aborigines and Islanders Day Observance Committee) week in Australia. It’s an opportunity to preserve the recordings of some languages and words that would otherwise be lost. You’ve got the combination of rare items, and an audience who might not usually be able to get to them – all those barriers are taken down when we take an open culture approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us about a successful project using open culture resources?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.nla.gov.au/blogs/trove/2016/01/08/ideas-cross-centuries-and-change-lives\">a photo of a hand</a> carved from whalebone and held together with catgut pulleys, it was made in 1845. Someone in the US found it in Trove and used it in his design for a 3D-printed prosthetic hand that people are now actually making because the designs are open source. We would never have imagined that would happen when the South Australian Museum of Health put that image into Trove. But it has.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Trove and Questacon’s version of The Raptor, inspired by a photograph of a whalebone hand from 1845.\r\n© Trove, National Library of Australia.\r\n\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Raptor_hand_Trove.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s about making connections between people who previously could not be connected. If the item’s behind a table, there’s a barrier between you and it and those connections are much much harder. It’s important for these resources to be freely available so people can make new connections and new discoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the future of open culture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The future is very much I think where the curation activities, traditionally in the hands of institutions, are starting to move more closely to the audience. People are creating and engaging with content in a way that we haven’t imagined. The more that is digitized, the more we are going to be able to make discoveries we had no idea would be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What cultural resources do you like to access online, personally?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m a massive fan of anything that’s digitized books or manuscripts. When they’re online and they’ve been digitized, I can see more in them than when they’re behind glass. That’s a true delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favourite pieces is the <a href=\"http://www.cdu.edu.au/laal/\">Living Archive of Aboriginal Language</a>s. You can explore languages through a map, find language groups and see books and hear reporting in indigenous languages. It’s quite extraordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find Trove on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TroveAustralia\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TroveAustralia\">Facebook</a> and at <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">trove.nla.gov.au</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What does open culture mean to you?

        title: 'Open culture in the USA - an interview with the DPLA’s Franky Abbott'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/open-culture\">open culture' blog mini-series</a>, \_we talk to Franky Abbott, Curation and Education Strategist for the Digital Public Library of America.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This is a shortened version of an interview that we presented on the<a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\"> Year of Open</a> website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is open culture important to you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture enables widespread access to resources that previously required time, money, or geographic proximity to consume. Not only can anyone with an Internet connection access these resources for various kinds of research, they can use these resources to create and inspire new work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who benefits from open culture and how?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the broadest terms, we all benefit from open culture! The kinds of new creative works, commentary, and research it enables benefit our ongoing dialogue about who we are, where we came from, and where we are going.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you tell us about a successful project using open culture resources?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My job is to use open culture resources to tell stories. For our <a href=\"https://dp.la/primary-source-sets\">Primary Source Sets</a>, we work with a team of terrific educators from secondary and college teaching. We select primary sources from DPLA’s contributing institutions that give students important insight into people, places, events, and ideas that are part of their curriculum, like the <a href=\"https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sets/the-transatlantic-slave-trade\">Transatlantic Slave Trade</a> and <a href=\"https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/sets/social-realism\">Social Realism</a>. By asking teachers with expertise in teaching with primary sources to curate open culture resources for this purpose, we are helping a much larger pool of educators and students connect with materials they can use while eliminating time-consuming searching and sorting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of DPLA’s Primary Source Sets, it is important for these materials to be freely available because of their high instructional value as well as teachers’ natural practices of adapting and remixing content to serve the needs of a particular course, unit, or student. It is essential that educators have the flexibility to do this with educational material and open culture allows that to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Joe Conzo, “The Mean Machine performing at street festival, Third Ave. Hub, Bronx, 1981.” Courtesy of Cornell University via ArtStor.\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/DPLA_open_culture.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the future of open culture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Platforms that host open culture resources often favour users with very specific research questions and search experience who are willing and/or expert enough to drill down through a huge quantity of content. I’d love to see the stewards of open culture focus in on organization, metadata for a global audience, subject groupings, storytelling, as ways to remove some of these challenges for users who will be less successful with laborious search and refine methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What cultural resources do you like to access online, personally?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m interested in the ways that open culture resources can give us access to untold stories and underrepresented communities. The <a href=\"http://invisibleaustralians.org/faces/\">Real Face of White Australia/Invisible Australians</a> was one of the projects that got me deeply invested in this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell University has made available a collection of more than <a href=\"http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/hiphop/conzo.html\">7,000 photographs by the American hip hop photographer Joe Conzo</a> that are spectacular. I love those photographs and I’m so grateful that they are available for lots of people to learn from and enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does open culture mean to you?

        title: 'The Playbills of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>The theatrical life of the Croatian capital Zagreb began in the 11th century and lasted, with interruptions, until its professionalization in the Croatian language, when the <em>Leteće diletantsko pozorište</em> (Flying dilettante theatre) from Novi Sad arrived to Zagreb and performed under the name of <em>Domorodno teatralno društvo</em> (Patriotic theatrical society) from 1840 to 1841. From 1844 to 1860, several theatre groups performed theatre productions in the Croatian language. Following the decline of German theatre active in Zagreb since 1780, the first and oldest Croatian national theatre – the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb – was established in 1860.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Department of Theatre Studies (today: the Division for the History of Croatian Theatre of the Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theatre and Music at the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) was established in 1966, the archival records, playbills, and programmes of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb are kept at the Division. All playbills dating from 1870 until today have been organised according to theatre seasons, and most of them are collected in repertoire books (169 books in total).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since some of the playbills from the period between 1840 and 1860 and from the first decade of the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb are kept at the Zagreb City Museum, the Division for the History of Croatian Theatre has also included the playbills from this museum in the digitization project. Since the beginning of digitization in 2009, all playbills dating from the 5th of September 1840 to the 10th of January 1912 have been digitized – 8,503 playbills in total. The playbills are provided with metadata and deposited in the DIZBI collection. The digitization of the playbills continues, and further 500 playbills are being prepared for processing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is well known that contemporary theatre studies consider playbills primary theatrical sources, and that not many theatres have their entire collection of playbills preserved. Playbills are not only reminders of theatre productions and theatre artists, but also documents of considerable social, cultural, historical, and political value, since they reveal information on the production numbers, the theatrical genres, and the response of theatre audience, as well as the relationship of one national theatre culture towards other nations and cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DIZBI collection also includes four books of theatre repertoires – <em>Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta</em>, compatible with the digitized playbills:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Hećimović, Branko, pr. i ur. (1990.), <em>Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta</em> <em>1840/1860/1980</em>, knj. 1, Globus, JAZU, Zagreb.</li>\r\n    <li>Hećimović, Branko, pr. i ur. (1990.), <em>Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta 1840/1860/1980</em>, knj. 2, Globus, JAZU, Zagreb.</li>\r\n    <li>Hećimović, Branko, pr. i ur. (2002.), <em>Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta</em>, knj. 3, Hrvatska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti, AGM, Zagreb.</li>\r\n    <li>Ljubić, Lucija; Petranović, Martina (2012.), <em>Repertoar hrvatskih kazališta</em>, knj. 5 – Deskriptivna obrada važnijih predstava na hrvatskom jeziku i izvedbi na stranim jezicima hrvatskih izvođača do 1840. godine, HAZU, AGM, Zagreb.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>This collection of digitized playbills has been delivered by The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU) to Europeana with over 7,300 playbills available for use under a Public Domain license.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact the institution at: teatar@hazu.hr</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Open culture in India - an interview with the National Digital Library of India’s Dr Partha Pratim Das'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/open-culture\">open culture' blog mini-series</a>, we talk to\_Dr Partha Pratim Das, Joint Principal Investigator, National Digital Library Project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This is a shortened version of an interview that we presented on the<a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\"> Year of Open</a> website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is open culture important to you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To be a true Indian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because I believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are groomed in the spirit of our millenniums-old lessons of Upanishad (उपनिषद) and Gita (श्रीमद् भगवद्गीता). Hence we believe in वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् – the whole world is our family. To quote:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>अयं निजो परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम्।</p>\r\n\r\n<p>उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्॥</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The small-minded count ‘this is mine and that is someone else’s’;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the men of great character, the whole world is their family!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do believe – knowledge is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Quote from Dr Partha Pratim Das - 'Open culture is going to be the lifeline of human existence on the planet'\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Pratim_Das.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who benefits from open culture and how?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>India is a country of diversity – several languages, varied and rich culture, multitude of religious and political faiths, wide geographic and climatic conditions, deep economic disparity – yet we are united, we are together, we are one nation, we have many ‘Bharat’s; but one India. We share our openness with the world beyond the geographic and political boundaries of our nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you tell us about a successful project using open culture resources?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital initiatives of India in Education, in general; and National Digital Library of India, NPTEL Videos, and SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) Programs (India’s MOOCs), in particular. Besides being freely available to the whole of India, these are now open to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"SWAYAM home page\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/SWAYAM.PNG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the\_<a href=\"https://swayam.gov.in/\">SWAYAM</a>\_home page</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To democratize education for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India with its large population, diverse geography and socio-economic disparities, requires that resources like educational material to be affordable and accessible. Only with democratization of resources can the population achieve their intrinsic potential. What is the future of open culture?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the future of open culture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open culture is going to be the lifeline of human existence on the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I had all the powers, I would set up an Open World University and promote open culture as a means of survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India, we have believed in open culture since time immemorial. Rabindranath Tagore set up Visva-Bharati University in 1921 for the communion of the world with India. \_Given all powers, I would build a Visva-Bharati in every corner of the globe and attempt to solve all conflict of humanity through open dialogue and mutual cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What cultural resources do you like to access online, personally?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>World cinema, world dance, and world heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is impractical to attempt to list, but I like…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gandhi Heritage Portal: <a href=\"https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/\">https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances for the Gods: <a href=\"http://www.dancingforthegods.org/\">http://www.dancingforthegods.org/</a> – an interactive multimedia website dedicated to Bharatanatyam, one of India’s oldest and best-loved classical dance forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Society for Natural Language Technology Research: <a href=\"http://www.nltr.org/\">http://www.nltr.org/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does open culture mean to you?

        title: 'Open culture in the Netherlands - an interview with the National Library of the Netherlands’ Martijn Kleppe'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/open-culture\">open culture' blog mini-series</a>, we talk to\_Martijn Kleppe, advisor for Digital Scholarship &amp; International Relations at the National Library of the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a shortened version of an interview that we presented on the<a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/\"> Year of Open</a> website in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is open culture important to you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a society we share so much richness that is expressed through our culture. It is incredibly challenging and rewarding to bring this richness to people in a way they did not expect or experience before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Quote from Martijn Kleppe\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Martijn_Troelstra.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who benefits from open culture and how?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both academic researchers and humanities scholars are always looking for data that is preferably openly available. Humanities scholars use this data to undertake their research, computer scientists to train their algorithms. This range of applications of open culture, from citizens who use it for their hobby up to high-ranked professors, to me truly shows the power and added value of open culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you tell us about a successful project using open culture resources?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year we organize a <a href=\"http://hackalod.com/\">hackathon</a>. This year, a programmer developed something that eventually became the <a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/tool/kb-lab-bot\">KB Lab Bot</a>, a Facebook Messenger Chatbot that allows you to search and retrieve digital cultural objects from the Dutch website <a href=\"http://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/en\">Memory of the Netherlands</a>. But we also built an open source CMS that allows other cultural heritage institutes to build their own chatbots.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why is it important for these resources to be available freely?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially in today’s world, where groups in society tend to be opposite to each other, I truly think culture in general can play a mediating role by showing the (historical) values we share.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the future of open culture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We should find ways to bring collections to the daily lives of people. Imagine everyday I read the news on a website. In the article, a photo is included of a building. By clicking on the photo, I will automatically get to see historical images of the building as stored in a museum, maps of the building as stored in a national archive and historical newspapers containing news of that location as stored in libraries. I will not have to leave my daily routine but am offered open culture collections during my daily visit to a single website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What cultural resources do you like to access online, personally?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One I like a lot and literally use about a dozen times a day is the <a href=\"http://www.art-tab.eu/\">Art Up Your Tab Chrome Extension</a>. It is such a great idea to bring cultural resource literally to everyone’s desk (top).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is your favourite piece of digitized culture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pieter Jelles Troelstra is well-known for his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Week_(Netherlands)\">failed attempt</a> to start a socialist revolution in 1918. In textbooks, this photo is almost always used to illustrate that revolution. However, researching my dissertation, I discovered this photo was not taken in 1918 but in 1912. Once I obtained a high-res scan of the file I read the texts on the leaflet at the bottom of the photograph: Algemeen Kiesrecht (Universal suffrage). Only then I realized this photo could be of a completely different revolution than the one it was always used for until then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Photograph of Troelstra\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Troelstra.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/iisg/4071852722\">Troelstra spreekt demonstranten toe tijdens de tweede Rode Dinsdag op 17 september 1912</a>.’ Photograph: Cornelis Leenheer.

        title: 'Introducing the Impact Playbook: the cultural heritage professionals’ guide to assessing your impact'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Do you need to demonstrate the impact of your work? Are you curious to know what effect it has on people’s lives, and how the daily activities of your museum, library or archive contribute to create that change? Are you looking for tools to help you measure it? If you’ve found yourself asking these questions, we’ve got just the thing to help you out.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Why impact matters</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe the cultural heritage sector can increase the change it brings about in people's lives by learning how to manage its impact. This requires that we develop a common language to talk about impact, about how we express our critical contribution to society. The Impact Playbook is a stepping stone towards our vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/238533045\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/238533045\">Introducing: Impact Playbook</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A step by step guide created collaboratively</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This Playbook has been developed by cultural heritage and impact professionals to guide you through the process of identifying the impact that your cultural heritage institutions has, or is aiming to have. It provides a common approach that can be applied throughout the cultural heritage sector. In this release, the Playbook explores the first phase of undertaking an impact assessment. It is divided into six steps, each one focusing on a clear goal and outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplying the right tools and resources in one place</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To get started you’ll need a positive attitude and a desire to understand the impact of your work, and let the playbook guide you through the rest. All of the tools and resources referenced in the playbook can be downloaded so that you can use them with your own institution. We have provided examples from our own experience with Europeana projects, and will add more as we learn about them from the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017\">growing Impact community</a> of cultural heritage professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds good, right? Check out the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact?utm_source=Pro%20Blog&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Impact%20Playbook%20launch&amp;utm_content=Playbook%20launch%20blog\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Playbook</a>!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana at THE ARTS+ 2017: from insights into digital cultural transformation to new creative experiences'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>From 11 to 15 October, Europeana joined cultural institutions, publishing houses, technology companies and other creative minds in Frankfurt, Germany. We were a key partner of <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">THE ARTS+</a>, a creative business festival that takes place during the <a href=\"http://www.buchmesse.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Frankfurt\_Book Fair</a>. This year, THE ARTS+ spread across 3,000 square meters, with 54 exhibitors, 120 speakers and 31 partners presenting innovative ideas, projects and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During these five days of innovation and inspiration, Europeana championed different areas of interest for creative businesses. In a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/presenting-digital-strategies-of-pioneering-cultural-institutions-at-the-frankfurt-book-fair\" target=\"_blank\">panel</a> revolving around digitisation, creativity and society, we invited speakers from world-renowned cultural heritage institutions to discuss digital transformation in museums and libraries. We worked on fostering partnerships for reuse of digital cultural heritage at a dedicated stand in THE ARTS+ Business Hub. Finally, we showcased interactive installations that make use of cultural data in innovative ways at a POP-UP museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>An immersive Pop-Up museum</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hosting nine multimedia art installations at THE ARTS+ Salon during the weekend, the <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/sessions/arts-pop-museum-enter-whole-new-world-art-2/\" target=\"_blank\">POP-UP Museum</a> enticed fairgoers into experiencing culture beyond the traditional museums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/take-the-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Challenge</a> winner <a href=\"https://www.storypix.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Storypix</a> invited the public to engage with artworks in a new way. The installation is built on a technology that allows the display of and interaction with high-resolution images on large screens. Engaging and amusing captions were added to the artworks to inspire new interpretations from the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/story.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 350px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Public plays with Storypix installation during THE ARTS+ 2017. CC BY-SA Europeana</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Danish digital design studio <a href=\"http://spaceandtime.dk/site/space-time\" target=\"_blank\">Space &amp; Time</a> presented four installations which combined culture and interactive technologies: <a href=\"http://www.spaceandtime.dk/site/#/site/digie\" target=\"_blank\">Digie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spaceandtime.dk/site/#/site/interactive-work-table\" target=\"_blank\">Interactive work table</a>, <a href=\"http://mixoscope.dk/\" target=\"_blank\">Mixoscope</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spaceandtime.dk/site/#/site/culture-cam-installation\" target=\"_blank\">JumpingJack</a>. The JumpingJacks let visitors project their own body transformed by cut-outs from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-280\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana 280</a> artworks onto walls and ceilings, thus creating their own unique, moving artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana also explored the power of multimedia storytelling. We led four GIF-making workshops for beginners at THE ARTS+ POP-UP Museum. GIF-makers, cultural heritage enthusiasts and lovers of the Internet were invited to participate in the\_<a href=\"http://woobox.com/v3qwr9\" target=\"_blank\">GIF IT UP</a> competition - a challenge looking for the best GIFs created from openly licensed material available on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a>, <a href=\"https://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Public Library of America</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalnz.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DigitalNZ</a> or <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Trove</a>. Fairgoers learned various ways to create GIFs by using vintage videos, stickers and effects, or playing with colours and exploring movement and transformation. Either by using effects to revive a painting or using a sequence of images to illustrate a transformation, visitors discovered how to tell old-time stories in a few seconds time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIF-makers can <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GIFITUP2017\" target=\"_blank\">submit</a> their creations and apply for <strong>#GIFITUP2017</strong> until 31 October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We were thrilled to be part of an event that investigated how Europe’s shared cultural heritage can be used for new creative business projects. Looking forward to the 2018 edition!</strong></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<h3>Teachers can now access Europeana Collections via the leading digital pedagogical platform Beneylu School</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Beneylu is a digital primary school resource publisher which offers teachers the opportunity to take their classes to the next level with <a href=\"https://beneylu.com/school/us/\">Beneylu School</a>, the digital classroom kitted out with the best apps including a blog and a homework planner.It was founded by Benjamin Viaud, Eymeric Taelman and Ludovic Meyer in 2008, with the goal of ‘making school even greater’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"241\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JX93k-NTgoU4WulD5kCZX_IOjA_HICVcQ3ytR34yIshXDzbqGhueyXOpcYMbnGqTN6Jw9NS8uVf71BOa3lnxXCq9KHh77tG98aACHMtLWt-hP0V3854O0zUiKhmTvhT0saK3yzSm\" width=\"461\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of Beneylu School: the digital classroom for primary and elementary school students, kitted out with all the best apps for real collaboration</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Upgrading classrooms around the world</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this, the company harnesses the network of each student’s network - their teachers, parents and friends - and enhances it with clear, intuitive and secure services that improve the learning environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>34,000 primary school classrooms in 38 countries around the globe are already signed up to Beneylu School, which is available in French, English and Spanish. This way, Beneylu has become the number-one publisher of digital pedagogical platforms for primary schools being present in France, UK, Australia, Spain, Canada, North and South America, or even in countries like Indian or Japan where Spanish, English or French teachers are working abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New resources to look beyond school books</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robin and Antoine are students in France. They both enjoy the interactivity that these new resources bring to the lessons. <em>'Every morning, we look at an artwork or we listen to a piece of music found on Beneylu. At the end of the week, a student writes an article about one of these topics. Once the teacher has reviewed it, we publish it on the classroom blog.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Gwenaëlle, French school teacher, these new features and the variety of educational material help her improve her classes. <em>‘I store resources and videos in the Media Library which I use for individual or written work outside the classes. For example, I assign \_homework via the Mail app, asking my students \_to look in the Media Library at the photos and videos from the science experiments covered the previous class, and to \_reuse this content to write an article on the blog.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An ongoing collaboration for educational content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and Beneylu have teamed up to offer primary schools quality content relating to art, history, animals, and more topics. Currently, 34,000 classrooms can use the Beneylu School secure <a href=\"https://beneylu.com/spot/us/beneylu-school/apps-for-the-classroom/app-search-engine.html\">Search Engine app</a> to access \_the rich and diverse material from Europeana Collections, including 53 million digital objects. In the near future, it could also provide more content from Europeana, such as the Art Faces app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"309\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XY8YxQ4BrMCrercZNcU47esDNsI00N6Dled3mNAy7CbEidv0B5jg-KQCim0QcWXpzdVoVZ8jWPlEItRYCet1ae8F544SmfoDllEctjua5F_COyVQtcQJqVu7O191LxORWRSyeYOW\" width=\"396\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the Beneylu School Search Engine\_listing\_content from the Europeana digital library</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"376\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Pw7PJlcaZxdV7re-0MVGAFZfM2SYQIH0w7aJ-weuVgefwCweU-36XEZY1Nj7oOGvb7gCji650GtUFLmdGfaq4j9CEH-GXqfOO3G0uwbFP3cpyoNeJ2D9WEb_HIkG5mThWwJsjHsk\" width=\"602\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of the Homework Planner</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'From an exhibition to a competition: wrapping up ‘Picture This! Vintage Postcards of Southeastern Europe’'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Over summer, we focused on the rich cultural heritage of South and East European libraries in a user-friendly way. Learn more as we celebrate the end of the project.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Postcards from the past</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries’ collections have always been at the heart of Europeana. However, until last year, digital materials provided by non-EU countries were not broadly represented in Europeana Collections. A project called Collections of South and East Europe in Europeana (CSEEE) was created to address that lack of visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org\">The European Library</a> (TEL), together with the National and University Library in Zagreb, Croatia, and the national libraries of Serbia and Slovenia helped bringing in content from five national libraries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYR Macedonia, Moldova, and Montenegro).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate that cooperation, we created an online exhibition highlighting the new material. We asked each of these national libraries to choose a set of three postcards representing their country, and to provide context about these places. Our purpose was to highlight the cultural and natural heritage of the regions presented on these vintage postcards. That's how '<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/picture-this-vintage-postcards-of-southeastern-europe\">Picture this! Vintage postcards of Southeastern Europe</a>' was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Online and on site tributes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the exhibition was online, the idea of asking users to take contemporary photographs of these historic places emerged. We particularly loved the idea that the postcards were a nice mix of popular touristic attractions and hidden gems. Given the perfect timing of the approaching summer holidays, we decided to make it happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over two months, we featured each of the participating countries during one week - encouraging people to visit the related chapter of the exhibition and inviting them to participate in the contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We received 416 contest entries, and over 1,200 votes in the Public’s Award. The exhibition got over 4,800 visits and we hope to get many more once it incorporates the photographs from the contest - we’re working on it now, so stay tuned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" National Library of Serbia\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/National%20Library%20of%20Serbia.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>© National Library of Serbia, Belgrade</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Harnessing the power of partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make this initiative a success, we needed the expertise of the National Libraries featured in the exhibition. They’ve done an amazing work through the whole process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partner libraries translated text copy for promotional materials - posters and flyers in the local languages - and took care of printing and distribution in libraries and tourist information centres. They also supported our communications and social media activities. It’s been great to have different local organizations involved, including the Serbian Ministry of Culture! Traditional media also played a fantastic role with Serbian breakfast tv show, Radio Beograd 1 and Macedonian Radio Skopje broadcasting information about the competition. Without the partners’ engagement, we wouldn’t be able to reach such broad audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Picture this! was a great adventure, we’d like to thank all the partner institutions for their enthusiasm and efforts they put into it. As we are celebrating the outcomes of the Collections of South and East Europe in Europeana project, which inspired this initiative, Jasenka Zajec, Library Consultant at the National and University Library in Zagreb, reminds us the positive effects of this collaboration for the future:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘Working with partner libraries, TEL and Europeana representatives has been a privilege and a great experience. The impact of the project and cooperation extends beyond the immediate results, as will enable libraries to prepare the data themselves in the future, and facilitate their participation in similar projects.’</em> \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in featuring your content on Europeana or organizing an activity with us, please get in touch!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Teaching History in an interactive way with the Transcribathon for Education'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Learn how this new fun and educational online learning tool can engage students with History</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Launched in Summer 2016, <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/education/\">Transcribathon for education</a> is an online learning tool developed by Europeana and <a href=\"http://www.factsandfiles.com/en/home.html\">Facts and Files</a> for the transcription of digital material from World War One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Interacting with historical sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It gives students the opportunity to work directly on archived documents from the First World War. These resources are gathered on <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918 thematic collection</a>, a unique digital archive of the First World War built over the last six years thanks to the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/about/collection-days-map/\">Collection Days</a>. These events invited citizens across Europe to bring personal records related to the War. The material submitted, ranging from letters, postcards, diaries, sketchbooks, etc, was digitized and uploaded into Europeana. \_These texts, which are predominantly handwritten and often hard to read, can be now transcribed and annotated by students in their classrooms thanks to the new Transcribathon for Education tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6dgloz3a54\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transcribathon for education can be used in various educational settings, from secondary to university level. Students and teachers can use the documents in the context of their choice, for instance, during History classes (related to WW1 and national or regional history), language classes, or in Civic, Social and Political Education programs. So far, 27,867 documents have been collected, 6,506 transcriptions are in progress and 8,153 have been completed. More documents will be added over time for their transcriptions and, in the long term, also available \_from other topics or collections. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Working collaboratively</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, teachers can create a more challenging and playful environment in establishing a competition. Students can work either individually or in teams on the transcription of a source from Europeana 1914-1918 (such as a diary, for instance). A jury then awards points for the quantity and quality of the transcription, and the presentation of the result. This competition factor allows students to measure their progress as a group and against participants from all over the world, and develop teamwork and communication skills through delivering presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"397\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/UaH8h8UqnWqN2eCH7Mp_nhpWfTaCGe6OL1m7RrCQlSdWZpOXD7O6ViaJQLTH6D39X1DyMSrdtkeQkT2iICaspebXqf6z8-tQRmyKx7gr0ae5NvtdJyG7uZ2IrMlvMjrkjXAk0cYw\" width=\"600\"><br><em>Student teams transcribing at the Primo Levi Gymnasium, Berlin, June 2016 - CC-BY-SA Facts &amp; Files</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing new skills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transcribathon for education has been proved a successful educative tool that enables students to work collaboratively and develop teamwork skills, but also to improve their transcription and media capabilities. While getting a better and more personal understanding of a war that shaped Europe,\_students also learn to create digital records and add the metadata (such as the location) that will allow future researchers and students to get an easier access to these resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new tool for education is available for free. We have tutorials in French, German, Spanish, Dutch and Rumanian, with more languages to be added in the next months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spread the word to your peers and get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:ad.polle@europeana.eu\">ad.polle@europeana.eu</a> if you would like to set up a Transcribathon in your country. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>A New Digital Era</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, when I was elected as Members Councillor for the first time, I was working for the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. In my <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-lizzy-jongma\">blog post</a>, I wrote about our work on Open Data, Linked Open Data and Open Access. And about my personal dream: to access, and even touch and smell history and heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though I changed jobs, I am still working on Open Heritage through digitization, and connecting information from different resources to improve our understanding of the Past. In 2016, I started working for the <a href=\"https://www.oorlogsbronnen.nl\">Dutch Network for War Collections</a>, a digital Platform for war collections from and about the Netherlands during WW2. The platform is facilitated by the NIOD, Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the Royal Academy for Sciences (KNAW). We estimate that at least 450 Institutes hold WW2 related collections. Approximately 7% of the collections are digitized, and less than 3% is available through an API with an Open License.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connecting\_resources to enrich heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dutch Network for War Collections collects tangible and intangible heritage: objects, but also biographical data and information about places and events. Our current collection gathers 10 million objects from 50 different data providers. By bringing together t resources from various collections, we can connect and enrich heritage. For instance, we found information about a prison in Arnhem that was attacked by the Dutch Resistance. The prison still exists, and the building is now a historical building with Monumental status. We discovered contextual information about the attack and the resistance fighters in many different archives.One of them, 200 kms away from Arnhem, even holds an image of the prison’s keys!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" \" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Matching%20Collections.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em>NER technique to match a collection and a thesaurus</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To create these links, we build thesauri describing objects, people, events and places. We use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to find objects, places, people and events in metadata and we add the matching data to object descriptions. We also reconstruct lives of people from resources - a service much appreciated by relatives and descendants.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" \" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-10/Person%20constructed%20from%20resources.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><em>Lives of people are reconstructed from many different resources. The resources are used to create timelines of events in the lives of people</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sharing Open Data to build the\_Network War Collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dutch Network for War Collections is building a digital, online thematic platform for teachers, children,historians, and families. And we need Open, Accessible, structured data to be able to build our thematic collection. We totally depend on our content providers and their willingness to produce and share digital data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Network War Collections is a mini version of Europeana: we have the same goals and have to deal with the same obstacles. By working together, sharing experiences, continuing pioneering work and showing the amazing things you can do, we hope to encourage organizations to put their collections online and to get the most out of digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though we can’t touch or smell the past yet, we have come a long way in bringing together the pieces of the puzzle called WW2.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Culture for inclusive education at the eTwinning conference'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana joined\_for the first time the annual conference of <a href=\"https://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">eTwinning</a>, the community of 500,000+ teachers and 180,000+ schools in Europe. Launched in 2005 as the main action of the European Commission’s eLearning Programme, eTwinning promotes school collaboration in Europe through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by providing support, tools and services for schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://groups.etwinning.net/42604/pages/page/253031\" target=\"_blank\">eTwinning annual conference 2017</a> took place between 26 and 28 October in Malta and brought together 700 member educators for three intense days of discussions and networking. The event aimed to share how eTwinning could raise the capabilities of schools to address three main factors of exclusion: cultural differences, educational difficulties and geographical obstacles. In this aspect, eTwinning can turn inclusion into action via specific international projects, dedicated professional development opportunities and connecting teachers so that they feel part of an inclusive community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/etwinning2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Milena Popova, presenting Europeana at eTwinning conf, eTwinning Ireland. (Photo by\_eTwinning </em><em>Ireland,</em><em>\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Leargas_etwinn\" target=\"_blank\">@Leargas_etwinn</a>).</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference program reflected the above mentioned focus and areas of action. eTwinners could choose among over 40 workshops on a wide range of topics, from the eTwinning capabilities for inclusion ( eTwinning groups, synergies with Erasmus+) to development of intercultural competences, use of technologies for education (creative coding, digital game-based learning) and theme-specific digital learning resources (science, history, migration). The track “eTwinning in practice” presented the <a href=\"https://groups.etwinning.net/42604/pages/page/253072\" target=\"_blank\">European Prize winners</a> and runners-up from the eTwinning annual competition for best educational projects in three age-related categories (4-11, 12-15 and 16-19 yrs). Several teach &amp; meet sessions and the two networking evening events strengthened the community bond and added extra positive vibe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana contributed to the conference theme through the workshop on 28 October “Migration &amp; Culture: how can our past educate our present and support inclusive education”. The 25 attendees represented a mix of primary and secondary education and diverse subjects (from foreign languages to history, arts and ICT). The workshop started with an introduction of Europeana and its resources for education, followed by a presentation about the ongoing activities and next steps on building an online resource on the topic of migration. Europeana Migration thematic collection will showcase institutional and user-generated content and narratives relating to the migration from and within Europe. It aims to raise the awareness that personal identity is made up of many cultural influences and in this way help celebrate diversity and support inclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second half of the workshop, we worked with the teachers on making the migration online resource relevant for their classes. First, we presented to them eleven potential content items chosen from collection (from photographs to postcards and videos) and asked to rate them according to their relevance for teaching and learning. Photographs showing migrants, official documents and postcards scored highest in this survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we brainstormed about the scope and use of the migration resource in education. In particular, we explored the type of content teachers would like to find in such a migration resource and how they would use it for teaching and learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/etwinning3.jpg\" style=\"width: 560px; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/etwinning4.png\" style=\"width: 650px; height: 350px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our workshop at the eTwinning conference was a great opportunity to raise the awareness of Europeana and the migration resource in particular among educators and encourage its reuse for learning. The participants were enthusiastic about Europeana Collections and several of them shared that they would promote it to their peers and students. This positive feedback is very encouraging with regard to our future activities with the eTwinning community. In line with the European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018, eTwinning will explore the role of cultural heritage in education. A few learning events with Europeana on this topic are already in discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn about our latest educational developments, join <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Education LinkedIn group</a> and follow us on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/europeanaeu\" target=\"_blank\">@EuropeanaEU</a>!</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>On 11 October, Europeana invited <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/presenting-digital-strategies-of-pioneering-cultural-institutions-at-the-frankfurt-book-fair\" target=\"_blank\">pioneering cultural institutions</a> to present their digital strategies during <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">THE ARTS+</a>, a creative business festival within the <a href=\"http://www.buchmesse.de/en/fbf/\" target=\"_blank\">Frankfurt Book Fair</a>. Journalist Michael Gubbins<strong> </strong>(<a href=\"https://sampomedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sampomedia</a>) led the discussions on digital transformation in museums and libraries. In this special extended blog post, Gubbins presents some promising directions gleaned from the event. <strong>Michael Gubbins</strong> is an experienced analyst, journalist and consultant with particular expertise in film and digital media.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A new sense of direction for a participatory culture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural organisations and creative industries have been trying to map a dramatically changing ecosystem for a generation – an unprecedented period of turbulence inspired by the Internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For much of that time, the established analogue world has been focused on trying to understand, tame and control ‘disruptive’ digital trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Digital’ has often been defined in isolation, or in a state of tension with the ‘analogue’. Or as MIT Media Lab founder Professor Nicholas Negroponte famously put it in his book<strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_Digital\" target=\"_blank\">Being Digital</a></strong>, the struggle between the world of ‘bits and bytes’ and the world of ‘atoms.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the contribution of digital developments to cultural bodies, as in all industries, has often been achieved in a kind of quarantine, with digital operations running along a separate if parallel road to the supposed ‘core’ business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many practices and processes have been ‘digitised’ and at an astonishing rate – <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/speakers/reinhard-althenhoener/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Reinhard Altenhöner</strong></a>, deputy general director of the <strong><a href=\"http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">State Library Berlin and Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz</a></strong>, said his institutions now had more than 20 million images available in digital formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation provides a necessary stage in the evolution of cultural institutions and industries but what follows is far from clear. Or, as the title of a debate, organised by Europeana and THE ARTS+ at the Frankfurt Book Fair put it: the next stage is <em><strong>“Uncharted Territory”</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why change?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that there is more territory to be charted at all is open to debate. Some in the cultural sector may feel that a destination has already been reached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archives have been digitised and websites offering curated online access launched, alongside social media feeds, blogs and podcasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The technology has progressed too: Altenhöner said interoperable formats and on shareable databases was already changing the way business was done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distribution of content has become far more efficient and cheap, and digital departments are now more generally acknowledged as important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what’s the problem?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are strong arguments that there are dangers in a world where culture finds itself trapped in demographic and social bubbles, and where significant parts of societies feel alienated from cultural institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the discussion in Frankfurt took a much more positive tone. Rather than looking at problems, it focused on the transformational of a new era for cultural institutions, and more importantly cultural engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/Europeana%20at%20THE%20ARTS+.jpg\" style=\"width: 760px; height: 598px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Illustration created during the \"Uncharted Territory\" session by graphic recorder <a href=\"http://annelehmann.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Lehmann</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Convergence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important ideas driving change is convergence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Frankfurt Book Fair, there were plenty of examples of convergence, as popularly understood, in action. Cross-genre adaptation is increasingly important to both the book world, with literary adaptation a growing and critical trend for film and television, and the fair now also has a section dedicated to gaming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stroll around the stands suggested that publishers are hurriedly exploring the potential of Virtual Reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative industries are now constantly chasing new ways of telling stories, or (perhaps more importantly) maximising their Intellectual Property value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the debate showed that cultural institutions convergence were also about expanding narratives and increasing value. And like creative industries, the speakers looked at development in a way that brings together the Digital Economy, the Knowledge Economy and the Experience Economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bricks and mortar in that world are not separate from online developments but part of an interconnected ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/speakers/antje-schmidt/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Antje Schmidt</strong></a>, Head of Digital Cataloguing at the <strong><a href=\"http://www.mkg-hamburg.de/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg</a></strong> said cultural value cut across distinctions, such as ‘virtual’ and ‘physical.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She said the museum, founded in the 19th Century, now “prepared the content that we produce for multiple users, channels and formats but also follow the standards that make it interoperable.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, what defines the platform is the interaction with the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Visitors (analogue or digital) are not only audiences. We perceive them as collaborators, co-creators and contributors, and try to listen to their needs to figure out how to engage them.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have learned how to listen and have tools to turn what they hear into practical action, she suggested. What’s more, through open policies, the museum is able to share tools to allow users to create their own narratives and meaning from the core collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Convergence then opens up new territory, but what makes the next stage so thrilling and challenging is the relationship between culture and the full diversity of people and communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Participation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>“The distinction between producers and users of content gets increasingly blurred,” suggested Professor <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/speakers/pier-luigi-sacco/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pier Luigi Sacco</strong></a>, Deputy Rector for International Relations and Professor of Cultural Economics of <strong><a href=\"http://www.iulm.it/\" target=\"_blank\">IULM University</a></strong>, Milan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“This paves the way to social and economic value creation through massive cultural participation.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He made a case for a new power relationship, not just between users and cultural institutions but between people and culture (redefining the meaning of the world in the process). He calls it “<strong>Culture 3.0</strong>.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were strong examples of the idea in action on the panel, hackathons at the Hamburg museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco’s argument went beyond the creation of specific programmes. He saw more profound social, economic and cultural changes that challenged the way that cultural institutions think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of those ideas are encapsulated in the <strong><a href=\"https://www.unlivemuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">UN Live</a></strong> project – ‘startup NGO’ working with the United Nations to create a new kind of multi-platform global ‘museum.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founder <strong><a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/speakers/michael-peter-edson/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Edson</a></strong> explained that the project had an ambitious founding mission to increase participation in activities in the pursuit of global goals, in every area of health and education, to climate action and sustainable communities, and the environment and peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The huge goals would be realised through small-scale, local and collaborative actions. Edson said the principles of design thinking had been employed – clarity of objectives and transparency of impact, prototyping and testing, learning and sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The success of the scheme will depend on “small scale, high-touch experiments at the local level, woven together with digital, which will build a bridge between awareness and action”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan has been extensively workshopped with a wide diversity of participants around the world. Those participatory principles work for established institutions too. <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/speakers/saskia-scheltjens/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Saskia Scheltjens</strong></a>, of the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Rijksmuseum</strong></a> in Amsterdam, said one of Europe’s most important galleries and museums was in a period of deep change that began with a simple idea:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Our collection belongs to everyone,” she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That goes far beyond the lazy cliché that most institutions like to recite. If the great public collections really belong to the people, they cannot be confined to visiting hours in the capital city. They need to be designed to be accessible, or as Scheltjens puts it: “open and connected.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, art cannot wait for the people to come to the gallery, the gallery needs to go out to the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rijksmuseum has become a beacon of making its assets accessible, mobile and shareable. “Everybody is a maker,” said Scheltjens, with the museum allowing a degree of open access to archives, to build their own content and meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its thinking, and willingness to embrace new opportunities, was certainly helped by a long period of closure, that created time and space to look ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Culture 3.0 is a challenge to the psychology, the status and the established economics of museums, galleries, libraries, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Internal change and impact</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The pressure points highlighted by all the projects in the report continually returned to a theme. The obstacle to trends that might deliver the greatest value of institutions might be the institutions themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That does not necessarily imply active resistance: the institutions have generally encouraged the exploration of new approaches. Most have teams dedicated to digital innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem in many organisations is in embracing the logical reform that would allow tentative exploration to become serious change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are, of course, vested interests within organisations, not just from those holding the reins of analogue power – some digital departments live in happy isolation, pursuing their own particular interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, suggests, Professor Sacco, they may find that they have nothing to fear but fear itself in this changed ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The role of cultural professionals is not diminished, but further expanded, provided that they are willing to explore and engage with the new context,” said Professor Sacco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his view, those professionals will find their work is more based on building relationships and bringing their museums, galleries, etc. to life. That may make their work simultaneously more powerful and empowering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will drive the confidence in change will be signs of impact, suggested Edson, of UN Live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, after wide consultations, the project decided to adopt the word ‘museum’ to cover a range of often-innovative online activities. It might seem an odd choice, given the concern of physical museums about how they are perceived, but Edson said the term acted as a value way of framing the idea, so that people could understand their part in development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He suggested that people needed a conceptual base, even for radical and innovative work (offering those institutions with a physical building an advantage).\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clear concepts, clear objectives, transparent measures, small-scale testing, learning from failure, participation and dialogue, collaborative action etc, would help build a new kind of institution to work faster, bigger scale, with people around the worlds.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What ifs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What emerged from a fascinating debate was a sense of direction, rather than any clear destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It recognised the fluidity of a changing environment, where the greatest opportunities might come from the imagination of someone who might not yet be able to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Future generations may look back at the charts for a new territory and see clear points on the map, where progress was made and consolidated, allowing others to travel further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what made the conversation so inspiring in Frankfurt is that fact that progress is being driven by ‘What ifs?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power of Culture 3.0 is that those questions can quickly be tested and developed with the people they serve, and\_each offering a clear direction sign to those that follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Read the presentations held during THE ARTS+ on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/uncharted-territory-digital-strategies-for-cultural-heritage-institutions-cohosted-by-europeana-and-the-arts-81426833\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Slideshare</a>!</h2>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"share-buttons\">\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://pro.europeana.eu/post/charting-new-territory-a-compass-for-cultural-institutions\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" src=\"https://simplesharebuttons.com/images/somacro/facebook.png\" style=\"width: 35px; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0; border: 0; box-shadow: 0; display: inline;\"></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?url=https://pro.europeana.eu/post/charting-new-territory-a-compass-for-cultural-institutions;hashtags=europeana\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"Twitter\" src=\"https://simplesharebuttons.com/images/somacro/twitter.png\" style=\"width: 35px; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0; border: 0; box-shadow: 0; display: inline;\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://pro.europeana.eu/post/charting-new-territory-a-compass-for-cultural-institutions\" target=\"_blank\"> <img alt=\"LinkedIn\" src=\"https://simplesharebuttons.com/images/somacro/linkedin.png\" style=\"width: 35px; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 0; border: 0; box-shadow: 0; display: inline;\"></a>\n</div>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-c9829f26-7790-5e02-de47-cbf5d391f76c\">Learn about the best innovative multimedia achievements related to Europe’s cultural heritage.</b></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Each year, Heritage in Motion rewards the best innovative multimedia achievements and products engaging the public with Europe’s outstanding heritage in all its forms. We tell you a little more about the 4 winners of the 2017 edition, which have been announced on 29 September 2017 in Skopje, Macedonia, during the Annual Conference of the European Museum Academy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Best Achievement Award</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jury was unanimous in declaring Historic Royal Palaces as the winner of the Best Achievement Award for <a href=\"https://www.heritageinmotion.eu/himentry/slug-b8d95e6193daf8032ca31da893c3e59b\">‘The Lost Palace’</a>. ‘This project immerses visitors in the history of a lost heritage site through creative and attractive technology, enhanced by performances and installations.<em> ‘A clever use of technology’</em>, according to the jury: <em>‘it is quite poetic and intriguing, but not afraid to engage the audience with style and theatrics.’</em> This nomination meant a lot to Tim Powel, creative producer:<em> ‘this Europe-wide recognition is a major boost to us and our creative collaborators on the project - Chomko &amp; Rosier, Univited Guests (with Lewis Gibson) and Calvium. Such awards really help us make the case to be bold, brave and try new things.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Best app for mobile devices</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury awarded the best app for mobile devices to <a href=\"https://www.heritageinmotion.eu/himentry/slug-e725d48429303680a4948577fc397609\">Athens Time Walk</a>, an offline guide with 3D representations of Athens' most famous archaeological sites. <em>‘A fun way to learn more about local history’</em>, it is the result of two years effort by a joined team of Web developers, 3D special artists, archaeologists, historians and cultural managers. Giannis Ladas, CEO, commented that this recognition was <em>‘a motive to work even harder on trying to find innovative ways to combine technology and culture’. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Best website and online content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by the Stockholm City Museum, the Stockholm City Archive, the Stockholm City Library and the City of Stockholm Administration of Education, <a href=\"https://www.heritageinmotion.eu/himentry/slug-bcd3b472548c436dbc81bea93b208f11\">Stockholmskällan</a>’s website enables people to walk in the footsteps of their predecessors, and to find traces of history in letters, photos, police reports, maps, film, music, paintings and tips of literature. For the Jury, it is also<em> ‘a best-practice example of cooperation between cultural institutions, initiating a process of learning history directly from the primary sources’</em>. According to Martin Nyblom, Stockholmskällan’s editor and educator,<em> ‘this award proves that our project meets a high standard regarding content, formats and working methods.

For the jury, <em>‘the multi-layered approach helps to unfold the secrets of both the artists and the museums and makes the exhibitions accessible to a much wider audience.'\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, two special mentions were also awarded for extraordinary projects: a scientific and creative accomplishment, The Next Rembrandt project by ING (Netherlands) is a 3D-printed painting blurring the boundaries between art and technology.

Early bird registration has been extended to 10 November. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-network-association-agm-2017-tickets-35932193157\" target=\"_blank\">Register now</a>, or you’ll miss all of this…</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Keynote speaker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re delighted to announce that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pier-luigi-sacco\" target=\"_blank\">Pier Luigi Sacco</a> is this year’s keynote speaker. Pier Luigi is Professor of Cultural Economics at the International University of Languages and Media in Milan. In a fascinating talk, he’ll be sharing his experiences and ideas on the topic of developing impact goals for cultural heritage. In the meantime, follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pierluigisacco\">@PierLuigiSacco</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pitch your project!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you run or plan to run a project that you think will have significant social or economic value? Would you like to present it to fellow Network Association members at the AGM? \_Would you like to win the time, support and expertise of Europeana’s impact team to assess the impact your project achieves? \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then submit your project idea by <a href=\"https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/aa60147874324f82bd344c87519007b4\" target=\"_blank\">filling in our short form</a>, outlining your main objectives and projected outcomes. Ten projects will be selected to give short\_presentations at the AGM. Deadline for submissions - 15 November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"L'évêque de Fulham jouant au cricket\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/L'%C3%A9v%C3%AAque_de_Fulham_jouant_au_%5B...%5DPlanet_News_btv1b90360801.JPEG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055590254.html?q=L%27%C3%A9v%C3%AAque+de+Fulham+jouant+au+cricket\">L'évêque de Fulham jouant au cricket</a>, Planet News (Agence de presse). Agence photographique, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">public domain</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What sort of projects are we looking for?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be any kind of project, large or small, but it should have clear indications of social or economic impact (or both). Think for example of the Europeana 1914-1918 or the upcoming Europeana Migration project. Both of these address a societal need to increase the feeling of ‘Unity in diversity’ in Europe. By inviting people to share their family histories of either the first World War or of migration, we are building up a collective memory that addresses all sides and perspectives, which will allow people to connect to each other’s stories on a level that would not have been possible otherwise. How does your project transform the world with culture?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two events for the price of one!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget that you can extend your stay in Milan by attending <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/events/20171207-european-culture-forum-2017_en\" target=\"_blank\">the European Commission cultural event - European Culture Forum</a> on 7-8 December at the <a href=\"http://www.superstudiogroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Superstudio Group</a>, Via Tortona, 27, 20144 Milan. All AGM attendees are invited <a href=\"http://europeancultureforum.onetec.eu/register.asp\">to register</a> for the European Culture Forum.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/agm2017\" target=\"_blank\">Find out more and register to attend.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Copyright advocacy update: Future access to cultural heritage, geoblocking  or a Digital Single Market?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana Board Member Paul Keller reacts to a newly proposed article by the European Council that goes against the idea of Digital Single Market. Read his in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/02-11-17-eu-copyright-reform-update\">in-depth article here</a>.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>More than a year after the European Commission published its proposal for a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-directive-european-parliament-and-council-copyright-digital-single-market\">Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</a> (DSM directive), discussions continue both in the Council and in the European Parliament. While the discussions in the European Parliament have recently slowed down to a crawl (the vote in the Legal Affairs committee <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Senficon/status/923915710518169600\">is not expected before January</a>), the discussions between the Member States in the Council are picking up steam: earlier this week, the Estonian Council presidency’s <a href=\"https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/EU/XXV/EU/16/00/EU_160054/imfname_10757971.pdf\">\_consolidated compromise proposal</a> was made public. The proposal includes an entirely new article on ’Collective licensing with an extended effect’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extended collective licensing and cross border use</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To anyone familiar with the Commission's proposal (and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-better-solution-to-making-out-of-commerce-works-available-online\">our criticism of the proposal</a>) this addition will appear somewhat odd as the Commission's original proposal already relied on ’collective licensing with an extended effect’ as a mechanism that would allow cultural heritage Institutions to make out of commerce works (OOCW) from their collections available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Articles 7-9 of the Commission's proposal are aimed at enabling the cross border use of out of commerce works. This would allow cultural heritage institutions to make such works from their collections available online so that they can be accessed from everywhere within the EU. While we think that relying on extended collective licensing alone will not be sufficient to achieve this objective for all sectors and all types of work, we are happy with the ambition to solve this problem on an EU wide basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Going against a Digital Single Market for cultural heritage?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By contrast, the newly proposed article 9a focusses on (existing) national extended collective licensing arrangements and would not have any cross border effects. Instead, it introduces provisions into the EU legal framework that would remove the legal uncertainty that currently surrounds the extended collective licensing arrangements that exist in a number of (mainly nordic) EU member states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By introducing the ability for more flexible domestic ECL systems, the Member States make the provisions aimed at allowing EU wide access to out of commerce works less attractive. From our perspective, this would be a huge loss that goes directly against the objective of the directive to create a Digital Single Market that enables cross border access to the digitised cultural heritage collections of institutions all across the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new proposal will likely lead to a situation where a lot of digital collections will only be available from within the Member State where the institution owning the collection resides. While it is unlikely that this is the intention behind the new article it would move us further away from Europe wide access to digitized cultural heritage and closer to a reality in which geo blocking access to culture becomes the norm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to read our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/02-11-17-eu-copyright-reform-update\">in-depth article</a> on the IPR page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note:</em> On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">consensus driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organizations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The BYZART project: creating one of the widest online collections of Byzantine art and archaeology'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Introducing a\_new Generic Services project to digitize and promote Byzantine art and archaeology, led by the BYZART consortium</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Written by\_Giulia Marsili, PhD,\_Università di Bologna</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October\_2017\_the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/byzantine-art-and-archaeology\">BYZART project</a> was launched and two kick-off meetings took place. They represented remarkable occasions to share knowledge about Europeana strategies and resources, as well as about goals and ambitions of the BYZART project. Funded as a part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-generic-services-opportunity-to-fund-a-thematic-collection\">2016 Generic Services call</a>, this project\_aims to digitize, catalogue and make available rich archive collections about Byzantine cultural heritage in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Byzantine culture is one of the milestones of European cultural heritage. For centuries, it spread all over the Mediterranean a homogeneous civilization despite regional diversities with strong influence over later European artistic and cultural expressions. Nevertheless, nowadays the wide heritage of the Byzantine art in Europe is undervalued, even if each Mediterranean region preserves remarkable memories and traces of its Byzantine past. The BYZART project proposes to raise awareness about this impressive heritage, by showcasing collections of archive photographs, audio-visual materials and 3D\_reconstructions in Europeana Collections.\_We aspire\_to utilise and building upon existing Byzantine content already in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 3rd October, Giulia Marsili and Lucia Orlandi from the University of Bologna, the\_BYZART technical coordinators, were welcomed to\_Europeana Foundation offices in The Hague. During the session, they presented the consortium and its member\_archives. The Europeana team introduced their guests to\_the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/thematic-collections\">thematic collections strategy</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services\">publications strategy</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">ingestion process</a> and editorial features such as <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/discovery/online-exhibitions\">exhibitions</a>, galleries, and blogs. All the suggestions received in this very inspiring meeting were taken\_and later brought up in the first official consortium meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 31\_October\_this second kick-off meeting took place at the Department of History and Cultures of the University of Bologna and gathered all the partners for the first time. It was a wonderful occasion to brainstorm every\_aspect of the project. Partners’ collections, digitization procedures and best\_practices on metadata structure, the BYZART web platform, editorial features, audiences and recruitment of new data providers were only some of the topics we addressed during this intensive and fruitful day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Byzantine Business in Bologna\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/byzantine_generic_services_kickoff_bologna_31_october_2017_ii.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most exciting topics\_was the variety of partners archive collections. Their subjects range from architecture, sculpture\_and archaeologý to pictures, icons and manuscripts, covering a really broad chronological (from 3rd to 15th century) and geographical span (all over the Mediterranean). Besides images, drawings, graphics,\_sketches and videos about Byzantine history, audio recordings about Byzantine church music and 3D\_reconstructions of\_Byzantine monuments will be included in the collection. The chance to digitize new materials represents a great occasion in getting highest quality materials, to which data providers will devote great efforts. We are aware that the acquirement and the sharing of more than 75,000 items will be a great challenge, but we are ready to face it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also focused on copyright\_and explored different ways to make as more content\_as possible available for reuse in different priority markets, such as academia, education, tourism and creative industries. In this way, the project hopes to create one of the widest existing collections of Byzantine art and archaeology within Europeana platform and open it up to new data providers which can contribute their Byzantine collections. If you are one of them, don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:disci.byzart@unibo.it\">disci.byzart@unibo.it</a>\_– we are waiting for you!</p>\r\n"

The workshop outcomes will serve as a basis for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to be published in early summer 2018 with the aim to help teachers use digitized cultural heritage material in their classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 1: Warming up the engines</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our workshop took place at the same time with the meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.scientix.eu/\">Scientix</a> project, giving us the opportunity to expand our reach to educators and explore possible reuse of cultural heritage in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) education. The morning of 28 October started with a presentation of Europeana and our educational resources to both project teacher groups (Europeana DSI3 and Scientix), followed by a <a href=\"http://www.scientix.eu/spw16-after\">discussion</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"289\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aUbPS_2i-UbNfsyJ5LHdFr1RhF9tlyxT2vxORstpxAQEUTu91y8ouL8yRi33UZNH2PlZQGaas_IQC4pzAnwgKFaxB8leRhNQ2I4KJ7Y8B85owo9EkixV6mi5-QX5aMN2wVVSFOUj\" width=\"608\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participants in the European DSI3 and Scientix workshops. European Schoolnet, all rights reserved.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoon, the participants split in two groups depending on the project they were working on. The 27 Scientix teachers learned about organizing events, presenting more effectively, social media, and STEM skills for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 18 Europeana participants got a more detailed introduction into the Europeana resources for educators. In particular, the teachers learned how to improve their searches in Europeana Collections and use the thematic collections, galleries and exhibitions. The workshop also presented them the variety of digital learning resources available on Europeana Professionals (<a href=\"https://www.beta.historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana</a>,<a href=\"http://lreforschools.eun.org/web/guest;jsessionid=7F648316149E267D3AD8E2ECA21A57EC\"> LRE</a>, <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">Inventing Europe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/it/app/faces/\">Art Faces</a>, among others) as well as with the guidelines for using openly licensed content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"416\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QRIsic6coZDl19aV68v7u9nXKyYV6k1wrzry7Du5boWAaLgvGuGzDO3MVeIxmjJGjFC7KnKnRGsr9qfz3fkT7qquZazpKy3YA8ydP87E3OeL7ID1T_3rIIv70p1Wo9D72m-UhgWy\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana DSI3 workshop. European Schoolnet, all rights reserved.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 2: Full steam ahead</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the second day, we worked together with the teachers on shaping up their concepts for learning activities and pedagogical scenarios with Europeana content. These resources will be trialled in their classrooms, refined and then become part of the above mentioned Europeana MOOC. We ended the day with a little artistic endeavour - take a look at some of our best <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/european_schoolnet/38010444181/in/album-72157687701823941/\">Van Go Yourself</a> recreations and other pictures of the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two-day event was a great opportunity for Europeana to find out what teachers had to say about our educational offering. We received good feedback and excellent suggestions, all of which we will consider carefully. Most of the teachers were pleasantly surprised by the discovery of Europeana content and the various possibilities for sharing the cultural treasures with their students. Some participants were very excited about linking cultural heritage content and science for educational purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europeana?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Europeana</a> resources - I am just discovering. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SPW16?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SPW16</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scientix_eu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@scientix_eu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eu_schoolnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@eu_schoolnet</a><br>\r\nFind something interesting for you! <a href=\"https://t.co/S9Zol8Vj2G\">pic.twitter.com/S9Zol8Vj2G</a></p>\r\n— Kwiatek-Grabarska (@KGrabarska) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KGrabarska/status/924305429567541254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>Presenting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Europeanaeu</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/spw16?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#spw16</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eu_schoolnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@eu_schoolnet</a> Giving educators access to great free resources for their lessons <a href=\"https://t.co/BkARH5P08X\">pic.twitter.com/BkARH5P08X</a></p>\r\n— Rafael Montero (@rafaelmb_1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rafaelmb_1/status/924211940720893952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The next Europeana workshop will be held on 8 until 10 December in Brussels.

        title: 'Introducing the Europeana Data Model online course  on data aggregation'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This MOOC makes it easy for librarians and cultural heritage institutions professionals to understand how to bring their collections into Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>During the second half of 2016, The European Library (TEL), which was the main library domain aggregator for Europeana, had the privilege of having <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/uldis-zarins-1\">Uldis Zarins</a>, from the National Library of Latvia, as interim manager to help wrapping up with its overall activities and services. Over these months, the European Library staff worked with its partners - European and non-European institutions - \_to arrange possible alternative aggregation routes. As a result, two main scenarios were identified for their future data delivery to Europeana - either re-routing their data aggregation workflow through another data provider, possibly a national aggregator; or becoming a direct data provider to Europeana. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Working with partners to improve the understanding of EDM</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Uldis recalls: <em>‘We realised that a large number of TEL partners were not in a position to use the services of another aggregator, and would instead become direct data providers . To identify the main challenges of becoming a Europeana data provider, we launched a survey, which revealed that one of the main stumbling blocks for libraries was data mapping and conversion to Europeana Data Model (EDM) - specifically from MARC 21, which \_is still the most commonly used data format for libraries. \_We looked for ways to boost the understanding of EDM among librarians, to explain how to translate MARC 21 elements to corresponding EDM fields, and to use the EDM for presenting their collections in Europeana. We noticed that the existing documentation on this topic was quite challenging to use, so we decided to try a more modern approach: we developed an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course\">online course</a> to reach out and support libraries in their task of understanding Europeana data requirements.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working towards this goal, a group \_from the Europeana office worked to bring their knowledge on EDM and expertise of libraries data, outline the course structure, and compile the most relevant information regarding the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools\">Europeana Data Model</a>. As a basis for the course, we \_looked at <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=europeana+libraries\">previous work</a> \_done within Europeana, specifically to map the library specific format, MARC21, to EDM. We’ve brought some fun into all the serious data talk, with interesting ways to present and visualize these sometimes arid concepts. For example, some of the videos were filmed on the rooftop of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek, \_the institution that hosts our offices in The Hague, and we created a great animation of a poster getting all the way from a library shelf into Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6FWHOvgCkKY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What to expect?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To give a short overview, \_the course is divided in 3 sections, as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-mooc-basics\">Section 1 - The basics of EDM</a> - \_this first section presents the history of EDM, its development and the theory behind the main classes. We also explain what led to the creation of EDM and why Europeana needs it in order to keep on being the leading digital library for European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-mooc-advanced\">Section 2 - Advanced specifications</a> \_- this section delves deeper into the EDM classes and shows what impact each of the properties has on the final outcome on Europeana Collections. We also share the best practice we've acquired over the years, and explain what happens with your data here at Europeana before we publish it.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-mooc-marc2edm\">Section 3 - Transforming MARC21 to EDM</a> \_- this final section highlights what the library domain professionals should consider when approaching specific data manipulation to EDM, and, further beyond, how such transformation is presented in the Europeana Collections site.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>We invite you to discover <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-mooc-introduction\">this online course</a> and we hope it will be \_useful to library institutions and other cultural heritage professionals! \_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>This is the second blog in a series dedicated to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/make-it-festive\" target=\"_blank\">end-of-the-year festivities</a> and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire creative reuse by makers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A time of wonder and love, the holiday season inspires fantasy and imagination for all age groups. From late November to mid-January, the world celebrates Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year and much more. Traditionally, most festivities are accompanied by gift-giving, making it a children’s favourite!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this blog post, we will feature high-quality children’s toys and crafts. We hope that the toys of the past can motivate <strong>makers</strong> to create with Europeana’s openly licensed content!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Playtime </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playing with toys is a fun way of introducing young children to social traditions and household routines. In our <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/vintage-dollshouses-toys/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a>, you will discover a free to reuse selection of dollhouses and meticulously designed miniature furniture, accessories and other types of vintage toys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the 17th-century dollhouse below. Made for Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), a wealthy orphan who lived with her sister in Amsterdam, this dollhouse contains a peat loft, a linen room, a nursery, a lying-in room, a reception room, a cellar, a kitchen and a dining room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/90402_BK_14656%20(1).jpeg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 723px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/BK_14656.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dollhouse of Petronella Dunois</a>, Anoniem. 1676. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about learning-by-playing with printable crafts for children? Enjoy some paper cutting art and craft ideas for kids with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A%282021659_Ag_NL_DigitaleCollectie_Deventer%29&amp;qf%5B%5D=bouwplaat+OR+bouwplaten&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">house cut-outs</a> available on Europeana. Below you will find an early 20th century cut out with a doll and four costumes (including a bike). We really like the choice of remixing and playing with cultural heritage that this represents for children!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/blog1.jpg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 723px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/2021659/1970_0235.html\" target=\"_blank\">Plano met aankleedpopjes, voor en achterkant</a>, Imagerie Pellerin. 1900. Deventer Musea. CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masks are also great to bring into playtime. In 1924, <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/248602/avant-garde-1920s-costumes-reemerge-revealing-their-makers-tragic-story/\" target=\"_blank\">German dancers</a> created Expressionist costumes that are reminiscent of retro robots and Bauhaus knights. Although these masks were originally avant-guard, they would make a great costume - some replicas could be easily made from scrap material and left-over boxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2048429_item_YTJKP7Q5IM55RRBHV4262XINB7GDDZAD.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 723px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048429/item_YTJKP7Q5IM55RRBHV4262XINB7GDDZAD.html?q=+Tanzmaske+\" target=\"_blank\">Tanzmaske \"Insektentänzer\"; von Lavinia Schulz | Diez-Dührkoop, Minya</a>. 1924. Museum Für Kunst Und Gewerbe Hamburg. CC0</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another toy with a long history is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top\" target=\"_blank\">spinning top</a>. Designed to spin rapidly on the ground, these toys were usually made of wood. Check out the beautiful colors of the wooden spinning top below, originating from Calcutta, India, from the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/blog2.jpg\" style=\"width: 560x; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/91619/SMVK_EM_objekt_1307418.html?q=toy\" target=\"_blank\">Snurra, </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/91619/SMVK_EM_objekt_1307418.html?q=toy\" target=\"_blank\">leksak</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/91619/SMVK_EM_objekt_1307418.html?q=toy\" target=\"_blank\">, toy</a>. 19th century.

        intro: ''
        body: "<p><em>This is the third blog in a series dedicated to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/make-it-festive\" target=\"_blank\">end-of-the-year festivities</a> and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire festive creative reuse by <strong>makers</strong>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gift-giving is one of the many traditions during the holiday season. How you wrap these items adds an extra element of surprise and intrigue and has an important role during festivities. As a long-standing tradition, wrapping gifts uses many different forms and materials, like paper, textiles or gift boxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Europeana and new <a href=\"https://www.giftwrapmyface.com/\" target=\"_blank\">web applications</a>, it’s now easy to find, be inspired by and use print designs to make gift-wrap. Forget pre-made gift bags and dazzle your friends and family with Europeana’s openly licensed content!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Check out our selection of gift-wrap ideas below </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the dress fabric of printed cotton\_from the Calico Printer's Association in the UK. The print (originally for a dress) is adorned with repeating images of Pierrot, a French pantomime character. His repeating figure focuses on the character’s essentials, a wide collar, hat and fools' outfit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/wrap1.jpg\" style=\"width: 560x; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/item_O267172.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dress fabric of printed cotton</a>, made by Calico Printer's Association, Great Britain, 1937. Victoria And Albert Museum. CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun and striking, the print below (also from the manufacturer Calico Printer's Association) features jellyfishes in bold colours. Add a non-traditional and modern touch to this year’s gift-wrap!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2048213_item_O267166.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 623px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/item_O267166.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dress fabric of printed cotton</a>, made by Calico Printers Association, Great Britain, 1945.

Make the gift wrapping as important as the gift by using beautiful prints like this one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/wrap3.jpeg\" style=\"width: 660x; height: 517px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Museum_of_Domestic_Design___Architecture__Middlesex_University_SD1258.html\" target=\"_blank\">Textile design</a>.

We selected a few fantastic textile prints to inspire DIY gift wrapping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This bright screen-printed silk head scarf designed by André Derain is one of our favourites. The rough, non-symmetrical grapes pattern is set off by irregular black and yellow borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/2048213_item_O35176.jpeg\" style=\"width: 710x; height: 567px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2048213/item_O35176.html\" target=\"_blank\">Screen-printed silk head scarf</a>, designed by André Derain, made by Ascher Ltd, London, 1947.(...)

        intro: "<p>Europeana is building up a new thematic collection dedicated to migration to, from, and within Europe. Learn more and get involved!</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Looking at migration to and from Europe historically, Europeana aims to show that the geographical moving of people makes culture richer, and that migration is intrinsic to what it means to be European, on a societal and personal level. These migration movements helped develop human societies, cultures and civilizations across and within borders, as well as defining the personal histories of our own families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/SK_A_3612.html\"><img alt=\"Painting 'Vluchtelinge' by John Macallan Swan\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/Vluchtelinge.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nVluchtelinge, 1870 - 1910.

Rijksmuseum, public domain</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A work-in-progress throughout 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Migration will bring together collections dedicated to the theme of migration to, from and within Europe. An alpha version can be found <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/migration\">here</a>, already gathering just under 200,000 documents from more than 750 museums, galleries, libraries, audio-visual archives and archives across Europe. Throughout 2018, our intention is to build this collection by improving and adding content from cultural heritage institutions across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official launch of Europeana Migration will be accompanied by a series of promotional and participatory activities throughout 2018, in line with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/working-towards-the-2018-european-year-of-cultural-heritage\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>. These events held in several European countries will focus on the ways migration has helped to shape European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000055659576.html\"><img alt=\"Ellis Island\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/ellisisland.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nEmigrants at Ellis Island, 1913. Rol [photographic agency]. Bibliothèque nationale de France, public domain</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating centralised access to migration related collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>New content will be sourced and digitised via partners in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-new-migration-in-the-arts-and-sciences-generic-services-project\">Migration in the arts and sciences project</a>, dedicated migration museums, our network of existing Europeana data providers, and new providers. The collection will bring together audiovisual material, archival content and textual collections. It will be the first time that these collections relating to migration will be gathered in one platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a preparatory phase in October, we surveyed users from our target markets: the results showed that users want access to documentary evidence, material culture, and personal stories that relate to migration. These could be photographs, diaries, artworks, posters, objects, artefacts, passports, postcards, diagrams, letters and more objects reflecting the migration movements that have occurred in Europe over many centuries. More specific information and guidance on how to prepare data for this thematic collection has been added to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Publishing Guide</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022608/FBIB_FBib_07004_068.html\"><img alt=\"A postcard sent from an immigrant in the United States to relatives and friends in Norway\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/migrationPostcard.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"><br>\r\nA postcard sent from an immigrant in the United States to relatives and friends in Norway.

Does your organisation hold collections relating to migration? If so, we want to hear from you!

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Sorina Stanca'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I am currently the director of <a href=\"https://librarytechnology.org/library/41933\">Cluj County Library</a>. My job involves the development of new activities for library users, the creation of digital content, and the valorisation of the library collection. Since 2008, I have been involved in several European projects linked with Europeana, such as EuropeanaLocal, Europeana Awareness and LoCloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Romanian public libraries’ first steps towards digitisation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My ‘history’ with Europeana started back in 2008, when our library got involved in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeanalocal\">EuropeanaLocal</a>. The main goal of the project was to improve the interoperability of the digital content held by regional and local institutions, and to make it accessible in \_Europeana. For Romanian public libraries, this was the first project that involved making their collections available online through digitisation. We started working together with public libraries and other cultural institutions from scratch selecting which collections to digitise, and creating metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Romania and the Great War</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After this first project with Europeana, we continued our collaboration and became\_partners in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a>. This new project gave us the opportunity to spread the news about Europeana, and to organise Europeana 1914-1918 collection days. Working together with other libraries from Romania to gather resources from the general public has been a rewarding experience. On that occasion, we discovered very interesting documents, manuscripts, photos, and letters from soldiers and participants to the Great War. Europeana Awareness allowed all library professionals who attended the National Conferences in Romania during the project period to become content providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Diary of Dumitru Nistor\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/NistorDiary.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diary of Dumitru Nistor, Europeana 1914-1918, Biblioteca Judeteana Cluj, CC-BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organising Transcribathons in Romania this year has also been a great experience. These events were held in Bucharest at the Romanian National Library, in Brașov at Brașov County Library, and in Sibiu at Sibiu County Library. The final event took place in Cluj County Library in Cluj-Napoca city. Over a week, the entire Romanian content from Europeana 1914-1918 portal has been transcribed, representing more than 1 million characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Task Force for Public Libraries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a councillor of the Europeana Network Association, I also got involved as a member of the Public Libraries Task Force. Our work plan was implemented between July 2015 and May 2016. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/europeana-task-force-on-public-libraries-final-report-dec2015.pdf\">The final report of the Task Force</a> demonstrates that public libraries would be strong partners for Europeana, as they can help connect with end users, widen their collections, but also collect and manage User Generated Content. Our library hosted one of the three workshops that were organised over the duration of this Task Force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my goals as a councillor was to encourage colleagues from the Romanian Public Libraries and from other types of libraries to join the Europeana Network Association, and to engage with Europeana activities and projects. At the end of my first term, the number of Romanian collections in Europeana has increased, as did the number of specialists who became members of the Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I run as a candidate for a second term to achieve the most important goal that I set myself as a councillor: <em>‘making more locally-relevant cultural content from Romanian cultural institutions available through Europeana’</em>. For this goal, I need to work together with the best specialists in digitisation from all over Europe.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I joined the Europeana Network Association (ENA) in 2015, and I have then been elected in the Members Council. My goal was to promote and to spread Europeana’s vision and mission, and to increase the quantity and quality of data in Europeana through ad-hoc initiatives both top-down and bottom-up, arising from communities of practice. As my last year as a councillor is approaching, I would like to share the work done and, more importantly, what I’m currently committed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supporting Europeana’s ecosystem</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a councillor involves<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/Councillor%20Terms%20of%20Reference.pdf?b62509c75b\"> several tasks and activities</a> related to the ENA organisation and its relations with Europeana. Over the last year, I’ve been involved in three working groups: the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Governance</a> working group, which aims to address the governance of the ENA and ensure its good and democratic development; the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-pro-wg\">Europeana Pro</a> working group, willing to identify business needs and priorities with relevant stakeholders/communities, and support the development of the new Europeana Pro website; and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/allezculture-working-group\">#AllezCulture</a> working group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, I’ve been an active member of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/benchmarking-europeana\">Benchmarking Europeana Task Force</a>. The purpose of the project was to evaluate the methodology and content of a first study benchmarking Europeana as a cultural information service, in order to propose a framework for future evaluations and benchmarkings. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/benchmarking-europeana\">result</a> of our work is publicly available on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reaching out to external communities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>But my activities included communication and engagement actions toward external communities as well. Last October, I took part in the <a href=\"https://www.force2017.org/\">FORCE2017 Changing the culture</a> conference, during which I presented \_Europeana’s vision and our objectives. Communities such as <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/\">FORCE11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.force11.org/scholarly-commons\">Scholarly Commons</a>, <a href=\"http://operas.hypotheses.org/\">OPERAS</a> and <a href=\"https://hypothes.is/annotating-all-knowledge/\">Annotating All Knowledge Coalition</a> can be seen as a unique and wide community through which we can build joint actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My work currently focuses on the open science advocacy and, more specifically, in creating liaisons between the ENA and the open science communities that share similar visions and commitments. We should work together to build an open, FAIR and sustainable ecosystem for science communication. To this respect, I’m inviting the community to join the <a href=\"http://thepund.it/go-fair-initiative/\">GO FAIR initiative</a> and conduct common actions to make cultural objects effectively findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about all this and to collaborate, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:didonato@netseven.it\">contact me</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezCulture</p>\r\n"

        title: 'EUROCLIO and Europeana: building better resources for teaching history'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Over the course of Europeana DSI2 (July 2016 to August 2017), <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a> has led the development of 20 learning activities for educators using Europeana content. As part of our partnership, EUROCLIO has also been working on an innovative new eLearning Environment for history educators, which will be hosted on the revamped <a href=\"https://www.beta.historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana</a>. The goal of Historiana is to make it as simple as possible for history educators to enrich their teaching materials with Europeana’s digital cultural heritage content.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>The 20 eLearning Activities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The topics covered are diverse and focus on historical events and developments that are important in classrooms across Europe (such as the two world wars, the Holocaust, and the industrial revolution) or people (such Stalin and the Suffragettes) that are of cross-border importance. The <a href=\"http://la.historiana.eu/la/\">eLearning Activities</a> are designed to help student acquire historical thinking skills (such as analyzing historical sources, or applying historical knowledge). The eLearning Activities demonstrate how the eActivity Builder can be used, and how the different building blocks function. The different building blocks make it possible for history educators to add text, images, embed anything, ask questions, and create sorting activities with different backgrounds.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Historiana 4.JPG\" height=\"509\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/BaDdPQdqTJhOY4oPTE8BRI5hjrMLzvv2G2hCBSjq1-9JVq9sP51ohuFKZqQtnPiEywZ5RO9fZaR5K0uLaLfrk0HQaMknrB5RJFjguBJ04sGjopHb0UlFqfBdiECPkVs5qbw9QP5e\" width=\"602\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A screenshot of eLearning Activities. EUROCLIO - European Association of History Educators, Design by Nique Sanders, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode\">CC BY-SA</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adaptability in the eLearning environment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adaptability is key in the new eLearning environment. Although historical themes may be common across Europe, they may be taught at different educational stages. Although the eLearning Activities are designed for students between 12 - 18 years, they can be easily made more challenging or more accessible. This could mean providing more or less information about the source or the historical context, or providing or removing additional support in the assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History educators can create their own eLearning Activities by combining building blocks that each have their unique features. Educators will be able to share the resources not only with their students and for their own use, but also with other educators. This is a big step forwards in encouraging Historiana’s users to effectively employ digital heritage in their educational materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"344\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iNl37wpl7M9HuzSDqHjQ_HQxCpPybhiRBDM8MsSJVDPVFdAeM9FSupCxCj6WqrXU-oljSzl9sHHRYw0wFiptBtIvlRrlBzP_26mFwTDI4843n1fSwOOYNmXoAvKiGc-7omdyUMsD\" width=\"602\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A screenshot of the Activity Builder used to create and edit eLearning Activities.

They were developed by the Historiana Teaching and Learning team, a group made up of history educators from six European countries (Croatia, Cyprus, Iceland, Georgia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). All the authors are currently teaching history at school, or are active as trainers of history teachers as part of initial teacher training or continued professional development. Each eLearning Activity has also been peer reviewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"409\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/c_eo4be_EMQSLKSXNYEuIOEf6XzAbw7gL4XtFGfi8gs2Hm2cfzMfhgPL0R7LklyPVfQeMjlQHCAKloOhe-c2Pzbd7mPglf6kLMg8DSdfYbsUdU-xhJayvlzO5VnRFFDfeBW0naEN\" width=\"602\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A screenshot of an eLearning Activity from a student’s perspective.

Together, we wish to \_secure the sustainable financing of Europeana’s platform, products and services. In order to help us achieve these goals, the Commission published a public consultation, which will run from 17 October 2017 until 14 January 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We need your input to shape the future of Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All the organisations and individuals with a personal or professional interest in digital cultural heritage - and in Europeana specifically - are invited to express their opinion, experience, and expectations of Europeana and the various aspects of the platform. We invite you to provide the Commission with your thoughts by taking part in this evaluation. Your answers are highly valuable to us, as they will guide us when setting future goals and priorities for Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit your response in an online questionnaire via <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/europeana\">EUSurvey page</a>, or by clicking on the button below.

        title: 'Charting trends in digitisation of heritage collections: read the ENUMERATE Survey results'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Find out some of the key findings of this large scale research about digitisation in Europe conducted last summer. \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>By Annemieke Arendsen, Communications Officer at DEN Kennisinstituut Digitale Cultuur</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 2017, almost 1,000 European museums, libraries, archives and other heritage institutions filled out the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/enumerate-core-survey-4-make-the-case-for-investments-in-our-digital-activities\">fourth ENUMERATE survey</a> to help us chart current trends in digitisation of European heritage collections. The ENUMERATE project started off in 2009 as NUMERIC, and grew into a series of biennial research efforts. Last year, the survey, which was organised under the umbrella of Europeana DSI-2, was published in twelve languages, and received response from 28 European countries. You can now access the results in the report ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Access\_to Digital Resources of European Heritage</a>.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2017 insights and conclusions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most notable results is the increase in the number of institutions that have a digital strategy: 42% versus 34% in the previous survey conducted in 2015. In 2017, 82% of the respondents have a collection available digitally. Most institutions curate a mix of heritage materials, including text based resources such as letters and books, but also 3D material. On average, 22% of the heritage collections have been digitised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Special thanks to the volunteers!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to conduct such large-scale researches on digitisation in Europe, international cooperation is needed. To do so, each country in which the survey was distributed had a national coordinator providing the questionnaire to as many heritage institutions as possible. These volunteers had a very important role in the process: without their help, conducting the survey wouldn’t have been possible!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Enumerate \" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/enumeratelogo.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the results of the fourth\_ENUMERATE core survey are in line with the findings of the previous ones. This makes us wonder if the timing between the surveys is right. One of the recommendations of the ENUMERATE team is to discuss conducting the survey every four to five years. We are also thinking of changing the way we investigate heritage to focus more on the impact heritage has on the general public. What does heritage mean to people in their daily lives? Europeana is already working on a framework to answer this question, with the recent <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Impact playbook</a>. Including this topic in future ENUMERATE surveys will be an interesting challenge for us too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can read the complete <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">European ENUMERATE-report</a>, and also dig into the results specific to the <a href=\"https://www.den.nl/uploads/5bdafec5e7395339faf97256b2ce41bc87cebed3a3dae.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Netherlands (in Dutch</a>).</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>My passion for open data started when I was working at Statistics Norway as the project leader for a new dissemination tool called<a href=\"http://www.ssb.no/en/statistikkbanken\"> StatBank Norway</a>. It was developed in strong cooperation between the Nordic statistical agencies, and I experienced how efficient and fruitful international cooperation could be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From Norvegiana to Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I studied at Norwegian University of Life Sciences, and I hold a Master of Science in Ecology and Environmental Economics. I have been working with electronic dissemination of cultural heritage data for several years, first with the City Archives of Oslo (since 2006), and the Arts Council Norway, where I worked as a Senior Advisor of Digital Museum Practice from 2012. Last October, I started to work as an Information Architect for the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My work at Arts Council Norway centred around opening up the digital collections of Norwegian museums. An important tool in this work was ‘<a href=\"http://norvegiana.no/\">Norvegiana</a>’, which can be seen as a national equivalent to Europeana. By the end of 2017, there will be about 7.8 million objects in Norvegiana, from more than 300 data providers. Cultural heritage data on Norvegiana can be accessed via an open API. It can be used and developed to create new services for business, tourism, and education, or exported into the international arena, such as Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" Fire Officers sledge.jpg\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/FireOfficerssledge.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2022608/BAR_A_20189_Ub_0001_034.html\"><em>Firefighters on horse sledding, 1890, Oslo City Archive, CC BY-SA</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Towards a strong ecosystem \_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In Norway, many museums share and publish their data via the <a href=\"https://digitaltmuseum.no/\">DigitaltMuseum</a> portal, which currently holds about 2 millions objects. The main access point for this data should be the<a href=\"https://dok.digitaltmuseum.org/en/api\"> DigitalMuseum API</a> – not Europeana. But Europeana can play an major role in training and developing best practices, standards and guidelines needed to improve this service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Councillor, my main ambition is to urge Europeana to keep developing as an infrastructure working tightly with the national aggregators and other data providers. Europeana must be seen as a partner which helps and supports national data providers - and not the other way around. It means that both domain and national aggregators should be considered strong and efficient data managers that Europeana will support in their basic work on cultural heritage data. I believe the ‘core’ work had be be done locally by the different databases. This is why I want to help shaping long term strategic goals for Europeana. Should Europeana exist as the preferred platform and portal for European cultural data? Or should it be used as a tool for the ongoing work in the different countries and projects?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are trying to shape a strong \_ecosystem, Europeana has proven to be an important community for discussions and improvement in the field of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezCulture!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Museums in the Digital Age: how BeMuseum helps Belgium museums connect'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>This Belgian network for innovation in museums wants\_to ‘Bring your museum from the dino’s time to the digital era’.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Founded in 2016, <a href=\"http://www.bemuseum.be/\">BeMuseum </a>is the Belgian network for innovation in museums. It organises an annual conference documenting new trends in the fields of museums, culture, innovation and technology. The second edition of BeMuseum was held at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels in October, focusing on innovation and data sharing with the idea to help ‘Bring your museum from the dino’s time to the digital era’. <strong>Sergio Roberto Gratteri</strong>, Associate, and <strong>Jennifer Beauloye</strong>, Co-founder of BeMuseum and member of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-art-history-advisory-board\">Europeana Art Advisory Board</a>, tell us more about the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is BeMuseum’s purpose?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our purpose is to be a network for Belgian museums and creative industries. We have two ambitions: we want to make the museum sector reflect on how to be more innovative on different levels such as technology, digitalisation, audience engagement and management. \_We also want to be offer them a platform where they can meet with the creative industries. Museums are often looking into new initiatives without having the skills or the right product knowledge. The conference allows them to get together with startups, learn from each other, and have interesting discussions. The creative industries can coach museum professionals, but we want to create long term conversations: we want them to feel part of a network and stay in touch after the conference. It is a very simple idea, but it can prove very effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What led you to set up BeMuseum and who's involved?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>BeMuseum was created two years ago from the understanding that a Belgian network for museum professionals didn’t exist on a national scale. It has become an open community consisting of Belgian institutions of all sizes, startups, experienced companies within the creative industries, and partner organisations active in the museum sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Name of image that will be displayed if image doesn’t load\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/bemuseum2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>BeMuseum conference at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels, \_(c) Collin Maxime</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What trends can we expect to see in Belgian museums in the near future?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum sector is after low budget and user friendly solutions for all digital applications, especially for audience engagement. At the moment they are either very expensive, or difficult to use. The degrowth movement will also get stronger. For the cultural sector, it is about going back to focusing on content for an improved experience, rather than producing and over consuming more and more exhibitions. Recently, museums felt that they were competing with tourist attractions offering several exhibitions and events in one building to attract more visitors. It became tourism. With this approach, you can’t keep up with the quality museums are aiming for. Instead, they are now trying to work more efficiently for targeted groups. That can be in focusing on good applications, support activities, or digitisation processes that will improve the quality the experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What's next for BeMuseum?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re still catching our breath after the last conference! We would like to make the format even more interactive and practical in the future, with a good balance between talks, debates and workshops. Our plan is to have a third conference next year, but we also have the ambition to offer smaller and more regular events, such as thematic meetups, to focus on creating a convivial network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow BeMuseum on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Be_Museum\">Twitter</a> and visit <a href=\"http://www.bemuseum.be/\">bemuseum.be</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>As part of the upcoming Europeana Migration campaign, we highlight more initiatives relating to migration and culture beyond our own network.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Throughout 2018, Europeana Migration will focus on how migration to, from and within Europe has shaped our cultural heritage. On the run up to the campaign launch, we will feature a number of interviews with arts and cultural heritage professionals working on projects related to migration, to shine a light on other initiatives showing the cultural sector’s response to this topic. Many of these projects also relate to digital culture, access to heritage collections, community, inclusivity, copyright, privacy and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To launch the series with a very current topic, we focus on <a href=\"http://www.thealientrail.com\">The Alien Trail</a>, from Cyprus. Sylvia Nicolaides, project curator, co-founder and director of the <a href=\"http://www.piffcyprus.com/\">Paphos International Film Festival</a> introduces us to the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fthealientrail%2Fvideos%2F1998810987056214%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you tell us more about The Alien Trail?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Alien Trail - known as ‘In the footsteps of foreigners’ in Greek - is a project in four parts including a photography exhibition; film workshops with refugees, migrants and Cypriot teenagers; a photography book and a documentary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We created this project to bring awareness of the refugee and migrant population in Cyprus. The first and most important step for Cypriot society is to acknowledge the existence of these unseeable people; and validate that they exist and are real. The Alien Trail intents to make these people visible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us more about the exhibition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition was initially presented in September 2017 in Paphos, as part of the activities organised during 2017 European Capital of Culture. It will open for a second run in the Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre, from 8 to 31 December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It displays the work of four photographers: Nicolas Iordanou, who also co-created the The Alien Trail project, is from Cyprus; and the other three photographers are represented by the Magnum Photo Agency: <a href=\"http://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL53T_6\">Antoine d'Agata</a> from France, <a href=\"http://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535QJL\">Nikos Economopoulos</a> from Greece, and <a href=\"http://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=2K1HRGTPLBN\">Bieke Depoorter</a> from Belgium. Each of them visited Cyprus and photographed refugees and migrants living there from a personal angle. We are planning to publish a photography book compiling all the images from the exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\" The Alien Trail exhibition\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-11/AlieanTrail2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Alien Trail exhibition, photo by Andreas Constantinou</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was the photographers’ approach to this topic?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Antoine d'Agata photographed mostly the streets in Paphos, but also the refugee camp in Kofinou. This camp is also part of Nicos Economopoulos’ series, as well as streets in Nicosia and in Limassol. Bieke Depoorter photographed Syrian families in Paphos. She stayed in their homes, spent time with each family, and chose to give a more intimate take on the issue. Nicolas Iordanou focused on Sadam, a Syrian man living in Paphos, and to document his surroundings: his family, his friends, his workplace. He made Sadam the main protagonist in the pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You worked with Cypriot teenagers, refugees and migrants; how did you involve them?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthropologist Nadina Christopoulou, educator Tereza Markidou and I organised film workshops: we worked with 16 refugees, migrants and Cypriot teenagers to create their own short documentaries. We provided the kids with cameras, and encouraged them to tell their personal stories and choose their own themes. Each child has interpreted ‘Home’ (the central theme of the workshops) in their own way. Our idea was to help them create with a non-verbal language, and focus on a visual approach, to avoid any language barrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How has the project been documented?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicolas Iordanou and I recorded the entire journey we took to explore this issue, documenting the people and families we met, the refugee camps, and more. Also, some extracts of the teenagers' short documentaries were included in the final documentary, sharing their own stories. This documentary will be screened in Paphos for the first time on December 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can visit <a href=\"http://thealientrail.com\">thealientrail.com</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Using computer vision tools for historical newspaper analysis: SIAMESE and Europeana Newspapers'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>An interview with Melvin Wevers, Digital Humanities researcher at KNAW, and Clemens Neudecker, coordinator of Europeana Newspapers</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Melvin Wevers, a researcher in the Digital Humanities Group of the KNAW Humanities Cluster, created —a tool that analyses adverts in historical newspapers—\_together with Juliette Lonij, as a Researcher-in-Residence at the Royal Library of the Netherlands. Clemens Neudecker, a researcher at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz, is working on making Europeana Newspapers —a huge set of historical newspapers—\_available through Europeana Collections. Here, they tell us more about how their areas of expertise come together....</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://libereurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Clemens_Neudecker.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;display:inline;padding-right:10px;\"><img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/melvinwevers-profilepic.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;display:inline;padding-left:10px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about SIAMESE - the tool you’ve developed to analyse images in newspapers.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melvin</strong>: <a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/tool/siamese\">SIAMESE </a>uses machine-learning techniques (like Convolutional Neural Networks and Approximate Nearest Neighbour algorithms) to detect shapes and objects, and search for similar images. For instance, it can recognise visual elements representing a car in an advert, and come up with similar car ads. This technology isn’t new in the world of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision\"> computer vision</a>, but applying it to historical objects brings new challenges and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why are machine learning algorithms useful for Europeana Newspapers?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clemens</strong>: Firstly, Europeana not only stores the metadata about the newspapers, but also the images and the OCR-ed full text. The second big reason is that throughout the project we have arranged for the majority of the content to be licensed as public domain. Both the images and text are openly licensed, and all the metadata is licensed as CC0. Thirdly, the newspapers have a wide variety of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melvin</strong>: I see opportunities in the international scope of Europeana Newspapers. For instance, multinational companies created big advertising campaigns in the past, including newspaper ads for different countries. Looking at how they\_compare and differ based on their local context is interesting to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clemens</strong>: Researchers are keen to use the Europeana Newspapers corpus to conduct transnational comparison work. They find it natural to go to Europeana first instead of going to the national libraries since the data in Europeana is harmonised in a common format and available through a single API. There is a constant influx of new projects, proposals and ideas. Now is the time for Newspapers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What opportunities are there for computer vision in the research of historical sources in general?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melvin</strong>:. Newspaper ads are often combinations of different objects, and being able to identify and classify them would make a large-scale study of historical visual imagery possible. The most important development would be the creation of a set of historical images on which the tools can be trained. To create these complex algorithms, you need a big dataset where all the objects are already labelled by humans: this is a big and complex task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clemens</strong>: Image-based methods\_create\_a lot of possibilities for the analysis of historical newspapers. SIAMESE looks at adverts, but there are a lot of other graphical elements which might facilitate or enable more advanced newspaper analysis. Obituaries, for instance, are graphically unique items in newspapers and are very interesting to the whole family history community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What interesting research have you come across recently that uses computer vision analysis on historical sources? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melvin</strong>: In Switzerland, he <a href=\"https://seguinbe.github.io/2016/12/19/replica-project-status-and-roadmap.html\">Replica </a>project, for instance, analyses historical artworks. There’s also a lot of other interesting research that isn’t historical, but this is mostly due to the fact that we don’t yet have a good training set for analysis of historical data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clemens</strong>: <a href=\"http://oceanicexchanges.org/\">Oceanic Exchanges</a>, is a transatlantic ‘digging into data’ project with partners from the US, Mexico and some European partners including Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and the UK. One of the tools used aims to detect reuse of newspaper articles. The <a href=\"http://impresso-project.ch/\">impresso project</a>, a Swiss-based research project with partners in Luxembourg, enables critical text mining of historical newspaper archives, taking into account multilingual perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are your next projects? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melvin</strong>: I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher and I would like to keep on looking at how ideas and concepts shift through time, and how I can detect those in text and images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clemens</strong>: I’m currently working on making Europeana Newspapers available in Europeana Collections. All the content will be available through IIIF which I’m excited about, and we should be able to launch the Europeana Newspapers thematic collection in the course\_of 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>More information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SIAMESE code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/jlonij/siamese\">GitHub</a>, and you can <a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/tool/siamese#live-demo\">test </a>the tool on the KB labs site. The <a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/dataset/siameset\">dataset </a>of advertisements that was used to train the SIAMESE tool is now also available for reuse by researchers, on request\_access from the Royal Library of the Netherlands.</p>\r\n"

Second,\_the time frame: \_the kick-off weekend is followed by a 6-week long sprint, which allows the teams to develop their idea pitches into exciting prototypes and demos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/codingdavinci/status/922172257962807297\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/CDV2017.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an energetic weekend, projects started to pop up in the event’s <a href=\"https://hackdash.org/dashboards/cdvb17\">hacking dashboard</a> - \_a total of 25 ideas were put forward by various teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Newspapers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being in charge of <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a>, two projects particularly raised my interest:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berliner Schlagzeilen is a Twitter bot that tweets daily front pages and headlines of newspapers from exactly 100 years ago, currently the ‘<a href=\"http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/list/title/zdb/27971740/0/?no_cache=1\">Berliner Volkszeitung</a>’ that was digitised by the <a href=\"http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/\">Berlin State Library</a> and added to Europeana as part of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers</a> project. You can view <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Volkszeitung100\">a demo</a> and access <a href=\"https://github.com/shoutrlabs/berliner-schlagzeilen\">the source</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altpapier (German for ‘waste paper’) is an app that pushes articles from historical digitised newspapers to the user’s device. Because of \_OCR data quality issues and the lack of a fully-featured API, the team had to build their own CMS, API and even an article correction and transcription interface in order to obtain quality data for the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://altpapier-app.de/viewer/\"><img alt=\" \" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/altpapier.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Users can select a newspaper issue via a calendar, browse the pages and mark any article on a page in order to be presented with the OCRed fulltext. One can then correct/transcribe the article and enrich it further with keywords. The cleaned articles are then pushed to the app. A version for Android is already available, a version for iOS will be released soon. You can download it from the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=oldnews.de.oldnews\">Google Play Store</a> and access <a href=\"https://github.com/mariabecker/OldNews\">the source</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://altpapier-app.de/viewer/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/altpapierapp.jpg\" style=\"\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How good is your API?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, work is currently underway to refactor and relaunch both <a href=\"http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/\">ZEFYS</a>, the newspaper portal of the Berlin State Library, as well as the <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers\">Europeana Newspapers portal</a>, which is soon to be re-launched as a Europeana thematic collection. As a result, both platforms currently don’t provide the API features required by these projects, such as</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Ability to retrieve OCR full-text</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Ability to retrieve image snippets</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Retrieve metadata in JSON format</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Ability to retrieve individual articles</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Ability to retrieve headlines</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>While (4) and (5) are issues inherent in the data itself and cannot easily be resolved without touching or reprocessing the source, items (1), (2) and (3) will soon be supported by both, Europeana and the Berlin State Library. What’s even nicer, since both platforms will be compatible with <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF</a>, many more use cases and applications can be supported in the future via those APIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2017 Awards</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After an exciting but exhausting 6-week sprint following the kick-off on 21-22 October, the project teams and data providers rejoined for the award ceremony on 2 December at the <a href=\"https://www.jmberlin.de/\">Jewish Museum Berlin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/codingdavinci/status/929021326496600064\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/CDV4.jpg\" style=\"\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coding da Vinci jury awarded a total of six prizes in these categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The most technical: <a href=\"http://mauar.de/\">MauAR</a> - augmented reality tour guide of the Berlin Wall</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The most useful: <a href=\"http://humboldt-kosmos.oklab-potsdam.de/\">Exploring the hidden Kosmos</a> - text comparisons and readouts of Humboldt’s Kosmos lectures</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The best design: <a href=\"http://norboy.de/\">Bertuchs Bilderspiel</a> - interactive online game for children</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The funniest hack: <a href=\"https://github.com/haxorpoda/bug-cruncher\">Haxorpoda</a> - bug sorting by shapes and colors</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Out of competition: <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomra/berlinbot-codingdavinci\">Marbles of Remembrance</a> - chatbot of Jewish life in Berlin during the Nazi period</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Everybody’s darling: <a href=\"https://cdv-skelex.github.io/\">Skelex</a> - explore digitized snake heads by means of virtual reality</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We invite you to have a look at the projects, find some inspiration, get yourself an Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/get-api\">API key</a> and start hacking/designing/playing!</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>This is the last blog in a series dedicated to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/make-it-festive\" target=\"_blank\">end-of-the-year festivities</a> and highlighting Europeana content that can inspire festive creative reuse by makers.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no better way of expressing love and other good feelings than a thoughtfully written message. A timeless practice, sending holiday cards is a caring way to wish a <strong>Happy New Year</strong> to family and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their designs, these joyful cards usually highlight end-of-the-year traditions, objects and figures, as well as winter elements. Below, we present you with beautiful images to inspire personalised messages of good fortune and best wishes. We hope <strong>makers</strong> will feel encouraged to put their creativity into action and remix digital cultural heritage in new designs, businesses or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Greet your loved ones and spread the holiday spirit by using exciting open content from Europeana Collections!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Winter Wonderland</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Snowmen, reindeers, Santa Claus and cozy nights at home. The cold weather of the season (at least in the North Hemisphere of the world) is a recurrent theme in greeting cards. Check out our dedicated\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/winter-wonderland\" target=\"_blank\">gallery</a> and <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/winter-wonderland/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest board</a> for scenes in paintings, photographs, drawings and more of how people celebrate and enjoy life when the weather gets colder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are fond of snow, take a look at the two distinct scenes below: a group of kids playing with snowballs and a woman walking in the snow. They convey two different sensations evoked by the cold weather: playfulness and solitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/snowballfight.jpg\" style=\"width: 410x; height: 267px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2021659/1969_0404.html\" target=\"_blank\">5 toverlantaarnplaatjes</a> (...).

Hasui, Kawase Watanabe Shôzaburô. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas mornings are a special time for the exchange of gifts among families. Take a look at a tender scene below: children and their gifts in front of a fireplace in a Christmas morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/xmasmorning.jpg\" style=\"width: 560x; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2024914/photography_ProvidedCHO_Ajuntament_de_Girona_348781.html?q=christmas\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas morning American Stereoscopic Company.</a> Desconegut.

Get heavenly vibes with the postcard below, dating from the early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/image.jpg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 623px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026107/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_www_esbirky_cz_GS_18401_6.html?q=Art+Nouveau\" target=\"_blank\">Pohlednice vánoční</a>.

It features a central boat with sails surrounded by Art Nouveau style waves of flowers and leaves, in black and white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/xmascard.jpeg\" style=\"width: 560x; height: 417px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2026101/Partage_Plus_ProvidedCHO_Museum_of_Domestic_Design___Architecture__Middlesex_University_SD1560.html\" target=\"_blank\">Christmas card design</a>.

        title: 'European Culture Forum: kicking off the European Year of Cultural Heritage and the Europeana Migration campaign'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Cultural sectors' key players gathered in Milan to discuss possibilities for cultural collaboration during the European Year of Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>‘Our Heritage: where our past meets our future’: this was the slogan of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/event/forum-2017_en#section0\">European Culture Forum in Milan</a>, the biennial flagship event organised by the European Commission held on 7 and 8 December, which also marked the official kick off for the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Over 2 days, 800 cultural sectors' key players got together for fruitful exchanges on European cultural cooperation. Such was the importance of the event to the sector that hundreds more professionals joined the proceedings by live link in a second venue close by. As the digital face of the Year, Europeana was a key part of these conversations: here are some of the highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Working together on cultural cooperation in Europe</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 2018, The European Year of Cultural Heritage will put the spotlight on Europe's wealth of cultural heritage to enable people to become closer to and more involved with their shared cultural heritage. Tibor Navracsics, European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, officially declared the European year of Cultural Heritage open, highlighting the need for cooperation to bring thousands of initiatives and events to people across Europe: <em>‘We need to preserve and treasure our cultural heritage for the next generations. This year of celebrations will be a wonderful opportunity to encourage people, especially young people, to explore Europe's rich cultural diversity. It allows us to understand the past and to build our future.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘My story, our heritage’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because this Year is for all generations of Europeans, a series of testimonials entitled <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana19141918/videos/1554387717960444/\">My story, Our heritage</a> invited younger people to share their experience of how cultural heritage has impacted their lives. Clara Röpke, a 17-year-old highschool student from Berlin, who hopes to become an archaeologist, flew the flag for Europeana1914-1918.eu. Taken by her school teacher to the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/news/europeana-transcribathon-campus-berlin-2017/\">Transcribathon Campus in Berlin</a>, she became addicted to transcribing as a means of making the First World War come alive <em>‘I approached the programme with an interest in history, but I didn’t anticipate what an impact old letters would make. The story I discovered was not just data, it touched me on a personal level.</em>’ She worked on the transcription of the story of a man barely older than her during WW1. On becoming an adult, he was forced to give up his dream of taking over his father’s restaurant and join the war effort. He survived the war, but coming home four years later, the restaurant didn't exist anymore, his dream had been crashed.<em> ‘This got me thinking about how we learn history in school, and the crucial details we often tend to forget. These were people with thoughts and feelings, and we can still learn from them. These stories need to be preserved. How are we supposed to make the best of our future if we don’t regard the past with care?’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Building up a collection dedicated to European Migration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Emphasizing the role that digital can play in making our cultural heritage accessible, she mentioned that the EU has been very visionary in providing the money for digitisation and for Europeana - We lead and are copied across the the world. \_She went on to say participation is not exceptional but normal - taking the words of Professor Sacco <em>‘if we don’t socialise people into production we are missing the point…’ </em>\_She said we need to empower people to geotag our monuments, to describe musical genre’s so that our old sound recordings are actually retrievable online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu/status/938747266202001409\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/EYCHJill.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To encourage people’s participation in the European Year of Cultural Heritage across Europe, Europeana announced the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration collection</a>. Inviting people to contribute with their families memorabilia, this collaborative digital project aims to show that culture is the product of multicultural influences down the centuries: <em>‘We are all made up of multiple cultural influences. With Europeana Migration, we will collect these personal stories and combine them with material held in museums, galleries and archives to create a culture for the future’.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/montemannion/status/938713757374656512\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/EYCHAleks.jpg\" style=\"\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GIF IT UP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Forum also presented the opportunity to showcase both openly licensed content from Europeana and the creative possibilities for its re-use to the 1000+ plus audience. At key points on the opening day, three specifically created animated slideshows featuring GIFs made using Europeana content and submitted to the international <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/09/gif-it-up-2017/\">GIF IT UP 2017 competition</a> were shown in the main plenary hall, literally bringing cultural heritage alive for the audience. \_And Europeana’s social media lead:\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/aleksandra-strzelichowska\">Aleksandra Strelichowska </a>was on hand to share with the audience the importance of opening up heritage to encourage others to share and create with it.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/243142191\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/243142191\">GIF Show 1</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event was live tweeted and\_you can rediscover the threads with the hashtags <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EuropeForCulture&amp;src=typd\">#EuropeForCulture</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CultureForumEU&amp;src=typd\">#CultureForumEU</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Two concrete case studies for exploring big archival data</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Pascal Dugenie, Research engineer at CINES, <a href=\"https://www.clariah.nl/over/wie-is-wie/wp2/daan-broeder\">Daan Broeder</a>, CLARIAH linguistics Tech Coordinator at CLARIAH and EUDAT Community Outreach Officer, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nuno-freire\">Nuno Freire</a>, Senior Researcher at INESC-ID, published a research paper on using big data for archival research with Europeana and HERBADROP as case studies.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper presents new approaches to the domain of computational archival science. Coupling emerging digital methods and big data technologies with archival practices poses new possibilities in research using platforms like Europeana and Herbadrop. Both Europeana and Herbadrop leverage the cultural heritage content within the Europeana Data (EUDAT) research infrastructure. In the paper, Europeana is used as a case study to showcase these new possibilities for big data research. More specifically, the Europeana Case Study explored the possibilities offered by achieving interoperability between the EUDAT infrastructure and Europeana Newspapers. These results, along with the results of the HERBADROP case study, were presented at the <a href=\"http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2017/\">IEEE International Conference on Big Data</a> on 13 December 2017.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/NunoFreire2/building-new-knowledge-from-distributed-scientific-corpus-herbadrop-europeana-two-concrete-case-studies-for-exploring-big-archival-data\">find the Slides to their workshop here</a>.

        body: "<p><strong>Starting with the Members Council</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, elected representatives of the Association, came together on 5 December in the spectacular <a href=\"http://www.museoscienza.org/english/\">Leonardo da Vinci's Science and Technology Museum</a> in Milan for their third meeting of 2017. The meeting started with a debrief of the work of Task Forces and Working Groups throughout the year, and marked the approval of two new Task Force proposals: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13IeiLdY-lFEA0whyU3TxFzsks1_TVxasRwZ4Oh-epQI/edit\">Europeana Migration</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Suvr4Urfz8VOfVewKrNDD5293FegkKufIXNRWVzbWFc/edit\">Impact Assessment no.2</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward, the Councillors were presented with the draft Association Business Plan and budget for 2018, and introduced to the 2018 Europeana #AllezCulture <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/contribute-your-collections-on-europe-s-migration-heritage\">Migration campaign</a>. \_They also discussed the outlook for 2018 on the structure of the Association. They brainstormed on ways of engaging the Network and supporting the Association activities related to the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a> (EYCH). In support of the Migration campaign and 2018 EYCH, the Council took part in the creation of a tweet bank on the template ‘My favourite food/music/art is ___ @EuropeanaEU’, including the dedicated hashtags #Migration=Culture #EuropeForCulture.<br><br><strong>Impact assessment and project pitch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To launch the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/agm2017\">AGM</a> the next morning, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, Chair of the Europeana Network Association, warmly welcomed the 200 guests with an introduction of the programme focused on the ‘impact of culture on society’ and how it can be measured. The event kicked-off with a welcome speech by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/fiorenzo-galli\">Fiorenzo Galli</a>, Director of the Leonardo da Vinci Science and Technology Museum, and <a href=\"http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;nodeID=3404232&amp;personID=433830\">Gail Kent</a>, representative of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en\">European Commission</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first session dedicated to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Europeana Impact Framework.</a> Europeana’s Deputy Director, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry Verwayen</a>, presented \_the newly published <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-impact-assessment-playbook\">Impact playbook</a> methodology and invited <a href=\"http://www.iulm.it/wps/wcm/connect/iulmit/iulm-it/docenti/sacco-pierluigi\">Pier Luigi Sacco</a>, Professor from IULM University of Milan and Harvard University, to give a presentation on the value of culture from the point of view of cultural economics research.

Although they were all amazing, the Network members awarded Frank Drauschke for his <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/transcribathon-winner-uncovers-the-human-perspective-of-war\">Transcribathon</a>, a crowdsourcing initiative for transcription and annotation of the unpublished material collected in Europeana 1914-1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More inspiring projects were put in the spotlight: Iulian Măcreanu, the winner of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-winners-of-the-wikimedia-1914-18-europeana-challenge\">Europeana Wiki challenge</a>, shared his story and impressions, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> said a few words about the activities of her organisation, <a href=\"http://www.culturaitalia.it/\">CulturaItalia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>General Assembly 2017</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event continued with the General Assembly, chaired by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a>. Merete Sanderhoff reflected on highlights of the Association activities in 2017, and outlined the priorities for 2018.

Network members were asked to share their predictions on what digital will bring to the Year, and to answer a quiz coordinated by Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/susan-hazan\">Susan Hazan</a>. We wrapped up the session by successfully launching the <a href=\"https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/64703-launch-of-eych-2018\">#AllezCulture Thunderclap</a> Europeana supports the 2018 EYCH, #SoDoWe’ - it released 340 tweets (136% of our goal!) that reached over 400,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big thank you goes to all of you who came and actively contributed to this very fruitful event.

        title: 'Presenting Impact at the Europeana Network Association AGM'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The 2017 Europeana Network Association AGM was dedicated to exploring the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/PYHTth\">impact</a> of digital cultural heritage - from a student transcribing the writing of their predecessors, to the museum professional striving to find a digital audience for their beautifully crafted art book. We heard how engaging with the past through digital heritage can improve the lives of dementia sufferers and bring artists, communities and businesses together in public spaces. In this blog we’d like to share everything we saw and heard, and the learning and inspiration we took home with us.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>New perspectives for assessing impact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day began with a keynote from renowned cultural economist Professor Pier Luigi Sacco, who introduced the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-network-association-agm-2017-6-december-the-value-of-culture\">Culture 3.0 paradigm</a>. He argues that the blurring of production and consumption - where the consumer now increasingly partakes in production and benefits from doing so - requires a new perspective on the types of values produced, and a refreshed and more strategic approach in the policy areas where cultural spillovers can be found. He discussed several examples, including innovation, sustainability and well-being, traditionally softer’ policy areas, where cultural activity can have a significant macroeconomic impact (for example, after major disease, cultural participation was as important a predictor of psychological well-being as income).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry Verwayen</a>, deputy director of Europeana Foundation, followed with a presentation of the research we carried out into the impact of Europeana for GLAMs and individual users. He presented a <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-network-association-agm-2017-6-december-impkt-at-the-agm\">review</a> of the development and implementation of the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/36xzwx4tnn0va8y/Europeana%20Impact%20Playbook.pdf?dl=1\">Europeana Impact playbook</a>, and the response we’ve received so far (very positive!). Finally, Harry announced our plans for the development of the final parts of the playbook, guiding the user through assessment, narration and evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Putting theory into practice: an interactive impact assessment session</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For many, the highlight of the day was finding out how they can understand the impact of their own projects and those of their peers. To put this in practice, we asked the audience to become part of the ‘impact assessment team’ and to provide live feedback on 10 project pitches specially selected out of the 25 applications we received in response to our call for projects (you can read more about the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/europeana-network-association-agm-2017-6-december-pitch-your-project-project-highlights-agm-2018-milan\">other potential pitchers</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the successful pitchers had 5 minutes to present the project’s core aims, beneficiaries and outcomes, demonstrating expected impact for stakeholders in areas like health, education, social cohesion, urban planning, the economy, and more. Find out who presented in the following slidedeck and see their full presentations on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/tag/agm-2017/2\">Slideshare</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/4lweiDGMiEZ9ac\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\r\n<strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/Europeana/impact-pitches-at-the-europeana-agm-2017\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Impact pitches at the Europeana AGM 2017\">Impact pitches at the Europeana AGM 2017</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana</a></strong>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The pitches were punctuated by panel sessions featuring Harry, Pier Luigi and members of<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-assessment\"> the impact task force</a>. Questions from the audience were answered during the first panel, \_ranging from queries as to how to the playbook could help satisfy the impact demands of donors; the relationship between economics and assessing the impact of heritage; involving and monitoring the impact of individual participation; and the role of evidence in policy, practice, and accountability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/audiencequestions.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 400px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>audience questions captured via interactive tool Mentimeter during Pier Luigi and Harry’s speeches.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The task force <a href=\"https://twitter.com/urbandigits/status/938377535758438400\">shared their experience</a> of applying impact assessment design to their work. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, of the Statens Museum for Kunst, shared how raising the profile of the impact of <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/about-smk/camp00/\">SMK Open</a> helps them connect with different stakeholders from funders through to different parts of the organisation. Marco Rendina explained that exploring the impact of Europeana Fashion brought new insights and perspective on how their work delivered value for their stakeholders. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AGM audience then had the difficult job of selecting a ‘winning’ project via Mentimeter, the interactive tool we used throughout the day. It was a close call, but congratulations to <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/\">Europeana Transcribathon</a>! Frank Drauschke, who leads the initiative, presented a fantastic case for supporting the wide impact the project can have, including in education, for heritage organisations, for individuals and communities. Europeana Transcribathon will now be supported by Europeana staff to carry out an impact assessment in 2018. We’d like to sincerely thank all of the pitchers who wowed the audience with their passionate pitches and powerful project ideas, and we invite them to stay in touch as they continue their impact journeys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The playbook has been designed to help capture and narrate this impact, and so we invite you to test it and tell us what you think. There is a lot more to come! Sign up to the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017\">LinkedIn group</a> and join our <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/cKyba5\">mailing list</a> and stay up to date as we work with Europeana Transcribathon and deliver the next stages of the playbook in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"storify\">\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"750\" src=\"//storify.com/Europeana/agm-impact/embed?border=false\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>[<a href=\"//storify.com/Europeana/agm-impact\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Europeana AGM: Impact\" on Storify</a>]</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Have your say: Has the PSI directive helped to make more cultural heritage available for reuse?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In 2013, the European Union amended the Public Sector Information Directive (PSI \_Directive) which deals with access to information held by public sector bodies. <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2003L0098:20130717:EN:PDF\">The amended directive</a> established the principle that all available information produced and collected by public sector institutions must be made available for reuse under open terms and conditions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Opening up cultural data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, the amendments to the directive also included the publicly funded libraries (including university libraries), museums and archives into the scope of the directive. As a result, publicly funded libraries, archives and museums in the European Union have to make works and information that they have in their collections available for reuse unless these are covered by third-party intellectual property rights. To put it the other way around, they must make available for re-use all works and information that is in the public domain or for which they hold the copyright. The directive leaves it up to cultural heritage institutions if they want to charge for reuse of the materials they provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Help measure the PSI directive</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-legislation-reuse-public-sector-information\">is now reviewing the impact of the directive</a>. Since the inclusion of cultural heritage institutions in its scope was one of the most substantial changes of the 2013 amendment, the European Commission has hired <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/\">Deloitte</a> to map impact of the directive on the opening up and reuse of cultural data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deloitte has produced a short (15 questions) <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/culturaldataPSI\">survey for libraries, archives and museums</a>. We encourage all our data partners to fill in this survey to help the European Commission to better understand the concerns of cultural heritage institutions when it comes to making their collections available for reuse. Given the fairly recent entry into force of the directive, it seems unlikely that many cultural heritage institutions will have extensive experiences with the PSI directive to report. In the light of <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2014/11/03/new-policy-paper-on-the-re-use-of-public-sector-information-in-cultural-heritage-institutions/\">concerns raised right after the adoption that the PSI directive would not necessarily contribute to wider availability of cultural heritage</a>, it is important to measure its impact so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have your say and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/culturaldataPSI\">fill in the survey until 15 January 2018</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Announcing Europeana Migration, a collaborative project focused on the cultural heritage of migration'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As the international community is observing International Migrants day, we tell you more about Europeana’s next campaign led across borders and generations</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/events/migrantsday/index.shtml\">International Migrants Day</a> was proclaimed by the United Nations in December 2000. At a time when the word ‘migrant’ is often accompanied by the word ‘crisis’, we at Europeana are focusing our 2018 activities on gathering and enriching Europe’s cultural heritage relating to migration in cooperation with museums and the people of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Making Europe richer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From folklore and traditions to visual arts, our cultural heritage shows us that the Europe we inhabit today is the result of a flow of people and ideas, and that migration is woven through our everyday lives. As a pan-European campaign encouraging us all to think of migration differently, Europeana Migration will promote values of diversity and inclusivity: in looking at migration to and from Europe historically, we’ll show that how the geographical moving of people has made culture richer, and even more than that, that migration is intrinsic to what it means to be European.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are countless examples of famous immigrants whose artistic and scientific works made a huge contribution to their immediate society: illustrious scientist and artists Albert Einstein, Piet Mondrian and Victor Hugo are some of them. An article entitled <a href=\"http://www.iicbruxelles.esteri.it/iic_bruxelles/it/gli_eventi/cartaditalia/cartaditalia-edizione-speciale.html\">‘Making Europe: Cultural heritage campaign to show migration is part of the European identity’</a>, published in Cartaditalia, tells you more about their personal journeys and contributions to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our thematic collection, Europeana Migration, will bring together collections dedicated to the theme of migration to, from and within Europe. <a href=\"http://migration.europeana.eu\">An alpha version</a> is already online, gathering just under 200,000 objects from more than 750 museums, galleries, libraries, audio-visual archives and archives across Europe. Throughout 2018, our intention is to build this collection by improving and adding content from cultural heritage institutions across Europe. New content will be sourced and digitised via partners in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-new-migration-in-the-arts-and-sciences-generic-services-project\">Migration in the arts and sciences project</a>, dedicated migration museums, our network of existing Europeana data providers, and new providers. Does your organisation hold collections relating to migration? <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/contribute-your-collections-on-europe-s-migration-heritage\">Read more on how you can contribute your collections!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collections days across Europe</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in December 2017<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/european-culture-forum-kicking-off-the-european-year-of-cultural-heritage-and-the-europeana-migration-campaign\"> at the European Culture Forum</a>, the campaign will provide many opportunities for the public to get involved and share their own stories. From spring 2018, a series of collection days will begin. The first will take place at the House of European History, Brussels, and further events will continue in migration museums, libraries and archives across Europe. The events will invite members of the public to contribute personal memorabilia telling stories from their own lives and their family history. These contributions will live alongside the resources from institutions collections across Europe in the <a href=\"http://migration.europeana.eu\">Europeana Migration Collection</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/Johnsson.jpeg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/15801/eDipRouteurBML_eDipRouteurBML_aspx_Application_AFFL_26Action_RechercherDirectement_NUID___6571__AFFL_3BAfficherVueSurEnregistrement_Vue_Fiche_Principal_3BAfficherFrameset.html?q=emigrant\"><em>Ingeborg Johnsson, who emigrated to America in 1901 Nordiska museet, Stockholm Public Domain</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Online activities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From photos to films and letters to artworks, these digitised artefacts will tell genuine stories of migrants, unveiling the personal and human side of migration waves. Building up a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/migration\">thematic collection</a> of digital content related to the topic of migration, these resources will be available for free for anyone to use for work, learning or pleasure. European citizens, across borders and generations, will be encouraged to explore the material already held in Europeana through online galleries, but also to contribute their own content and join conversations on social media with the hashtags #EuropeanaMigration and #EuropeForCulture .</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The cultural sector and migration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To shine a light on other initiatives showing the cultural sector’s response to this topic, we have our Mapping Migration in the Arts blog series. Kicking off the series, an interview with director of the Paphos International Film Festival introduced us to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mapping-migration-in-arts-the-alien-trail\">The Alien Trail</a>, a four-part project bringing awareness of the refugee and migrant population in Cyprus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>I’m happy to announce the results of the 2017 Europeana Network Association Members Council elections. We had 26 fantastic candidates who came forward in this year’s elections, and our Network Association members chose eight\_of them to fill open seats in our Members Council \_between 6 and 14 December.</p>\r\n"

Out of 1,440 members, who <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/let-s-make-next-key-decisions-together-renew-your-membership\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed their membership</a> by November 2017 and were eligible to vote, 634 participated in the elections.

The new Members Council is composed of 36 elected representatives who will start working together on 1 January 2018 and hold their first meeting in spring to draw up future priorities for the Association.<br><br><strong>Thank you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to to thank all the candidates who ran for this election, and hope to see you keep being active Network members and campaigning again in the future!

        title: 'Meet the winners of the Europeana Research Grants Programme 2017'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We're thrilled to announce our three Grants Winners for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/grants-programme\">Europeana Research Grants Programme</a> 2017, together with the short list of promising proposals.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 28 September the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-grants-programme-2017-call-for-submissions-and-guidelines-for-applicants\">Call for Proposals</a> for the second Europeana Research Grants Programme officially opened, and ran until 12 November. This year's Grants Programme invited researchers from all over Europe to send in research proposals connected to the theme of intercultural dialogue. The response was overwhelming, with more than 60 proposals sent in from\_21 different countries and 45 different research institutions.\_Check the visualization below to discover the diversity in\_this year's applicants!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The grants winners</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After four rounds of reviews by the Europeana Research team and the Europeana Research Advisory Board, three proposals were selected for funding from a short list of seven. We are happy to announce and extend our congratulations to\_<strong>Caterina Preda, Krista Murchison, and Margaret Quinn.</strong>\_Here is a quick overview of their proposals:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Caterina Preda -</strong>\_<strong>A visual tool for the display of the visual representations of the Roma of Romania in the 19th and 20th centuries in the Europeana collections: between stereotypes and truthfulness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project provides a web platform, which includes the visual representations of the Roma of the Romanian territories as they appear in the Europeana collection in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’ depictions. This web-platform will be used as a didactic tool in the classroom, in high school and university level courses. The research investigates the ways in which the stereotypical repetitive representations of the Roma help explain the current underprivileged situation of this community in Europe and in Romania in particular. The project argues for a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of a largely unknown history by using visual representations taken from the archives of the libraries, which are included in the Europeana collections. The web platform uses several categories and by this classification, helps bring forward the visual mechanisms that have helped consolidate the images of the 'romantic', 'exotic', 'other'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr.\_Caterina Preda is an Assistant Professor at the\_Faculty of Political Science, University of Bucharest in Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Krista Murchison -\_A Digital Database of Manuscripts and Intercultural Dialogue in Post-Conquest England</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project will draw on Europeana data to take a new approach to the status of French writing following the Conquest. It will create and analyse an EDM-compliant digital database of all 958 manuscripts containing French literature from medieval England. By providing unprecedented quantitative evidence for the persistence of French among lay and clerical audiences alike in the centuries following the Conquest, this project will contribute to an urgent and growing body of linguistic scholarship (Lusignan 2011; Ingham 2012; Wogan-Browne 2015) and socio-historical studies (Rothwell 1994; Georgianna 1998; Butterfield 2009; Ingham 2010) that has exposed factual and ethical flaws in the 'triumph' of English narrative and highlight medieval England’s multifaceted intercultural dialogue.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Krista A. Murchison is Lecturer of Medieval English Literature at the\_Leiden University Centre for the Arts in Society in the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Margaret Quinn -\_</strong>\_<strong>An Intercultural History of Northern Ireland: Mapping Intercultural Exchange and Inter-dependency from 1600 to Modern Day</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through an analysis of resources deriving from the Europeana Collections content, and other historical documentation, this project will construct the intercultural history of Northern Ireland from 1600 to present day.\_The final outcome of the project will be an interactive, open access website that presents the intercultural historical narrative of Northern Irelands from 1600 to present day. The primary objective of the project is to create an online, easy access learning and development tool which can be utilised by schools, community groups and cultural organisations to facilitate intercultural dialogue, and enable the development of intercultural competencies that can directly impact on the broader intercultural community of Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Margaret Quinn is a PhD Candidate at Ulster University in Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The shortlist of promising proposals</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last round of reviews, the three final projects were selected from a shortlist of seven. These projects are all promising and unique in their own way, and deserve being mentioned for all the effort and time that was put into constructing them. Here are the four proposals that, together with the three grants winners, constitute the shortlist.\_In no specific order:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Matteo Romanello</strong> - Linked Books: Towards a Serendipity Engine for the Humanities and Social Sciences<br><strong>Néhémie Strupler</strong> - Cuneiform radaR<br><strong>Sofia Alexopoulou</strong> - A photography, a thousand words?<br><strong>Rachele Sprugnoli</strong> - Interculturality in Historical Travel Writing: Seeing Italian Culture Through Travellers’ Eyes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to everyone who sent in a proposal for this year's Grants Programme. The projects of the three funded researchers will start in January 2018, keep an eye on the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/academic-research\"> Europeana Research page</a> to find updates on these projects and for more news on Europeana Research Grants Programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe height=\"955\" src=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/EuropeanaGrantsProgramme2017ApplicantAgegroupsandLocations/Dashboard1?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Open access insights from the Finnish National Gallery'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of our series dedicated to museums opening up their collections, we speak to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanna-leena-paloposki-916b2556\">Hanna-Leena Paloposki</a>, Chief Curator and Archive &amp; Library Manager at the Finnish National Gallery</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>You recently spent a two-month professional residency at Europeana. How did this come about?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kansallisgalleria.fi/en/\">Finnish National Gallery</a> (FNG) has always supported international partnerships and, in 2016, it started its own professional residency programme. I submitted a successful application and was keen on learning more about the online availability of cultural heritage collections, open data and international collaboration in the field. My manager Riitta Ojanperä, Director of Collections Management, suggested Europeana: I immediately became excited by the idea. Not being a museum and not having its own collections, I thought that Europeana would give me fresh perspectives on the accessibility of collections on a pan-European scale – and I haven’t been disappointed!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What motivated you to create <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/an-ecstasy-of-beauty\">An Ecstasy of Beauty</a>?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I discussed various project ideas with fellow art historian <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy\">Douglas McCarthy</a>, Europeana’s Collections Manager (Art &amp; Photography), and we quickly agreed that I would create an online exhibition for Europeana. I wanted to combine artworks and the wonderful archive collections of the Finnish National Gallery with other material available in Europeana. I was also interested in connecting Finnish artists to the international phenomenon of artists’ travels, and decided to focus on the journeys of five Finnish artists beyond Europe. Through these artists’ eyes and the prism of this era, visitors to the online exhibition can go on a journey to \_Africa, America and the Caucasus, and discover their views about native cultures. I think this topic is also relevant to Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-new-migration-in-the-arts-and-sciences-generic-services-project\">Migration</a> campaign and to Europeana’s outward-looking, international ethos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/Simbergin.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lahteilla.fi/simberg/#fi/line/2896/40018_912/theme/1034\"><em>Hugo Simberg, 1902 photograph of a model for the painting The Wounded Angel, Hugo Simberg Archive, Finnish National Gallery</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who was involved in making the exhibition?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Producing an exhibition is always a team effort and An Ecstasy of Beauty was no exception. Douglas was involved from the start: we discussed my ideas and the manuscript throughout the process, and his input was very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exhibition producer <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/malgorzata-szynkielewska\">Małgorzata Szynkielewska</a> provided helpful feedback on my manuscript and image choices, and she made a crucial contribution to the exhibition. During my stay, upgraded data from the Gallery’s art collections, with higher-quality images, were ingested into Europeana by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pierre-edouard-barrault\">Pierre-Edouard Barrault</a>, Data ingestion specialist. Pierre worked carefully to optimise the new FNG data and our collaboration gave me valuable insight into the ingestion process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who’s your favourite artist in the exhibition?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That would be Hugo Simberg (1873-1917). I have always liked his artworks and they’ve become even more meaningful since I catalogued the archive that his son donated to the Gallery. I’ve had the opportunity to work on Simberg projects such as a major exhibition and publication by the Ateneum Art Museum in 2000, the <a href=\"http://www.lahteilla.fi/simberg/\">website</a> dedicated to Simberg’s photographs and letters from the FNG archive, and the<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/finnishnationalgallery/sets/72157649370205747/\"> publication of his photos</a> under a CC-BY licence. Simberg was a very interesting person, with a close connection to his family. His oeuvre speaks to me – especially the angels, demons and death figures – but An Ecstasy of Beauty shows another side of his work. My favourite exhibition item is the postcard he sent to his sister Elsa from Caucasus in 1899, because it demonstrates how archival material can complement artworks in telling a story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/Kuva.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fi/record/2021012/app_si_C_VI_2548_3A45.html?q=Hugo+Simberg\"><em>Emäntä ja piruparka kaksosineen, 1907, Hugo Simberg, Finnish National Gallery</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Ecstasy of Beauty is available in Finnish and English. Why is it important for non-Finnish speakers to learn about these artists?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was clear from the start that I would write the exhibition in English. The Finnish National Gallery and its associated websites publish a great amount of material in three languages: Finnish, Swedish and English. But Europeana offers a good chance to reach even more audiences and viewers from all around the world, increasing international visibility. It gives us one more way to connect Finnish cultural heritage to that of other European countries, and to showcase it in an excellent and active international context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/an-ecstasy-of-beauty\">The Ecstasy of Beauty</a> exhibition on Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>by Camille Tenneson</em></p>\r\n"

        title: 'The story of Marin Gogoloi: a ’Wiki-Europeana’ odyssey of a World War I soldier'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In October, Members of Romania’s Wikimedia community received the overall prize in \_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-the-winners-of-the-wikimedia-1914-18-europeana-challenge\">the Wikimedia 1914-18 Europeana Challenge</a> for their portfolio of work. Măcreanu Iulian was the Coordinator of the Wikimedians of Romania portfolio and spoke at the recent Europeana AGM in Milan about a specific image he came across during the competition. He tells us the touching story behind it...</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In August 1916, Romania entered in war against the Central Powers. In turn, Germany decided to send the 9th Army on the new Romanian Front. Together with the elite German unit was Albert Reich, a young painter working as a front reporter who, later on, would became famous. During the course of the Romanian campaign he produced more than 100 engravings, not only depicting scenes from the front, but also people, villages and landscapes. In 1917, Reich published a book of his engravings, Durch Siebenbürgen und Rumänien, which remained mostly unnoticed in the aftermath of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, as part of a europeana project, the Berlin State Library digitised the book, and made it available to the public. Recently, our team of Wikipedia Romania extracted and annotated individual images from the book, published the story on Europeana 1914-18, and transferred the images to Wikimedia Commons. One of them represented a young Romanian soldier taken prisoner by the German troops. Looking closely at the photo, I found out that that particular soldier was named Marin Gogoloi, from Romanian 56th Infantry Regiment according to the plate number of his cap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/gogoloi.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1916_-_Albert_Reich_-_generic,_soldat_roman_prizonier_p42.jpg\"><em>Albert Reich, generic, soldat roman prizonier, public domain</em></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I became intrigued, and I made an inquiry to the Romanian Military Archives. They confirmed that the soldier Marin Gogoloi did exist, and provided us with his birthplace, a remote village in the county of Suceava. We emailed the mayor of that commune, asking if they could provide any further information about the soldier. To our surprise, they answered that Marin Gogoloi did live there, before moving to another village where he died around 1960. They also identified a grandson of \_Gogoloi – currently aged about 75, who confirmed that he was the man from the photo. The family didn’t have any other picture of him, and the Albert Reich engraving is now their only pictorial memory of their ancestor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2017-12/wikimedians.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our big world is made of billions of small worlds: if we can have impact on a family or even one person, it means we can change the world with culture. It also changes the perspectives over the people and events. Marin Gogoloi is no longer the humble Romanian soldier made prisoner of war; he is now connected with history, being immortalized by a German painter, and his portrait is available to millions of users of Europeana and Wikimedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about Romanian Wikimedia community’s participation in the Wikimedia 1914-18 Europeana Challenge on<a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/12/08/first-world-war-memories-romania/\"> Wikimedia’s blog</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Digitising our literary heritage: The Antun Gustav Matoš collection (1873-1914)'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The literary bequest of Antun Gustav Matoš (Tovarnik, June 13th 1873 – Zagreb, March 17th 1914), is kept at the Archives of the Department for the History of Croatian Literature of the Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theatre and Music within the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb, Croatia. It\_is among the largest out of approximately 200 deposited collections there. Matoš was one of the greatest and most productive writers from the period of Croatian literary modernism, and is generally seen as one of the most significant Croatian writers.\_<br><br>\r\nThe majority of Matoš' bequest was housed at the archives of the then Institute for Literature during the 1950s, and was composed of donations and acquisitions. The collection includes around 900 scanned objects (approximately 5,000 pages), highlighting the most important and interesting parts of the bequest, such as Matoš' autographs and typescripts with author's proofreading marks of his own poems (especially sonnets), short prose, feuilletons, essays, epigrams, travel writings, and cultural, theatre, and literary criticism. The collection also covers press clippings, photographs of the author, his family, friends and acquaintances, his personal documents, visiting cards, and correspondence between Matoš and his family members. It further includes a variety of documents relating to prominent people in the cultural sphere at the turn of the 19th century and in the first decades of the 20th century.\_<br><br>\r\nAfter deserting the army, Matoš lived in Belgrade, Vienna, Munich, Geneva, and finally, from 1899 to 1904, in Paris. Following his return to Zagreb, he lived as a bohemian and a professional writer, surrounded by a circle of younger poets, disciples and admirers, such as Ljubo Wiesner, Tin Ujević, Krešimir Kovačić, and Nikola Polić.\_<br><br>\r\nReflections of Matoš' interest in Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine, and Edgar Allan Poe, symbolism, and other phenomena in European literature of the period, as well as of the romanticist tradition, are evident in his poetic works. The collection therefore offers an insight into the literary and cultural world of the <em>fin de siècle</em>, not only in Croatia, but also in the wider context of European modernist literature.\_<br><br>\r\nThe objects in this collection were scanned in 2008 by the digital studio Novena d.o.o., financed by the 'Antun Gustav Matoš Society' from the writer's hometown of Tovarnik, and by the Department for the History of Croatian Literature’s staff, who also provided the metadata, thus completing the digitisation project. If researchers should have any problems with reading textual material scans – autographs and manuscripts, they can rely on Matoš' complete works (<em>Sabrana djela Antuna Gustava Matoša</em>, acronym <em>SD</em>), published in 1973 by the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 20 volumes, since all the archival materials found in the bequest were used as a basis for this edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Written by Ana Batinić, PhD, the Department for the History of Croatian Literature of the Institute for the History of Croatian Literature, Theatre and Music; the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (HAZU).\_<br>\r\nemail: abatinic@hazu.hr</em><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Weekend session for video game developers in Poland resulted in 11 games inspired by First World War digital archives.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>From 1 to 3 December 2017, Game Jam with History took place at the National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute in Warsaw. Created in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/indie-games-poland-foundation/\" target=\"_blank\">Indie Games Poland Foundation</a>, the event aimed to show the potential for\_game makers to integrate\_archival materials into their works, both as inspiration and as an\_element of the final product. It was a weekend session for amateur and professional designers and video game developers who were tasked with reusing\_archival content from Europeana Collections and Polish online repositories (<a href=\"https://www.nac.gov.pl/en/digital-archive/\" target=\"_blank\">National Digital Archive</a>, the <a href=\"https://polona.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">National Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://archiwum.nina.gov.pl/katalog\" target=\"_blank\">National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute</a>). The overall theme was the First World War and the interwar period connecting to the upcoming centenary of Polish Independence next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maciej Dydo, Deputy Director of the The Intellectual Property and Media Department, Ministry of Culture and National Heritage said:</p>\r\n\r\n<address><em>[The Game Jam is] an incredible event that shows how the work of many people who spend years digitising our heritage: photographs, documents, images, and then publishing them on the web, can be creatively adapted into video games. Games are a new medium whose audience is growing, they engage young people, allowing them to experience history.</em></address>\r\n\r\n<p>32 participants, ranging from graphic designers and\_Atari enthusiasts to game developers have worked together developing games from scratch. In less than 48 hours\_they created 11 new games approaching the topic creatively. The final games were very diverse, starting with different mechanics - from trading card games and walking simulators to time management games - and taking\_various angles to the theme - from regular battles and\_games to rebuilding a country’s infrastructure as a consequence of a war or solving romantic dilemmas with political factors in the background of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marek Czerniak, Game Jam co-organiser &amp; founder of the Indie Games Foundation said:</p>\r\n\r\n<address><em>The last couple of days showed that Game Jam and archives are a good fit. Archives are a great source of inspiration for graphic artists and game developers who create new worlds and stories. </em></address>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury, formed of representatives of the Polish Ministry of Culture,\_Europeana Foundation, a video game producer and a Polish Radio reporter,\_selected three team winners:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Janusz Lejtan, Joanna Lejtan for '1920-Battle of Warsaw'</li>\r\n    <li>Michał Wroński, Aleksander Bydłowski for 'Fronty Wojenne'</li>\r\n    <li>Marta Stawska, Martyna Wasiluk, Patryk Woźnicki, Maciej Kozłowski for 'Kwatermistrz' ('Quartermaster')</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The jury also awarded teams in extra categories, like\_'The Best Use of Archive Materials' and 'The Most Archival Game'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LgTtyGJIvI?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A brief AV recap from the History Game Jam FINA, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Second edition of TuEuropeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">TuEuropeana</a> project started in Poland last year, inviting potential Europeana users and institutions with digital archival collections to exchange knowledge and\_experiences. Created by the Polish Europeana Network, a local working group initiated by <a href=\"http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/pages/the-ministry-of-culture-and-national-heritage.php?lang=EN\" target=\"_blank\">The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage</a> in 2014 and coordinated by FINA (previously known as the <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/\" target=\"_blank\">National Audiovisual Institute</a>) with support from the <a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/\" target=\"_blank\">PSNC</a>, the project raises awareness of Europeana Collections materials and promotes reuse of digital archival content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the project included among other things educational events for cultural institutions, teachers and workshops for design students. This year, as well as the Game Jam, they continued with a series of events: workshops, webinars and transcribathons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Check out the projects from Game Jam with History in our dedicated <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157689792369581\" target=\"_blank\">Flickr album</a>!</strong></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>As part of the upcoming Europeana Migration campaign, we highlight more initiatives relating to migration and culture beyond our own network.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Throughout 2018, <a href=\"http://migration.europeana.eu\">Europeana Migration</a> will focus on how migration to, from and within Europe has shaped our cultural heritage. On the run-up to the campaign launch, we are featuring a number of interviews with arts and cultural heritage professionals working on projects related to migration, to shine a light on other initiatives showing the cultural sector’s response to this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, we speak to Kathryn Lloyd, Director of Programs at the Tenement Museum in New York, about their online collecting project <a href=\"http://yourstory.tenement.org\">Your Story, Our Story</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s Your Story, Our Story all about?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tenement.org/\">Tenement Museum</a> tells the stories of immigrants who started their lives anew on Manhattan's Lower East Side between the 19th and 21st centuries. Their stories are told through recreated apartments and businesses of real families in two historic tenement buildings. Our tenements once housed over 10,000 working class immigrants from over 20 nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors often want to share their stories, but we didn’t have a way to preserve them until 2013, when we started <a href=\"http://yourstory.tenement.org\">Your Story, Our Story</a>. So far, more than 3,000 people have submitted stories to the collection, from 11 states across the US. People can now explore stories from people they might not otherwise meet, and we hope that by sharing a wide range of generations and perspectives, people can learn from others’ stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What sort of stories are people telling?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve found it is easier to centre stories around objects, something museums do all the time. When someone is asked ‘tell us your family’s migration story’, they may not know where to start but if you ask them to select an object that tells part of their family’s migration story, then it becomes much more tangible. So far, people have written about objects that speak to their family’s culture and identity - anything from traditions, music and recipes, to their names and basketball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Baby stroller\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/Your%20Story%20Our%20Story%20baby%20stroller.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>S. Jefferson, 2002. </em>©\_2018\_Lower East Side Tenement Museum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my <a href=\"http://yourstory.tenement.org/stories/baby-stroller-and-a-book\">favourite stories</a> is from the son of a woman who migrated from a Spanish-speaking country. His story centres on a photograph of his mother pushing a stroller with an English dictionary in the foreground. For him, the photograph represents the struggle she went through when trying to learn English while having a baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We share some of these stories through our social media and during museum tours. We have found that people are really honoured and pleased that the museum is telling their family’s story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you develop the Your Story, Our Story website?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with a simple Pinterest board, working with school groups. Since then, we’ve made a <a href=\"http://yourstory.tenement.org\">bespoke site</a>, consulting with teachers, scholars and our museum educators to think through how we make the site work for people. There were some surprises: one of the biggest things teachers wanted was to be able to print the stories, so they could hang them up in their classrooms. This was something very simple that we hadn’t thought of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent redesign now offers visitors the opportunity to submit up to two minutes of audio. We think this will be key to collecting visitors’ stories - they might find it difficult to write in the moment, whereas telling a story is easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Your Story Our Story explore page\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/Your%20Story%20Our%20Story%20explore.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Your Story, Our Story 'Explore' page\_</em>©\_2018\_Lower East Side Tenement Museum</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<br>\r\nWho else have you worked with on Your Story, Our Story?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We started collecting stories with a local fifth grade class in Brooklyn. Since the beginning, working with groups has helped us achieve our aims to connect stories across generations and places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute for Museum and Library Services, we’ve partnered with the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, who will all incorporate Your Story, Our Story into their programming and collect stories in their communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next for Your Story, Our Story?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re now working on adding scholarship and historical context - that was really important for us because that’s what we do at the museum. We’re working on making short videos mixing insight from migration scholars with personal stories. These will focus on current events and topical issues such as legality and language acquisition - content that supplements what our visitors discuss or what teachers use in their curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re also thinking of experimenting by asking specific questions around certain times of the year, for example what holiday traditions families have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can see projects like this having really good applications in workplaces, as a sort of team-building exercise to write a story and share with colleagues. We’re also interested in marketing this to family reunions, when people come together and share stories.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'TuEuropeana EduLab: Archives Inspire… and Teach'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Poznań EduLab invited educators to create new interactive teaching activities based on technology and archival content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>A two-day workshop devoted to the use of digital archival resources (from Europeana Collections and some Polish online repositories) in interactive educational activities was held on 24-25 November 2017 at the <a href=\"http://edulab.pcss.pl/\">PSNC EduLab</a> in Poznań, Poland. As part of the workshop, a number of digital and analogue tools were used to test existing narratives and create new ones based on archival materials.<br>\r\nThe workshop involved teachers and educators teaching 10 to 14 year olds humanities. They were invited to take part in two thematic paths. These were:<br><br><em>Virtual field game</em> - in which the teachers' task was to design, using pre-selected archives, a virtual field game depicting a literary period, the life of a famous individual, etc. Working with digitised maps, text extracts and photographs integrated with openly-licensed tools and enriched by written texts and clues, the participants prepared a number of interdisciplinary tasks encouraging the player to explore the world and reach the final destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Escape room</em> - the task here was to first experience an earlier prepared game and then create a new one in which players solve a series of puzzles and riddles using clues to complete a list of objectives and learn in a truly engaging way about a certain topic. Using QR codes, augmented reality, virtual crosswords, etc. and mixing them up with archival materials, the participants learned how to present an educational topic to their students in an engaging and innovative way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"401\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TCnjvwBopZnOBI6yqezgwQOOdMnhO8JFew65FlU6GxbnqKtsG4s1QeEg-8r70a26s-xtEEtdQLIqG_O_5TeaYIMnYFCNU4bLupSfqWJGm3iKcQ46byn_WakVZvZLDhn5ro1aztuy\" width=\"602\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>One of the Escape Room tasks reusing archival material. Maja Drabczyk, National Film Archive - Audiovisual </em><em>Institute,</em><em> CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the workshop, multimedia training materials were created (in Polish) to further support and promote independent implementation of scenarios of educational activities used during the workshops by teachers. The users will get to know or deepen their knowledge about selected writers, painters, musicians, inventors/scientists from above historical period, use modern technologies, get acquainted with the possibilities offered by applications supporting learning processes and last but not least they will get acquainted with archival sources - texts, images, music recordings, etc., absorbed from digital repositories and used in the tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Guardians of the Medallion</em> (Strażnicy Medalionu) virtual field game the participants will have to unravel the mystery of the loss of a valuable medallion, searched by its guardians - ie. outstanding figures from the 19th century - Charles Dickens, Maria Skłodowska-Curie, etc. Together with them, players will go on a virtual journey around Europe during which they will encounter various tasks built around archival materials, including Richard Wagner’s <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/pl/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_3000134099762.html?q=Richard+Wagner\">portrait</a> and <a href=\"https://polona.pl/item/polonia-ouverture,Njk4OTY5MTc/10/#item\">music score</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Escape </em><em>Room</em> the players will try to solve a mystery of a lost cup at a tea party gathering key Polish personalities from the 1920s and 1930s period. By solving a crossword based on archival images, finding an answer to a riddle in a <a href=\"http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=7331\">set of archival newspapers</a>, recognizing a person in a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/pl/record/08609/7150e346_3fdc_4bb3_b9e7_bebe12dd363f.html?q=what%3A%22Janusz+Kusoci%C5%84ski+%2C+polski+lekkoatleta%2C+z%C5%82oty+medalista+olimpijski+z+Los+Angeles+w+biegu+na+10+000+m%22-\">video dating to 1930s</a> they will uncover the list of all the guests and find the missing one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://barka.net.pl/tueuropeana/\">TuEuropeana multimedia training materials (in Polish)</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana and partners to showcase big data collaboration at European Open Science Cloud conference'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The outcome of Europeana’s collaboration with EUDAT and CLARIN on big data in cultural heritage will be presented at <a href=\"https://eudat.eu/events/conferences/save-the-date-eudat-conference-putting-the-eosc-vision-into-practice\">EUDAT’s conference, ‘Putting the EOSC vision into practice’</a> in Porto, Portugal, from 22-25 January.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>EOSC stands for the <a href=\"https://eudat.eu/european-open-science-cloud\">European Open Science Cloud</a>, a project that falls under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/%20european-cloud-initiative\">European Cloud Initiative</a>. The European Open Science Cloud aims to become a virtual environment with free at the point of use, open and seamless services for storage, management, analysis and reuse of research data, across borders and scientific disciplines. The goal of the creation of the EOSC is ‘to make science more efficient and productive and let millions of researchers share and analyse research data in a trusted environment across technologies, disciplines and borders’, says Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation. The EOSC is part of the European Union’s effort to realise a Digital Single Market in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When talking about big data, open science and accessible research, you have to talk about digital cultural heritage. Europeana collaborated with EUDAT (European Data Infrastructure) and CLARIN (a European Research Infrastructure for the Social Sciences and Humanities) in two projects aiming to analyse and connect cultural heritage data with researchers’ workflows. As the possibilities of Linked Open Data and the Semantic Web keep gaining in importance, it’s no wonder the EUDAT conference has a <a href=\"https://eudat.eu/semantic-services-in-eosc\">track about Semantic Services</a> and their relation to the European Open Science Cloud.

        title: 'Hello world! The Finnish National Gallery opens up its collections'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Collections Management Director\_<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/riitta-ojanper%C3%A4-922b8025/\">Riitta Ojanperä</a> tells Douglas McCarthy what’s driving the Finnish National Gallery's new open access policy</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Finnish National Gallery recently applied an open licence (CC0) to its digital reproductions of out-of-copyright works, joining leading institutions in the <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\">OpenGLAM</a> movement to promote free and open access to digital cultural heritage.\_<strong>Riitta Ojanperä</strong>, PhD, Director of Collections Management, tells us all about the Gallery’s new policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">Riitta, why has the Gallery adopted an open licence for its out-of-copyright works?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The FNG aspires to be among the very best museums in northern Europe, taking into consideration our audience\_needs and expectations. Opening up our collections data is one way of leading our customers towards even richer museum experiences, and of course the requirements of national and EU cultural policies very strongly pointed the way to a tenacious open-data policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">What led to the policy change and who was involved?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial drive came from some Finnish OpenGLAM activists around 2012 and our first actual operations came quickly afterwards, focussing on images from our archival collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">What advice would you give to other museums considering a similar policy?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems to be a widely shared view, both here in Finland as well as in other countries, that \_generous open data policies increase museums’ popularity and generate more visitors and more engaged audiences. Talking about a museum’s business policies, it’s worth considering thoroughly the transaction costs involved in licensing and distributing images, compared, for example,\_with selling products based on images of artworks and objects in the collections. I don’t recall hearing regrets from any museum that decided to execute a open data policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">How does the Gallery’s open policy compare with other Finnish institutions?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I must admit that the FNG has been rather slow in taking the pivotal step towards the large-scale publication of CC0-licensed images. Whilst advancing with baby steps, we have seen museums like the Helsinki City Museum be recognised internationally by opening their data as part of an innovative renewal programme. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">Which audiences are you trying to reach?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our target groups are many: the educational sector, that is teachers and school children all over Finland; researchers internationally; active users of digital imagery available on the web. One of the main aims of our new collections website is increasing the re-use of FNG data. We’re trying to reach anybody who is willing to connect with the cultural and human values that a museum’s collections can transfer to individuals and communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">What does the FNG hope to achieve by partnering with Europeana?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Finnish National Gallery works with cultural institutions and professionals all over the world. Europeana offers us a good platform for international collaboration and for presenting our collections in a European context. \_This focus coincides perfectly with the aims of Europeana. Before Hanna-Leena Paloposki’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/museums-in-the-digital-age-insights-from-the-finnish-national-gallery\">residency</a> at Europeana, one of the FNG curators had already joined the Europeana Art advisory board, and some of us are members of the Europeana Network Association. After Hanna-Leena’s residency and her <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/an-ecstasy-of-beauty\">beautiful online exhibition</a>, we look forward to further collaboration in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-81436173-ff5d-f7e1-508b-64d8d7e00a14\">What does the Gallery have planned for 2018?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re currently replacing our collections management software. From spring 2018, we’ll be using one system to manage all of our collections, instead of having a separate one for each collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll also be launching a new online collections website next autumn, the concept of which is under construction just now. After the implementation of the new system and the launch of the new website, we will be able to make some of our archive collections available in Europeana. Very exciting!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/galleries/treasures-from-the-finnish-national-gallery\">View\_highlights from\_the Finnish National Gallery</a> or\_</strong><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Finnish+National+Gallery&amp;locale=en&amp;per_page=36&amp;view=grid\"><strong>explore the entire collection\_in Europeana</strong></a>\r\n</h3>\r\n"

        title: 'MashUp Film Festival: 1,000+ films available for new creations'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Films from Europeana Collections are available for use in this year’s MashUp Film Festival.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>How can you bring film heritage alive through the creation of film mashups? That’s the question asked by the MashUp Film Festival (15 March- 15 April) in collaboration with the French National Centre of Cinematography and the Moving Image (CNC), LaCinéTek and Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the MashUp Film Festival joins forces with organisations that support the conservation and promotion of national and international film heritage to shine a spotlight on the creation of mashup short films. Openly licensed films provided through CNC, LaCinéTek and Europeana <a href=\"http://mashup-film-festival.com/appel-a-films-cnc-lacinetek-europeana\">are now available</a> as part of the call for the creation of mashup short films launched in France and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mashup short films created will be shown at a special screening in Paris in April 2018 where a prize for Best Film will be awarded by a jury comprised of representatives of each organisation. The event will also be the opportunity for a discussion on the economic and legal questions around copyright, the use of film heritage in contemporary audiovisual creation and the use, perception and production of images today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director, says, ‘As Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage, Europeana is really pleased to partner with the MashUp Film Festival, helping to give the 2018 edition an international flavour. We constantly look for new uses of our openly licensed cultural heritage and are excited about MashUp film's new creations.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about the MashUp Film Festival:\_<a href=\"http://www.mashup-film-festival.com\">www.mashup-film-festival.com</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Shaping the future of audiovisual archiving: New international think tank identifies strategic priorities'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/\">The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> has published a new White Paper ‘<a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/hub/av-think-tank?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer96ed8&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com\">Towards a New Audiovisual Think Tank for Audiovisual Archivists and Cultural Heritage Professionals</a>’. It identifies strategic priorities for audiovisual archiving in the coming decade and puts forward 10 concrete recommendations for collective action.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Through its holdings of over a million hours of material, its expertise, and activities, Sound and Vision aims to strengthen an open and free society. It currently offers its holdings to the broadest variety of end-users, including journalists, students, researchers, heritage organisations, and the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newly published White Paper is one of the first steps that Sound and Vision has taken to establish a new international thought leadership group that aims to articulate international research for the audiovisual cultural heritage sector. It helps stakeholders active in the preservation of audiovisual heritage to identify their future priorities. It also aims to enable more long-term use of AV archiving for learning and education</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The recommendations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"White Paper Conclusions\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/NISV%20recommendations.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Peter B. Kaufman, Towards a New Audiovisual Think Tank for Audiovisual Archivists and Cultural Heritage Professionals (Hilversum, NL: Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, 2018). page 15. </em><em>CC BY</em><em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Paper puts forward ten recommendations as strategic priorities for the coming ten years, around which action, research and development, and resources will be organised. Each recommendation comes with a timeline of first collective actions to be taken. Here’s a headline summary of the questions the recommendations address:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Should there be a better way, for instance a unified catalogue, for the field to know itself, its holdings, and its power?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Should there be a guidebook of best practices written by the field for Google and other technologies to optimise audiovisual searchability and findability?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Should there be more concerted engagement with the giants of the field like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, commercial as they are?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>What should be our own commitment to constant experimentation?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Should we launch a real effort to engage with Wikipedia?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Should it be put forward somewhere that the work of FIAT/IFTA and PrestoCentre and individual archives like Sound and Vision should always be centered on pushing information to be unfettered and free?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>If digital content is increasingly harder to license, rent, and sell online, then advertising will become the primary means of generating revenue against archival moving image content in the future. How should we consider this advertising business – from a business perspective?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Should archivists liaise more fluidly with producers and creators?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How do we define our roles as educators today, especially as so many young people see and hear the world through moving images and sounds that we may one day be called upon to safekeep?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>What role, if any, should archives play in the political/media/cultural arena?</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<h3>What happens now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The AV think tank is committed to following up on these recommendations through a series of activities and by creating dedicated task forces and working groups. These groups will conduct further research, set grounds for policy and practice recommendations through handbooks, strategy papers, and other publications; and develop action plans that connect directly to the interests of AV archivists and cultural heritage professionals. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Read the full White Paper</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The White Paper can be found at<a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/avthinktank\"> </a>the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/knowledge/hub/av-think-tank?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer96ed8&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com\">Sound and Vision website</a> or downloaded directly as<a href=\"http://publications.beeldengeluid.nl/pub/574/TowardsANewThinkTankForAudiovisualArchivistsAndCulturalHeritageProfessionals_SoundAndVision_Jan2018.pdf\"> PDF</a>.

        title: '62% of rights statements are accurate - together, we can improve on that'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Recent research by Kennisland identified that 62% of content published via Europeana has\_accurate rights statements, and that there are common issues that lead to the 38% that are inaccurate.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Accurate rights statements help users of cultural heritage understand how they can reuse the content they discover. In this blog, we explain how Europeana is responding to the recommendations in <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/publicaties/research-paper-the-accuracy-rights-statements-on-europeana-eu/\">Kennisland's\_report</a>, and what cultural heritage institutions can do to increase the confidence people can have when reusing cultural content. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Overview of results showing the accuracy of rights statement applied to content published via Europeana\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/KL%20pie%20chart.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Overview of results showing the accuracy of rights statement applied to content published via Europeana, from Research Paper: The accuracy of Rights Statements, Kennisland</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether we’re steadily improving the labelling of cultural content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Collectively, we have come a long way since <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/rights-labelling-campaign-reaches-its-final-phase\">research as first undertaken into the use and accuracy of rights statements in 2013</a>. Back then, 30% of objects didn't have a rights statement - today 100% of objects do. We also saw evidence that a large number of collections contained objects that were not correctly labelled. Today, Kennisland estimates this figure to be around 38% and points us to a recurring issues of incorrect labelling of objects using Creative Commons licences and the Public Domain Mark.\_ And in this time we've seen some large collections opened up such as<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/set-art-free-and-the-rest-will-follow\"> SMK </a>\_and\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-success-of-hispana\">Hispana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Accuracy of rights statement per category\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/KL%20bar%20chart.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Accuracy of rights statement per category, from Research Paper: The accuracy of Rights Statements, Kennisland\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research report, undertaken over the summer of 2017, continues \_our effort to better understand how accuracy rights statements are applied. \_Can we assess the accuracy of the statements used, and when we find inaccurate statements is it possible to identify why? \_The research undertaken, was based on extrapolation, \_differentiated between inaccurate statements. For example where an object was labelled with a Public Domain Mark (PDM) and the data absolutely confirms that the object is in copyright. And those that are questionable such as where the data published does not appear to support the selection of a Creative Commons licence. \_It also highlights the issue of objects that are not protected by copyright, and those where the copyright has expired being labelled with a Creative Commons licence.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Europeana is responding to the report’s recommendations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018 we're going to focus on improving the support, information and training we offer to data partners. \_We want to highlight the common issues faced when applying rights statements such as looking at what copyright applies to, and providing support to data partners on how to address them. \_And we will promote the use\_of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">statements from the RightsStatements.org consortium</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe copyright community will be formalised to provide a space to share best practices - for example how to seek permission to apply Creative Commons licences - and knowledge between professionals. \_ And we’ll be looking at improving our own policies and practices, such as updating the documentation provided to data partners during the ingestion process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking together - how Europeana and data partners can improve the accuracy of rights statements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a limit to what the data analysis can tell us - it can’t for example tell us about your experience applying rights statements. Or how well you feel that you understand the copyright laws that apply to your collections, or if you have adequate resources available to research and apply rights statements correctly. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nYou can help us improve the support we can offer by talking to us about your experiences applying rights statements. Do you recognise the issues highlighted in this report in your own data? \_Get in touch and together let’s improve Europeana Collections one rights statement at a time.\_ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/publicaties/research-paper-the-accuracy-rights-statements-on-europeana-eu/\">the full research paper by Kennisland</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Footnote on the research paper</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennisland constructed a methodology for qualitative research in which they\_individually assessed the accuracy of the rights statements of a representative sample of 1,462 digital objects made available via Europeana. The results from the sample give an indication of the accuracy of the rights statements of the entire database of Europeana. The research was limited to determining the accuracy of the rights statements by looking at the available data on Europeana and the website of the data partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>And the results?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The results show that at least 61.8% of the rights statements were accurately applied and at least 9.1% were inaccurate based on the available information. The accuracy of 17.4% of the rights statements is questionable, while for 8.8% of the rights statements it was not possible to determine the accuracy. 3% of the rights statements have not been evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two categories – objects with a public domain statement and objects with a Creative Commons statement – where the accuracy is significantly lower in comparison to the other categories. The accuracy in these two groups is close to (at least) 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>So, what next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Through policy and training, Europeana can support the improvement of the quality of the rights statements, but cannot by itself completely solve the underlying problems concerning their accuracy.The accuracy of rights statements is in the first instance the responsibility of the institutions that make digital objects available via Europeana (the data partners).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kennisland have put together some recommendations for Europeana, which are intended to open up a dialogue with data partners about how to improve the accuracy of rights statements.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918 in Warsaw \_- almost 200 documents and 90 000 characters has been transcribed within 24 hours in Poland</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918 was a two-day workshop and a competitive event. It took place on 1-2 December 2017 at the National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute (FINA) in Warsaw, Poland, and has been organised alongside the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/game-jam-with-history-tueuropeana-archives-inspire\">Game Jam with History</a>, as part of the <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl\">TuEuropeana</a> programme. Members of the public from all age groups and levels of expertise were invited to join the event in Warsaw to transcribe and annotate Polish documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 24 hours 16 participants in 4 teams have transcribed almost 200 documents and 90 000 characters. The youngest participant was 13, the oldest was 60+. Our top transcriber typed over 24,000 characters by herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants enjoyed the complexity of the task - transcribing is not only a mechanical process, but one that requires analytical skills for finding the exact context. Stanisław Kalinowski and Krzysztof Płuciennik, students who joined the event, mentioned also the importance of cooperation:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>''The most interesting part was the team work, as it was often hard to decipher the documents. Plus they were written in various languages, so we had to ask each other for help''.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"369\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OKLvMRguOXEtyXwdQe03NxrXf-uhOH-Fyvg9hiTDCHQtPTI1rVNsgMYoCIV9kBR44TkNx9oeucM_A1JfKiKVrHKii_8wQhi0AlQ5xmS6yWNSI2soj-Q1eo-RwrvLVVsaTp3w_-Q-\" width=\"554\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participant of Transcribathon Warszawa 2017.<br>\r\nMalwina Toczek, National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute , CC BY-SA</em><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants did not work only on Polish texts, but used their language skills to transcribe documents in Latvian, English, French and Ukrainian. This showed the potential of the tool to be used at schools during foreign language courses, and not just history. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBgmR7Vwurc?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>AV recap from the Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918 in Warsaw, Filmoteka Narodowa – Instytut Audiowizualny CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to participants’ work you can now read about people who experienced life during World War One, like <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-18519/\">Franciszek Szałach</a>, an officer in Polish Legions or <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/id-21500/\">Władysław Zahorsk</a>i, a physician and a writer from Vilnius. You also can join and start transcribing by signing up on the site: <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com\">https://transcribathon.com</a>. More documents in various languages are available there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karolina Widyńska, French teacher, who brought her students to FINA that weekend, said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>''I think [Transcribathon] was a fantastic event. Everything we do as a group, outside of school, is a valuable experience. And here we had a tool that showed us “living memories”, documents which someone had found, brought in, and which were later scanned and archived''.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Second edition of TuEuropeana</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tueuropeana.pl/\">TuEuropeana</a> project started in Poland last year, inviting potential Europeana users and institutions with digital archival collections to exchange knowledge and experiences. Created by the Polish Europeana Network, a local working group initiated by <a href=\"http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/pages/the-ministry-of-culture-and-national-heritage.php?lang=EN\">The Ministry of Culture and National Heritage</a> in 2014 and coordinated by FINA (previously known as the <a href=\"http://www.nina.gov.pl/\">National Audiovisual Institute</a>) with support from the <a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/online/en/\">PSNC</a>, the project raises awareness of Europeana Collections materials and promotes reuse of digital archival content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, the project included among other things educational events for cultural institutions, teachers and workshops for design students. This year, as well as the Transcribathon, they continued with a series of events: workshops, webinars and a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/game-jam-with-history-tueuropeana-archives-inspire\">game jam</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana #EdTech Challenge: inspirational tips and tricks (Part 1)'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Openly licensed content to get your creativity going.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-edtech-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana #EdTech Challenge</a> has been launched! We’re offering €30,000 for the best idea(s) using technological processes and resources to inspire learners and educators with digital cultural heritage. This blog is part of a series featuring openly licensed datasets and content picks. This week, we look at the topics of natural and modern\_history to pique your imagination for a winning application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Natural History Art from the Rijksmuseum</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the natural world fascinate you? Discover a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/natural-history-art-from-the-rijksmuseum-in-amsterdam-netherlands\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a> of paintings and drawings of flowers and animals from the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Rijksmuseum</a>. Science has relied heavily on illustrations to document natural elements. Take a look at one below by Flemish artist Jacob Hoefnagel. Part of the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Hoefnagel\" target=\"_blank\">Archetypa studiaque patris</a></em>\_book, the image is an engraving that depicts plants, insects and small animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/RP-P-1887-A-11847.jpg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 623px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/90402/RP_P_1887_A_11847.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dieren en planten rond een sprinkhaan en een artishock; Insecten, bloemen en vruchten; Archetypa studiaque patris GeorgiI HoefnageliI.</a> Hoefnagel, Jacob. 1592. Rijksmuseum. Public Domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sounds of nature</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If sounds of nature are also an inspiration for you, discover our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/sounds-of-nature-from-the-british-library\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a> of almost 1,500 audio files of bird songs. Recorded in the United Kingdom, during the late 20th century, this material presents the audio recording of garden sounds and of common birds in Britain. Check out below the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/nightingale-and-canary-animated-short\" target=\"_blank\">Nightingale and Canary</a>\_animated short video by Australian artist <a href=\"https://andythomas.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Thomas</a>. The artist created beautiful abstract shapes that react to\_bird song recordings\_from the archives of the <a href=\"https://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NtIHJSRQvvk\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Nightingale &amp; Canary - Bird sounds visualized by Andy Thomas</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Butterflies from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Colourful, beautiful flying insects, butterflies can teach us about natural life-cycles - the metamorphosis these winged creatures undergo is impressive! Take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/search?f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;locale=nl&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A11622%2A&amp;qf%5B%5D=butterflies&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a> of over 400 photographs of butterflies, including additional scientific information. Known as triangle birdwing, the Trogonoptera trojana (shown below) is a butterfly native to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/trojanus.jpg\" style=\"width: 250x; height: 523px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/record/11622/_GLOBIS_MFN_GERMANY_4776.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trogonoptera trojana</a> (Honrath, 1886). Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, GloBIS. CC BY-SA</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WWI photographs from Austria-Hungary</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying the past is a great way to educate the younger generations. Educators could take advantage of the extensive World War I collection available on Europeana to create apps for the classroom. For example, explore more than\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/wwi-photographs-from-austria-hungary\" target=\"_blank\">37,000 photographs</a> illustrating the Great War in the former Austria-Hungary monarchy. The photograph below is an example of the daily routine in the war field, the likes of which are crucial in showcasing a different, human side of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/9200291_B.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 623px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200291/BibliographicResource_3000073605208.html\" target=\"_blank\">Kriegsalbum 42, Bild 11639 | K.u.k. Kriegspressequartier, Lichtbildstelle - Wien.</a> 1917. Österreichische Nationalbibliothek - Austrian National Library. Public Domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Swedish military aviation in historical images</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example of military history in images is our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/swedish-military-aviation-in-historical-images\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a> of over 13,000 photographs, postcards, posters, floor plans, and caricatures, documenting the development of the Swedish Air Force from the late 19th century up to the 1980s. Explore black-and-white historical pictures of early sky pioneers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/91611.jpeg\" style=\"width: 350x; height: 623px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/916113/S_FV_photo_FVMF003478.html\" target=\"_blank\">En man klädd i flygardräkt kliver in i flygplan S 31 Spitfire. | Okänd fotograf.</a> 1948-1955.

        title: 'Looking ahead at impact: what’s in store for 2018'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Let's take a look at the year ahead, and how we are developing the impact toolkit:\_ Building on the work in 2017 and the first release of the impact playbook, we'll be moving into a new gear to deliver the impact playbook 1.0, supported by lots more case studies, research and of course an impact task force.\_\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>2017 in a nutshell</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-assessment\">Task Force</a>, six workshops, two reports, our very first Europeana-wide impact assessment and over 1,400\_downloads of the\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Impact Playbook</a>.\_ What a year we had! \_To top it off, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/presenting-impact-at-the-europeana-network-association-agm\">AGM in Milan was dedicated to exploring impact in the cultural heritage sector.</a> We were introduced to a new perspective on impact in the sector - the Culture 3.0 paradigm - and transformed the audience into an impact assessment team, providing real-time feedback to ten fantastic impact-producing projects. \_It was a jam-packed year of impact!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Playbook 1.0</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the design phase of the Impact Playbook behind us, we are gearing up to deliver the assessment, narration and evaluation phases. \_We’ll be working with the support of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-assessment-2-0-task-force\">a renewed Impact Task Force for 2018</a> and have once again recruited the expertise of<a href=\"http://www.sinzer.org/nl/\"> impact consultants Sinzer </a>to guide and support us. Want to take a peek behind the scenes of how we developed the Impact Toolkit in 2017? Check out the ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-the-impact-toolkit\">Developing the impact toolkit</a>’ report - we’ll be following the same approach in 2018. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Case studies, case studies and more case studies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re also going to be working on sharing more examples of impact in the cultural sector - starting with five that will be developed following the playbook. If you came to the AGM you’ll know that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/presenting-impact-at-the-europeana-network-association-agm\">Transcribathon won our support to undertake an impact assessment</a>. In addition, we’ll be supporting our partners to undertake impact assessments on the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration Campaign</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/about-smk/camp00/\">SMK Open</a>, the <a href=\"https://wikimedia.org.uk/wiki/Expert_outreach/National_Wikimedian_at_the_National_Library_of_Wales\">National Wikimedian at the National Library of Wales</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.hamburg.de/bwfg/8324196/verbundprojekt-der-hafencity-universitaet-hamburg-erweckt-domplatz-wieder-zum-leben/\">SmartSquare</a>. And our partners at <a href=\"http://den.nl/\">DEN </a>will be researching examples of economic impact, sourcing examples from around the globe so that we can report back on how other methodologies work and what sort of results they deliver.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>In case you missed it</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Join the impact-focussed conversations over in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017\">the impact community for cultural heritage professionals on LinkedIn</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Read about what we found when we tested the playbook on our own work in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-insights-2017\">Impact Insights Report 2017 </a>\_</li>\r\n    <li>Curious who's working on impact\_at Europeana?\_ We're a six-person strong team: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/julia-fallon\">Julia (Fallon)</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nicole-mcneilly\">Nicole</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/nicholas-jarrett\">Nicholas</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/julia-schellenberg\">Julia</a> (Schellenberg) and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/panagiotis-kyrou\">Panos</a>\_</li>\r\n    <li>Have you used the Impact Playbook, or are you planning to?

        body: "<p>Inspired by the internet phenomenon of selfies, the <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/it/app/faces/\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories FACES</a> game uses famous painting portraits to teach children about the basics of visual art. The game creator and one of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-europeana-challenge-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s 2016 Challenge winners</a>, the Italian startup <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/it/\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories</a>, has recently released an improved version of FACES. The game went from using five to 30 openly licensed paintings from famous international collections. Artworks from the Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum in New York and Europeana are displayed for kids to play with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/labs.europeana.eu/labs/blog/IMG_7195.PNG\" style=\"width: 150x; height: 423px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A screenshot of Art Stories FACES. CC BY-SA FACES </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art Stories founder, Federica Pascotto, tells more about the new release: ‘By playing different games (jigsaws, finding details, identifying shapes, patterns and elements), kids are challenged in their observation skills and learn what to watch when observing an artwork. We have completely changed the graphic interface, and the game’s mechanics: each game gives kids a score, and by scoring they are taken to the timeline, that can be completed only by answering all questions correctly.’ The timeline is a brand-new game: a visual quiz connected to the paintings children have been playing with. It is a fun way to convey content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TD9iKeS3bgw\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its launch (on 11 January), the new version of the app has had more than <strong>31K downloads</strong>, mostly from the USA and Canada, then followed by Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. For a sneak peek at the app, play a <a href=\"http://bartolomeo.education/portfolio_page/il-ritratto-gioco/\" target=\"_blank\">free version</a> of the game!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Download the new and improved <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/art-stories-faces/id1113488508?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Art Stories FACES</a> on the App Store!</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Join Europeana #edTech Challenge</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are an entrepreneur, developer, designer or educator who wants to explore digital opportunities for education and training, take part in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-edtech-challenge-2018-terms-and-conditions\" target=\"_blank\">latest online competition</a>.

        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.euinfo.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">The EU Info Centre</a> in Belgrade spearheaded the initiative to design a calendar reflecting the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a> and handed it out to partner organisations and Serbian citizens, but also made it available in <a href=\"http://europa.rs/images/publikacije/Kalendar-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">electronic form</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the first in the series of activities to be executed by the EU Info Centre and the <a href=\"http://europa.rs/?lang=en\">EU Delegation\_to Serbia</a> over the course of the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Apart from being the first, this activity is also unique as it was carried out in collaboration not only with local partners – the <a href=\"https://www.nb.rs/?change_lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">National Library of Serbia</a> and <a href=\"http://europanostraserbia.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Europa Nostra Serbia</a> – but also in close cooperation with Europeana. This way, ‘the project’ encompassed all key actors at both European (the EU and Europeana) and national level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European and Serbian cultural heritage has been depicted through photos, the bulk of which were borrowed from Europeana, accompanied by short captions that present the richness and diversity of European culture and Serbia’s contribution to it, on the one hand, and to bring Serbian citizens closer to Europeana, on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors believe that the diversity and richness of cultural heritage brings people together and builds a shared understanding of places that make up the great European continent: ‘The heritage found in villages and towns, chateaux and chapels, art works and museums, but also in our homes, crafts and cuisine is what gives us a true European identity.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional_images/image2.png?62bcddf56f\" style=\"height: 574px; width: 600px;\"><br><em>Page from the calendar ‘Serbia in Europeana’, V. Valožić, “Memory from Belgrade”, 1889, National Library of Serbia, CC BY-NC</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initiators of the project stated that the content selection was an exciting challenge that allowed them to set out on a genuine journey through European culture via Europeana with support from the Europeana Collections team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as pieces from Europeana, the 2018 EU calendar features contributions from Serbia, reflecting not only Serbia’s architectural and archaeological cultural heritage, but also scenes from everyday life and traditions, including street art as part of emerging heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional_images/image1.png?6e66e5326c\" style=\"height: 574px; width: 600px;\"><br><em>Page from the calendar ‘Grandma’s kitchen: Guardian of tradition’, M.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Last year Munich’s Pinakotheken launched a new <a href=\"https://www.sammlung.pinakothek.de/\">collections website</a>, participated in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/focus-on-facebook-sunflowerslive-reuniting-van-gogh-s-five-sunflowers-on-social-media\">#SunflowersLive</a> and convened a major <a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">conference</a>.\_<b>Antje Lange </b>talks Douglas McCarthy through a landmark\_2017 and shares her plans for this year.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Tell us about your role, Antje.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I act as ‘editor in chief’ of the Pinakotheken social channels and websites. I’m responsible for the day-to-day management of digital activities including apps, social media and our collections website. I try to be a kind of ‘human bridge’ between our museums and outside world, providing audiences with the best possible experience and keeping our collections alive in the digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<em>18 museums, 25,000 artworks, one collection</em>\_is the motto of the <a href=\"https://www.sammlung.pinakothek.de\">collections website</a> you launched last April. How did this project come about and who was involved?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2017, most major museums already had good collections websites to showcase their artworks. We were long overdue to join the club but issues with our internal database held us back. Our public demanded – and deserved – a proper collections website and, more than once, our Twitter followers provided helpful ideas and encouragement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from technical challenges, some curators were reluctant to expose all of our 25,000 artworks on a single platform, including 17,000 works in storage and 4,000 works on permanent loan! Once our Director General Dr. Bernhard Maaz had approved the project, I created an external team to design and develop the website. It took about six months in total (excluding the planning phase).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are your aims for the site?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our main goal is to present people with the essential facts concerning the artworks and to make them look attractive. I don't like the idea that our collection might resemble a boring database solely for art historians and researchers. Don’t get me wrong – they’re welcome to use the site for research but it should also be useful and enjoyable for the general public. So the principles of usability, accessibility and responsive web design are paramount.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How has the site been received and how will it be developed?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve had lots of positive feedback on our social channels and several students have written to say ‘thank you’ for being able to use images in their doctoral theses. As soon as we launched, I began gathering new ideas and people tweeted me suggestions. I find his feedback really helpful and I try to implement ideas as best I can. \_We’re about to launch an advanced search function so look out for that. You might say that websites are never really finished!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can we look forward to seeing the Pinakotheken collections in Europeana?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is ‘Yes!’ but it’s a work in progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You hosted a conference called ‘<a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">Museums in the Digital Sphere: Opportunities and Challenges</a>’ which addressed the needs of 21st century museum visitors and issues like open access to digitised collections. What was its impact in the context of German museums?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, it was important to ensure that smaller museums and the public could join the event, so it was free of charge. We wanted to create an atmosphere in which everyone could share their day-to-day challenges concerning databases, missing resources and the challenges of copyright management. We also wanted to showcase positive examples of art education and creativity born from online collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-01/MusMuc17.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Panel discussion at Museums in the Digital Sphere, Pinakothek der Moderne, 6 October 2017</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of the conference was huge. Discussions with other major German museums and artists’ estates began afterwards and still continue. Displaying images of modern art in our collections is problematic due to the restrictions of copyright law but we’re working on a compromise to allow us to publish our in-copyright modern artworks (all 15,000 of them!). This would mean we could share our whole collection with the public online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s coming up at the Pinakotheken in 2018?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/en/klee\">Paul Klee: The Construction of Mystery</a> will be the first major exhibition of Paul Klee’s work to be held at the Pinakothek der Moderne. The focus of the exhibition is the 1920s, when Klee responded to the challenges of modern technology and its impact on artistic creativity. I’m working on an app that will use your phone camera to let you create\_artworks based on your photos and Klee's work. Special Klee-inspired filters and stickers will help you understand Klee better and let you dive into his world. So look out for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/constructklee\">#ConstructKlee</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/the_real_antje\">Follow Antje on Twitter</a>.</h3>\r\n"

        title: 'PARTHENOS releases new training module for digital humanities researchers'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.parthenos-project.eu/\">PARTHENOS</a>, standing for “Pooling activities, resources and tools for heritage E-research networking, optimization and synergies”, is a European-funded Horizon2020 project. It connects several different European research infrastructures and focuses on fostering research in the cultural heritage sector. The project aims to define common standards in cultural heritage research, create and implement shared policy, and develop joint activities for researchers. One of those activities is the creation of an online training suite for researchers, educators, managers and policymakers who want to learn more about research infrastructures, the issues around them and the methods to use them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project organisers have released a new training module entitled “Manage, Improve and Open Up Your Research Data”. The module addresses concepts such as <a href=\"http://training.parthenos-project.eu/sample-page/manage-improve-and-open-up-your-research-and-data/introduction-to-research-data-management/the-fair-principles/\">the FAIR Principles</a>, <a href=\"http://training.parthenos-project.eu/sample-page/manage-improve-and-open-up-your-research-and-data/open-data-open-access-and-open-science/\">Open Science</a>, and<a href=\"http://training.parthenos-project.eu/sample-page/manage-improve-and-open-up-your-research-and-data/data-management-planning/\"> Data Management Plans</a>, and is geared towards researchers in the digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This module is a great resource for digital humanities\_and other researchers working with digital cultural heritage. In the training module, you can find Europeana resources on Linked Open Data, rights statements, the Europeana Data Model, and much more. It’s a great way to learn about working with research data and how you can use Europeana for your research at the same time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The module is a collaborative effort led by Dr Jennifer Edmond with input from <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/\">CLARIN </a>and <a href=\"https://www.dariah.eu/\">DARIAH </a>among others, as well as from projects beyond the immediate PARTHENOS family, such as Europeana and <a href=\"https://www.eudat.eu/\">EUDAT</a>. The module “Manage, Improve and Open Up Your Research Data” offers both a linear path through the key topics and the option to pick and choose sections according to what the user is most interested in learning. Training materials used throughout the module, such as videos and presentation slides, are also freely available for lecturers and trainers to use in their own courses. For example,<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFxunuPF2gw\"> this presentation by Dieter van Uytvanck</a> can be used as a resource on CLARIN and the FAIR principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The “Manage, Improve and Open Up Your Research Data” module is just one of many new resources being developed by the PARTHENOS project in 2018. For more details on these future developments, visit the <a href=\"http://training.parthenos-project.eu/\">PARTHENOS Training Suite.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to find out more about why Europeana and our international partners and peers think that open data is so important for research, education, and much more, you can browse our month-long <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/we-love-open-culture-no-listen-we-really-love-open-culture\">‘Open Culture’</a> feature on the Year of Open and in particular, read our article on <a href=\"https://www.yearofopen.org/september-open-perspective-what-is-open-culture/open-culture-what-can-you-do-with-it-resources-for-education-and-creative-industries/\">what you can do with open culture</a>.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Creatives, listen up! The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-edtech-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana #EdTech Challenge</a> is open. You can win up to €30,000 for the best ideas reusing Europeana's content for innovative learning! Submit your proposal by 28 February and show us how to tackle educational subjects in a creative way. This blog is part of a series featuring openly licensed datasets and content picks. This week, we look at the topics of <strong>geography</strong> and <strong>archaeology</strong> to get you inspired.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Maps</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The study of geography has the power of transforming learners of all ages into informed world citizens. Check out our Pinterest board dedicated to <a href=\"https://nl.pinterest.com/europeana/maps/\" target=\"_blank\">maps</a> and discover unusual, colourful and historical maps that give you different perspectives on past events.

        title: 'How the Impact Playbook is empowering libraries - a user perspective'
        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Since our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact?utm_source=Pro&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DTudor%20guestblog\">Impact Playbook</a> was launched in October 2017 it has been downloaded over 1,500 times by cultural heritage professionals. We hear from Dafydd Tudur, Head of Digital Access at the National Library of Wales on his experience using the Playbook.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>‘Libraries gave us power’ were the opening lyrics of a favourite song when I was in my teenage years (‘A Design for Life’ by Manic Street Preachers’). Having been an avid reader from an early age, I had never questioned the transformative power of knowledge, and the importance of libraries’ role in providing access to information. But these days I would ask (provocatively) whether the Manics, if challenged, would have been able to prove the validity of their statement? Could this empowerment they had experienced be demonstrated and directly attributed to the role of libraries?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the need for a robust methodology for demonstrating the ‘impact’ of cultural organisations that led to the development of Europeana’s Impact Playbook. The Playbook defines ‘impact’ as ‘changes that occur for stakeholders or in society as a result of activities (for which the organization is accountable)’. Demonstrating the impact of the cultural sector is therefore about proving that cultural organisations such as The National Library of Wales are making a direct contribution in areas such as wellbeing, learning, social cohesion, entrepreneurship, cultural diplomacy, innovation and identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About two weeks before the launch of the Impact Playbook, I had the pleasure of attending an event hosted by the EU Presidency in Tallinn, Estonia, where we were guided through the new resource using presentations and practical workshops. I returned to the National Library of Wales eager to test the process on one of our own projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I had selected a project - a crowdsourcing workshop that was to be held with a local family history society the following week - I had brief, informal conversations with colleagues who were involved in its delivery to explain the concept behind the Playbook, and then began to put arrangements in place for the pilot workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With other demands on time, I wasn’t going to be able to commit the recommended number of hours either for preparation or for the workshop, but I could remember being encouraged to think of the Playbook as a modern cookbook, as a source of inspiration rather than a step-by-step set of instructions, and so I did. I organised a half day session a few days later, sent them a copy of the Playbook encouraging them to read the introductory sections, and translated the presentation and printouts (the Empathy Map and Change Pathway) into Welsh. On the morning of the meeting, I read through the Playbook again, put my PowerPoint presentation on the screen, and got my sticky-notes, pens and print-outs ready. We were ready to go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Defining the Project</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our selected project was part of a larger externally-funded project, we already had a definition to hand. We spent a few minutes discussing the key aspects of the project so that we had a common understanding of the wider context of the project that we had selected. In fact, this turned out to be one of the several benefits gained from the entire session: the Playbook gave us an opportunity to take a step back and discuss both the strategic and operational aspects of the project. Everyone left the room with a better understanding, both individually and collectively, of what we were doing, why we were doing it, and what we hoped to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Identifying stakeholders</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying stakeholders seemed an easy task. I prefer to call these beneficiaries (even though its important to identify the whole range of project stakeholders too) as it keeps the focus on the ‘participant’ or ‘end users’ who benefit from the project. The project manager had already organised the workshop with the local family history society, but could also see potential to work with groups of participants in other social and demographic segments in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had facilitated similar workshops for projects such as Welsh Journals (now in Beta) and the Dictionary of Welsh Biography (ongoing) as a step towards developing ‘User Stories’ (as part of our implementation of Agile project management). In those previous workshops, we had identified and grouped potential users, and then develop personas in order to explore different ways they would engage with our product or service. As I was putting the Playbook into practice, I could see that there was an opportunity to integrate the impact design into this project planning process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The Empathy Map</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Empathy Map was a great tool for putting ourselves in the shoes of our participants. I’ve seen the map being used in two ways: to empathise with potential participants and identify the ‘pain point’ or ‘problem’ that we could solve, in order to come up with an idea for a suitable project; or, as we did in this workshop, to try and envision and empathise with them as they participate in our proposed activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Empathy Map stimulated discussion between us on the participants’ level of confidence with technology, what would really engage them in the activity, what could potentially intimidate them, and how we could ensure that the activity responded to their needs and expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found some gaps, or at least opportunities that could be missed, in our planning. We also found that we could promote the project in a way that would focus more on addressing the needs of the stakeholder as well as the opportunity to help the Library achieve its own goals (e.g. enriching and improving the discoverability of information in our collections through transcription).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The Change Pathway</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then progressed to the Change Pathway, which allows us to see the relationship between our projects based on stakeholders, our input in terms of resources and activities, the outputs, outcomes and impact. We had already established who our stakeholders would be, our activity and the resources required to deliver it. We found that our discussion focussed on the difference between outputs and outcomes, which proved to be the most useful aspect of this exercise. We also considered where the accountability line would be placed to separate the outcomes that were directly attributable to our project, and the ones that weren’t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop helped us prepare the way to demonstrate the impact of our project, but also helped us in other ways I hadn’t perhaps expected at the start of the process. These were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>the Playbook helps to focus on the participant/beneficiary and the impact, rather than the collection and the outputs;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>the Playbook is a very useful tool for planning projects in general: it creates a space for discussing fundamental aspects of a project so that a common understanding of its aims and activities are established from the outset; and</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>it’s great for team-building!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>With the Design Phase of the Playbook available to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact?utm_source=Pro&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_content=DTudor%20guestblog\">download</a>, Europeana are now working on the next Phases: Assess, Narrate and Evaluate. There’s much more to come, but, from my initial experience of using the Playbook, I can already see how it can offer a rationale and methodology for demonstrating how libraries ‘give people power’. And by doing so, Europeana’s Impact Playbook is also empowering libraries.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Marco Streefkerk'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h2><strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Educated in sciences and humanities, in my professional career I am driven by the impact that modern technology has on human civilisation. Before I joined\_DEN (Dutch knowledge centre for digital heritage and culture), I worked as a commercial consultant for museums and as a project manager at a university library. Within DEN I am responsible for international activities with partners such as Europeana, Wikimedia and UNESCO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At DEN I work hard to make clear that keepers of collections from the past and producers of culture of today have a common interest and should all collaborate in making culture relevant for the emerging information society online and sustainable for the future. DEN is, I believe, unique as a cross-sectoral, knowledgeable, result-driven, network organisation. As a\_member of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, I will bring these aspects with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WlQ6fj3rxQ?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Why I am Europeana</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has been my partner for international collaboration since 2007. At the beginning I was involved in the design of the Europeana Data Model. In 2011, 2013 and 2015 I organised the international conference on Digital Strategies for Heritage (DISH) together with Europeana. From 2012 till 2015 I was work package leader for the Europeana Inside project. I am participating in Task Forces on 3D documentation and Impact. Within Europeana itself, DEN is responsible for statistics on the status of European cultural digitisation (Enumerate).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Network Association, to me, is the most important product\_of Europeana's existence. It is an inexhaustible source of knowledge and experiences and I love my connection to it. I attend most AGMs and all EuropeanaTech events. After serving as a Working Group member, work package leader, Task Force member and project partner, the council membership is my next challenge. I am dedicated to make the Network Association future-proof and I cannot wait to contribute actively. That is why I was so happy to be voted in!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What's my agenda?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my ambitions for the Network Association is to bridge the gap between cultural heritage and artists in theatre, music, film, media, design, and architecture. I believe these two, often quite separated, parts of the cultural sector have a lot to learn from each other. However, they are equally convinced about the value of culture to society. Together they can serve society better, and transform the world with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extending a warm welcome to cultural producers is part of my agenda for the Network Association to be more open, more inclusive. Our network\_ still depends too much on too few people, let's not be afraid of new perspectives, private organisations, new energy. I want to put effort too into strengthening the international position of the Europeana Network. I am proud of my European roots and\_European culture, but engaging with other parts of the world is exciting and necessary nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p><a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/\">Gallica</a>, the digital library of the national library of France (<a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html\">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a> – BnF) and its partners, is turning 20. As part of its many birthday celebrations, new services - such as Gallica Studio - are being released.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>By <a href=\"mailto:cecile.quach@bnf.fr\">Cécile Quach</a>, library curator and Gallica Studio project manager, BnF. With many thanks to <a href=\"mailto:jean-philippe.moreux@bnf.fr\">Jean-Philippe Moreux</a>, expert, and <a href=\"mailto:marion.ansel@bnf.fr\">Marion Ansel</a>, Project Officer - European Projects, for revising this article.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched on November 25, 2017 during the <a href=\"http://www.bnf.fr/fr/evenements_et_culture/auditoriums/f.hackathon_2017.html?seance=1223928195323\">second in-house hackathon</a>, <a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/\">Gallica Studio</a> is an online participative device dedicated to the creative uses that can be made from Gallica. Aiming to promote the appropriation of <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/accueil/?mode=desktop\">Gallica</a> by its users, it is designed to be empowering - taking advantage of new practices of the digital era, such as co-construction schemes, citizen sciences crowdsourcing, or more individual kinds of makers’ projects, all backed up by the philosophy of the cultural commons. The aim is to ultimately encourage the emergence of new uses of online common heritage and related tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gallica Studio invites everyone to be creative and engage with content made available through Gallica.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A toolbox for reuse</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A '<a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/articles/1\">Boîte à outils</a>'\_(toolbox) provides tools and resources to promote the reuse of Gallica's commons resources. Made available by teams from BnF or by external developers, they take many forms: technical documentation on APIs, data formats, new features codes. A ‘Lab’ also allows you to test beta versions of new developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First to be put to the test is <a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/bo%C3%AEte-%C3%A0-outils/plongez-dans-les-images-de-14-18-en-testant-un-nouveau-moteur-de-recherche\">GallicaPix</a>, an advanced search tool focusing on WWI iconography. It aims to identify images in all types of prints using artificial intelligence on OCRed and OLRed digitised collections. This image retrieval tool - documented <a href=\"https://altomator.github.io/Image_Retrieval/\">here</a> - was developed\_jointly by BnF expert Jean-Philippe Moreux and Guillaume Chiron, researcher at La Rochelle University.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Collaborative projects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Inviting new projects or simply inviting people to take part in an existing project, the '<a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/projets-collaboratifs/gallicarte-un-projet-de-g%C3%A9olocalisation-des-r%C3%A9sultats-de-recherche-dans\">Projets collaboratifs</a>'\_(Collaborative Projects) section of Gallica Studio is as varied as the\_projects themselves. These projects can focus on indexation or geolocation, on annotation or document-sharing, on a collaborative encyclopedia on a given topic, on sharing tutorials, etc. These are all projects carried out by Gallica’s users and the BnF together. For example, there is <a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/projets-collaboratifs/gallicarte-un-projet-de-g%C3%A9olocalisation-des-r%C3%A9sultats-de-recherche-dans\">Gallicarte</a>, winner of the 2016 BnF hackathon with a feature that displays Gallica search results on a map.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Veille des Gallicanautes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Documenting the creative and innovative uses produced by Gallica’s users, the '<a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/articles/2\">Veille des Gallicanautes</a>'\_(Users’ Projects) section of Gallica Studio is full of discoveries. You can find tips to create your own advent calendar, as well as a <a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/veille-des-gallicanautes/quand-les-gallicanautes-mettent-la-main-%C3%A0-la-p%C3%A2te\">gallery of pastries</a> baked from old recipes released last year as part of a gourmet heritage corpus. Also presented is the website '<a href=\"http://gallicastudio.bnf.fr/veille-des-gallicanautes/sur-les-traces-des-premiers-disquaires-parisiens-avec-gallica\">Disquaires de Paris</a>'\_with its interactive map that identifies the Parisian record dealers and vendors of phonograph cylinders, providing visual artifacts (photographs, record sleeves, stickers, advertisements, ephemera) to tell a piece of their story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Apple pie in Polish style\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/tarte_a_la_polonaise_patrimoine_gourmand_gallicastudio.jpg\"><em>'\_Apple pie in Polish style' by Octavine dans la Lune, credit: Gallica-BnF, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward, Gallica Studio will also offer artist residencies to revisit heritage through contemporary creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please feel free to have a look and to contact us with any hacking or designing project!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Europeana and me</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My experience with Europeana began back in 2009, when ICCU's Italian National aggregator, <a href=\"http://www.culturaitalia.it/opencms/it/contenuti/fotonotizie/Europeana__consultazione_pubblica_online.html?language=it&amp;tematica=Tipologia&amp;selected=0\">CulturaItalia</a>, where I work as project manager, started providing technical support to Italian libraries, museums and archives wishing to participate in the development of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I have worked on many projects of the Europeana family, such as <a href=\"http://www.athenaeurope.org/\">ATHENA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/\">Linked Heritage</a>, \_<a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/\">ATHENA Plus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.partage-plus.eu/\">PARTAGE</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana-photography.eu/\">EUROPEANA PHOTOGRAPHY</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeanasounds.eu/\">EUROPEANA SOUND</a>, <a href=\"http://ambrosia-europe.eu/\">AMBROSIA</a>, where I was involved in the process of selecting content and supporting content providers in delivering quality data. In the framework of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness/project-partners\">EUROPEANA AWARENESS</a>, I contributed to the organisation of Collection Days\_across Italy - a series of events aimed at encouraging individual citizens to share their memorabilia and stories on WW1 (1914-1918), to be digitised and uploaded to the Europeana catalogue, along with the institutional collections. This was a rewarding experience for me, as I believe that preserving cultural heritage collections, making them accessible to the public, and allowing citizens to participate in enriching and sharing them is one of the greatest challenges of cultural institutions. In the coming year, we at ICCU intend to continue in this direction by organising a Europeana Transcribathon on 1914-1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ICCU also manages one of the largest online manuscript databases - <a href=\"https://manus.iccu.sbn.it/index.php?lang=en\">Manusonline</a> - as well as an online database of early print editions - <a href=\"http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/web_iccu/ehome.htm\">Edit16</a>. These, together with <a href=\"http://www.internetculturale.it/opencms/opencms/it/\">InternetCulturale</a>, the digital repository of Italian libraries, offer the basis for Italy's contribution to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Europeana Rise of Literacy</a>, which I am currently coordinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Europeana Rise of Literacy, we are not only improving data quality, but also facilitating users' access to available materials through the creation of thematic 'entry points' and editorials on specific topics, to serve as 'paths' to the discovery of resources and collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>My aims as councillor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the Members Council\_of the Europeana Network Association, I will strive to boost the status of the national aggregators at the political level, as they are the pillars of the Europeana project, and are vital to its sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another goal which I intend to pursue is that of encouraging the involvement of the public in discovering, using and enriching our collections. In Italy, Europeana and CulturaItalia are quite well-known among experts in the field. We should, however, enlarge our audience by implementing awareness-raising strategies. One such strategy could be that of making our collections not only available, but also known and accessible to schools and universities. Most of the classrooms in Italy are equipped with interactive multimedia whiteboards (IWB) and PCs, with the possibility of broadband internet access. Europeana and its network have a wealth of relevant, quality content to deliver to them. Imagine virtual environments where students can discover millions of resources, create personal collections or school projects, and share their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emerging research infrastructures in the sector of cultural heritage and digital humanities, such as <a href=\"https://www.dariah.eu/\">DARIAH</a> and <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/\">CLARIN</a>, are also important allies for spreading the use of Europeana's extraordinary collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much has been done in the course of Europeana's first ten years. Millions of resources have been made available through a single access point, good practices of data quality and normalisation have been adopted, different languages and cultures meet in the Europeana Network Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let us find ways to expose ever wider audiences to our cultural heritage, to promote the role of Europeana in supporting social, cultural and economic innovation by opening up access to our shared heritage: #AllezCulture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Exploring our impact at the National Library of Wales'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Dafydd Tudur and Jason Evans tell us about their experiences with the Europeana Impact Playbook at the National Library of Wales, from downloading and trialling the Playbook in 2017, to having their Wikimedia project included as part of the five impact assessments to be developed with the support of Europeana in 2018.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Why we are interested in impact/how we got involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At a time when knowledge and information seems to be accessible anywhere, at anytime, the need for cultural organisations to design and measure the impact of their activities is greater than ever before. Realising this, I immediately saw the value of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact?utm_source=Pro&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Impact%20Playbook&amp;utm_content=NLW%20-%20Impact%20blog\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> as a step towards having a standard method of measuring the National Library of Wales’s impact. Attending the ‘Culture 3.0’ event hosted by the EU Presidency in Tallinn in October gave me an opportunity to learn more about the Playbook from some of those who had been working on it, and consider further how it could be applied to some of our own projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A trial run of the playbook</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the weeks after the event in Tallinn, I discussed the Playbook with colleagues at the National Library of Wales and ran a workshop to try it out on one of our upcoming activities. Having participated in the workshop, my colleagues could see how the Playbook led to discussions and insights that could not only allow us to measure, but also to increase the impact of our activities. I have shared some of my first-hand experience of using the Playbook <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-the-impact-playbook-is-empowering-libraries-a-user-perspective\">in a use case</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taking that a little bit further: NLW + national Wikimedian</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a change in policy in 2013 which supported open access to its historical collections, the National Library of Wales appointed a Wikipedian in Residence in order to proactively share its data via Wikimedia platforms and to support the development of Welsh language and Wales-related content on Wikipedia. Fast forward several years and the library is now one of just a handful of organisations worldwide who employ a full-time Wikimedian. The ‘National Wikimedian’ has a remit to develop open access initiatives within the institution, and in Wales more widely. They regularly support and organise Wikipedia editing workshops and edit-a-thon events, support a team of Wiki volunteers at the National Library and share library data via Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2015, the Library’s partnership with Wikimedia UK has led to the release of nearly 15,000 openly licensed images, 10,000 new Wikipedia articles and the creation of 33,000 Wikidata items. We know that Wikipedia articles containing our images have been viewed 380 million times since the beginning of the project and we know that over 350 people have been involved in our events, but beyond this we have very little insight into the impact of this collaboration.\_Like many institutions we must balance open access with income generation, so it would be incredibly powerful to understand the economic value of open access initiatives. What does our local economy gain from access to rich cultural data and all the outreach work which goes on as a result?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to understand the impact on the reach and reputation of the National Library. But more importantly, how can we measure the impact of our Wiki projects on those who view, use, or repurpose our open content? And what might be the impact on volunteers gaining computer literacy and language skills through learning to edit Wikipedia?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of the Impact Playbook presents a golden opportunity for us to dig deeper into the actual and perceived impacts of our Wikimedia projects.\_We are delighted we will be the focus of one of Europeana’s five impact assessments in 2018 as part of\_the next phase of the Impact Playbook, and we hope our findings will help inform future projects and strengthen the case for open access as an effective vehicle for meeting the institution’s strategic goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To stay up-to-date with the latest news in impact and with the development of the Impact Playbook, visit our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact?utm_source=Pro&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=Impact%20Playbook&amp;utm_content=NLW%20-%20Impact%20blog\">Impact webpages</a>\_and join our <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13528017\">community on LinkedIn</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Improving discoverability with new ‘entities’ in Europeana Collections'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana provides strong searching capabilities of its collections, and it’s getting better at showing how items are connected to each other, and providing an alternative way of exploring material.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana Collections has always required people to find an item they’re interested in before they can\_find other records by the same creator or topic. We’re in the early stages of a significant improvement to our browsing abilities, and with last year’s release of ‘entity’ pages we’ve made some real improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is an ‘entity’ page?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Entity pages on Europeana Collections are the entry points to content by a specific person, or a topic (other types of entities will come later). They provide context to the items, through depictions and metadata relating to that person or topic. Let’s take Lucien Capet as an example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above\_is the landing page for Lucien Capet. It contains biographical information that confirms his identity and lists items that were created by or about him. These pages are currently only discoverable through the metadata available on the item pages (by clicking on a hyperlinked word or phrase). Previously, this would have triggered a search for the phrase; now it goes directly to an entity page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that while this might not seem to be a huge deal to the person searching for information, the SEO benefits are significant as this offers an accessible point for search engines to discover related and high-quality content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Multilingual searching abilities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking a famous artist such as Johannes Vermeer as an example. In the majority of languages, someone wanting to see works by him would probably be searching for ‘Johannes Vermeer’, but what if the user is from a country where the language uses a different character set? When an item is connected to an entity, it gains the multilingual search terms associated with that entity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Johannes Vermeer entity\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/Entities2.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2021672/resource_document_mauritshuis_670.html\"><span>Meisje met de parel\_</span><span>Girl with a Pearl Earring</span></a>. <span>Johannes\_Vermeer. </span>Mauritshuis. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This object is connected to Johannes Vermeer as an entity, and therefore is searchable not only in Latin script, but also in other languages such as Japanese and Arabic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future intentions for Entities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While we currently only offer pages for individual entities at present, the long-term ambition is to offer browse pages which allow people to filter through other kinds of entities that help contextualise the item further. Examples of this could be the ability to view a list of all ‘creators’ of content within Europeana Collections, and then filter this list by options such as ‘Painter’, ‘Inventor’, ‘Philanthropist’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This benefits the person browsing collections because it means they can discover what kind of content is in Europeana, without having to find an item first. It also benefits people using a search engine, as these pages will be highly crawlable by Google and provider better access for bots to a broader range of content.</p>\r\n"

        title: '#MakeWithEuropeana: Makers market pilot report'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana releases its report of the makers market and sets out recommendations for our future approach to reaching this segment of the creative industries.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In 2017, we recognised <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/inspire-makers-to-creatively-transform-europe-s-digital-cultural-heritage\" target=\"_blank\">makers</a> as a business development opportunity for Europeana and committed to investigate this creative industries submarket in a small pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot consisted of two phases. The first phase was theoretical and involved in-depth desk research into the maker movement from a wide variety of online sources. Phase two covered a nine-month practical experiment to gather first-hand experiences on the maker market, evaluate the attractiveness of our reuse offer to makers as well as the potential impact we could have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This practical experiment included an industry consultation, a promotional campaign and an investigation of relevant content distribution formats. We interviewed selected professionals from various domains and countries (Europe and North America) and with direct (international) experience with the maker communities. The promotional campaign included attendance at selected makers events and three online mini-campaigns on the Europeana Labs social media. Finally, we investigated the suitability of the various formats to bring content to makers, such as Pinterest boards and Europeana thematic collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Makers market pilot report</strong> documents our makers research and field findings throughout 2017, and proposes recommendations about the next steps for Europeana on the makers market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In brief, we will not pursue the maker market for the time being and will consider re-evaluation of this decision in two years. Meanwhile, we will monitor the maker market developments, focus on improving our 3D content offer and explore the link between makers and two other key markets for Europeana - education and cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Find out more about our conclusions in the report - download it now!</h2>\r\n"

        title: 'Capturing Fashion in the 20th Century with Frieda Dauphin-Verhees'' Study Collection'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>After collecting fashion objects for almost her entire life, costume design teacher Frieda Dauphin-Verhees decided to donate a part of her impressive clothing archive to the <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\" target=\"_blank\">Antwerp Fashion Museum - MoMu</a>. Through a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/celebrate-the-two-successful-projects-in-europeana-s-first-match-funding-call\" target=\"_blank\">crowdfunding campaign</a> via <a href=\"https://en.goteo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Goteo.org</a>, in collaboration with Europeana, MoMu raised the funding to create an educational tool from her collection.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Frieda Dauphin-Verhees is a costume designer who collected clothing and accessories throughout her entire life. Her collection consists of thousands of objects, from dresses from the roaring twenties and skirts from the fifties, to power pumps from the eighties. During Frieda’s career as a costume designer, these pieces inspired her work for theatre and movies. Later in her life, when Frieda taught costume design at the <a href=\"https://www.ap.be/royal-academy\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp</a>, her students researched costume history using her collection. Now that Frieda is no longer teaching, she was looking for a new home for her life’s work and found it in <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\" target=\"_blank\">MoMu</a>’s library, as a part of its study collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frieda partially donated her archive to MoMu so it can continue to inspire and educate people as a hands-on collection. Via the crowdfunding platform Goteo, and with the generous support of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/crowd-and-matchfunding\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s match funding program</a>, MoMu raised the necessary funding to integrate Frieda’s pieces into the museum’s study collection and build an educational tool with it, so it can be consulted by students, researchers and designers. The educational tool consists of the following components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>A physical archive. Frieda’s collection is properly stored in preservation-friendly boxes containing complete silhouettes (main garments, underclothing, accessories, shoes) documenting 20th-century fashion organised by time period. These boxes can be consulted in MoMu’s library by individuals and groups (secondary schools will be the main target). MoMu will also facilitate the use of these boxes by secondary schools within the MoMu library for training, workshops, etc. MoMu will also start an educational programme based on this collection.</li>\r\n    <li>Every artefact in these boxes is described according to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Data Model</a>, and will be shared on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Collections</a>.</li>\r\n    <li>MoMu has built a <a href=\"http://studiecollectie.momu.be/s/frieda-verhees-collectie/page/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> in the <a href=\"http://omeka.org/s/\" target=\"_blank\">open source CMS </a><a href=\"https://omeka.org/s/\" target=\"_blank\">Omeka-S</a>, in which more information on the project can be found and the collection can be consulted in a database.</li>\r\n    <li>Every artefact is digitally photographed by a professional photographer, coupled with the record in the online database, and made accessible under a CC BY-SA licence. These photos were also donated to <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:MoMu_Study_Collection\" target=\"_blank\">Wikimedia Commons</a>;</li>\r\n    <li>An educational video was made based on the content created for this project. In this video, Frieda Dauphin-Verhees tells the fascinating story behind the objects from her collection. The video is organised chronologically and offers context for the physical collection that is available for consultation. But it can also be viewed as a stand-alone documentary on fashion in the 20th century. The video is shared through MoMu’s Vimeo/youtube account, under an open licence.\_</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/254847187\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/254847187\">STUDY COLLECTION | Capturing Fashion in the 20th Century with Frieda Dauphin-Verhees' Study Collection</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/momuantwerp\">MoMu Fashion Museum Antwerp</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Frieda Dauphin-Verhees' Study Collection will be featured on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apps\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s apps gallery</a> and promoted to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/education\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s educational communities</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find more information at the <a href=\"http://studiecollectie.momu.be/s/frieda-verhees-collectie/page/welcome\" target=\"_blank\">Frieda Dauphin-Verhees' Study Collection's page </a>Or get in touch via\_<a href=\"mailto:dieter.suls@momu.be\">dieter.suls@momu.be</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the Members Council: Peter Soemers'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Hear directly from each of your elected Members Council representatives, and get to know them a little better.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Winning Gold</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In December I was elected as a member of the Members\_Council. It felt like an unexpected Olympic medal, because I don't work\_in a cultural heritage institution. I earn my living as a simple application manager at the Dutch central government (databases for CRM, patents and subsidies). In my spare time, I'm a lover of visual art and an avid museum visitor. Since museum professionals have become accessible to people like me via social media, I have learned about OpenGLAM and Europeana; eventually they became my passion! By opening up minds and collections to the outside world cultural heritage institutions have won gold!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The Stream of Life\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/app.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2021012/app_si_A_II_968_3A20.html\"><span>Utför livets flod ; Vid livets ström</span><span>Elämän virralla\_</span><span>The Stream of Life; On the River of Life</span></a>. <a href=\"http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/app?si=A+II+968%3A20\">Finnish National Gallery</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Public Domain</a><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Touching hearts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the purpose of being a Councillor is not to parade with a medal on stage but to support Europeana in every way possible. What can members of the Network Association expect from me?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm excited every time content and projects of Europeana touch hearts. I am delighted to <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/183833345\">hear the testimonies</a> of people who took part in the collection days of Europeana 1914-1918. Their family history is now part of Europe's history. They are people like us; their fate could have been our fate... I sincerely hope that the collection days\_of the Europeana Migration campaign will also be enriching lives by telling stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A family with no history is not a family at all\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/family.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot/still from '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-family-with-no-history-is-not-a-family-at-all\">The impact of the war</a>'\_by Harry Verwayen, Europeana, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taking and using roots</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to focus on so-called end users, small institutions, private collections and the general appearance of Europeana. Does that make sense? I think so. Europeana resembles a big oak tree. It has solid roots, consisting of connections with cultural heritage institutions, partner organisations and member states. But without having and taking longer, thinner roots, really interacting with the soil ('<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-uldis-zarins-1\">collaborative platform</a>' of users), the tree could wither. Ultimately, cultural heritage must reach the hearts of individual people; that was also a conclusion of the 2016 Amsterdam symposium '<a href=\"https://issuu.com/cre-aid/docs/minocw-cultural-heritage\">Ready to reach out</a>'\_(e.g. Martine Reicherts).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the ways in which I try to do this is making personal connections with cultural workers and bloggers. Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PSoemers\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tanjapraske.de/author/peter-soemers/\">blogposts</a> and also via the modest <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-europeana-trusted-bloggers-programme-it-s-all-about-making-meaningful-connections\">Europeana Trusted Blogger</a> pilot. As a Councillor, I hope I can do more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"textil, cloth\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/textil.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/91608/SMVK_VKM_objekt_2441140.html\"><span>textil, cloth</span></a>. <a href=\"http://collections.smvk.se/carlotta-vkm/web/object/2441140\">Världskulturmuseet</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a><span>.\_</span></span>Textile from artwork 'Hardship and hope: Crossing the U.S. Mexico Border'\_(2010): 'Each object found embedded in the sand carries a personal untold story'.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Being human</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like to see Europeana in the perspective of our fundamental human responsibility for each other. History shows dictators and terrorists constantly trying to expand their power by depriving people\_of their identity. By making cultural heritage publicly available, Europeana tries to do the contrary, giving every person the opportunity to discover and shape his/her own identity. Who I am is a layered thing, consisting of many influences and my own choices. Our shared European identity is an important layer - although it sometimes seems to cover tectonic plates rubbing against each other. Culture does not always connect people.\_This has to be counterbalanced by our most fundamental common identity: being human. This should always be in the lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, my 'holy book' for my commitment to a network wanting to be relevant to society is the 'Europeana Dream' of Nick Poole, former Chair of the Network:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjBvJNRFTlM\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana, take up your responsibility!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Beyond the walls of our museum: open access insights from the Mauritshuis'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Last year, the Mauritshuis published its collections in Europeana Collections in high-resolution and in\_the public domain, joining leading institutions in the <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenGLAM</a> movement to promote open access to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Curator <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lea-van-der-vinde-4a05122/\" target=\"_blank\">Lea van der Vinde</a>\_tells Douglas McCarthy how\_open access helps the Mauritshuis fulfil its mission.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Why does the\_Mauritshuis feel\_it is\_important to make its collection available outside of the museum? Who are you trying to reach?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that the artworks in the collection of the <a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Mauritshuis</a> are of great importance to many people. They evoke feelings and thoughts, spark interest and creativity, and so much more. So sharing images of the works freely\_for people to enjoy, but also to use for educational and research purposes, is very important to us. The mission of the Mauritshuis is to share the best of Dutch Golden Age painting in our building – but of course, the impact of the collection goes well beyond the walls of our museum, and by providing high-resolution images of the artworks we are able to share these treasures with many more people than ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What advice would you give to other museums considering opening up their collections?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In these\_times, digital access to cultural heritage\_is of great importance. Our\_audience (rightly!) expects to be able to find high-resolution images of artworks from the collection on our website, as well as on digital platforms like Europeana Collections. One of the main reasons for digitising collections is to make them more available to the public, of course, but releasing the digital images into the public domain truly makes them as accessible as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The quality of the digitised artworks\_is fantastic. How did you go about photographing the\_collection?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With around 850 artworks, the collection of the Mauritshuis is rather comprehensive, which provided us with the opportunity to start a digitisation project with the (realistic!) goal of\_creating new high-resolution photography of the entire collection. This project was made possible by a donation from the BankGiro Lottery. We knew it would be a major undertaking, especially as we decided to photograph every painting in detail in an unframed state, both front and back, and also including the (current) frame. The renovation and expansion of the Mauritshuis during the years 2012-2014 presented us with the perfect starting point. At that time, a large part of our collection was kept in storage and therefore easily available for photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/Mauritshuis%20crop%20detail.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Liberation of Peter (detail), 1624. Hendrick ter Brugghen. Mauritshuis, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What do you hope to achieve through working with Europeana?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope more people will connect with the artworks of the Mauritshuis and\_with great artists like Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Rubens, Hans Holbein, and so many more. Sharing the images of the collection on Europeana will surely have a great added value because\_the Mauritshuis collection has now become part of the immensely rich Europeana collection of over 50 million digital items! This opens up many possibilities for\_reuse and sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Finally, tell us about your some of favourite objects in the Mauritshuis.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am glad that I'm\_not asked to single out only one favourite! Of course I love Vermeer and Frans Hals, but I also have a soft spot for the lesser-known masters, or paintings of the famous ones that are, for some reason, not generally as well-known. Rembrandt, for instance, is represented in the Mauritshuis with several masterworks, like the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021672/resource_document_mauritshuis_146.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp</em></a>. It’s easily overlooked, but we also exhibit a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021672/resource_document_mauritshuis_598.html\" target=\"_blank\">tiny work</a> by him, painted in expressive brushstrokes on a copper plate. It pictures a bearded man with a rather infectious\_laugh – it’s impossible not to smile back at him when you see it! Also the works by 17th century female artists, like this\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2021672/resource_document_mauritshuis_1203.html\" target=\"_blank\">exquisite still-life</a> by Clara Peeters, are amongst my personal favourites.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?locale=en&amp;per_page=36&amp;q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Mauritshuis%22&amp;view=grid\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Explore Mauritshuis artworks in Europeana Collections</strong></a></h3>\r\n"

        body: "<p>#ColorOurCollections is a week-long colouring fest on social media organised by libraries, archives, and other cultural institutions around the world.

        title: 'Mapping Migration in the arts: Another England'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of the Europeana Migration campaign, we highlight more initiatives relating to migration and culture beyond our own network.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Throughout 2018, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration\">Europeana Migration</a> will focus on how migration to, from and within Europe has shaped our cultural heritage. On the run-up to the campaign launch, we are featuring a number of interviews with arts and cultural heritage professionals working on projects related to migration, to shine a light on other initiatives showing the cultural sector’s response to this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, we speak to Becca Thomas, Creative Director of <a href=\"https://pidginperfect.com/\">Pidgin Perfect</a> about a <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/\">Historic England</a> project called <a href=\"http://anotherengland.co.uk/\">Another England</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Another England?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the British Nationality Act, as well as the centenary of the end of World War One. Our project takes this important year as its starting point, tracing a century in which black and Asian people influenced England’s culture, industry, economy, and national life as never before. Pidgin Perfect were commissioned by Historic England to develop this project which tells the story of the country’s rich multicultural heritage through place, and aims to better include black and Asian heritage in Historic England’s collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What activities are part of the project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have planned eight workshops throughout 2018, at which we invite the public to tell us about the places that are significant to their communities and localities. The next takes place in Birmingham in March. Through collaborative mapping activities, we look at cities and towns through themes of home, work, origins, culture, worship, resistance and more. The workshops also include presentations and special performances from black and Asian artists and historians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Another England workshop\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/AnotherEngland2.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><em>Another England workshop</em>\_©\_2018\_Bob Fallon for Historic England / Pidgin Perfect</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the online element to the project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re also collecting people’s ideas about important places online through our website\_<a href=\"http://www.anotherengland.co.uk\">www.anotherengland.co.uk</a>. This website is a standalone site, outside Historic England's main website. We found that this sense of independence has been important to help communities and project participants understand that this project is genuine. Working with a project team of experts from black and Asian communities and cultures has been instrumental too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Another England workshop\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-02/AnotherEngland1.jpg\"></p>\r\n<p><em>Another England workshop</em>\_©\_2018\_Bob Fallon for Historic England / Pidgin Perfect</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the significance of the project?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the majority of Historic England's collection relates to the history of white people. They are interested in diversifying their understanding of England's architectural history, to explore black and Asian history and the nation's buildings and spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the buildings identified in the workshops may not ordinarily be seen as architecturally significant, nor worthy of being protected. But this project is uncovering their social, cultural and historic importance for communities across England, and tells a fuller story of the country’s rich multicultural heritage.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 15-16 May,\_the third international EuropeanaTech conference will take place on the <a href=\"https://ssrotterdam.com/\">ss Rotterdam</a>,\_in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. EuropeanaTech 2018 places tech firmly at the centre of the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>, and we are delighted to announce the first wave of conference details and programme.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Gorgeous data, glorious technology - the digital face of culture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech 2018 brings together an international network of technical and R&amp;D specialists from cultural heritage organisations, research institutions and creative industries to share innovative development and predict the technical future of digital cultural heritage. The conference will focus on the three Ds; Data, Discovery and Delivery, spanning topics as diverse as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Centralised vs decentralised delivery</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Artificial recognition and intelligence</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Browse interfaces</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Structured commons</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Wikidata</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ingrid-mason\">Ingrid Mason</a> will be our master\_of ceremonies. A deployment strategist, echnologist, librarian and data specialist, Ingrid is a linked open data expert and leader in change associated with digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our confirmed keynote speakers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have four keynote speakers confirmed, with more to come. First up is Ben Vershbow. Ben is a digital innovator with more than a decade of experience at the intersection of libraries, publishing, arts and the web. Ben leads Wikimedia's Community Programs team and has long advocated for deeper collaboration between GLAMs, academia and the Wikimedia movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/robert-sanderson\">Robert Sanderson</a> is a world-renowned information scientist and expert in linked open data and the digitisation of cultural heritage. He is the Getty’s first semantic architect and is a passionate advocate for open culture. His conference call will be - to be successful in the missions of our organisations, we must take up the banner of usable data and 'Shout It Out: LOUD'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/george-oates\">George Oates</a> is the director of Good Form and Spectacle, CEO and founder of Museum in a Box, and inventor of The Commons on Flickr. George has an extensive CV of leading innovation in the cultural heritage sector. An experienced speaker about design, community and control, she will present ‘Every collection is a snowflake’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ruben-verborgh\">Ruben Verborgh</a> is a professor of Semantic Web technology at IDLab and a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation, Flanders. With expertise in decentralisation, hypermedia clients, Web APIs and Linked Data, Ruben is currently collaborating with Tim Berners-Lee on re-decentralising the web. \_Under the title 'One flew over the cuckoo’s nest', he will address the role of aggregation on a decentralised web.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The three Ds: <strong>Data</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Without data we have nothing. But sometimes the data we do have leaves much to be desired. Finding automatic ways to enrich it and improve its discoverability is the basis of making our cultural heritage work in the digital world. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We'll be joined by a number of data experts to give presentations and lead discussion:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sandra-fauconnier\">Sandra Fauconnier,</a> GLAM-Wiki strategist on Structured Data on 'Wikimedia Commons - Structuring and linking the world's heritage (and more!)'</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jason-evans\">Jason Evans</a>, National Library of Wales, just one of a handful of Wikimedians employed by a library worldwide with 'Wikidata in GLAMs. How and why'</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/emmanuelle-bermes\">Emmanuelle Bermes</a>, Deputy Director for Services and Networks at the National Library of France will host a vocabularies panel on ‘Wikidata as authority data’.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>The three Ds: <strong>Discovery</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The art of any digital strategy for a cultural heritage organisation is to increase the discoverability and use of its material. Discovery spans indexing by the search engines to getting people past the shop window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confirmed for EuropeanaTech so far are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/herbert-van-de-sompel\">Herbert Van De Sompel</a>, Information Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and Open Archives Initiative legend, will use insights gained from discussing link vulnerability for the document web to explore the problem domain for Linked Data collections in his presentation 'The Weak Link'. \_Herbert will end the first day with this talk as a 'Future Note'.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Tristan Roddis, Head of Web Development at Cogapp will be presenting on what computers see when they look at art and ’When automated analysis goes wrong'</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>The three Ds: <strong>Delivery</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So you’ve got good data, and worked on your UX design but how are you going to manage and deliver a service to your audience? How performant does your platform need to be? Are you API-centric?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll hear from:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/laurie-arp\">Laurie Arp</a> on her co-directed project ‘It Takes a Village: Open Source Software Models of Collaboration and Sustainability’</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Nora Al-Badri and Jan Nikolai Nelles, the artists who ‘acquired’ the 3D-Scan of Nefertiti’s Bust.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Plaban Bhowmick, Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology with a new take on aggregation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/chris-awre\">Chris Arwe</a>, Head of Information Services at the University of Hull with 'From Hydra to Samvera: evolution of an open source repository community'</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Our very own\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/valentine-charles\">Valentine Charles</a> who will talk the conference through the Europeana data aggregation product in development – Metis.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Register now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To see the latest EuropeanaTech 2018 programme visit our\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\">event page</a> where you can find out more and <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeanatech-conference-2018-ticket-tickets-43923398066\" target=\"_blank\">book your tickets</a>. \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll be announcing more conference details over the coming weeks, stay tuned for these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>We have two ways you can help us make this a possibility.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Everyone should know what they can do with the works they discover through Europeana Collections. This is the basic premise that drives our work to help data partners apply the most appropriate rights statements to the objects they publish. What if we made the information we publish about copyright and reuse available in your native language? Would it make it easier for you to understand and share?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Action #1: Trialling community-contributed translations into five languages</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to translate our basic copyright and reuse terms into all 28 official languages of the EU using the goodwill of our network. \_But this could turn into a complex task to ensure translations are accurate, so we’re going to take a lean approach and work with five languages to start with, using this experience to make it easier to translate the remaining 22. \_ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can you help? Other than English, do you speak one of the 28 official languages of the EU? Are you interested in providing a translation of our copyright and reuse information into your native language? \_If you are, \_let us know at <a href=\"mailto:copyright@europeana.eu?subject=Helping%20with%20Translations%20of%20Copyright%20Information\">copyright@europeana.eu</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll work with the first five languages you’re interested in translating and share our progress as we go. Keep an eye out for updates and calls for action via our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">new copyright community homepage</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaIPR\">@EuropeanaIPR</a> Twitter account. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Action #2: The German translation of RightsStatements.org now open for Public Consultation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana uses 6 statements derived from <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/rightsstatements-org\">RightsStatements.org consortium</a>. \_With huge thanks to Europeana Members Council Member<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-ellen-euler\"> Ellen Euler</a>, they have now been translated into German. \_The Consortium, who are starting to <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/documentation/translations.html\">process translations of statements</a> following their own Translation Policy, have undertaken two internal reviews. \_And they are now opening them up for public review - if you are a native German speaker, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OuAFgkl1JE_962K-_xtOHyNskFfRtWI4LB8bfFTzhWI/edit?usp=sharing\">check out the translation </a>and submit any feedback you have directly into the document by Midnight Friday 30 March. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once all the feedback has been reviewed and addressed, the translated statements will be available via <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org\">rightsstatements.org</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">will be accepted for use on Europeana Collections.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Greetings From Zagreb - a journey through time'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We talk to the people behind 'Greetings From Zagreb', an app that uses historical postcards\_that are available on Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Sofija Klarin Zadravec, National and University Library in Zagreb (NSK)\_Digital Library Adviser and\_Dragana Koljenik, Croatian Institute for Librarianship (operating as part of NSK), tell us about the Greetings From Zagreb app...</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pozdravizhrvatske.nsk.hr/zagrebapp/\">Greetings from Zagreb</a> is the first mobile application ever developed by a library in Croatia.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a part of the Greetings from Zagreb project, the main goal behind the app was to promote NSK<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/\"> Digital Library</a> and its<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=list&amp;filter=11689\"> Print Collection</a>. Using digitised historical postcards as the focal point of the app we wanted to improve the Digital Library user experience by offering a new way of engaging with the digitised material - in this case the postcard, an almost forgotten communication means. The app brings these historic postcards back to life by taking the user on a virtual tour through the city's ten most beautiful landmarks that are represented with 150 historical postcards from our collection. The postcards can be sent\_or shared with friends and family through email, text and social media. The app also has a Now&amp;Then feature that enables the full experience of the app and Zagreb even to those who are not there in person.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transcending divides</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The app is aimed at tourists and locals interested in Zagreb's past, but also at the general public usually not acquainted with the digitised cultural heritage of Croatia. We consider that the postcard as a medium transcends generational, educational and national divides and as such has the ability to reach wide audiences.<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=view&amp;id=11077\"> A colourful vintage card</a> with a message, greeting or a funny travel testimonial on the back\_is close and understandable to almost everyone. We presume that is the reason our app resonates with audiences that go beyond the usual library patron.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Postcards from a bygone time</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=list&amp;filter=11689&amp;mr%5B552911%5D=a\">Postcard Collection</a> is one of the biggest collections at the NSK<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=list&amp;oby=rmr&amp;obyt=a&amp;filter=11689&amp;rrep2=y&amp;user=y&amp;date=y&amp;pft=2&amp;restricted=n&amp;published=y&amp;pfvf=y&amp;mrf%5B10206%5D%5B549147%5D=a\"> Print Collection</a>. It holds more than 150,000 postcards featuring places in Croatia but also all kinds of greeting cards from the end of 19th\_century to the contemporary ones. They represent a record of a bygone time, show everyday life on the<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=linked&amp;c2o=549435&amp;grid=y\"> streets</a>,<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=linked&amp;c2o=549510&amp;grid=y\"> parks</a> and<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/?object=list&amp;mrf%5B10382%5D%5B549459%5D=a&amp;grid=y\"> squares</a> of Zagreb, but also testify to the universal human need to communicate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitised postcards from NSK Print Collection are also available on Europeana Collections as<br>\r\npart of its rich postcard collection (126,380 postcards and counting) from European heritage<br>\r\ninstitutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection represents an indispensable resource for researchers in various fields, historians and conservators.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Showcasing Croatia</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope to promote our Digital Library in a new and innovative way. We also want to open new paths for cross-sectoral collaboration and new partnerships including the cultural, IT, business and tourist sector. By launching this app, NSK has already affirmed itself as an important factor and an active participant in Croatian public life by showcasing what we are capable of and how our digital collections have the potential to create new values across various sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1,000 downloads</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the launch in December 2017 the app has promoted the Digital Library on an unprecedented level. Our<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb/\"> Digital Library</a> website had maximum number of hits in the whole year and we had more than 50 media coverages from national and international media outlets including print, radio, TV and Internet portals in less than 20 days after the launch. As far as the downloads go we are close to hitting our first 1,000!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Going beyond Zagreb</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Greetings from Zagreb app has great potential for further development. Our plan for 2018 is to start a nationwide campaign called Greetings from Croatia. This campaign would connect libraries throughout Croatia on a mass postcards digitisation and promotion campaign. We plan to continue promoting the app through various activities and channels such as<a href=\"http://place2go.org/\"> International Tourism Fair Place2go</a> in March and on the<a href=\"http://dfest.nsk.hr/\"> Eight Festival of Croatia's Digitisation Projects</a> in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the\_<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pozdravizzagrebagmail.greetingsfromzagreb&amp;hl=en&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1\" target=\"_blank\">app</a>\_or take a look at the project's\_<a href=\"http://pozdravizhrvatske.nsk.hr/zagreb/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Mapping Migration in the arts: The Real Face of White Australia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As part of the Europeana Migration campaign, we highlight initiatives relating to migration and culture beyond our own network.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Throughout 2018, Europeana Migration will focus on how migration to, from and within Europe has shaped our cultural heritage. In the run-up to the campaign launch, we are featuring a number of interviews with arts and cultural heritage professionals working on projects related to migration, to shine a light on other initiatives showing the cultural sector’s response to this topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time, we speak to Tim Sherratt, Associate Professor of Digital Heritage at the University of Canberra, who has led a project called The Real Face of White Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us about The Real Face of White Australia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Real Face of White Australia is a series of projects aimed at increasing awareness and use of a powerful set of historical documents created in the administration of the White Australia Policy in the first half of the twentieth century. These records are now preserved in the National Archives of Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The documents themselves are visually striking – particularly the identification certificates which often include portrait photographs and handprints. Back in 2012, Kate Bagnall and I downloaded thousands of digitised copies from the Archives’ database and ran them through a facial detection script. The result was a seemingly <a href=\"http://invisibleaustralians.org/faces/\">endless scrolling wall of faces</a> – a totally different way of seeing the records. Instead of files or metadata, you could see the people inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as the photographs and handprints, the documents also contain lots of information about ordinary people whose lives were monitored and controlled under Australia’s racist immigration policies. In 2017, we worked with undergraduate students at the University of Canberra to create a website where the <a href=\"http://transcribe.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/\">documents can be transcribed</a> – creating a valuable dataset for continuing research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was the White Australia Policy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early twentieth century, Australia defined itself as a ‘white man’s country’, yet the reality was something different. As well as Indigenous Australians, there were many thousands of non-Europeans living and working in Australia, including Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Afghans, Syrians and Malays. Many of them were born in Australia, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, the Australian government introduced a program of legislation that discriminated against non-Europeans. This became known as the White Australia Policy. These laws concerned things like immigration, citizenship, the right to vote, social security and employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Immigration Restriction Act, anyone entering Australia who was deemed not to be ‘white’ could be subjected to a ‘Dictation Test’. Despite its name, no-one was expected to pass this test – it was the mechanism for excluding those who didn’t fit the image of White Australia. Officials could choose the language of the test – it wasn’t just given in English – to make sure the arriving passenger failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Immigration Restriction Act meant that thousands of non-European people already living in Australia now had to carry special identification documents when they travelled overseas. Otherwise they could be subjected to the Dictation Test and denied re-entry. Many thousands of these documents – called Certificates of Domicile and Certificates Exempting from the Dictation Test – are held by the National Archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who has been involved in the project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://katebagnall.com/\">Kate Bagnall</a> is a historian of Chinese Australia who has been working with these records for many years. <a href=\"http://timsherratt.org/\">My research</a> is focused on politics and possibilities of digital cultural collections. We’ve both long been interested in how we can use digital technologies to open the records, and tell some of these stories online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve also involved students from the University of Canberra. Students in my <a href=\"https://2017.exploringdigitalheritage.net/\">Exploring Digital Heritage class</a> are expected to work on a digital project, so in 2017 we worked together to develop and promote a site for crowdsourced transcription of the White Australia records. The site uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/wragge/scribeAPI\">Scribe Framework</a>, a community transcription platform developed by Zooniverse and the New York Public Library. This part of the project was also supported by the University’s <a href=\"http://www.canberra.edu.au/research/faculty-research-centres/cccr\">Centre for Creative and Cultural Research</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course the project was only possible because the <a href=\"http://www.naa.gov.au/\">National Archives of Australia</a> had already digitised a large number of the documents and made them publicly available online. We were also supported by the <a href=\"https://www.moadoph.gov.au/\">Museum of Australian Democracy</a>, who helped us launch and publicise the project in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Real Face of White Australia transcribe-a-thon event\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/realface_1.jpg\"><br><em>Volunteers during the transcribe-athon at the Museum of Australian Democracy</em>,\_photo courtesy of Tim Sherratt</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What has happened?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We launched the transcription site in September 2017 at a weekend-long ‘transcribe-a-thon’ held at the Museum of Australian Democracy in Australia’s Old Parliament House in Canberra. The Scribe framework breaks the transcription process down into a series of self-contained steps – marking, transcribing and verifying. Over 2,000 documents were marked and classified during the transcribe-a-thon, with many people joining in via social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the documents are transcribed and verified through the website, data and images are made publicly available through a <a href=\"https://github.com/wragge/realface-data\">GitHub repository</a>. So far we have verified data for more than 800 certificates. There’s still plenty of work to do – join in at <a href=\"http://transcribe.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/\">http://transcribe.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve created a Twitter bot that shares micro-stories and photos from the transcribed documents. You can follow it at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InvisibleAus\">@invisibleaus</a>. We’re also working with a group of researchers in Melbourne to add another set of records relating to the White Australia Policy – this time registers rather than certificates – to the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s always been important to us to remember and respect the people whose lives are documented in these records. By transcribing the certificates – extracting information about their names, their ages, their places of birth, their travels overseas – we hope to <a href=\"http://chineseaustralia.org/how-i-found-dolly-denson/\">learn more about them</a> and their experiences; to reveal more of the ‘real face’ of White Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the project is not just about transcription, it’s also about awareness – about <a href=\"https://theresearchwhisperer.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/crowdsourcing/\">exposing these records</a> and <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-04/white-australia-policy-project-transcribes-history/8868680\">acknowledging this history</a>. There was some symbolism in the fact that we launched the project in Old Parliament House, where many aspects of the White Australia Policy were planned and implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as hosting the ‘transcribe-a-thon’, the Museum of Australian Democracy allowed us to use their digital projectors in the main hall at the centre of Old Parliament House. Perhaps the most powerful and moving moment for me was to see the faces of some of the people who lived their lives under the weight of the White Australia Policy projected in that space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Real Face of White Australia column projections\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/realface_2.jpg\"><br><em>Projections on the columns of King's Hall, Old Parliament House</em>, photo courtesy of Tim Sherratt</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Gender discrimination in the cultural heritage sector'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Reflecting upon biases in physical and online collections.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In recent months, the hashtag #Metoo has evolved from a debate on social media to a topic that sparks discussions throughout the world. It also reached the cultural heritage sector, for example when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/takedown-waterhouse-naked-nymphs-art-action-manchester-art-gallery-sonia-boyce\">Manchester Art Gallery decided to temporarily take down a painting</a> because of its sexist depiction of women. Or when <a href=\"https://minnen.se/tema/metoo\">Nordiska Museet</a> in Sweden started collecting #Metoo experiences as part of its collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museum collections are a treasure. They collect and preserve cultural heritage in all its diversity and tell us stories about people and societies. But still, they are highly subjective. It’s people and their choices who decide which story is worth telling and which one is not - and this power produces biases, considering the fact that historically evolved collections throughout the world are mostly the result of men making choices about cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, many of these choices have been good ones. They allow us to discover great artworks, ethnographic treasures from the past and documentation of intangible heritage. But there are <a href=\"https://nmwa.org/advocate/get-facts\">reasons </a>why artworks by women are much less represented in cultural heritage institutions, why there are fewer female directors or why you seldom hear about a new auction record for\_a female artist. Museums are part of a world that has been and still is discriminatory in many ways. The questions that arise from #Metoo and similar movements in the past few years are a chance to change that: museums should seize this opportunity and reflect the blind spots in collections due to lack of diversity in museums’ staff in most of the institutions’ history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://mm.dimu.org/image/032wZzh5vMtL?dimension=800x800\"><br><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/916118/S_TEK_object_TEKS0049530.html\">Washing machine by Husqvarna AB </a>, Tekniska museet, CC BY-SA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Objects play a crucial role in finding the balance in the ways women are depicted and represented in collections and exhibitions. Although gender norms and social expectations are inscribed in their design, they play an important role in giving insights into the everyday lives of women. As an example, I would like to take my own grandmother. She worked as a cleaning lady most of her life, raised two children and, until his death, she cared for my grandfather. She never obtained a formal education. She has never been offered the same opportunities as were her brothers. Her story is one of those important to understand a society but her name appears nowhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, I took her to an exhibition in a museum. One exhibit was an early version of a washing machine. My grandmother enthusiastically started to explain how much easier this machine made her life. Telling this story is not about how great it was or is to be a housewife. It is about how much it meant to my grandmother seeing that a piece of her own story and that of many other women of her generation is worth to be told and will be preserved for future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is what #Metoo could do for cultural heritage institutions: create more such moments. Moments in which a person from any background feels truly represented in the history that is preserved – in the physical as well as in digital realms: women, men, people of all national and social backgrounds. Happy Women’s Day!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The National Library of Finland: boost the value of your digital collections'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The National Library of Finland is the country's national aggregator, providing Europeana with almost 1 million digital objects from Finnish institutions. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MariaAnnele\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Virtanen</a>\_spoke to Douglas McCarthy about its recent national workshop in partnership with Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 15 February, the first <a href=\"https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/events/europeana-workshop-boost-the-value-of-your-digital-collections-1522018\">full-day workshop</a> about Europeana was held in Helsinki. Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy\">Douglas McCarthy</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pierre-edouard-barrault\">Pierre-Edouard Barrault</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-karin-glasemann\">Karin Glasemann</a> from the National Museum of Sweden, packed their suitcases and travelled to snowy Helsinki to share their expertise with Finnish colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘How to boost the value of your digital collections’ was the day’s theme. Key questions included: what are the benefits and joys of opening up collections? What kind of opportunities does Europeana offer to participating partners? How can Finnish archives, libraries\_and museums make their collections accessible via Europeana?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 60 professionals from all kinds of Finnish museums, archives and libraries – plus active members of Open Knowledge Finland and Wikimedia Finland – took part in the event. Around 30 of them did so online via Adobe Connect, which National Library uses regularly to expand participation\_in a country with long distances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Karin Glasemann gave an <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/secret/CmExhcVse8Qien\" target=\"_blank\">inspiring introduction</a> about the National Museum of Sweden’s open access policy and practices. Her presentation warmed up the participants for the important themes covered during the workshop: the benefits of open licensing, the importance of high-quality metadata and excellent digital reproductions. Having a guest from a neighbouring country proved to be good choice because of the cultural affinities\_– if they can do it in Sweden, why can’t we? If it was a success for them, why can’t it be a success for us? It's\_also easy to cooperate with and seek advice from colleagues nearby. The National Museum of Sweden has, for example, published paintings online as <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF resources</a>, something no Finnish organisation has experience of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/no%20metadata%20no%20future.png\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>'No Metadata No Future' – a message from Karin Glasemann's presentation. nometadata.org logo CC BY-NC-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight of the workshop followed when Hanna-Leena Paloposki from the Finnish National Gallery talked about her recent <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/museums-in-the-digital-age-insights-from-the-finnish-national-gallery\">residency at Europeana</a>. She then announced that the\_Gallery's\_decision to apply\_CC0 licences to digital reproductions of its\_Gallery’s out-of-copyright works! The workshop audience applauded spontaneously to the news, which <a href=\"https://twitter.com/finnishngallery/status/964095532846239744\">quickly spread</a> on social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the day\_Douglas, Pierre-Edouard and the Finnish presenters provided workshop participants with information about Europeana and things to consider when providing cultural heritage data. Europeana’s publishing and licensing frameworks were made familiar to the participants who also took part in interactive exercises. Pierre-Edouard had visited the National Library a day before the workshop and discussed data workflows with the Library team, both from Europeana’s and from the Library’s points of view. This was very\_useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the workshop the participants chose between two interactive sessions: one was about the data quality and the other about the educational use of cultural heritage data with guests from Finnish educational sector. It was already 5pm, but participants stayed active until the end and discussion was so lively that the workshop run a bit overtime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was felt that the national workshop made a difference for Finnish GLAM organisations: new libraries, archives and museums realised what kind of value providing data to Europeana could have for their organisations, and new thoughts about openness were seeded.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<h3>Us, them, everyone - who are the RightsStatements.org Consortium?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Consortium is currently made up of five members - all international or national level aggregators. \_These are the founding members of the \_<a href=\"https://dp.la/\">DPLA</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>, who were joined in 2017 by Canada’s <a href=\"https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/search/Pages/search.aspx\">Digital Library and Archives</a>, India’s <a href=\"https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/\">National Digital Library</a> and <a href=\"https://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove, National Library of Australia</a>. \_The work of the Consortium is led by a Steering Committee that continues to be chaired by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jill-cousins\">Jill Cousins</a> until 30th June 2018, with a newly appointed Vice-Chair<a href=\"http://www.goc411.ca/en/96799/Caitlin-Horrall\"> Caitlin Horrall </a>from Canada's Library and Archives.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/about.html\">Two Working Groups </a>undertake the development work for the consortium: \_The Statements Working Group, co-chaired by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.dp.la/about-dpla-pro/staff\">Emily Gore</a>, and the Technical Working Group, co-chaired by <a href=\"http://library.stanford.edu/people/matienzo\">Mark Matienzo</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/antoine-isaac\">Antoine Isaac</a>. Each member has a seat on the Steering Committee. \_And the work of the Consortium is supported by a coordinator sourced from one of the members - at the moment that’s me!\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan for 2018 is a year is all about development and refinement of what we do</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>From zero to a five member consortium with 27 million digital objects around the world using the statements provided by the consortium - \_2017 was a productive year. \_Building on that, the Steering Committee have set <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2GpGyaZ\">four goals for the Consortium to achieve in 2018</a>;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal #1 is to<strong>\_grow a thriving consortium</strong> by increasing membership to gain financial sustainability and reach across the globe. The consortium will then ensure take-up \_and use of rights statements, proving the worth of such globally interoperable standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal #2 is to<strong>\_develop products and services that focus on the needs of new members</strong> by developing a model implementation cycle to make rights statements easily implementable and therefore operational.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal #3 is\_to <strong>develop products and services that meet the needs and expectations of all members</strong> through the work of the Technical and Statements working groups, which will gather user needs and improvements.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal #4 is to <strong>nurture a well-informed and active community</strong> by improving the channels of communication to create awareness of the value of rights statements and increase their use within the cultural heritage institutions worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2GpGyaZ\">business plan</a> is published at <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org\">RightsStatements.org</a>, along with a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2DiEbTS\">Consortium Work Plan</a> which provides more detail on how the Consortium\_plan to fulfill the four goals for 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can keep in touch via <a href=\"mailto:info@rightsstatements.org?subject=Question%20about%20the%20rightsstatements.org%20business%20plan%202018\">email</a>, follow <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2HjMTUg\">@RightsStmts</a>\_on\_twitter or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2tCJvCi\">the RightsStatements Consortium on Linkedin.</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Europeana kicks off Europeana Migration collection days in the House of European History in Brussels (15-17 March)</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Netherlands, 13 March 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2018 is the European Year of Cultural Heritage, and the Europe we inhabit today is the result of migration, as generation after generation of people spread across the continent and carried their ideas with them. To celebrate this dedicated year, Europeana, the European digital platform for cultural heritage, invites all Europeans, young and old, to share the objects that help them tell their own stories of migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pan-European campaign will kick off on Thursday 15 March in partnership with the House of European History, in Brussels. ‘Everybody has a story to tell about their origins, and the moments that shaped their lives. We want people to share those stories and the objects that tell them, and to help us bring them together online. In that way we can celebrate the diversity and richness of the cultural heritage that is being passed on generation after generation, all over Europe’ says Harry Verwayen, acting Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Blending family stories all over Europe</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is a partner to the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage. Throughout the year, Europeana will run a series of collection day events in partnership with museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections across Europe to build a new online collection, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration</a>, that will showcase how the flow of people and ideas has contributed to the richness of Europe’s culture today. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to use people’s meaningful objects, ranging from family photographs to letters and postcards and recipes, to help Europeana to tell the story of Europe and the people who live here. These objects and stories will sit alongside items from museums across Europe, helping to paint a bigger picture of European migration movements over the last few centuries. They will be recorded online for posterity and made available for all to discover and use for education, research, inspiration and pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana invites all visitors to share their family objects and stories to help build this online collection showcasing Europe’s rich history of migration. \_Events will be held across Europe throughout the year, starting with a three-day event at the House of European History on 15-17 March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘We are proud to host these Migration Collection Days to celebrate our European cultural heritage and to allow people to share and explore their own personal history, which is at the origin of the Europe we know today,’ says Constanze Itzel, Director of the House of European History.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Future events\_</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>10-11 May\_2018, Hungarian National Museum, Budapest, Hungary (partners: REACH Project partners, National Archives of Hungary)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>25-26 May\_2018, EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, Dublin, Ireland</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>23 June\_2018, Instituto Cervantes Library, Utrecht, The Netherlands</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>June* [date TBC] 2018, Cardiff, Wales (partners: National Library of Wales, Millennium Centre, Cardiff, Wikimedia UK)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>18-19 August\_2018, EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, Dublin, Ireland</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>12 September\_2018, Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies in cooperation with Croatian Heritage Foundation, Zagreb Croatia (partners: Croatian Ministry of Culture, National and University Library in Zagreb, Croatian Radio Television)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>23 September 2018, Centre de documentation sur les migrations humaines, Luxembourg</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>24-25 November\_2018, EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, Dublin, Ireland</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Autumn 2018*, National Library of Latvia and Latvian Museum of Emigration, Riga, Latvia</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Autumn 2018*, National Library of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>*Dates subject to final confirmation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If people cannot attend the events they can also <a href=\"https://migration.europeana.eu/share\">contribute online</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notes for Editors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAbout Europeana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’.<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\"> Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

Visitors can discover the origins and evolution of Europe, learning about both the continent’s diversity and history’s many interpretations of its story. The learning offer of the museum takes a trans-European viewpoint that explores the historical memories, diverse experiences and common ground of the peoples of Europe and how these relate to the present day. Available in 24 languages, entrance to the museum is free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana DSI is co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Open access for fascinating South-Arabian ‘squeezes’ from the Glaser Collection'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Copies of several hundred open access South-Arabian stone inscriptions have been made available in Europeana Collections via Kulturpool by the Austrian Academy of Sciences.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Guest blog by\_Petra Aigner,\_leader of a project titled '<a href=\"http://glaser.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/gl/about\">Pilot-3D-Digitizing of Rare Ancient South Arabian Squeezes, 19th Century Glaser Collection</a>'.</em>\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection of the Austrian scholar and explorer Eduard Glaser (1855-1908) was acquired for a large sum of money in 1910 by the Academy of Sciences in Vienna. The epigrapher and specialist in the South-Arabian languages collected a huge amount of medieval Arabic manuscripts and stone inscriptions that are now spread all over Europe. He also collected ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_paper\">squeezes</a>’ (a kind of copy on paper) of the non-transportable ones, as well as photographs, glass-negatives, diaries, and notes of historical importance. The Academy owns the latter precious documents of the 1880s and 1890s and through two projects is digitally preserving and scientifically analysing them. This is another step towards the integration of the history and culture of South Arabia within the field of ancient Near Eastern studies and will help to give a fuller historical background of\_the early first millennium BCE till the rise of Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eduard Glaser collected these inscriptions during four expeditions (1882-1884, 1885-1886, 1887-1888, 1892-1894) to South Arabia - now largely the Republic of Yemen. Most of the squeezes are currently in a very poor state, while the original inscriptions are in many cases damaged and are (given Yemen’s political instability) inaccessible anyway. The preservation of this valuable epigraphic corpus will amount to the preservation of a significant part of ancient Yemen’s history and culture and, more broadly speaking, the preservation of an often overlooked part of the Semitic-speaking Near East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inscriptions are written in Ḥaḍramitic, Qatabānic, Minaic, and Sabaic languages of Ancient South Arabia. The time range is from 800 BCE-600 CE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost 500 items from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A15515*&amp;view=grid\">the Glaser Collection</a>\_were transferred to Europeana Collections by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Library, Archive &amp; Collections (BAS:IS). The scans are available for use under an open licence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Hatke (Austrian Academy of Sciences, University of Vienna) is responsible for all transcriptions of the texts preserved in the squeezes, together with the translations and commentary. These remain intellectual property of the author. Please contact George.hatke@univie.ac.at</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Throughout 2018, the European Year of Cultural Heritage, Europeana will run a series of collection days and events involving museums, libraries, archives and audiovisual collections across Europe that specialise in or are interested in the theme of migration.<br><br>\r\nPeople across Europe, young and old, will be encouraged to join in both online - by contributing to and exploring our migration collection - and by participating at museum events where they can add their personal migration stories, with material such as pictures, diaries, videos and letters, to the collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/make-your-story-of-migration-part-of-a-new-digital-collection\">first event</a> of this pan-European campaign kicks off today, Thursday 15th, through to Saturday 17th March, in partnership with the House of European History, in Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“Everybody has a story to tell about their origins, and the moments that shaped their lives. We want people to share those stories and the objects that tell them, and to help us bring them together online. In that way we can celebrate the diversity and richness of the cultural heritage that is being passed on generation after generation, all over Europe”</em>\_- Harry Verwayen, acting Executive Director at Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People across Europe will be encouraged to help build this collection throughout the year. Further events will be held throughout 2018 in Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Wales, Luxembourg, Croatia and Latvia, with more to be announced. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration#upcoming-events\">See the full list here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your organisation is interested in sharing your migration content as part of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">collection</a>, or running a collection day then please contact <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/adrian-murphy\">Adrian Murphy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a migration story to tell and object to share we’d love to see you at one of the collection days, or to have you <a href=\"https://migration.europeana.eu/share\">contribute online</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'First 2018 Members Council meeting in The Hague: Rebooting and starting afresh'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 6 March, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Network Association's Members Council</a> gathered in the National Library of The Netherlands in The Hague for their first 2018 meeting. It was very fruitful, full of fresh ideas and breakthroughs, and resulting in positive structural changes that will pave the way for the Association’s work in 2018 and beyond.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>First, we gave a warm welcome to the four new Councillors - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Di Giorgio</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kate-fernie\" target=\"_blank\">Kate Fernie</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/peter-soemers\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Soemers</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-streefkerk\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Streefkerk</a> - who started serving their three-year terms. The Chair of the Europeana Network Association, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, started the meeting with reflections on how to structure the common collaborative efforts in a better way to create and facilitate a true 'network of networks’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Council discussed the current and future Network Association’s aspirations, with the main objective to improve the current set-up in order to activate and strengthen the Network. The Councillors agreed that a strong Network with its own identity can effectively back up the core mission of Europeana and provide a high level of professional and personal fulfilment and a feeling of ownership for its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plenary discussion then revolved around how each of the Councillors can contribute to a better functioning of the Association, turning the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2017/Europeana-Joint-Aspiration-and-Association-Approach-2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Joint Aspiration and ENA Approach</a> into action. While focus on community-building efforts, they agreed to regularly work together in small groups on specific key areas of interest. Councillors were also asked to give their opinion about what they think has been working well and what some of the remaining challenges are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Network made of communities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The afternoon session of the meeting was dedicated to the next key topic - implementation of the new community-based Network structure. The Network will be reshaped around 'communities' of interest. They will be based on areas of professional or personal common interest, the challenges and needs of the Network members, or thematic channels/markets of Europeana. They can have regional/national representation with members sharing knowledge and best practice and raising specific bottom-up initiatives in a way that is rewarding and challenging at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board and the Council identified and started exploring the future functioning of five proposed communities of interest:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Technical standards</li>\r\n    <li>Impact</li>\r\n    <li>Innovation within the sector</li>\r\n    <li>Outreach campaigns</li>\r\n    <li>Use of CHI In education and research.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/MC%20meeting%20The%20Hague.jpg\" style=\"height: 399px; width: 600px;\"><br><em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/40704729851/in/album-72157664495657837/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association Members Council meeting, 6 March 2018</a>, Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contributing to the Europeana Migration Campaign</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors were presented with the upcoming activities related to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Migration Campaign</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\" target=\"_blank\">collection</a>, being part of the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\" target=\"_blank\">2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage</a> (EYCH). The discussion then revolved around how the Councillors and their networks can contribute to the campaign and actively take part in cross-border activities related to the EYCH legacy and European Agenda for Culture. A few Councillors also shared their personal migration stories with Europeana teams during a small <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/make-your-story-of-migration-part-of-a-new-digital-collection\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana collection day</a> simulation. Finally, the usual formalities such as updates on the Association budget, Working Groups and Task Forces were also on the agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Coming up next</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find some pictures from the meeting on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/sets/72157664495657837\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Flickr</a>, and the minutes of the meeting together with the presentations will be published shortly. The next meeting will take place in The Hague in July 2018. If you wish your elected representative to tackle specific topics, let them know!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Foundation announces departure of Executive Director Jill Cousins'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Foundation Governing Board today announces the resignation and departure of its founding Executive Director, Jill Cousins.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>16 March 2018, The Hague</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins set up and led Europeana as the Executive Director of its governing Foundation since its beginnings in 2005/6, based on her work with the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL) to create The European Library in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the launch of the Europeana website in 2008, it has grown into a platform for the use and reuse of over 50 million cultural heritage items from across the whole of Europe and beyond. In 2012, Jill led a campaign to allow the metadata used to describe collection items to be made available under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a> (CC0). This was by far the largest one-time dedication of cultural data to the public domain, described at the time as ‘a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/12/europeana-cultural-heritage-library-europe\">coup d'etat</a> for advocates of open cultural data’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the quest to make cultural heritage relevant for everyone, Jill borrowed an idea from Oxford University to create <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918 </a>with its family collection days across Europe. \_Combined with institutional collections, this is the world’s largest archive of digital World War One material. More recently, she has started a similar endeavour with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration</a>, aimed at showing that we are all products of multicultural influences and that Europe’s cultural heritage is richer as the result of movements of people and ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind Europeana is a network of organisations and individuals spanning the cultural heritage and technology sectors, working towards a common goal, spearheaded by Jill Cousins - to transform the world with culture. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">Europeana Network</a> started as a means of sharing knowledge and development and has grown into an Association of more than 2,000 dedicated and active members which regularly shouts out for the importance of cultural heritage to society and democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Looking back there are many things I would want to have done better but I am very happy with the progress we made on the standardisation and interoperability of Europe’s digital cultural heritage because in doing so we have democratized access for everyone and made the material truly usable for education, research and the creative industries. \_\_This has been the ultimate joint effort - a really collaborative, commons endeavour, from so many selfless individuals who have dedicated their time and effort to showing that culture makes Europe borderless. #AllezCulture et merci à tous.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth Niggemann, Chair of the Europeana Foundation Governing Board, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The Europeana Foundation Governing Board is enormously appreciative of and inspired by all the work Jill has done over the years to transform the world with culture. We wish her every success in her new role and will miss her drive, her innovation and her infectious enthusiasm.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill will now take on a new challenge, leading the Hunt Museum in Limerick, Ireland, and continues to make our cultural heritage work across international borders as Chair of RightsStatements.org.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Foundation Governing Board is currently interviewing candidates for the role of Executive Director and has announced Harry Verwayen as the Acting Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation in the interim, effective immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E: Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’.<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\"> Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

        title: 'Creative reuse and open access at the Slovak National Gallery'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/michal-cudrnak\">Michal Čudrnák</a> tells us how\_openly licensed collections\_and creative reuse help\_the Slovak National Gallery reach new audiences.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3><strong>Since 2015, the Slovak National Gallery (SNG) has released high-resolution images of its collections into the public domain. What inspired this policy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While working on the <a href=\"https://www.webumenia.sk/en\">online catalogue</a> of artworks from Slovak collections four years ago, we were closely following the pioneers of open access in the GLAM sector. It seemed natural to us to release images of public domain artworks without restrictions. As a public institution, our mission is to safeguard the artworks and to make them accessible to the public. Why would we restrict usage, if there is no legal reason to do so, and when the revenue from licensing the digital images – at best – only covers the administrative costs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When advocating for the public domain release, we were fortunate to be supported by our Director, senior management and colleagues. At first we used the Creative Commons <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\">NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> licence, but we soon changed it to <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a> because the non-commercial statement created unnecessary restrictions and complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>SNG recently ran an <a href=\"https://www.webumenia.sk/en/kolekcia/103\">Art Remix</a> contest to inspire the creation of new works using\_images of its collection. Why did you do this?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening up digital collections is an important first step but it’s crucial to let people know what can be done with the\_images. To get the message out, it’s not enough to simply display the Public Domain logo – you should actively\_encourage people to use images, whether to print a T-shirt\_or make a Photoshopped collage. So together with the <a href=\"https://sensorium.is\">Sensorium Festival</a>, we circulated a call asking artists and creatives to remix the artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How did the contest turn out?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the <a href=\"https://www.webumenia.sk/en/kolekcia/103\">contest results</a>, we can see traces of current cultural trends and aesthetics – Snapchat portraits, iPhones inserted into paintings and so on. The young people who submitted most of the pieces projected their world onto the artworks. Even after the contest had finished, the remixing went on, such as these <a href=\"https://soda.o2.sk/pribehy/stur-stefanik-hodza-vylepsili-sme-vazne-vyrazy-slovenskych-dejatelov\">Face-Apped historical portraits</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our aim was not to get new artworks into the SNG collection, but to make our public domain artworks a natural part of the web. As well as\_providing several access points to the images – be it Web umenia, Europeana, Wikipedia or Google Arts &amp; Culture –\_it's\_vital for them to become the raw material of creative reuse and to embed them in collective consciousness. This is similar to how well-known artworks in the analogue\_print era,\_endlessly reproduced in books and magazines, became\_part of daily life and shared culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How do projects like Art Remix relate to the Gallery’s mission?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>They are a natural extension of the Gallery’s mission to be an open institution. This is expressed in the way that colleagues curate and interpret artworks, how they engage with the public and the extent to which our institution becomes a part of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large part of our main building in Bratislava has been closed since 2001\_because of its deteriorating condition, so opportunities to exhibit artworks have been limited. I think this has resulted in a more creative approach to curating, designing and marketing exhibitions and to\_presenting the collections online. It has also blurred\_the conventional distinction between online and offline activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-03/SNG%20remix%202.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Patrik Baláž, 2017 remix of <a href=\"https://www.webumenia.sk/en/dielo/SVK:SNG.O_1554\">View from Rysov</a>, Public Domain</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What else have you been doing in this area?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some nice examples of artworks being used by designers and makers to create products, such as a <a href=\"https://www.kompot.sk/eshop-en-us/kids/t-shirts/psicek-a-macicka-kids-t-shirt/\">T-shirt</a> adorned with an image from <em>The Tales of Doggie and Moggie</em> by the painter and writer Josef Čapek (brother of Karel Čapek). Children from the post-war generation in former Czechoslovakia grew up with this book and its original illustrations (part of our collection) are well-known. A local company approached us about creating the T-shirt, a year before the works entered public domain. Now that anyone is free to download the images, we hope that similar reuse will follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Europeana publishes almost <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A07101%2A&amp;view=grid\">10,000 high-resolution and public domain images</a> from SNG. How does partnering with Europeana benefit the Gallery?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has a very good following and audience in the cultural sector, be it professionals or the general public. When Douglas recently promoted the Gallery’s collection\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CultureDoug/status/975649765932371970\">on Twitter</a>, I was pleased by the response and by the fact that a lot of people picked and tweeted artworks they liked: one person working on disability studies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daniel_blackie/status/975660911380914176\">shared</a> a painting titled <em>Blind Joe</em>, another <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kulturerbejahr/status/974688705276469248\">tweeted</a> a <em>Sleeping Dog</em> on the occasion of World Sleep Day. These simple but telling examples show that we need different channels/platforms to get the public domain artworks to different communities.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>23 March 2018, The Hague</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open Culture Award recognises an exemplary initiative promoting free and open access to cultural heritage collections; a project which showcases humanity’s patrimony freely, openly and without any restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe's digital platform for cultural heritage, providing online access to tens of millions of digitised items from cultural institutions across Europe - from books, photos and paintings to television broadcasts and 3D objects. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The OEA award recognises Europeana’s work in opening up this shared cultural wealth and working to make it freely available for learning, for research, for creatives and for pleasure - and in particular its efforts in making digital cultural heritage content available for use in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Acting Executive Director at Europeana, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘It is wonderful that the Open Education Awards have recognised Europeana’s work, especially in 2018, the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Our mission is to transform the world with culture by contributing to an open, knowledgeable and creative society.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>EuropeanaTech 2018 is a little over six weeks away. Joining the 300+ innovators and thought-leaders in tech in the cultural heritage sector are six keynote speakers from around the world. We\_are very excited to be introducing them, and their keynote presentations, over the next few weeks.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>About EuropeanaTech 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech 2018 will place tech firmly at the centre of the European Year of Cultural Heritage and will bring together an international network of technical and R&amp;D specialists from cultural heritage organisations, research institutions and creative industries. Leading specialists, practitioners and researchers from across the world will converge in Rotterdam in May 2018 to share innovative progress and forecast the technical future of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference will cover the three - Ds, Data, Discovery and Delivery -\_and we are delighted with the array of experts we have to lead us through these areas. No less so than our keynote speakers, who have been cherry-picked from different industries ranging from research to heritage, and who are recognised as world-leaders in their fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Book your place</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside our keynote speakers we have a very exciting line-up of speakers and panel members who are leading the way in tech, and there are even two free events on the day before the conference starts. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\">View the programme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeanatech-conference-2018-ticket-tickets-43923398066\">get your ticket now</a> for the bargain price of €185.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meet our keynote speakers:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/herbert-van-de-sompel\">Herbert Van de Sompel</a>, Information Scientist, Los Alamos National Laboratory, United States</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbert Van De Sompel is the most recent recipient of the Paul Evan Peters Award - awarded for a ground-breaking and lasting contribution to the creation and innovative use of network-based information resources and services that promote intellectual productivity and scholarship. Herbert was the first recipient of the SPARC Innovator Award by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) for starting the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and the open reference linking framework (OpenURL). We are delighted he is flying over to Europe to present the conference ‘Future Note’ on Tuesday 15 May, titled ‘The Weak Link’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Links are a powerful and essential component of the web but also its Achilles heel. We are all familiar with Link Rot - links stop working - but less so with Content Drift - the content at the end of links changes over time. While both Link Rot and Content Drift are generally a nuisance, they are unacceptable when links from managed collections, such as cultural heritage and scholarly communication, are concerned because they undermine the integrity of the collections. During the presentation, a wide range of technologies and approaches will be featured, including Persistent Identifiers, Robust Links, Link Decoration, Memento, Web Archives, and Linked Data Archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbert says: 'For 20 years, I have been focusing on leveraging the web for scholarly communication. There is a lot moving in that space but the neat stuff occurs and remains at the fringes, isn't able to go mainstream. I have witnessed a rather different dynamic when it comes to cultural heritage where some very significant technical innovations are becoming widely adopted. That is leading to significant levels of interoperability between collections and it brings us closer to a bright future with advanced cross-collection services. For anyone interested in learning where this is all heading, EuropeanaTech2018 should really be a blast.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/emilie-gordenker\">Emilie Gordenker</a>, Director, Mauritshuis, the Netherlands</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emilie Gordenker has been Director of the Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis in The Hague for the last ten years. An art historian, lecturer and curator, Emilie is presenting our closing keynote on Wednesday 16 May, titled ‘Dutch Old Masters and New Technologies’.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mauritshuis has a compact collection of 850 Old Master paintings, with a strong concentration of\_paintings of the Dutch Golden Age. The focus and quality of the museum's holdings - plus the setting in a 17th-century building - make the Mauritshuis unique. But this also presents a challenge: how do they make the narrow range of Old Master paintings come alive to a younger audience? In this lecture, Emilie will discuss recent initiatives that harness new technologies to attract a broad audience, from specialists to first-time visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-1b5fb939-8a8b-f23d-a507-d8c8ee13b794\">If you are interested in sponsoring the event, we have a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/sponsorship-options-at-europeanatech-2018\">range of options available.</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The latest Europeana #edTech Challenge invited entrepreneurs, developers, designers and creative thinkers to submit their best ideas for using cultural heritage and digital technologies to foster innovative learning and teaching.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The online competition closed at the end of February with nearly 80 applications from across the world. We evaluated each of them against the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yNY-6XSWTvzkxUdouDdJmKRivGouCOkmfYllREYqyFo/edit?ts=5a58c87e\">competition criteria</a> and shortlisted six projects. From there, an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-edtech-challenge-2018-jury\">international panel</a> of experts conducted personal interviews with the candidates to discuss their product concept and business model in greater detail, as well as cost estimates and delivery timeframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with a range of strong ideas with enthusiastic teams behind them, we decided to extend the prize fund to 34,000 EUR and support the further development of the two projects below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘Wonders of the World’</strong><br>\r\nCreator: Art Stories, Italy<br>\r\nAward: 14,000 EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Wonders of the World’ (provisional title) is an educational app that teaches primary school kids about world cultural heritage. An animated character, a child with a backpack, will lead kids on a discovery tour of 13 sites around the world. Each site will present architectural and historical content from Europeana (maps, photographs, paintings) and will challenge kids in a playful way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The app will use animation and gamification extensively to create engaging learning journeys and spark children’s curiosity and desire to travel and learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Wonders of the World’ will be available for iOS and Android. A small free version will be developed and promoted on www.bartolomeo.education, currently used by many Italian primary schools. The first release of the app will support English, French and Italian, with more languages to be added in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘Bird Memory Song’</strong><br>\r\nCreators: Léna Mazilu and Yoann Gueny - one person start-ups in France<br>\r\nAward: 20,000 EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Bird Memory Song’ is a hybrid education project for primary school children on birds and their songs. The project aims to teach younger generations about the diversity of wildlife and strengthen their relation to nature while improving the children’s visual observations skills and sound memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Bird Memory Song’ will come in two complementary formats: a poster and a digital application, bringing the physical and digital worlds together. Large, playful and colourful, the poster will present about 20 European birds illustrated in a realistic way. The project team will work closely with an orthologist on the bird selection as well as the design of educational content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application will bring a fun and educational component. In ‘Listening’ mode, the children will scan the bird on the poster and immediately see it come alive, hear its song (sourced from Europeana’s bird sound recordings collection) and find out more about this bird. In the ‘Memory’ mode, the children will listen to a song then find the matching bird on the poster. A points system, clues and tutorials as well as the introduction of various levels of game complexity will encourage children to train and start over to become an expert. The app and poster will be released in English and French. The app will be free and available for iOS and Android whereas the poster (and in the future, sound recording) sales will be managed via an e-shop.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In part two of our introduction to the EuropeanaTech 2018 keynote speakers, we present two more experts that we are thrilled to have joining the 300+ innovators and thought-leaders from around the world attending the event.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>About EuropeanaTech 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech 2018 will place tech firmly at the centre of the European Year of Cultural Heritage and will bring together an international network of technical and R&amp;D specialists from cultural heritage organisations, research institutions and creative industries. Leading specialists, practitioners and researchers from across the world will converge in Rotterdam in May 2018 to share innovative progress and forecast the technical future of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference will cover the three - Ds, Data, Discovery and Delivery -\_and we are delighted with the array of experts we have to lead us through these areas. No less so than our keynote speakers, who have been cherry-picked from different industries ranging from research to heritage, and who are recognised as world-leaders in their fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Book your place</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside our keynote speakers we have a very exciting line-up of speakers and panel members who are leading the way in tech, and there are even two free events on the day before the conference starts. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\">View the programme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeanatech-conference-2018-ticket-tickets-43923398066\">get your ticket now</a> for the bargain price of €185.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meet our keynote speakers:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Robert Sanderson, Semantic Architect, J. Paul Getty Trust, United States</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/robert-sanderson\">Robert Sanderson</a> is a world-renowned information scientist and expert in linked open data and the digitisation of cultural heritage. He is the Getty’s first semantic architect and is a passionate advocate for open culture. His conference call will be to 'Shout It Out: LOUD’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of the Semantic Web, built on RDF and standards-based, graph-centric\_technologies, led to a significant shift in the way we think about data. But thinking isn't\_enough. The introduction of Linked Open\_Data, with its five stars of excellence, led to a significant shift in the way we use the web to publish data. But just publishing isn't enough either.\_We are entering the next phase, caused by recognising that the key missing ingredient is\_usability of the data by consuming applications. We are moving rapidly towards Linked\_Open Usable Data. If the data is not usable or developer-friendly, then there will not be\_applications built that use it. If there is no use, there is no value to the resources invested in\_its creation, publication and improvement.<br><br>\r\nIn his Data strand keynote, on Tuesday 15 May, Robert will discuss some of the critical technology advancements and adopted best practices that have moved us closer to the goal line -\_from JSON-LD and schema.org,\_through IIIF and more recently linked.art. The presentation will contrast both processes and\_products, with an emphasis on adoption of standards to the benefit of the community. By\_learning from both successes and failures of technologies and communities, we can better\_enable the sustainable, decentralised delivery and discovery of culturally significant data and\_content. To be successful in the missions of our organisations, we must take up the banner of usable data and get LOUD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robert says: 'I am greatly looking forward to discussing the digital aspects of cultural heritage at the EuropeanaTech conference, as it brings together a diverse spectrum of museum, library, gallery and archival stakeholders and viewpoints on data, discovery and usability. EuropeanaTech makes the most of the network that Europeana has created to highlight the great work in Europe, and provide a practical forum for furthering cultural heritage, which is increasingly integrated and digital.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ruben Verborgh, Professor of Semantic Web technology, Ghent University, Belgium</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With expertise in decentralisation, hypermedia clients, Web APIs and Linked Data, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ruben-verborgh\">Ruben Verborgh</a> is currently collaborating with Tim Berners-Lee on re-decentralising the web. Under the title 'One flew over the cuckoo’s nest', he will address the role of aggregation on a decentralised web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk to any librarian, archivist, or museum curator and you will find they have one thing in\_common: an unconditional love for the metadata they produce. Like parents raising a child\_and birds hatching an egg, eventually the time comes when our younglings think they're\_ready to spread their wings and fly into the unknown. Is it our destiny to prepare them for this\_flight and then disappear, or should we remain a safe haven to which they always can\_return? The story of decentralisation versus aggregation ultimately revolves around the\_tension between control and trust, between holding on and letting go. In his keynote, Ruben will\_explain that, instead of making that choice, we rather need to strive for achieving the best of\_both worlds. Decentralisation and aggregation go hand in hand—there's a place for both in a\_loving nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruben says:\_‘EuropeanaTech brings together critical and creative thinkers from all sides of the cultural heritage domain, I am looking forward to reuniting with them all in May.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruben is presenting our Discovery strand keynote on Wednesday 16 May.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Medieval manuscript databases'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Second Europeana Research Grants programme gave the opportunity to some great researchers to develop their projects with Europeana funding. The Europeana grant winners are currently busy working on their projects but have managed to find the time to answer some questions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In this interview series, we highlight their work, their lives, and what digital cultural heritage means to them. The first grant winner in this series is Dr. Krista Murchison, lecturer and researcher at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Her project for Europeana is called ‘A Digital Database of Manuscripts and Intercultural Dialogue in Post-Conquest England’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Research/Krista%20A%20Murchison-cropped.jpg\" style=\"max-width:200px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your current academic position and what’s your research focus? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My research and teaching explore how medieval English literature was influenced by the continental tradition, among other things. In my research, I look at both English and French literary traditions from medieval England, primarily from a book history perspective. Medieval manuscript culture—in which writing was constantly being shared, commented on, imported, and reused in new formats—has a lot in common with digital culture, and I look at how the similarities between them can help us understand medieval texts and ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I teach both English and French medieval literature as a lecturer at Leiden University, and I’m currently teaching a bilingual MA course that explores how medieval stories like the Arthurian legends were reimagined and reinterpreted as they were brought across the channel. I also incorporate some digital projects into my teaching; just as an example, my seminar class last year created this digital edition of some little-known medieval lyrics (<a href=\"https://kristamurchison.com/teaching-projects/\">https://kristamurchison.com/teaching-projects/</a>), and I’m currently collaborating with a small team to produce a fun online adaptive platform for teaching Old English (launching in a couple of months!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you discover the Europeana Grants Programme and why did you decide to apply for it? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been increased interest in the status of French in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, but this fascinating linguistic situation is still not well understood. To help us understand this situation better, I dreamed of creating a digital database containing linguistic data for all of the ~958 manuscripts from medieval England that contain French literature. When my institute sent me an email about the Europeana Grants Programme, it seemed like my project might be a good fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation of medieval manuscripts has been so important to medievalists in general. There are still many reasons to work with a manuscript in person, but among other benefits, the digitisation of medieval manuscripts allows us to visually compare manuscripts from different collections, to see new details on manuscripts and to access manuscripts remotely. The kind of project I’m working on now, which involves checking linguistic data of a large number of manuscripts, wouldn’t be feasible without digitised manuscript collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation is also so important from a preservation perspective. Yesterday, I was gathering catalogue data for a manuscript of epic poetry that survived 600 years, only to be destroyed during the Second World War. If the manuscript had been digitised, and the images stored on multiple servers, this would have mitigated somewhat the loss. Cultural heritage hubs like Europeana are so valuable for ensuring that a large group of people can view and study heritage objects—not just today, but for centuries in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How will Europeana help you achieve your research goal? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana grant funds have been crucial for the creation of, and research for, the digital project, so I’m very grateful for Europeana’s support. Europeana’s own digital collections are providing data for establishing the linguistic profile of some of the manuscripts that will be analysed, particularly those housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once complete, the database will give new insight into the areas, periods and contexts in which French circulated in medieval England, and help us better understand a particularly rich linguistic situation. I’ve been using my Twitter account (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/@drkmurch\">@drkmurch</a>) for updates about the project, so I encourage anyone interested in it to check for further updates there!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Find more information in Krista Murchison’s report below and hear from the other grant winners</em> <em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/visual-representations-of-roma-in-19th-and-20th-centuries-caterina-preda-europeana-research-grants-winner\">Caterina Preda</a>\_and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-the-venice-scholar-matteo-romanello-europeana-research-grant-winner\">Matteo Romanello</a>.

        title: 'Our Migration Collection Days launch'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Earlier this month, we launched the Europeana Migration campaign with three collection days at the House of European History in Brussels. Here’s a glimpse at this special event, which will be followed by similar events throughout 2018 all over Europe.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>In numbers...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over three days, we collected 51 stories, told by 39 adults and 12 children from the age of six to 80. Their stories included 50 adults and nine children, 35 women and 28 men, from great-great-great-grandfathers to grandchildren. They brought exactly 100 objects, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A&amp;view=grid\">prayer beads to family trees and even a chair</a>! It wasn’t just the objects we recorded that were diverse, but also the participants’ backgrounds: The participants’ migration stories \_covered 43 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, both Americas and Australia - the only continent not covered was Antarctica. We were given stories in five languages and listened to migration motives ranging from political persecution, war and revolution to love, work opportunities and cultural curiosity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From seashells to songs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In our interviews, we were able to capture the diversity of migration as a human phenomenon. We had stories about historical migration motives, such as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2084002/contributions_907bab80_0b2d_0136_6466_167dbbf18ed0.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A\">Mircea Carp</a>\_who migrated from the new communist regime in Romania to Washington DC after WWII. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2084002/contributions_ce08dd80_0a61_0136_769d_4e0772fa233b.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A\">Marieke’s story</a> is quite the opposite, she was born in the US and migrated to Brussels together with her husband in 2016 - now she’s working with refugees on songs about their experiences. We listened to stories like <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2084002/contributions_6f446cb0_0b2f_0136_5317_4a53da2989f4.html?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A\">Barghav’s</a>, a school kid, who brought a seashell necklace from his hometown Hyderabad, India and is currently living in Brussels with his family - although he has already planned his future as a scientist in the US when he is grown up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Larissa Borck was one of our interviewers during the three days and she felt enriched after this experience: “‘It was a great pleasure to be able to talk to such a diverse range of people from all around the world. The objects that they brought to be digitised ranged from high commodity valuables to treasures of emotional value. Listening to the stories was precious to me: You get to know people and their histories on a very personal level. Some started to cry, just because it was the first time they had the chance to talk about their migration stories. We should have more moments like these in our daily lives!”’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Positive and participatory</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After the event we spoke to Constanze Itzel and Blandine Smilansky from the House of European History to hear their reflections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constanze Itzel, Museum Director said, ’We were very pleased to host these Migration Collection Days. Our museum, which assembles objects, documents and testimonies from across Europe has a very similar mission to Europeana. The topic of migration is present in our permanent exhibition, which shows the development of Europe as a continent from which people left, looking for a better life, in the 19th century, while it became a destination many have been trying to reach by all means in the second half of the 20th century. Our exhibitions show how migration has always been part of Europe's history and has shaped its heritage.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blandine Smilansky, Events coordinator, said, ‘We were delighted not only with the varied audience that participated, but that visitors to the Museum who were not aware of the event showed a lot of interest, and overall it enriched the experience of the visit for many people, showing how participatory their experience at the museum can be. An example of this was one young French woman who while sharing her family story realised there were things she still didn’t know and explained how this conversation made her want to talk more with her father about her grandparents’ immigration to France in the 1950s’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event generated press interest from Brussels and Spain, and you can read and listen to the coverage in French, Dutch, Spanish and English in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/document-archive/europeana-in-the-news\">press round-up</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Would you like to get involved in Europeana’s Migration campaign? If your organisation is interested in sharing your migration content as part of the collection, or running a collection day then please contact <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/adrian-murphy\">Adrian Murphy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or do you have a migration object and story to tell? Throughout 2018, our partners will host a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration/collection-days.html\">series of Collection Days</a> all over Europe, or you can contribute to our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Migration Collection</a> by sharing your story via our <a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/migration\">online form</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Visual representations of Romani in 19th and 20th centuries'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Second Europeana Research Grants programme gave the opportunity to some great researchers to develop their projects with Europeana funding. The Europeana grant winners are currently busy working on their projects but have managed to find the time to answer some questions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In this interview series, we highlight their work, their lives and what digital cultural heritage means to them. The second grant winner in this series is Dr. Caterina Preda, lecturer and researcher at Bucharest University in Romania. Her project for Europeana is called ‘A visual tool for the display of the visual representations of the Roma population in\_Romania in the 19th and 20th centuries in the Europeana collections: between stereotypes and truthfulness’.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Research/caterinapreda.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\">\r\n<p><b>What is your current academic position and what’s your research focus? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently a tenured Senior University Lecturer at the Department of Political Science of Bucharest University, with a PhD in Political Science. I teach courses on art and politics and cultural memory, as well as courses on Latin American politics. I have been researching the relationship between art and politics in dictatorships in Eastern Europe and South America with a focus on Romania and Chile. My recent research also deals with cultural memory practices in post-dictatorships or other post-traumatic contexts such as the Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust). I have also participated in a project that dealt with the history of the Roma population in Romania. It is there that I discovered my interest in dealing with the stereotypes of representation of the second most important Romanian minority. I want to confront the artistic representation of Romani with archival sources, and highlight historical facts that are not integrated in the general history of Romania, or are only marginally taken into account.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you discover the Europeana Grants Programme and why did you decide to apply for it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I discovered the call for proposals online and started going through the Europeana database, which led me to reflect on the sources that depict the Romani people. I thought it could be interesting to build an online tool to use in classrooms, both at high school and university levels, to try to help bring about a more balanced understanding of the stereotypes that this minority faces even today. The deconstruction of the historical representation of Roma population in Romania in images lies at the basis of our project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my projects I have tried to integrate as many archival sources as possible that provide a better understanding of certain research topics. In this sense, digital cultural heritage is I think essential to a series of research topics. Digitising the archives of state institutions and private collections that relate to the Roma population could help enrich our understanding of some specific historical periods. We have for example worked with the archives of the Union of Visual Artists (UAP) in Romania and had to search through thousands of documents. Digitising those records could make a huge difference. Making these resources more accessible and providing a theoretical and historical context for their reading today should be an ongoing societal project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How will Europeana help you achieve your research goal? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana helps us achieve our research goal through the use of the online collections of images it provides, which can be reused on our platform and shown in classrooms or used as a research source by students who are interested in the representation of the Roma population\_in Romania. Our project will provide a web platform that can be used as an online visual tool for the representation of the Roma in Romania. It will include images from the Europeana collection, as well as accompanying historical and theoretical background information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Find more information in Caterina Preda’s report below, <a href=\"http://roma-ovt.ro/en/\">explore the project website</a>,\_and hear from the other grant winners</em>\_<em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/medieval-manuscript-databases-krista-murchison-europeana-research-grants-winner\">Krista Murchison</a>\_and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-the-venice-scholar-matteo-romanello-europeana-research-grant-winner\">Matteo Romanello</a>.</em></p>\r\n"

        title: '#AllezDemocracy – a different kind of exhibition'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Marta Musso, from the Archives Portal Europe Foundation, tells us about a social media campaign celebrating heritage relating to the history of European democracy.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net\">Archives Portal Europe</a> (APE) is an online portal and search engine bringing together documents relating to European heritage from more than 700 institutions in 30 countries. These fascinating archives are also available in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana Collections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thinking about democracy for the European Year of Cultural Heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a> 2018, we at APE asked representatives from all countries in our network to choose example documents from their archives that relate to the broader theme of democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democracy is one of the greatest, all-encompassing themes in history. Across the ages, the aspiration to democracy has been one of the main engines of history in Europe. The ideas around what democracy is, what it does, what it should do, and the implementation of these ideas in governments on a national, local, and international level, are persistent features in the history of Europe. It was even one of the starting points for building the European Union. So it is a very fitting theme to use to celebrate European cultural heritage in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Piece of a newspaper regarding the announcement for a Feminist Union Meeting\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Pic%2001.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/RO-NAR-C/type/fa/id/RO-BU-F-01754/unitid/RO-BU-F-01754+-+nr.+LIX_SLASH_37\"><em>Piece</em><em> of a newspaper regarding the announcement of</em><em>\_a Feminist Union Meeting in order to claim women’s suffrage in local elections</em></a><em>, 1922, National Archives of Romania. Public domain.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#AllezDemocracy success on social media</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The contributors - archivists from all over Europe - chose documents that \_represented the ideas and practices of democracy in their countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since September, the records have been published twice a week on APE’s social networks (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/archivesportaleurope.net/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArchivesPortal\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/archivesportaleurope/\">Instagram</a>) with the hashtag #AllezDemocracy. Each post engages around 2,000 viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are now halfway through the campaign and have had an unexpected level of success both in terms of viewers and contributors. We received more than 100 documents from 25 countries. The documents span nine centuries, from the 12th century all the way to the 1990s, and come from throughout Europe, from Georgia to Portugal, from Iceland to Malta.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>From constitutions to forgotten feminists</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The documents are incredibly diverse: from the <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/it/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/NL-AmISG/type/fa/id/http_COLON__SLASH__SLASH_hdl.handle.net_SLASH_10622_SLASH_ARCH01225/unitid/http_COLON__SLASH__SLASH_hdl.handle.net_SLASH_10622_SLASH_ARCH01225+-+449/search/0/democracy\">personal papers</a> of forgotten characters such as Dora Winifred Russell, a British feminist and socialist campaigner active in Europe in the interwar period, to the <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net/featured-document/-/fed/pk/98655#sthash.RBTbNrvt.dpbs\">Law of Epidaurus</a>, the first constitution of Modern Greece after the independence of the country. And from the 1118 <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/ES-28079-AHN9/type/fa/id/ES-AHN-28079-UD-184171/unitid/ES-AHN-28079-UD-184171+-+ES-AHN-28079-UD-2610184\">Tumbo viejo de la Catedral de Lugo</a>, the monastic cartulary (manuscript) of the Lugo Cathedral in Galicia - the first administrative documents of the post-Roman era, to the Maltese <a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/MT-NAM/type/fa/id/LIB/unitid/LIB+-+GMR_0104\">Appello agli Elettori</a>, the Appeal to the Electorate, written in August 1849, when the first general elections in Malta took place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Appeal to the Electorate\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Pic%2003.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.archivesportaleurope.net/ead-display/-/ead/pl/aicode/MT-NAM/type/fa/id/LIB/unitid/LIB+-+GMR_0104\">Appeal to the Electorate</a>, 1849, National Archives of Malta.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of #AllezDemocracy is that it allows people to find gems from archives all over Europe, presenting often unseen viewpoints. Rather than just focussing on the celebratory examples of democracy given by the Resistance, or the battles for universal suffrage and women’s rights, the documents provide examples of the problems of implementing fair electoral systems, inclusive institutions and efficient bureaucracies: all elements of functioning democracies that are a contemporary challenge for institutions throughout Europe. Special attention has also been given to smaller countries within Europe, often forgotten in the grand narrative of the post-war European values that we know: countries like Estonia, Slovakia and Malta are amongst the largest contributors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A different kind of exhibition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>#AllezDemocracy is organised as a diffused exhibition throughout the web, marking a new way of using digital spaces for the organisation of virtual shows. Rather than aggregating all documents on a single website, #AllezDemocracy runs as updates on social media, following a chronological order that tells the story of the democratisation of Europe throughout nine centuries and 25 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition can be followed by episodes, every Tuesday and Thursday, or by accessing the chronological list of documents, updated weekly, on <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu/index.php/news/61-allezdemocray-the-democratisation-of-europe-2\">a dedicated page of APE’s website</a>. The best way to experience the exhibition, however, is by chasing the documents through the hashtag #AllezDemocracy, a treasure hunt following the footsteps of those who, throughout centuries, have believed in democracy as a universal value for the peaceful and the egalitarian coexistence of humankind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleurope.net\">www.archivesportaleurope.net</a> or <a href=\"http://www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu\">www.archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact <a href=\"mailto:marta.musso@archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu\">marta.musso@archivesportaleuropefoundation.eu</a></p>\r\n"

        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Governing Board of the Europeana Foundation has appointed Harry Verwayen to be the new Executive Director of the organisation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board made the decision following a rigorous selection process and Harry will formally step up from his current role as Acting Executive Director on 1 May 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth Niggemann, Chair of the Europeana Governing Board and Director of the German National Library, said: ‘The Board is very happy to have made a unanimous decision. Harry is someone who can bring us continuity with a fresh perspective. We wish him every success in his new role and look forward to his contribution to the Europeana initiative.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen said: ‘I am honoured to continue my work at the Europeana Foundation, now as its Executive Director. The past ten years of Europeana have shown how a collaborative effort between organisations and individuals spanning the European Commission, member states, the cultural heritage sector and civil society can be transformational. I hope to build on this effort with continued vigour and focus so that together we can deliver an even greater impact for our society.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen brings more than two decades of relevant experience to the role. He worked in academic publishing for more than a decade before joining the Amsterdam based think-tank, Kennisland, where he was responsible for business model innovation in the cultural heritage sector. He joined the Europeana Foundation in 2010, taking on responsibility for business planning, strategy development and Europeana Collections in various roles. Notably, he has worked with the Europeana Network Association on the development and implementation of industry standards, such as the Europeana Publishing Framework, and more recently on the Europeana Impact Playbook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry takes over from founding Executive Director, Jill Cousins, who stepped down in March after more than a decade in the role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu\">Eleanor.Kenny@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation operates Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’.

        title: '40+ events in Serbia for European Year of Cultural Heritage'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Over 40 events throughout Serbia are bringing cultural heritage sites and intangible heritage closer to the people as part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage (EYCH). Marina Rakić from the EU Info Centre in Belgrade and Tamara Butigan Vučaj from the National Library of Serbia tell us more.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>At a launch event on 16 March, the head of the EU Delegation to the Republic of Serbia, Ambassador Sem Fabrizi, stressed the importance of the EYCH, pointing out that by cherishing cultural heritage, Europeans celebrate ‘the sense of belonging to the common space, values and principles that provide the foundation of Europe.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Not only do we celebrate our rich past, but we have an excellent opportunity to give new impetus to creative industries and the information society and thus foster economic development. Above all, however, this is an opportunity to remind ourselves about what makes up our European identity,’ Fabrizi said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>A national aggregator for Serbia </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Library of Serbia joined the launch of the EYCH campaign by promoting<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/serbia-launches-new-heritage-aggregator-for-europeana\"> a new national aggregator for Europeana,</a> set up at the end of February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The national aggregator is made possible by Slovenian IT company Semantika and supported by the Ministry of Culture and Information, as part of national digital infrastructure, DARIAH Serbia. It is an important milestone for Serbia and has been recognised as such by the EU Delegation to the Republic of Serbia, which provided a small but valuable grant for the aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assistant Minister of Culture, Dejan Masliković, said the process of digitisation of cultural heritage and contemporary art in Serbia had been ‘being conducted in a random manner.’ But, ‘many institutions have moved this process forward’ and as a result, Serbian libraries are now keeping pace with their EU counterparts when it comes to digitisation, he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serbia is finally in a position to take a more active role in Europeana’s vision of transforming the world with culture by enriching Europeana Collections with more Serbian content. This national aggregator is the first from a non-EU part of Europe, setting an example that others could follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Exhibitions and events </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new photo exhibition -<a href=\"http://euinfo.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/euic-online-izlozba-panoi.pdf\"> A journey through cultural heritage</a> - showcases European and Serbian cultural heritage, using mostly items featured in Europeana Collections. Conceived as a ‘travelling exhibition,’ it will tour various cultural institutions in Belgrade before continuing its journey to other parts of Serbia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous other activities promoting cultural heritage are being implemented throughout Serbia, aimed at people of all ages, from creative workshops for kids on the topic of European art and history and guided tours of places of collective memory, to academic lectures on cultural relations between Serbia and Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in September 2018, the National Library of Serbia will organise Collection Days for Europeana Migration - asking the people of Serbia to share objects and documents that tell their family’s stories of migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Blog/serbiapress.jpg\" style=\"max-width:700px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A meeting of the EU Info Centre and Europeana in Serbia, March of 2018. Copyright EU Info Centre, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Serbian partners </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This series of events is organised by the EU Delegation to Serbia and the EU Info Network - made up of the EU Info Centre in Belgrade and EU Info Points in Novi Sad (north Serbia) and Nis (south Serbia) - in cooperation with national partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/serbian-2018-calendar-created-in-cooperation-with-europeana-for-the-european-year-of-cultural-heritage\">lovely 2018 calendar</a> that the EU Info Centre and the EU Delegation to Serbia made in collaboration with Europeana for the European Year for Cultural Heritage!</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Governing Board of the Europeana Foundation has appointed Harry Verwayen to be the new Executive Director of the organisation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Board made the decision following a rigorous selection process and Harry will formally step up from his current role as Acting Executive Director on 1 May 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth Niggemann, Chair of the Europeana Governing Board and Director of the German National Library, said: ‘The Board is very happy to have made a unanimous decision. Harry is someone who can bring us continuity with a fresh perspective. We wish him every success in his new role and look forward to his contribution to the Europeana initiative.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen said: ‘I am honoured to continue my work at the Europeana Foundation, now as its Executive Director. The past ten years of Europeana have shown how a collaborative effort between organisations and individuals spanning the European Commission, member states, the cultural heritage sector and civil society can be transformational. I hope to build on this effort with continued vigour and focus so that together we can deliver an even greater impact for our society.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen brings more than two decades of relevant experience to the role. He worked in academic publishing for more than a decade before joining the Amsterdam based think-tank, Kennisland, where he was responsible for business model innovation in the cultural heritage sector. He joined the Europeana Foundation in 2010, taking on responsibility for business planning, strategy development and Europeana Collections in various roles. Notably, he has worked with the Europeana Network Association on the development and implementation of industry standards, such as the Europeana Publishing Framework, and more recently on the Europeana Impact Playbook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry takes over from founding Executive Director, Jill Cousins, who stepped down in March after more than a decade in the role.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In the third and final part of our introduction to the EuropeanaTech 2018 keynote speakers we focus on\_two more of our keynote speakers, joining the 300+ innovators from around the world who will be at the SS Rotterdam between May 15-16.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EuropeanaTech 2018 will bring together world-leading specialists, practitioners and researchers to share innovative progress and forecast the technical future of digital cultural heritage. EuropeanaTech is a fantastic opportunity to join a long-standing community of collaborators of over 1,000 professionals working in the field of Tech. As part of this collaborative community you will meet, work with and learn from your peers all around the world. You’ll hear from those at the forefront of their fields and take away the latest in understanding, technique and application. Our final two keynote speakers are both leading innovation in their fields and we’re delighted to introduce them to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>George Oates, Interaction Designer, Good Form and Spectacle, United Kingdom</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the director of Good Form and Spectacle, CEO and founder of Museum in a Box, and inventor of The Commons on Flickr, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/george-oates\">George</a> has an extensive CV of leading innovation in the cultural heritage sector. An experienced speaker about design, community and control, she will present ‘Every collection is a snowflake’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The promise of pristine linked data is powerful and compelling, but in practice, we’re working\_with data created by humans, which is full of inconsistencies and gotchas. Instead of trying\_to force computers to understand these foibles, George has been working directly with data\_creators and using data visualisation to see the grain of individual catalogues including Open\_Library and the fabulous Wellcome Library collection. This work has gently challenged myths\_of data completeness and accuracy, and even helped data creators see their own collection\_data in a new light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ben Vershbow, Lead Programs Manager (libraries, education, cultural heritage),</strong>\_<strong>Wikimedia Foundation, United States</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/EuropeanaTech_2018/Speaker_PDF/Ben-Vershbow.pdf\">Ben</a> is global lead for libraries, education, and cultural heritage at the Wikimedia Foundation, the U.S.-based nonprofit which supports Wikipedia and more than a dozen other open knowledge projects. Previously, Ben worked for eight years at the New York Public Library where he founded and led the celebrated innovation program, NYPL Labs. Prior to that, he was Editorial Director at the Institute for the Future of the Book, a think tank and interactive studio exploring networked forms of reading, writing, and scholarship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben will be using his experience at the intersection of libraries, publishing, arts and the web to deliver his conference call: ‘Let's finally connect\_all the world's cultural heritage’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside our keynote speakers we have a very exciting line-up of speakers and panel members who are leading the way in Tech, plus two free events on the day before the conference starts. You can <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeanatech-conference-2018-ticket-tickets-43923398066\">purchase your EuropeanaTech 2018 tickets</a> for the bargain price of €185.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Strategy and open data at Wellcome Collection'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Tom Scott, Head of Digital Engagement at London’s <a href=\"http://wellcomecollection.org/\">Wellcome Collection</a>, shares his thoughts on\_digital strategy\_and the contribution of open data to a knowledgeable and\_creative society.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>London’s <a href=\"http://wellcomecollection.org/\">Wellcome Collection</a> is a free museum and library exploring health and human experience. Inspired by the collections assembled by Henry Wellcome, it encourages great ideas about health by connecting science, medicine, life and art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, Wellcome Collection set out on its new <a href=\"https://stacks.wellcomecollection.org/a-digital-strategy-for-wellcome-collection-1b43e5365331\">digital strategy</a> and began work on improving access to its collections. Starting with its image collection, they migrated the content from the old Wellcome Images site to a new platform, to form part of the <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works\">Wellcome Collection website</a>. Tom Scott, Head of Digital Engagement, shares his thoughts with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Last October, you published a <a href=\"https://stacks.wellcomecollection.org/a-digital-strategy-for-wellcome-collection-1b43e5365331\">digital strategy</a> paper for Wellcome Collection. Six months on, how are things progressing?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re making good progress. Last quarter, on wellcomecollection.org we tackled <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/whats-on\">What’s On</a>, <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions\">exhibitions</a> and <a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/events\">events</a>. User research helped us identify how to help our visitors, it helped us identify what they wanted practically and emotionally. Usability testing then helped us understand whether our design ideas met or exceeded those expectations and needs. The result, a combination of improved interface design and a new approach to content and imagery, has significantly improved the user experience -- in the last quarter we saw a 15% increase in users and 135% increase in ‘reading time’ (active time on content pages).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind\_the scenes, we’ve also done a huge amount of work to bring our catalogue across into the new platform. In addition to the c. 110k images we migrated across from the old Wellcome Images website, we’re now exposing 1.16 million catalogue records via the <a href=\"http://developers.wellcomecollection.org\">API</a> and as <a href=\"https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/datasets\">downloadable datasets</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because we will also be merging in the archive catalogue (ISADg records), intra item metadata (METS and ALTO data) and enriching the data through machine learning (e.g. to identify dates and other entities), the new platform restructures the data into a single, coherent domain model. On the front-end, this is important because it means, for example, that you won’t need to understand how an item has been catalogued before you search for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s still work to do on the API and the underlying data before we start building a website with it but, if you are interested, we’ve published a preview of this data, details are all available at\_<a href=\"http://developers.wellcomecollection.org\">http://developers.wellcomecollection.org</a>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-2822bea9-f1c5-134c-d1ff-8359efa83533\"><img height=\"608\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f0yT2L3a_Adloq7woiy0pQ68xBMSjns0grIZBH-mY6vUnSgBz4O_nDM6Bu7fgStm9Ubef0A90bAIX3Ulf9xGR_lpL3qgwjrcEcPn45p7nE9TYm6xVPQlb6-0s6C2jR7SexZwSX54\" width=\"602\"></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'<a href=\"https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vjn6yzmd\">Rita Levi Montalcini, digital illustration</a>' by Daria Kirpach. Credit: Daria Kirpach and Salzman International. CC BY-NC</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Open access to Wellcome technologies like <a href=\"https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/\">Cardigan</a>, <a href=\"http://developers.wellcomecollection.org/\">APIs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org\">source code</a> seems to be central to your strategy. Why is this important and what engagement have you achieved externally?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Being open is in our DNA. Wellcome exists to improve health for everyone by helping great ideas to thrive. For ideas to thrive, we believe, they need to exist in the open so that others can integrate them, use them, learn from them and improve upon them. We hope that is true for the data, code and content we are publishing as part of our work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it works both ways. Under the hood <a href=\"https://stacks.wellcomecollection.org/using-loris-for-iiif-at-wellcome-6ed1fefaf801\">we use Loris</a> as our IIIF image server. Loris was an existing Open Source IIIF Image Server and in adopting it we have benefitted from all the <a href=\"https://github.com/loris-imageserver/loris/graphs/contributors\">work</a> that had gone before, but we’ve also improved Loris and that benefits all the other Loris users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working in the open also helps us to do a better job of building a scalable, maintainable service. For example, we use the public catalogue and IIIF APIs to build wellcomecollection.org. We don’t have a secret backdoor or private API, we use the same public APIs available to everyone else, and that is a good thing because it helps us enforce a separation of concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The platform team (the team responsible for the API) care deeply about how the data is gathered, modelled and stored. The experience team (who are responsible for the website UX) have no vested interest in how gathering, modelling and storage happens, as long as it happens. On the other hand, the experience team have their own concerns about what they are receiving, how to render it and how users interact with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, we could enforce this separation without making everything open and public but in doing so we have no choice and that helps us stay honest when deadlines loom! \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Wellcome Collection makes over 100,000 images available to download under a CC BY rights statement. Why was CC BY chosen and what was the decision-making process?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a few more than that! We are digitising our 19th century book collection, archives, manuscripts, recipe books and much more. To date, we’ve digitised and made available (at wellcomelibrary.org) around 36 million images (a number that is rising at around 250k images a month), representing around 250,000 items. This is in addition to the 100,000 ‘visual images’ originally brought over from Wellcome Images. Over the coming months, we will migrate the wellcomelibrary.org images across to the new platform too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of those images are licensed under CC-BY - some aren’t - mostly where we don’t own the copyright. We selected CC-BY because we wanted to make it as easy as possible for researchers and others to use and reuse the material and because we wanted to reach as many people as possible, not just on our own website but also elsewhere - on Europeana Collections, Wiki Commons, the Internet Archive and elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How has the new site been received?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We run weekly user research and usability testing, online polls and A/B tests and, based on the insight we’ve gained through that work and web analytics, we’ve got a pretty good idea where we’ve got it right and where we need to work harder. On balance we are definitely ‘winning’. Usage and engagement are both up and increasing and\_qualitative feedback is positive. The teams responsible - product design and development, photography, editorial content and production - have done an amazing job and I am in awe of what they’ve achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Why is it important for the Wellcome to publish its data on Europeana Collections?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s mission to help build on Europe’s cultural heritage and to contribute to an open, knowledgeable and creative society is something we want to support, it is something we believe is important too. I hope that by working together we can help contribute to a more open, creative society where ideas can thrive.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'EuropeanaTech 2015 projects - where are they now? Qatar Digital Library'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>With EuropeanaTech 2018 just around the corner, we hear how a couple of projects presented at the 2015 conference have developed. Today, Tristan Roddis of Cogapp tells us about the\_Qatar Digital Library online archive.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>The project</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For EuropeanaTech 2015, I presented a <a href=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Europeana_Cogapp.pdf\">poster</a> about the <a href=\"https://www.qdl.qa\">Qatar Digital Library</a> online archive.\_The Qatar Digital Library (QDL) makes\_a vast archive featuring the cultural and historical heritage of the Gulf and wider region freely available online for the first time. It includes archives, maps, manuscripts, sound recordings, photographs and much more, complete with contextualise\_explanatory notes and links, in both English and Arabic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source content and structured metadata was produced by the British Library according to common archival standards. The final website, created to present this information in an engaging and highly usable way, was produced by <a href=\"https://www.cogapp.com/\">Cogapp</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The story back in\_2015</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The site had launched in October 2014 and was still in its infancy, but we wanted to talk about the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The underlying data: documents digitised and catalogued by the Qatar Foundation Partnership Programme team at the British Library</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is delivered online: <a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/solr/\">Solr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>, <a href=\"http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/\">IIPImage</a></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is transformed: METS and ALTO to Solr documents</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is stored: Solr schema fields for search, categorisation and structure</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The system architecture: redundant architecture with load balancing and GlusterFS as a clustered file store</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The plan for data growth: the site launched with 93,000 pages, and in February 2015 had over 300,000.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Figure 1: a graph of predicted data growth, created for EuropeanaTech 2015\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Tristan1.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 1: a graph of predicted data growth, created for EuropeanaTech 2015. Tristan Roddis. CC0.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What's happened since?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, the site has continued to be maintained by Cogapp, thanks to budget allocated by the Qatar National Library, and so has evolved a lot in terms of user-facing features. But how did our initial system stack up, and did it stand the test of time? Let’s look at each point in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The underlying data: the British Library has continued to contribute the vast majority of the online archive, but we have also been able to add several thousand pages from the Qatar National Library’s own <a href=\"https://www.qdl.qa/en/search/site/?f%5B0%5D=document_source%3Aarchive_source&amp;f%5B1%5D=holding_institution%3AQatar%20National%20Library\">Heritage Collection</a>, thanks to cataloguing and translation efforts by the <a href=\"https://www.wdl.org/en/\">World Digital Library</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is delivered online: Solr, Drupal and \_IIPImage continue to provide the underpinnings of the site, but we have upgraded Solr periodically from its initial version 4 to its current version 6. We have also upgraded IIPImage so that it now supports the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) <a href=\"http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/\">Image API</a>, and added a lot of content-management features to Drupal, most notably the ability to import linked authority file data, and to update the categorization of archival documents.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is transformed: we continue to transform METS and ALTO to Solr documents, but have carried out a number of optimisations to reduce the amount of storage required and to increase site responsiveness.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The way the data is stored: we continue to store all archival data as Solr documents, but have changed the way things are stored to allow better cross-language searching between Arabic and English, as well as to provide a grouped view of search results.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The system architecture: all components are still load-balanced and redundant in two different data centres, but we have swapped out the GlusterFS system (that relies on comparatively high-cost \_Elastic Block Storage) for a cheaper and simpler image store backed by S3.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The plan for data growth: the British Library continues to add content, and at the time of writing there are 1,367,012 pages visible on the site: exactly on-track for the \_1.6 million documents by the end of the year.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>As well as evolving the underlying systems as mentioned above, we have also kept busy in the intervening three years by adding new user-facing features to the system: full support for both the IIIF Image and Presentation APIs, a timeline search with histogram of results per year, the <a href=\"http://alt.qcri.org/farasa/segmenter.html\">Farasa</a> Arabic word segmenter, and search-phrase highlighting of transcriptions, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Figure 2: timeline date search\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Tristan2.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Figure 2: timeline date search,\_Tristan Roddis. CC0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, the choices we made back in 2015 have stood the test of time, although being able to evolve the underlying systems has meant we can not only keep up-to-date with improvements made to third-party systems, but also make our own code and data more robust and able to meet changing user needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>This year at EuropeanaTech 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, does this relate in any way to the topic of my own talk at <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\">this year’s EuropeanaTech</a>? The answer is: partially. My subject is 'When automated analysis goes wrong' and as part of this, I’ll be looking at the challenge of extracting documents with illustrations from within the tens of thousands of pages of <a href=\"https://www.qdl.qa/en/search/site/?f%5B0%5D=document_source%3Aarchive_source&amp;f%5B1%5D=source_content_type%3AManuscript\">handwritten medieval Arabic manuscripts</a>: where we went wrong, and how we finally managed to reliably disambiguate these without any human intervention.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'EuropeanaTech 2015 projects - where are they now? Ajapaik'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>With EuropeanaTech 2018 just around the corner, we hear how a couple of projects presented at the 2015 conference have developed. Today, Vahur Puik, from the Estonian Photographic Heritage Society, talks about Ajapaik, a\_crowdsourcing platform for geotagging historic images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>The project</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ajapaik.ee\">Ajapaik </a>('time period' in Estonian), shows how places have changed over time. On the Ajapaik site, you can\_look for historic\_images of places from the collections of Estonian museums,\_mark the pictures of places you know on a\_map and add your own\_pictures ('rephotographs')\_of the same locations\_to lay over them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The story back in\_2015</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At that time, our crowdsourcing platform for geotagging historic images was already four\_years old but still in kind of a prototype phase as we only had around 4,000 historic photographs on the site, 3,000 of which had been geotagged with the help of users. We also had 700+ 'rephotographs' made largely by a single fanatic rephotographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were convinced that crowdsourced geotagging was possible and that by\_enriching\_digitised pictorial heritage with geographic metadata, we could use\_a map-based interface to access content instead of using the dominant textual searches. But 3,000 images is a tiny fraction when big individual collections have hundreds of thousands or even millions of images.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What's happened since?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Three\_years later, we have more than 126,000 images (mostly Estonian content from public collections) on the platform and 72,000 pictures have been geotagged. The progress has been considerable and we’ve learned a lot along the way. Unfortunately, we’ve only been able to implement a very little of our\_long list of ideas of features and improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Number of historic photos and geotagged photos on Ajapaik app\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Ajapaik%20content%20graph%202015%E2%80%932018.png\" style=\"width: 1000px\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Number of historic and geotagged photos on\_Ajapaik. CC BY-NC-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gamification versus social interaction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the central realisations has been the fact that the platform has been designed with mostly pictures in mind – we have been building the app ‘for’ the pictures but the success of a crowdsourcing project depends entirely on the user community. Therefore, we need to focus much more on the users. Since the beginning we’ve used very basic gamification –\_users get points for their contributions and different tasks give different amounts of points. For instance, a first rephoto added to a historic picture gets 1,250 points, while curating a new historic image only gives 50 and geotagging an image gives between 160 to 300 points. There are different leaderboards for every album which are usually place-specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know from user feedback that gaining points is not motivating enough. More valuable\_is the social interaction that comes from things like\_Facebook groups for sharing and discussing historic content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we offer\_users the option to comment on the images (and we’ve made incremental improvements to the system), it hasn’t taken off. Only a\_few top contributors use it for sharing\_additional information about what’s depicted in the image, but there’s no casual debate or emotional posts about the images that are thriving on social media. So we think the focus needs to be more on social interaction and community as opposed to gamification. We need notification systems when users have submitted conflicting suggestions for locations –\_whether the first user wants to defend his (the user base is predominantly male) opinion or admits his error. Users could ‘sign up’ for a specific place – when new images get added to their home street, they get notified etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These kind of features are easy and very natural to imagine (as these are present on the dominating social networks) but are much harder to implement given that just the task of geotagging has plenty of aspects that are not yet there. Aerial photographs,\_for instance, need a different geotagging interface than normal pictures from the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Screenshots of the Ajapaik app showing rephotography\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-04/Ajapaik%20rephoto.JPG\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>App screenshot (left) of a\_</em><em>rephoto</em><em> captured before uploading, screenshot (right) of closest images with </em><em>rephoto</em><em> indication (blue icon –\_</em><em>user</em><em> has rephotographed the old image, white icon –\_</em><em>rephoto</em><em> made by some other user). Ajapaik, CC BY-NC-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Camera location and rephotography</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning, we chose the camera location as the geodata that we focus on. There are several reasons for that. First – the camera location is definitive, there was only one place in which\_the photographer was standing and one direction the camera was facing. In some\_cases it may be hard or even impossible to determine, but there cannot be two or more different right answers. Camera location is also crucial for the next main task we want users to engage in – rephotography. Taking repeat photos of historic scenes has become more and more popular as\_the amount of digitised historical content available online is growing. Having pictures geotagged and using a smart device app would make the process even more accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>This year at EuropeanaTech 2018</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We published the new version of the Android rephotography app in March 2018 on Google Play Store. More about our plans related to crowdsourcing geodata and rephotos\_of\_historic images are in my talk at EuropeanaTech 2018. Hope to see you there!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Lithuanian cultural heritage in a digital world: a Europeana national workshop'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On Wednesday 25 April 2018, the National Library of Lithuania hosted a Europeana national workshop in its spectacular renovated building.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our setting was a beautiful room full of books about European arts and culture - highly appropriate for a workshop in which we showed the value of reaching a pan-European audience when publishing content with Europeana. The workshop was carefully planned with the National of Library of Lithuania, the national aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The workshop</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The day began with an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V8Y6QwvPtL_CbDGZZkFCJKTaNT6IlYMdq0zoey-AAsQ/edit?usp=sharing\">inspirational presentation</a> from Renata Petrušić from the National and University Library in Zagreb. Renata showed her Lithuanian peers how more open and collaborative approaches in their work had helped boost the value of their digital collections. She presented an exhibition called <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/picture-this-vintage-postcards-of-southeastern-europe\">Picture This!</a>, a collection of vintage postcards from southeastern Europe. The exhibition was the outcome of the Collections of South and East Europe in Europeana (CSEEE) project they co-led which increased the amount of non-EU library content in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Renata Petrušić from the National and University Library in Zagreb\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-05/LithuaniaNationalWorkshop1.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Renata Petrušić from the National and University Library in Zagreb presenting to participants at the Europeana national workshop at the National Library of Lithuania. Nicole McNeilly, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rimvydas Laužikas of Vilnius University gave a presentation about a local case study. The university is the largest Lithuanian contributor to Europeana Collections, publishing large amounts of archaeological material through CARARE. Lina Mačiulienė from the National Library of Lithuania then outlined the role of the National Library in past collaborations with Europeana and in its capacity as a national aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Rimvydas Laužikas of Vilnius University\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-05/LithuaniaNationalWorkshop2.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Rimvydas Laužikas of Vilnius University presenting at the Europeana national workshop at the National Library of Lithuania. Nicole McNeilly, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day then proceeded with a mix of presentations introducing our most important frameworks (like the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10g_fD4yD18IzVmC9-SD-UhHdTcqdpPKG6ny92yECq0g/edit?usp=sharing\">Publishing Framework</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HMJ74i9loYxWWcrPQODtU8CcMYBu5i8FCsHSmN4tUwY/edit#slide=id.g380fa2b48c_0_36\">Licensing Framework</a>) and topics (such as <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19OHN_djGQtmj_ksPtmB2PctXBFC0ZFbz3aMjo0PDVSo/edit#slide=id.g380fab8c51_0_0\">data quality</a>). We had a practical exercise on the topic of rights statements, and ended the day with a discussion on the technical and political challenges faced by Lithuanian institutions with regards to opening up collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘It was important to meet with the Europeana team to hear their experience and discuss our concerns. The workshop was important and useful for all Lithuanian memory institutions. The most interesting part of the workshop was copyright policy as it is the most essential issue we are facing today.’\_Jolita Steponaitienė, National Library of Lithuania</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Woman with the Artist\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-05/WomanWithTheArtistKasiulis.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063603/LIT_280_010.html\">Woman with the Artist.</a> Vytautas Kasiulis. 1948, Lithuanian Art Museum. Lithuania, CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What happens next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we better understand the challenges in the Lithuanian context, we can work more proactively with the national aggregator to support the institutions that acknowledged their desire to improve their existing content (opening the licenses and putting the material into higher tiers within the Europeana Publishing Framework) and to publish new collections on Europeana Collections. We were thrilled when participants told us about their willingness to add data to the new Europeana Migration thematic collection and the forthcoming Europeana Manuscripts thematic collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the sky was as grey as <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/europe/lithuania/articles/a-brief-history-of-cepelinai-lithuanias-national-dish/\">cepelinai</a> (a Lithuanian saying bringing together the national dish and the climate!), everyone left on a very positive note. For us, this also includes planning two more national workshops to be held in the coming weeks, one in Varna, Bulgaria, to coincide with the Presidency of the European Council, and the second in Budapest, Hungary.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us about your role at the Statens Museum for Kunst?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m so lucky to be working as a bridge builder between the largest art collection in Denmark and the public – not just in my own country, but everywhere in the world. Since 2008, our strategy has been ‘to be a catalyst of users’ creativity’. We try to deliver that ambition by making the digitised collection radically open, and encourage active reuse by designers and artists, school kids and young people, citizen scientists and many more. It has been key for us to implement <a href=\"https://www.smk.dk/en/article/free-download-of-images/\">clear and user-friendly open licensing</a> so that people know they can freely use the art. Our collection is part of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/cultural_commons_papers/european-cultural-commons-summary.pdf\">the Commons</a>, and we all have shared rights to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is the New European Bauhaus relevant to your work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To my knowledge, it’s the first time we’ve seen such a clear and compelling call on the cultural sector to contribute to a more sustainable future. All too often, art and culture are perceived as an add-on once the basic infrastructures of society have been put in place – like decorative icing on the cake. In the New European Bauhaus, art and culture are fundamental to building truly livable societies where we take better care of nature and each other, because – to quote Elizabeth Holstein, a young Danish entrepreneur who I’m very inspired by – ‘Creativity is fundamentally problem-solving… The more you let your creativity guide you, the greater your ability to break free from what can feel like a locked situation.’ That is exactly why we set our digitised cultural heritage collection free: so it can be a resource in the innovative and creative hands of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A chance for the cultural sector, in the widest sense of the word, to show that art and culture – and the liberating, participative forces inherent in making them digital – are key to building societies that are sustainable not only from a technical point of view, but also on a human level. The legacy of Bauhaus is collaboration across borders, both where the word originated, in the cathedral workshops of medieval Europe, and in the 20th century art and design movement: across disciplinary, national and cultural borders. That’s exactly the mindset needed to tackle the climate challenges we all face. We need everyone to contribute and to be taken seriously, from science and tech experts to citizen scientists, from professional designers and artists to creatives from the general public, from scholars to students. The digital cultural heritage sector has critical experience in getting those people together to break new ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>If you visited a cultural site or heritage institution in five years time, what do you hope that experience would be like?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Welcoming. Vibrant. Stimulating thinking and doing things differently. And diverse, like people are. A Danish museum director said that if cultural institutions want to be an integral part of society, the one thing not to do is make people feel lonely or estranged. The worst thing we can do is to make people feel stupid; that when they leave our site, they feel like a lesser person than when they arrived. That ought to be a no-brainer, but it’s really an area where we can, and have to, improve. We need everybody’s creativity in order to solve the problems we’re facing today, and it’s obvious to me that our public cultural institutions should be a convener.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think that digital can support this vision?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital is participatory by design. It is accessible to almost two thirds of the world’s population. Combine those two factors, and digital holds enormous potential to let more and more diverse people take part in the conversations, negotiations and actions that shape how we live together and treat the planet – that most fundamental Commons of ours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You’ve previously written about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/statens-museum-for-kunst-the-social-impact-of-using-art-to-increase-civic-participation-of-young-people-2018\">the social impact of using art to increase civic participation of young people</a>; how do you think digital heritage can support the development of enriching and inclusive social experiences?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I find the interplay between two terms closely connected to the Bauhaus legacy quite productive when trying to answer that: the English verb ‘building’ and the German noun ‘Bildung’ – something <a href=\"https://medium.com/code-words-technology-and-theory-in-the-museum/wanna-play-8f8e2e8cb2fe#.g41p8a4np\">I’ve reflected on in more depth before.</a> Bildung is impossible to translate entirely as it converges into one word the joint meaning of education, formation, and culture. With digital access to cultural heritage as raw materials for creativity and innovation, Bildung becomes closely connected to building. Creating an understanding of the world and your own place in it becomes a product of active processing, adapting, rebuilding and repurposing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That’s what we try to support whenever we facilitate people in using our digitised collection. As our impact studies show, this approach potentially helps them find ways to understand and express difficult concepts, while&nbsp;working creatively and intuitively creates an open space to reflect on their emotional response to difficult concepts on a deeper level.&nbsp;If we can bring those kinds of impacts to the problem space of the New European Bauhaus that’s potentially very powerful.</p>\r\n"

Cultural heritage institutions, and Europeana as our shared network hub, are ideally positioned to be places, physical as well as virtual, where citizens and experts can meet in an inclusive environment to discuss how to tackle today’s local and global challenges. As Peter Kaufman of MIT Open Learning reminds us in <a href=\"https://www.sevenstories.com/books/4278-the-new-enlightenment-and-the-fight-to-free-knowledge\">The New Enlightenment and the Fight to Free Knowledge</a>, we have a strong tradition of being platforms of enlightenment and democratic citizenship. We hold trustworthy sources and knowledge that people can rely on when taking part in debates and sensemaking in an overwhelming reality. We can use that to build a Bauhaus for change.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Europeana 2021</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the cultural heritage sector looks to recover, rebuild and grow in post-pandemic times, Europeana 2021 - taking place from 10 -12 November - will aim to raise voices from across the sector to empower digital transformation and explore the role digital cultural heritage plays in today and tomorrow’s world. Building on the success of last year’s virtual conference, we are excited to be creating another designed-for-digital event to inspire and inform you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost 1000 professionals from around the globe attended Europeana 2020, and we are looking forward to welcoming an exciting mix of cultural heritage practitioners to this year’s event again. Whether you work in and around tech, copyright, education, research, impact, communications and more in the cultural heritage sector, there will be something for you! We welcome both those new to the sector and a regular at Europeana events to join us and connect with an engaged and innovative audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Call for proposals</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to open up our platform to new - as well as familiar - voices and topics and give the stage to exciting&nbsp; formats. Therefore we are inviting you to submit your proposals for an interactive and engaging webinar, workshop, session or intervention to be held during Europeana 2021. We’re looking for proposals that cover the following themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</strong>: Cultural heritage empowers society to embrace its diversity and flourish. We are looking for proposals related to any aspect of diversity and inclusion. This could be around access, reinterpreting or reimagining practices and discourses, or looking at the ways people work and operate individually, within our organisations and as a sector. We are interested in how we can collectively ensure our communities are equitable and everyone feels safe, welcome, represented and equal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Participation</strong>: Participation in and engagement with culture creates value in our sector and society at large. We want everyone to have the opportunity to participate in digital cultural heritage - to access it, to share it, to enjoy it, contribute to it and be enriched by it. We are looking for proposals that help engender participation. This could be by supporting others to develop opportunities to participate and integrate participatory activities into products and services. We’re looking for proposals that cover participatory practices, standards, platforms, tools and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Collaboration is vital in addressing the cultural heritage sector’s vulnerabilities and challenges. Greater collaborative practices can progress our sector’s digital transformation, which in turn can enable further collaborative opportunities. We’re looking for proposals that support collaborations for a European cultural sector which places digital cultural heritage at the heart of society. We’d love to hear from you if you have imaginative, engaging or new ways to connect people or organisations, build partnerships, engage audiences and network from within or even outside the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Public Sphere and Data Spaces</strong>: The Europeana Initiative is positioned at the heart of a data space for cultural heritage in the new plans of the European Commission. We want that space to be part of a vibrant digital public sphere where everyone can interact with trustworthy, reliable information and enjoy discussions and interactions which are respectful and free of harassment and exploitation. This idea is very closely linked to the foundations on which Europeana is built and the values we hold. And it’s also closely linked to the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a> movement which aims to shape future ways of living that answer the wider challenges we face today. Digital cultural heritage can play an important role in this initiative, and in shaping the heritage of tomorrow. We’re looking for proposals in this area to share and showcase how the digital transformation of our sector contributes to such a thriving public digital space, to sustainability, accessibility, and inclusivity, and to help ensure that culture is always represented in discussions on the development of policies and programmes linked to digital public spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Climate Action</strong>: There is a global climate emergency and digital has a carbon footprint too. We’re looking for proposals that support and contribute to the European Green Deal and New European Bauhaus, creating a greener, more sustainable society. We want to hear about innovative and new ways we can work together to tackle and raise awareness of the climate emergency. The proposals could cover individual actions we can all take to ‘green-up’ our practices, or activities that organisations can carry out to proactively make a positive difference. If it covers how we can individually and collectively reduce the impact the digital cultural heritage sector has on climate change, we want to hear from you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Apply now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To submit your application please read the detailed information on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/conference-call-for-proposals\">call for proposals page</a> and then complete our form. <strong>The deadline for proposals has been extended to 12 September 2021.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can’t wait to read your proposal!</p>\r\n"

Later, the commitment to Diversity and Inclusion was cemented as one of the priorities of the Foundation’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-business-plan-2021\">Business Plan for 2021</a>.

                body: "<p>Diversity and Inclusion can mean different things for different people and coming to a joint definition is part of the process the Europeana Foundation is still working on - and towards. We are progressing with the broad understanding that Diversity is about embracing a multitude of backgrounds and identities, and Inclusion is about providing a safe environment, respect, equal opportunities and rights for everyone irrespective of their background, while actively searching for gaps in our own knowledge.&nbsp; Embedding these principles in the Europeana Foundation means, ‘to be transparent and accountable for our own actions’ (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/next-steps-for-the-europeana-foundation-on-diversity-and-inclusivity\">Harry Verwayen, General Director, 17/12/2020</a>), working towards acknowledging our blind spots and being proactive in ensuring that marginalised voices are being heard. This was one of the biggest lessons for us in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2020 - A year of challenges and learnings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">COVID-19 changed the world on many fronts, and like organisations globally, Europeana Foundation faced challenges and opportunities. In June 2020 we launched a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">series of workshops</a> that called upon our community to identify new paths through - and beyond - the COVID-19 crisis for digital cultural heritage. These workshops with 64 practitioners and experts from the cultural heritage sector helped us to further our understanding of the challenges and opportunities the sector faces, including around <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Diversity and Inclusion. Over the past nine months we have been exploring this area and have looked at how we can embed it in the way we work, organise and host events, and collaborate and interact with people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020 we organised 33 online events, hosted more than 50 individual sessions at Europeana 2020 and facilitated over 20 others, attended by more than 2,800 people. We were also hard at work in improving our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/rights/accessibility-policy\">website accessibility</a> both on Europeana and on Pro, and diversifying our <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/features\">editorials</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the main opportunities of switching to online interaction was the ability to lower the barriers to participation. At the same time, the online format presents challenges.&nbsp; While it offers even more people the opportunity to attend an event, the online environment tends to change how people act, and can result&nbsp;in inconsiderate types of behaviors. It made us think of how we can improve our processes and investigate how we can create a safe space for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After our annual conference in November, the question of safe space became a prominent one, especially after a keynote that included blind spots and ignored its privileges, hurting people through its visual presentation and choice of words. It became clear that we needed to step up to face the challenge of how to create&nbsp;safe spaces, and we have a lot to learn. Since then we have experienced other challenging events that made us realise the urgency&nbsp;of having expert help and guidance, in order to create not just safe, but brave spaces in our community, where people feel they can share their experiences and be vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2021 - A year of change: prioritising the internal Diversity and Inclusion Cross team</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In January 2021 we formalised an internal <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-europeana-foundation-diversity-and-inclusion-cross-team\">Diversity and Inclusion Cross team</a>. The first steps we wanted to take as a team were to listen and learn from each other. Europeana Foundation’s Impact Advisor Nicole McNeilly developed two strategy workshops, aimed at helping the cross-team further shape an internal roadmap for Diversity and Inclusion. During these workshops, we discussed what Diversity and Inclusion means for each individual and mapped the values that should guide our work at Europeana Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We noticed that while we shared similar values, we had different perspectives on what Diversity and Inclusion means, and this made it difficult to come up with a term we all agreed on for the cross-team. We split ourselves into smaller groups to share our thoughts and reflect on our different perspectives. We realised that working towards defining and embedding Diversity and Inclusion in our organisation requires a lot of work, which is why we deemed it important to consult experts to guide us through our learning and build confidence in our abilities to tackle future mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Since the workshops, we have been consulting external moderators and experts. We are thrilled to be&nbsp; working with Jass Thethi (<a href=\"https://onlybrowninthebuildinghome.wpcomstaging.com/\">Intersectional GLAM</a>) and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/lauren-vargas\">Lauren Vargas</a>, who are currently supporting the Europeana Initiative to build a foundation on which we can design and implement our plan for a more diverse and inclusive organisation. Jass has joined meetings with the Members Council of the Europeana Network Association to support discussions around Diversity and Inclusion. Lauren hosted a series of training sessions with all three bodies of the Europeana Initiative to help us design a Community Pact, a set of principles aimed at creating an inclusive, respectful, equitable, safe and brave community within Europeana. On top of our work with these experts, we are diversifying our editorials on Europeana.eu, working with external authors that represent marginalised groups to incorporate more diverse narratives and perspectives. Read a recent blog written by guest author Iuia Hau on the history of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/blog/roma-slavery-in-romania-a-history\">Roma slavery in Romania</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Designing a Community Pact, the impact work and the roadmap are some initial steps that we are taking in the Foundation to shape a more concrete understanding of what Diversity and Inclusion mean in the context of Europeana. This way we can confidently create and implement an action plan, with tangible goals that help us ensure safer spaces for conversations, acknowledge our blind spots, and become transparent and accountable for our actions. Our commitment and consistency to the cross-team goals will be, in turn, crucial in order to elicit change in the Europeana Initiative and the wider GLAM sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-bbfe4e1d-7fff-9d66-548c-f07446ff7245\">Is your institution working on initiatives related to Diversity and Inclusion?

Instead of pursuing a traditional academic career, I started aspiring to a career in a special collections library. In 2008 I started working as a manuscripts cataloguer at the Public Library in Bruges, in 2012 I finished my Ph.D., and in 2018 I became curator of the manuscripts collection. A library offers an environment with well-read and welcoming colleagues, physical manuscripts within easy reach, and wide and enthusiastic audiences. What’s not to like? And of course I try to pay it forward by welcoming interns at our library, knowing full well what the impact of such an experience can be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&nbsp;What are you currently working on?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m currently working on two digital projects. The<a href=\"https://www.medieval-reads.eu/about\"> Art of Reading in the Middle Ages (ARMA)</a> will deliver 20,000 items to Europeana, mostly manuscripts and early printed books, created between the years c. 500 and c. 1550. The project will show how medieval reading culture evolved and became a fundamental aspect of European culture. It is a collaboration between the Europeana Foundation, six libraries, and one museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://mmmonk.be/en\">Mmmonk</a> is a project funded by the Flemish Government. It aims to unite c. 800 medieval manuscripts from four Flemish abbeys in a virtual library. About 680 of those manuscripts are kept in the project partners’ institutions in Bruges and Ghent, the others are spread around the world. We want to unite them via the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) and to build awareness about the possibilities of IIIF for end-users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finding a good balance between work to provide high quality digital access to cultural heritage objects, and my other responsibilities towards our collections and our readers! Another challenge is reaching and engaging diverse audiences, especially those who do not have easy access to culture.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Variation is definitely one of the stimulating aspects of my role. Every project, be it a digital project, a publication or an exhibition, offers new exciting ways to broaden my horizon in terms of knowledge, expertise, and networks. From creating a large exhibition on incunabula, to uniting monastic manuscripts via IIIF, to welcoming students for a workshop on medieval chronicles, there is never a dull moment!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While I was working intensely on the Europeana ARMA project, a Council Member approached me and suggested I should stand for election. I am certainly grateful for that initial nudge. From my involvement with ARMA, I thought it could be valuable to bring my perspective of recent first-hand experience with the aggregation and educational side of Europeana. Another motivation for joining the council was because I felt Europeana could benefit from some more (diverse) voices urging for the adoption of IIIF. Through our library’s collaboration with IIIF pioneers at Ghent University, I have become a<a href=\"https://whova.com/embedded/session/annua8_202106/1646973/\"> full blown advocate for IIIF</a>. The Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Foundation have already made important progress in this field, but there is still a long way to go. As a Council Member, I would like to join the effort by offering a curator’s insight in addition to the already present IT expertise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And, in more general terms, I was motivated to join the Members’ Council because of the appeal of being able to contribute to an important European mission, working from my own strengths. I feel truly European at heart and wish to contribute to its noble cause in any way possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although I also have a soft spot for the educational role of Europeana, I have decided to focus my efforts on the expansion of digital capacity, specifically on the improvement of interoperability and discoverability via linked open data and IIIF. In my opinion high quality data is the foundation on which everything else is built. I am not an IT expert, but a curator’s perspective is necessary to bridge the gap between technology experts, collections, and end users.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>You are currently working with the Santa María La Real Foundation, Europa Nostra, the European Students’ Association for Cultural Heritage (ESACH), the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)&nbsp; - and completing a PhD! Can you tell us more about your different roles?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is true - I am currently involved in many different projects and organisations! My main job is as an architect at the <a href=\"https://www.santamarialareal.org/en/\">Santa María La Real Foundation</a>. I work on Horizon 2020 projects focused on the sustainable management of territories, cultural routes and pilot destinations through heritage and cultural tourism, including <a href=\"https://www.impactour.eu/\">IMPACTOUR</a> and <a href=\"https://textour-project.eu/\">TExTOUR</a>. I also collaborate on projects which define management plans for <a href=\"https://www.ciudadespatrimonio.org/ciudades/index.php\">World Heritage Cities</a>, and design and create different thematic tourist routes specialised <a href=\"https://culturviajes.org/rutas-urbanas-por-madrid/\">in urban heritage in Madrid</a>. At the same time, I am carrying out PhD research at the Polytechnic University of Madrid in the field of Sustainability and Urban Regeneration, focusing on the enhancement of alternative cultural heritage of large cities in the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I disseminate and enhance these cultural heritage related activities by working with organisations including <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/\">Europa Nostra</a>, <a href=\"https://esach-madrid.weebly.com/\">ESACH</a>, the <a href=\"https://heritagetribune.eu/\">European Heritage Tribune</a> and <a href=\"https://icomos.es/\">ICOMOS-Spain</a>. Thanks to my role as an <a href=\"https://www.esach.org/ehya.html\">ESACH Ambassador</a> and the international representative of the <a href=\"https://www.icomos.org/en/about-icomos/committees/emerging-professionals\">Emerging Professionals Working Group (EPWG) in ICOMOS</a>, I am able to give more visibility to this work, my colleagues and young people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New European Bauhaus, for me, is an updated and renewed revival of many of the values that have been raised throughout the 20th century. Given my background as an architect, I find it particularly interesting that aesthetic issues and the value of ‘beauty’ have been included as one of the three key pillars of the initiative. The cultural urban landscape, visual and architectural landmarks, perspectives and relationships between streets and buildings, and the connection with nature through the city itself and its perimeter, are fascinating issues to think about and discuss in terms of aesthetic, and this initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is New European Bauhaus relevant to the work you are doing?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus is undoubtedly an incredible initiative at European (and almost global) level to rethink our society, our cities and our cultural heritage in terms of resilient sustainability, inclusive societies and aesthetic values. These approaches do not stand alone, but are part of an active strategy aligned together with the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the European Green Deal and the European Heritage Green Paper, published between ICOMOS and Europa Nostra. These act as a starting point for the approaches of all the projects in which I participate in a collaborative and multidisciplinary way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think we can mobilise young people, students, and new and emerging professionals around the New European Bauhaus?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is very important, at least from my point of view, to give young people, students and emerging professionals voice and visibility. The world of cultural heritage, and in this case the world of the New European Bauhaus, is complex, diverse and multidisciplinary. For a person new to this sector, it can be difficult to know where to start, who to approach or what steps to take. As we do through ESACH or the EPWG of ICOMOS, it is important to create spaces, activities, working groups and actions that help to involve these future generations through specific projects, presentations and networking events, mentoring and training plans, and the dissemination of scholarships and specific courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What we can never forget is that the ideas, points of view and proposals <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />of young people and those new to the sector are just as valid as those of other professionals; even if they do not have the same experience or the same tools, this can be addressed little by little through ‘learning by doing’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>If you visited a cultural site or heritage institution in five years time, what do you hope that experience would be like?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would certainly hope that such an enclave or place would know how to maintain and enhance its own identity and singularities, which make it unique in terms of cultural and heritage criteria. It is important that the approaches of the New European Bauhaus, in terms of aesthetics, sustainability and inclusion, as well as new technologies, are able to adapt to the needs of this site or property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think that digital can support this vision?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New technologies and the digitisation process must be tools to help us to know, understand, maintain, conserve, preserve, manage and disseminate all our cultural resources and heritage assets in a more efficient and simple way, both for us and for future generations. There are many options available, from intelligent monitoring systems, dissemination through social networks or the use of techniques such as Video-Mapping, geolocation, Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What we should never lose sight of is that however much digital media improve and evolve, they must always be a tool which accompanies the experience of our relationship with cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible; digitisation should not replace the real ‘in-situ’ experience, but rather be focused on improving its quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New European Bauhaus encourages interdisciplinarity - Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has described it as ‘a bridge between the world of art and culture on one side and the world of science and technology on the other’. How can the cultural heritage sector work with other sectors to make a contribution to the initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />I would approach this question from the point of view of ‘heritage education’, and in this way, connect again with the mobilisation of future generations and younger professionals. There is no doubt that cultural heritage today is understood as a multidisciplinary field, whereas previously approached from more specific points of view, such as architecture. It is essential to raise awareness in our society of the importance and value of cultural heritage from a young age to make it a resource capable of addressing both the field of the arts and the world of science, and able to respond to issues including sustainability in cities, resilience strategies and sustainable development.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What does the New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus initiative aims at profound societal change. It takes perhaps the biggest challenge that we face as a society - how do we live better and more sustainably together - and asks how we respond to that challenge. That is an ambition no one can ignore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus proposes to spark the innovations necessary to achieve this goal, and to inspire and mobilise the necessary civic effort, with a creative, cultural, and people-centric approach. This direction appeals to me as it constitutes a disruptive but empowering new approach to reimagining the relationship between people, nature, and the built environment of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How does the New European Bauhaus align with Europeana’s goals?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus initiative’s goals and methods resonate strongly within the Europeana community. While Europeana’s core business is focused on cultural heritage collections and digital transformation, our efforts are animated by a broader vision to reimagine the relationship between people, society, and the institutions of European culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the concept of digitality — the condition of living in a digital culture — is notably absent from the New European Bauhaus at the present time. But the digital space is integral to our living environment today -&nbsp; we work there, we play there, we come together there. It is as much a part of our daily life as our physical surroundings, and increasingly how we use those spaces and experience them determines our experiences as human beings. We want to explore what the digital component of the space envisaged by the New European Bauhaus could and should look like, and what the contribution of digital cultural heritage can be in that sphere. We are working towards a digital space that is equitable, inclusive, climate responsible - elements that we have already identified in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-foundation-business-plan-2021\">Foundation’s Business Plan, ‘Towards a digital public space for cultural heritage’</a>, and which resonate strongly with the ambitions of New European Bauhaus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We see these also reflected in a growing recognition in civic, political and policy circles of the importance of a values-based and bottom up response that has much in common with the New European Bauhaus. That response envisages a <a href=\"https://sdeps.eu/index.php/sdeps-rules-of-cooperation/\">Digital Public European space</a>, which is built on democratic values and promotes a rights-based, people-centred landscape that helps nurture more inclusive societies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has Europeana been supporting and promoting awareness and discussion of the New European Bauhaus?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-european-bauhaus-europeana-cafe\">series of Europeana Cafés on New European Bauhaus</a>, we sparked new conversations about the opportunities which the initiative has for the cultural heritage sector, and encouraged cultural heritage professionals to add their voices to the discussion. We have developed an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">innovative mentoring programme and educational challenge</a> to encourage educators to get involved, and are connecting contemporary conversations about green issues and sustainable living with cultural heritage using blogs, galleries and learning resources on<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/new-european-bauhaus\"> the Europeana website</a>. All of these activities - and more - are shared through a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">page on Europeana Pro</a>, providing a central point of information and inspiration on the initiative for the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we feel that ‘digital’ is not sufficiently part of the New European Bauhaus at the moment, we are supporting the Commission in its ambitions to explore how we want to manifest ourselves in a digital environment and participating in a <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2288\">Digital Principles Consultation</a>.&nbsp; We will bring our views into focus in the coming months as we are working towards a vision statement to outline what we can contribute to the New European Bauhaus, in practice. We are exploring it through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-european-bauhaus-europeana-cafe\">Cafés</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">Europeana Network Association</a>, and will benefit from the expertise and perspective of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation#advisory-board\">Advisory Board</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In a not too distant future shaped by the values of the New European Bauhaus, what do you hope that the experience of visiting a cultural heritage institution would be like?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would hope that cultural spaces and institutions become great convening places, where you don’t only go to look at a great painting and then move on. I’d like an experience that helps you interact with that artwork, something more conversational and more inclusive. Maybe you can share it with your friends, or do something with it - add to it, remix it. Instead of a place that invites you to only look, it becomes a place that allows you to shape your thoughts, converse, and engage in social interaction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think that digital can support this vision?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I see the spaces around us becoming more and more hybrid - they will be both physical and digital. I imagine that in 10-20 years, everything in the world that is physical (buildings, streets, lampposts and so forth) will have a digital overlay - it will be augmented in a digital way. That means that - if we design it well - you can have a much richer experience.&nbsp; A future digital space led by New European Bauhaus values should be a fantastic space to be in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What needs to happen to get us there?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We need to work out what the rules are around such a hybrid world. How do we operate it? How do we interact in it? Who can access it? Do you feel at home there? Who manages the conversation? What are the boundaries?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help us answer these questions, we need to develop a common vision for and understanding of that Digital Public Space I mentioned earlier - one that works for all parts of society and supports the work of the cultural heritage sector in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New European Bauhaus encourages interdisciplinarity - Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has described it as ‘a bridge between the world of art and culture on one side and the world of science and technology on the other’. How can the cultural heritage sector work with other sectors to make a contribution to the initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Take a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/new-european-bauhaus-europeana-cafe\">Europeana Cafés</a>! There, we have brought together people and organisations from the digital cultural arena, like Europa Nostra, individuals like Jens Bley (who works on SmartCities) and Meta Knol&nbsp;(who runs Leiden, City of Science 2022) alongside other organisations who are much more geared towards cities and places. Although we each have our own starting points and particular perspectives on New European Bauhaus, together we can explore how digital and culture translate into these other areas. By working together with other sectors - and working to start conversations between them - we can look at the problem space from different angles and make sure people and organisations can connect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>It has been a busy time for the cultural heritage sector! What has Europa Nostra been focusing on?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the unprecedented context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the much-needed economic and social recovery of the wide cultural sector, our organisation has, more than ever, stayed true to its mission of being the European Voice of civil society committed to cultural heritage. We have enhanced (mostly online) networking and capacity building opportunities for heritage stakeholders, celebrated excellence in the heritage field with our flagship <a href=\"https://www.europeanheritageawards.eu/#:~:text=The%20European%20Heritage%20Awards%2FEuropa,%2C%20research%2C%20education%20and%20communication.\">European Heritage Awards / Europa Nostra Awards</a>, campaigned to save endangered heritage across Europe and beyond (especially through our <a href=\"http://7mostendangered.eu/about/\">7 Most Endangered programme</a>), and advocated for the recognition of cultural heritage as a strategic asset to all policy priorities of the European Union as well as of all European countries, cities, communities and citizens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is the New European Bauhaus initiative relevant to this work and Europa Nostra’s activities?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As stated by the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union speeches in September 2020 and 2021, the New European Bauhaus adds a much-needed cultural dimension and a soul to the European Green Deal by bringing it closer to citizens and their living environment - both built and natural. It is deeply connected to our cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible. Therefore, the wider heritage ecosystem has actively and enthusiastically expressed its readiness to contribute to the widest possible outreach, and hence success of this initiative! For this reason, Europa Nostra was particularly pleased and honoured to be selected among the very first 13 selected partners of the New European Bauhaus and our organisation strives to align all its activities to the ideals of the initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Personally, what does New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let me tell you how delighted I was when I heard, for the very first time, the value of BEAUTY being advocated by a European Institution! The three core ideals of the New European Bauhaus - sustainability, inclusiveness and aesthetics - are embedded in our shared heritage and are key to (re)imagining our collective future together. Indeed, European urban and rural areas are built over centuries of shared history, reflected in buildings and landscapes alike. Cities and regions, including our countryside and rural areas, with their distinctive ‘spirit of the place’ and with their direct links to the quality of life of citizens and their communities, must be at the forefront of this vital movement!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In 2021, Europa Nostra produced <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/putting-europes-shared-heritage-at-the-heart-of-the-european-green-deal/\">The European Cultural Heritage Green Paper</a>, in close collaboration with members of the European Heritage Alliance. How do you think this paper supports the values of the New European Bauhaus?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Cultural Heritage Green Paper ‘Putting Europe’s shared heritage at the heart of the European Green Deal’ makes a convincing plea that our cultural and natural heritage are key to achieving the ambitious goals of the European Green Deal to make Europe the first carbon-free continent by 2050. The Paper correlates cultural heritage to all of the components of the European Green Deal and provides concrete and operational recommendations for policymakers at all levels and heritage stakeholders across Europe. We are convinced that cultural heritage, while being endangered by climate change, is also part of the solution. From reusing heritage buildings to using traditional agricultural know-how to support sustainable food systems, cultural heritage can support the transition towards a healthier, greener and fairer future in the spirit of the New European Bauhaus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europa Nostra, acting also on behalf of the European Heritage Alliance, was proud to cooperate with ICOMOS and the Climate Heritage Network of which we have recently become a regional co-Chair for Europe and CIS. We are grateful for the support received from the European Investment Bank and the EU Creative Europe programme, to release this ground-breaking document.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In a not too distant future shaped by the New European Bauhaus, what do you hope that the experience of visiting a cultural heritage site would be like?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historic buildings and their surrounding landscape shape and nurture our feeling of ‘home’ and our sense of belonging to a wider European family. Europe’s cultural heritage provides a vital bridge between the need to preserve these multiple layers of our identity and the need to embrace new ways of life. As such, it offers an inspiring framework for social cohesion and inclusion which contributes to the wellbeing of citizens and their communities. As the idea of the New European Bauhaus is focused on the design and the aesthetics of Europe’s future sustainable living environment, we hope that its projects will help promote a ‘high-quality Baukultur’ with due respect for&nbsp; the historic character of our cities, villages and rural areas. Care for cultural heritage must be part of any green agenda for the future of Europe!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you think that digital, tangible and intangible heritage can work together to support this vision?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of the pandemic, the digital shift in the cultural heritage sector has accelerated, offering welcome tools for more inclusive cultural experiences. Cultural heritage institutions (big and small) have embraced digital opportunities to continue their activities, keep their audiences entertained and engaged, while reaching new ones across Europe and beyond. Digital practices, such as 3D modelling, also have the potential to drive creativity and also enhance conservation efforts for the sake of a better safeguard of both tangible and intangible aspects of Europe’s shared cultural heritage.&nbsp;Indeed, digital,&nbsp; tangible and intangible heritage are interrelated and reinforce each other. There is a need to further enhance these synergies for a more sustainable, inclusive and beautiful future of Europe but also for Europe to promote and even lead innovation on the international scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New European Bauhaus encourages interdisciplinarity - Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has described it as ‘a bridge between the world of art and culture on one side and the world of science and technology on the other’. How can the cultural heritage sector work with other sectors to make a contribution to the initiative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it comes to collaboration, the heritage world has a huge amount of experience to offer, as each heritage site and project entails, by definition, a strong partnership between a wide range of actors and disciplines. Cultural heritage, with its multiple values for Europe’s society, economy, culture and the environment, contributes to so many other policies and sectors, including urban and rural development, architecture, design, education, research, innovation, agriculture, mobility, social cohesion and inclusion. In order to make&nbsp;those bridges even more robust, there is a need to adopt a more holistic approach to cultural heritage. The New European Bauhaus is a unique opportunity to mobilise, to change our mindset and our narrative about Europe’s green and digital transformation while enhancing&nbsp;our shared cultural heritage. In this way we shall make our continent - and the whole Planet Earth - a better, fairer, more beautiful and more meaningful place to live for present and future generations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b7e23173-7fff-9139-4e48-b3a0319ad841\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">Explore New European Bauhaus on Europeana Pro</a> and watch <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/call-to-action-for-a-more-sustainable-inclusive-and-beautiful-europe\">Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović’s keynote speech from Europeana 2021</a>. </b></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>During the 2020–2021 academic year, the global pandemic gave the Europeana community of educators the opportunity to become more relevant in their work of integrating digital culture in learning practices and to grow even further. Events such as the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/europeana-education-competition-2021/\">Europeana Education Competition 2021</a> and the new MOOC <a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/courses/course-v1:Europeana+Culture_EN+2021/about\">Digital Education with Cultural Heritage</a> created additional online opportunities for professional development, opening Europeana to even more educators interested in using digital technologies and new pedagogies with quality content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/education\">Europeana Education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/\">European Schoolnet</a> have created this handbook to showcase the best practices of the year and help colleagues all over Europe to find innovative ready-to-use educational material. We are confident that these resources will support educators during the next school period for online, offline and hybrid teaching and learning environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This handbook takes inspiration from the <a href=\"http://blogs.eun.org/teachwitheuropeana/\">Teaching with Europeana Blog</a>, and just like the Blog, focuses on eight topics:, Art, Diversity and Inclusion, Environment, History, Language Subjects, Music, Philosophy, STEAM (STEM + Arts). It shares Learning Scenarios (LS) and Stories of Implementation (SoI) that not only relate to a topic, but also introduce innovative techniques, methodologies, key competences and more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We hope that you can implement this handbook both online and offline, and that it will be useful and beneficial for your teaching activities!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Below, you can download the handbook&nbsp;in English, access it in German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Turkish, and explore an interactive version,&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Access to, and the use of, digital services and platforms is no longer an innovation or a ‘nice to have’ - it is an essential resource for citizens and organisations, both public and commercial. It is clear that creating a strong digital foundation for all is not just more important than ever, but absolutely vital to Europe’s future.&nbsp; A values-based European digital landscape that helps nurture more democratic and inclusive societies, is therefore essential to ensuring a level playing field for all people in the EU to access and leverage the full potential of digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission’s current <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en\">consultation</a> is asking for the views of EU institutions, Member States, regional and local authorities, NGOs and civil society organisations, international and umbrella organisations, other digital stakeholders, and citizens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The views of the cultural heritage sector are important and will shape future debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the proposed digital principles?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In March 2021, the European Commission published its <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/communication-digital-compass-2030_en.pdf\">‘2030 Digital Compass</a>’ - which outlines a vision for a digital decade, with a goal of reaching a ‘human-centred, sustainable and more prosperous digital future for Europe by 2030’. It proposes that a set of digital principles should help shape our digital society. The consultation is looking for perspectives to help formulate those European digital principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Its suggestions for these digital principles are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Universal access to internet services,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A secure and trusted online environment,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Universal digital education and skills for people to take an active part in society and in democratic processes,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Access to digital devices, systems, devices and services that respect the climate and environment,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Accessible and human-centric digital public services and administration,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ethical principles for human centric algorithms,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Protecting and empowering children and young people in the online space,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Access to digital health services.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the Europeana Initiative’s position?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The principles proposed by the European Commission in this consultation are important. The Europeana Foundation, Network Association and Aggregators’ Forum, collectively representing the Europeana Initiative, strongly support a rights-based, people-centred approach to the concept of digital citizenship and the development of principles that promote an equitable and democratic digital environment in which</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">basic liberties and rights are protected online,&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">sovereignty of data is protected,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">public institutions are empowered to function in the public interest, and&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">people are able to participate more fully in the creation, functioning and potential of their digital environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Initiative recognises the relevance and importance of the proposed principles however we believe that a fundamental principle is missing - that of universal access to cultural heritage online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The role of digital technologies in enabling access to culture as a means of promoting inclusivity, creativity, critical engagement, education and knowledge-sharing, is essential to empowering citizens and creating fairer societies. Ensuring the principle of universal and continuing access to culture online will be fundamental to achieving that goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also believe that the proposed principle of a secure and trusted online environment does not go far enough if our digital landscape is to truly reflect the values-based society that Europe aspires to. It is not enough to aspire to an alternative to Big Tech, we must actively build it. To that end, we propose that this principle be expanded to encompass the concept and development of an open, decentralised, and trusted European digital public space. A digital public space that is built on democratic values and public digital infrastructure, and that ensures an inclusive, rights-based, people-centred alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Initiative has responded to this consultation. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/page/consultation-on-a-declaration-of-digital-principles\">Read our full response</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How do you respond to the survey?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Go to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13017-Declaration-of-Digital-Principles-the-%E2%80%98European-way%E2%80%99-for-the-digital-society/public-consultation_en\">consultation</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Create an account if you do not already have one, and then login - it’s a simple process.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Answer a few demographic questions about yourself, or the organisation on whose behalf you are responding,</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">&nbsp;Now comes Section I&nbsp; corresponding to the proposed digital principles.

                body: "<h3><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before I joined the National Library of Scotland in 2014, I worked as a researcher for the Open Data Institute (ODI) in London after completing my Masters in Digital Asset Management. During my Masters course I worked as a consultant on digital transition projects in local museums in the south of England, which was my first professional experience in the cultural sector. A keen interest in the benefits of openness led me to my initial role at the Library, which specialised in copyright policy and developing an open licensing approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over time, my role within the Library evolved and grew as our priorities and resources shifted, and now encompasses responsibility for data protection, records management, freedom of information, and other forms of information support services in addition to responsibility for copyright.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Much of my day-to-day work involves providing guidance and support to colleagues and the public (for example, in research and digitisation projects)&nbsp;as well as developing and managing policies and procedures in my areas of specialism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, I have a few larger activities that I am excited to be working on at the Library right now.&nbsp;In 2017, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/professionals-in-focus-dafydd-tudur\">fellow Members Councillor Dafydd Tudur</a> (National Library of Wales) and I co-developed a copyright risk assessment framework, to structure a standardised approach to the assessment of copyright in our collections. I am now working within the Library to develop this framework into an automated tool that can produce indicative assessments of the copyright status of collection materials using data from our catalogues. We will use this tool to advance the Library’s digitisation and openness objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the last year I have also been working on a framework to support the assessment of ‘sensitive’ content within the Library’s collections. The framework works to provide a structure to this complex and nuanced process, enabling our collection professionals to make informed decisions about the degree of access that can be afforded to materials, as well as the degree to which content warning notices ought to be applied.&nbsp;And with my records management hat on, I am continuing long-standing work to embed a comprehensive records management plan across the Library.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The greatest challenges, and what I love most about the role, are the range of topics that I work on and the speed at which they can evolve. I love that in my role I am a specialist in a number of topics and that I am called upon to provide support, guidance, and structure in these different areas. On any given working day I can expect to hop between topics, which means I am continually exposed to activities, issues&nbsp;and ideas of incredible variety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another aspect of my role that I love is the chance to tackle topics that could readily be seen as ‘mere compliance’ and instead explore and help my colleagues to benefit from the positive, proactive, and supportive aspects of these areas. I try to approach every opportunity or issue in my areas of specialism from a positive angle. I think this is so important, because structures like copyright and data protection don’t simply exist to stifle innovation and activity, even if it can feel like that in the heat of the moment. These structures are much more nuanced and expansive than many realise at first glance, and I feel that it is my role to help my colleagues and our users to get the very best out of these structures and to understand why they are constructed as they are.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My engagement with Europeana has been on a slow, steady upward trajectory over the past few years. Mainly this has been through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright\">Copyright Community</a>, but it has also been through projects that the Library has been involved with and through secondhand enthusiasm of my peers for other areas where Europeana has great strengths, such as on impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Between 2017 and 2020 I was privileged enough to chair the UK’s Libraries and Archives Copyright Alliance (LACA), a long-established group that advocates for fair and balanced copyright and has been instrumental in ensuring delivery of positive changes to the UK’s copyright laws. My work with LACA further exposed me to the range of cultural and information organisations working to improve our quality of life and to the high challenge, high reward world of advocacy. After finishing my time as chair, I was excited for a new challenge and new means to support the cultural sectors. The opportunity to serve as a Councillor seemed the perfect means to do this within an organisation that I have found remarkably rewarding to my own career and to my own organisation’s digital engagement activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have two key objectives as a Councillor. First, I would like to continue to advance the open agenda. Openness is central to cultural organisations, and we cannot truly do our best if we are not open and exploring new, more dynamic ways to be open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, I want to help to make the Members Council, and Europeana itself, even more accessible and transparent to our sectors and communities. Although I have worked closely with Europeana for several years, have been active on the Copyright Community, and now chair that Community, I have found the organisation and the Council challenging beasts at times to understand.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>While characterised by the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020-2021 school year offered educators the opportunity to develop new resources to better integrate digital cultural heritage in education. We were delighted that over this period, more than 2,200 primary and secondary school teachers, museum educators, and other cultural heritage professionals created educational resources with Europeana content or used them in face-to-face and/or online classes, impacting more than 17,000 students. What innovative activities did Europeana and European Schoolnet work on to ensure this engagement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>'Digital Education with Cultural Heritage'&nbsp;MOOC&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/courses/course-v1:Europeana+Culture_EN+2021/about\">'Digital Education with Cultural Heritage'&nbsp;MOOC</a> ran from March 2021 to April 2021. It offered participants the chance to deepen their knowledge of digital cultural heritage, while exploring Europeana resources and various educational tools. About 1,100 educators (of which half were primary or secondary school teachers), cultural heritage professionals and researchers participated, and almost 550 of them successfully completed the online course. Participants were introduced to different ways of creating learning scenarios, combining the use of digital cultural heritage with innovative pedagogies. The course explored methods of engaging students ranging from flipping the classroom, to project-based learning, to gamification, and more!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Teaching with Europeana blog</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With more than 100,000 page views and 30,000 users accessing its content between September 2020 - June 2021, the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a> has been shown to be a valuable tool for educators. It offers a wide range of learning resources and educational tools to easily integrate digital cultural heritage into everyday educational practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since September 2020, about 200 new learning scenarios and over 40 stories of implementation have been produced for the blog. These offer inspiration and guidance to educators who want to bring cultural heritage into their classrooms. The significant number of new contributions is a result of the engagement and work of a large community made up of&nbsp;11 teacher ambassadors, 3 museum ambassadors, 91 Europeana User Group teachers, 14 Europeana User Group museum educators and participants of the ‘Digital Education with Cultural Heritage’ MOOC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, a working group of educators approached the prominent and important topic of inclusion and diversity by developing eight thematic learning scenarios and four stories of implementation, dealing with cultural diversity, gender identity and stereotypes, and ability diversity themes, suggesting inclusion strategies and techniques as a means of avoiding prejudice and bias. These resources reflect and demonstrate&nbsp; how a diverse learning environment can expand learners’ cognitive, social, and cultural skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Education Competition 2021</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/europeana-education-competition-2021/\">Europeana Education Competition 2021</a> invited primary and secondary school teachers, museum educators and cultural heritage professionals to find innovative ways of using artistic and scientific educational heritage in their activities. 89 entries were submitted from 18 different countries, and the 24 best resources were rewarded and included in the handbook <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-learning-in-the-pandemic-cultural-heritage-resources-by-and-for-educators\">Digital Learning in the Pandemic</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A handbook of best practice</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are delighted to have recently published the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/digital-learning-in-the-pandemic-cultural-heritage-resources-by-and-for-educators\">Digital Learning in the Pandemic</a> handbook. As its name suggests, the handbook includes best practices and examples of digital learning which were created and tested in formal and non-formal educational settings during the 2020-2021 school year. The learning scenarios and stories of implementation it includes are organised into eight different topics – Art, Diversity and Inclusion, Environment, History, Language Subjects, Music, Philosophy, STEAM (STEM + Arts) – according to the key competences promoted, the methodology and trends they follow as well as the innovative activities they include. We hope that this will prove a valuable resource for educators!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To share the work that they have undertaken over the past academic year, Europeana Education and European Schoolnet have produced an illustrated ‘Europeana Education: Activities’ summary 2020-2021’.

                body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us about your work at the French Ministry of Culture? How does this intersect with your role as Chair of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum? &nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have worked for the French Ministry of Culture for 14 years in many positions, and am now in charge of the definition and implementation of the Linked Open Data (LOD) strategy for the Ministry. I have been lucky enough to follow or be involved with the Europeana Initiative from the beginning, and I currently coordinate French participation in Europeana, representing France in the Digital Cultural Heritage and Europeana (DCHE) expert group in the European Commission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the last five years I have also been the representative of the French national aggregator in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a>. I was elected as a member of the Forum Steering Group and nominated as Chair a few months ago. I think that the Forum is a perfect reflection of how technical and policy aspects of digital cultural heritage can be managed together, and it is a great honour for me to get the chance to represent all the aggregators and data providers who contribute to Europeana.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The points of intersection between my roles are therefore numerous; the technical and policy aspects I deal with at national level are about guiding and supporting cultural heritage institutions to publish their data as Linked Open Data and contribute to the Europeana Initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How is the New European Bauhaus relevant to the work you are doing in both of these roles?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The New European Bauhaus is particularly relevant as it brings focus onto culture and creativity in a political and economic context where those aspects were not considered as priorities. With both of my roles related to making cultural heritage available to the widest audiences, including artists, New European Bauhaus reminds us that creativity and culture can rely on or be inspired by cultural heritage. I believe it gives us some food for thought and inspiration!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does New European Bauhaus mean to you?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I first heard about the New European Bauhaus, I understood it as a revival of the ‘classic’ Bauhaus of architecture and design. I found it relevant that this artistic movement - which focused on bringing together art, architecture, design and wellbeing - is being revived in times troubled by crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming. For me, the Bauhaus was synonymous with objects and architecture that are beautiful but also completely functional and useful. So I also perceive the New European Bauhaus as something related to art and culture but with purpose and connection with technology and other sectors. I see it as an invitation to citizens to bring up ideas where art, culture and creativity can meet our current societal challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In a not too distant future shaped via the European Bauhaus, what do you hope that the experience of visiting a cultural heritage institution would be like?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe the New European Bauhaus will bring new ways to engage with audiences. In the current context, where people cannot travel as they used to, or do not feel safe enough to visit crowded places or wait in long lines, there is a challenge to offer innovative ways to visit a cultural heritage institution. One of our missions as professionals in the cultural heritage sector is to make everyone feel welcome and make content as educational and accessible as possible. In a future institution shaped by the New European Bauhaus, I hope that this will be even more possible, and that we will be able to look forward to visits which do not conflict digital and ‘in real life’ experiences, but which strike a balance between the two.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the last exhibitions I visited here in France used digital to enhance a visit in situ very effectively. There was a monumental display of a painting, with a digital focus and explanation of many of its elements. This feature considerably enhanced my experience as a visitor as I was able to see and read it from anywhere in the room and it provided me with valuable historic and artistic details. I believe soon these kinds of augmented experiences will be widely used.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How else do you think that digital can support your vision?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All the ‘behind the scenes’ work done by aggregators and of course data partners will contribute to building that vision. A decade ago, digital mostly meant wide access without any notion of frontier or border. I am rather happy to see that this understanding of digital has evolved, and I think today digital is more seen as a way of offering an ‘augmented culture’ where the traditional divide between digital/physical is no longer relevant. Digital enhances culture for heritage but also for creation. Digital is completely integrated in our daily life and process so it is crucial in this context to support the digital transformation of the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New European Bauhaus encourages interdisciplinarity - Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has described it as ‘a bridge between the world of art and culture on one side and the world of science and technology on the other’. How can the cultural heritage sector work with other sectors to make a contribution to the initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The division of the cultural heritage sector is a consequence or a reflection of how politically and administratively things are organised and funded. In reality, culture does not stand on its own. Culture by definition is a bridge to and from other sectors. The New European Bauhaus is a great opportunity to remind us that culture, like ecology, is multidisciplinary and that collaboration between sectors related to humanities on one hand and technology on another hand should be fostered.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Historiana, an international online platform for history and citizenship educators</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/historiana\">Historiana</a> is an online learning platform developed by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/euroclio\">EuroClio</a> and Europeana. It supports the use of cultural heritage collections in education and helps cultural heritage institutions to engage with students. Historiana is currently developed and promoted by three main <a href=\"https://www.euroclio.eu/the-historiana-teams/\">teams</a>: the Historical content team, Learning and teaching team and Concept, Design and Development team. Each of these teams advances the platform in different ways, creating new content, implementing user feedback and supporting colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Recruiting and training new trainers&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To further the goals of the Teaching and Learning team, in April 2021&nbsp;EuroClio launched a new programme to recruit trainers for the platform, and 23 educators from 13 countries applied to become Historiana trainers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Applicants had to complete several steps of training to become certified. First, they familiarised themselves with a training package prepared by the Teaching and Learning team, and with Historiana itself. They then met for an intensive online workshop which included the creation of eLearning activities that demonstrated critical historical thinking skills. Finally, the applicants had to review and update EuroClio’s current teacher training guide to bring new insights and updated methods into the content. In the end, 11 educators were awarded the certificate and became Historiana trainers!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Updating the teacher training guide</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The feedback which the applicants provided on EuroClio’s teacher training guide was very positive. Nevertheless, they made a few improvements which have been incorporated into the guide, focusing in particular on updating its exemplary activities, eLearning activities used as best practices on Historiana. In addition, they reviewed and updated learner challenges and the language was made more accessible for teachers who are not familiar with Historiana. You can access and download the updated guide <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teacher-training-guide\">here</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Supporting outreach and multilinguality</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By increasing the number of Historiana trainers, the Teaching and Learning team hopes to be able to reach a broader audience. Trainers will be able to support the organisation of local workshops in their own countries (important in a time of ongoing travel restrictions), reaching more educators than ever before. In the coming year, as part of their collaboration with Europeana, EuroClio will be organising training in the local area of all the new trainers. These events, delivered by the new trainers, will be held either online or in-person, depending on the rules in each country, and will introduce the platform to history and citizenship educators and present Historiana’s new features to experienced educators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The number of languages in which the training can take place has also increased from 6 to 13, helping to promote Historiana to educators whose preferred language may not be English. Additionally, the new trainers will be able to translate or add new resources in Historiana in other languages, increasing the internationality of the platform. All these benefits will further help the discovery of international (re)sources made available by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are an educator interested in becoming a Europeana trainer, please get in contact with EuroClio at <a href=\"mailto:secretariat@euroclio.eu\">secretariat@euroclio.eu</a>! You can also explore resources in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teacher-training-guide\">updated teacher training guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are an aggregator or cultural heritage institution working with Europeana, you can create a <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners\">partner page</a> on Historiana to promote your resources to educators by curating your own source collections or eLearning activities. Check out the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/photoconsortium\">Photoconsortium</a>, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/rijksmuseum\">Rijksmuseum</a>, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/swedish-open-cultural-heritage\">Swedish Open Cultural Heritage</a> and <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/partners/imperial-war-museum\">Imperial War Museum</a> pages for inspiration and contact <a href=\"mailto:secretariat@euroclio.eu\">secretariat@euroclio.eu</a> for more information about creating a page.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>How do you manage the topic of diversity in the classroom? Where to start?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are educators. We are trying to teach future generations to thrive while in this ever-changing environment we still struggle with a very subject-based curriculum. Instead of embracing technology in the classroom and promoting problem-solving, creative thinking and collaboration, we spend most of our classroom time on exams, assessing, testing, and providing information. However, our students have a greater need than ever to learn how to live and work in a society where every individual is unique. If we want to tackle the topic of diversity and inclusion in the classroom, we have to focus on promoting and accepting the differences between people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Teachers should show genuine interest in learning more about students’ cultural backgrounds, hobbies, learning styles. With this, they can start a conversation, a dialogue, a debate about respect and diversity as we all know communication is the core to a culturally aware and inclusive school environment. Anyone can access curated content on the Europeana website like the exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/family-matters\">How the 20th century changed family life</a> or participatory tools like <a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/migration\">Share your migration stories</a> to support and ignite these conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>It seems extremely important to discover learners’ personal stories, many of them marginalised, to understand who we are and in which context we live in today. Could you suggest some resources for teachers and students to reflect on that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are several possible resources&nbsp; that can be used to reconnect with and productively learn from our past. Let me give you some examples. There is a lesson plan in <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a>, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/learning-activity/Cultural%20Herritage:%20Monuments%20and%20Statues\">Remember the past</a>, that helps students develop their critical thinking and learn more about controversial monuments and statues. Another helpful resource is the learning scenario on Teaching with Europeana, <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/inclusion-processes-through-participatory-photography-and-digital-narratives-ls-pt-304/\">Inclusion Processes through Participatory Photography and Digital Narratives</a> from Paulo Antunes, a Portuguese teacher, which aims to bring learners with diverse cultural backgrounds together centered on participatory dynamics. Finally I would like to mention a student's collaborative effort, a virtual museum made by my Hungarian students from fragments of their grandparents’ untold stories and related objects, the <a href=\"https://www.artsteps.com/view/606dee1d963cf1461448b58e/?currentUser\">Memory Gallery – Art Museum SZLI</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You mentioned at the very beginning how important it is to start the conversation - I imagine not always easy - with the students. But how do you keep the dialogue alive to better understand each other with respect and empathy? Tell us more about the significance of communication.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maintaining ongoing communication throughout the school year, students can give feedback and reflect on to what degree they felt included in activities. It is in this way that they can learn more about their individual problems and suggest different options to improve the class experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the last few years, teachers and educators from all over Europe, participating in the Europeana education initiative and in collaboration with European Schoolnet, have been working on different topics and developing learning scenarios, on diversity and inclusion. These materials are published in <a href=\"http://blogs.eun.org/teachwitheuropeana/learning-scenarios/ls-topic/ls-diversity-and-inclusion/\">The Teaching with Europeana blog</a>. There you can find examples of how to encourage students to research and learn about their own and others’ <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/in-my-shoes-ls-hr-303/\">ethnic and cultural backgrounds</a> by <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/one-coin-two-sides-the-art-of-debating-ls-mt-219/\">debating</a>, <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/our-story-our-history-after-the-immigration-ls-fr-260/\">planning,</a> or <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/the-political-process-and-citizens-voice-in-the-european-union-ls-ro-348/\">expressing support</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Finally, diversity and inclusion is not a compulsory topic in the school curricula, so how do you embed these learning scenarios and resources into your teaching?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you start planning your classroom activities, besides acknowledging and respecting students’ backgrounds and fostering cultural awareness, you should also ensure that diversity is respected. Many of the resources I’ve mentioned could be integrated into lesson plans. These learning scenarios prove that, regardless of the subject, it is always a good choice to connect them to real-life examples or visual representations. You can give the students the freedom to browse and choose content on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/\">the Europeana website</a>, so they can approach the topic from their own diverse perspective. Good examples are the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/emotional-intelligence-and-teenagers-ls-bg-506/\">Emotional Intelligence and Teenagers</a> or <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/learning-scenarios/ls-language/english-ls/raising-awareness-about-refugees-inclusion-ls-pt-104/\">Raising awareness about Refugees</a> learning scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students who learn about different cultures during their education not only become more open-minded and empathetic, but they are also prepared for a future diverse working and social environments. Hopefully, the scenarios we have produced so far will help other teachers and educators to embrace and teach about diversity by using cultural heritage sources that represent anyone's story. Let’s leave no one behind!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The Europeana Network Association (ENA) is a strong movement of over 3,000 professionals, across Europe and beyond, who are united by a shared mission to expand and improve access to our digital cultural heritage. In this democratic and inclusive community, we share knowledge and experience, and engage in creative cross-border and cross-domain collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our members are formally represented in the governance of the Europeana Initiative by representatives who they elect to&nbsp;the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a>, who&nbsp;then take decisions on their behalf. The Members Council is composed of 36 representatives, 27 of whom will complete their three year terms this year. We are therefore looking for committed future Councillors to fill their open seats, and as Chair of the ENA’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/governance-working-group\">Governance Working Group</a>, I am excited to formally kick off this year’s elections campaign!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why stand to be a Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a Councillor, you formally represent and champion the interests of ENA members. You can contribute to making the ENA’s governance more transparent, accountable and democratic, and help us look for new ways of adding value to ENA membership, and make it more inclusive and diverse. Councillors also get an opportunity to advise and actively help Europeana implement its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/strategy-2020-2025-summary\">Strategy</a>&nbsp;and support Europeana's mission to <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will have the opportunity to lead the activities of ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">communities</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/working-groups\">task forces and working groups</a>, and in January 2022, you will be able to elect and also stand for election to the new ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a>. Working formally with fellow councillors and across the network offers great opportunities to build connections with other cultural heritage practitioners. The&nbsp;new Council will keep working to develop ways for members to get involved&nbsp;and nurture close collaboration with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/aggregators\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/foundation\">Europeana Foundation</a>. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/support-collaboration-and-growth-the-europeana-network-association-in-2021\">Learn more about the current ENA Strategic priorities</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are looking for active and committed members, ready to bring forward these activities&nbsp; and available to attend meetings three times a year. To find out more about the responsibilities as a Councillor, you can read our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/Councillor-Terms-of-Reference.pdf\">Councillor Terms of Reference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Stand for election</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From now until 13 October 2021, we are inviting all ENA members to come forward as Members Council candidates to fill the 27 open seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we aim to make the ENA more inclusive and diverse, we welcome candidates from all backgrounds and sectors relevant to Europeana, providing you are a member of the ENA. Whether you're an emerging professional new to Europeana or have many years experience in the cultural heritage sector, we want to hear from you. We welcome professionals working in research, education, copyright, technological development, creative industry, copyright, or any other area related to Europeana’s work. If you’re not a registered member yet, you still have time to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">sign up</a> - make sure you do so before 1 October 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please send us your candidate profile and submit your candidacy via the button below by <strong>13 October 2021</strong>. Please explain why you wish to run, what you stand for, and what you want to work towards as a Members Councillor. We will then formally announce the candidates on 14 October 2021, inviting each candidate to introduce and campaign themselves to the ENA. Make sure to follow the campaign using the hashtag #EuropeanaElects.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>In Europe, Black History Month is marked annually in October - particularly in Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom -&nbsp; to celebrate Black lives and communities, highlighting the achievements of People of Colour throughout history and in the present. Black History Month is also a month of discussion, debate and protest, bringing challenges that face Black communities to light and campaigning for equal rights, opportunities, and representation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This October we are excited that our new exhibition ‘Black Lives in Europe’ will explore the lives of people such as Toussaint Louverture, Anton de Kom and Nicola Adams, who fought for their freedom and rights, entertained the world and accomplished great achievements. We acknowledge that the Europeana website contains limited collections around Black history – especially Black European history – so we want to highlight Black lives and achievements where we can. Complementing the exhibition, we will share a variety of stories about Black history with galleries and blogs on the Europeana website.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Through editorials on Europeana Pro we will also highlight cultural heritage institutions like the Horniman Museum, which are working to bring Black cultural heritage to wider audiences (see also the UK-based project <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/staying-power-photographs-of-black-british-experience\">Staying Power</a> from the Victoria and Albert Museum and Black Cultural Archives, from which the Al Vandenburg <em>On a Good Day</em> series <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1189951/high-street-kensington-from-the-photograph-vandenberg-al/\">photograph leading this post</a> is taken). In doing so, we hope to inspire professionals and institutions to digitise and share Black cultural heritage, as well as recognise and address the historical barriers that these activities face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our plans for Black History Month are part of our wider organisational effort to be more inclusive and diverse. We want to give more space to the narratives of underrepresented groups, in order to become more representative of the society in which we live. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/diversity-and-inclusion-working-towards-an-equitable-future\">Find out more</a> about the work being done towards this at the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to support cultural heritage institutions to get involved in Black History Month, and we can help to share your work and content in a number of ways. If you would like to get involved, you can:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Write</strong> an editorial piece which highlights Black history for the Europeana website or <strong>recommend</strong> historical Black European figures we could feature. You are welcome to share images and objects from your own collections.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Tell us</strong> about your plans for Black History Month so that we can explore ways to support and align them with our activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Share</strong> your own work through Europeana Pro. Is your organisation mainly focused on Black history or running projects and exhibitions to highlight it? Let us interview you and raise awareness about the importance and challenges of making Black history accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can do all of the above by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU9IOndv3-895jlCoqZ5wDHn-iRrOU6CFYQDrzNtQwfZ0FsQ/viewform\">filling out our form</a> or getting in touch with <a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu\">editorial@europeana.eu</a>. In addition, you could:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Promote</strong> relevant content, blogs, images and objects from your own collections on social media. Use #BlackHistory and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Highlight</strong> a well-known or lesser-known historical Black figure on social media. Again, use #BlackHistory and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Follow, retweet and share</strong> our editorials and news posts throughout the month - we will be sharing them on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/3201557/\">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For any other questions or ideas, please get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:editorial@europeana.eu\">editorial@europeana.eu</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>As explored through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/ai-theme\">Europeana Pro news</a> earlier this year, AI has huge potential for the cultural heritage sector. It offers the possibility to generate extensive amounts of data to enrich heritage collections, making them easier to explore and interconnected. Beginning in December 2019, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">EuropeanaTech AI in relation to GLAMs Task Force </a>aimed to carry out a horizon scanning exercise to investigate the role and impact of this technology in the sector, and gain a greater understanding of projects which use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Surveying the sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2020, the Task Force surveyed professionals working in galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs),&nbsp;research institutions and the wider industry (including technology suppliers and the&nbsp;creative industries). The survey received 56 responses and the results offer valuable insights into the use of AI in the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost all the respondents (91.8%) were interested in at least one AI topic, and more than half of them (54%) had expertise in this area. Several shared that they were already working on AI-related projects which were mostly aimed at digitisation and discoverability. However, many people also reported challenges in working with AI, particularly in relation to the skills and expertise which projects required of staff and a lack of appropriately annotated training data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Insights from interviews</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the survey, the Task Force interviewed eight cultural heritage professionals from various European institutions. Their responses add rich perspectives on the approaches that cultural heritage institutions are taking towards AI, and are included as case studies in the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone who was interviewed agreed that AI has great potential for cultural heritage, and wanted to investigate using it further. It was clear from many responses that AI will play an increasingly large and valuable role throughout the activities of cultural organisations, especially with regard to access, metadata extraction and enrichment. However, as in the survey, many people referred to challenges when working with AI, stressing the need for cross-departmental collaboration, the challenging lack of data with suitable annotations and the complexities of integrating AI into existing infrastructure. They also expressed concerns regarding ethics and how best to demonstrate and communicate the value of applying AI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reflections on the report: challenges and opportunities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From the results of this Task Force, it is clear to see that AI and Machine Learning (ML) projects are already being carried out in GLAMs and have been for several years, even if they have not always been visible. We hope that the results of this Task Force will be one way to share and promote this work!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we have seen obvious interest in and enthusiasm for AI across the sector, there are also obstacles. People reported that it can take a long time before the results of an AI strategy or research become apparent, which means that it can sometimes be a challenge to convince organisations of the necessity of the work. The report gives insights into the main challenges faced by GLAMs, ranging from access to training data, ethical considerations, and issues related to scaling up projects to institution-wide implementations.&nbsp;AI is not seen as a 'quick technology fix' for the humanities, and precisely because of this time-consuming aspect, data and knowledge sharing seem essential for the continuation and success of these projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech community</a> will continue to support knowledge exchange on AI, and seek further collaboration with other initiatives to increase its impact. The Task Force and the EuropeanaTech Steering Group have outlined action points for this future work which focuses on the themes knowledge exchange, data sharing and strategic input:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We want to achieve knowledge exchange through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-our-europeanatech-x-ai-webinar-series\">EuropeanaTech x AI webinar series</a> and by organising other events which focus on specific topics and collaborations with Cultural AI Lab, AI4LAM and The Museums + AI Network. If you have got an idea, please get in contact with Europeana’s Research and Development Manager Antoine Isaac, <a href=\"mailto:antoine.isaac@europeana.eu\">antoine.isaac@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Following on from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeanatech-challenge-for-europeana-ai-ml-datasets-announcing-the-winners\">EuropeanaTech challenge for AI/ML datasets</a>, Europeana has begun to publish datasets of potential interest for AI applications under the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/communities/europeana/\">Europeana community</a> umbrella in Zenodo. The first contribution is a <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4896487\">style classification dataset</a> from the <a href=\"https://v4design.eu/\">V4Design </a>project.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Strategic input will build on the reflections from this final report, including integrating and linking new AI systems into existing systems, publicly sharing models trained on domains specific to cultural heritage collections, implementing AI in a way that is considerate of ethical and legal, and reducing the carbon footprint of training models and processing at scale.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep following the work of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> to explore how this progresses, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/ai-in-relation-to-glams\">download and read the report in full</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />How can cultural heritage institutions measure the impact of their work on audiences, stakeholders and the wider public? How can they evaluate their events to improve them? What tools can they use to understand the effect of their services and products, particularly as they move online?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana has been helping cultural heritage institutions to answer these questions by developing resources, holding events and convening a community around impact in the heritage sector. We want to standardise an approach to impact that we - and others - can adopt, to better understand the impact of digital cultural heritage. Read on to find out more about what we have been doing over the last year to reach these goals!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Developing the Europeana Impact Framework</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Impact Framework defines how we apply and embed impact assessment within the Europeana Foundation and the wider Initiative. Over the past year, we have been refining its different elements, including the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a>, a phased, step-by-step approach to help cultural heritage professionals design, measure and narrate their impact. We recently published <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-playbook#phase-three\">Phase three of the Playbook</a>, which guides professionals through the narration of impact, from building a narrative to visualising data and publishing the findings in different ways for different audiences. This year we were also delighted to share the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-standardised-question-bank\">Europeana standardised question bank</a>, a new resource that accompanies Phase two of the Playbook. The question bank aims to support cultural heritage institutions and our partners in their data collection and impact assessment practices, particularly surveying stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, we have created a<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-case-studies\"> central impact evidence base</a> on Europeana Pro to bring together all our impact assessments for others to refer to and learn from, and we have refreshed and updated our online <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact\">Impact Toolkit</a> so that you can find all of the resources you need in one place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Europeana Impact Community</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have been delighted to see that in the last year the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Europeana Impact Community</a> has almost doubled in size and been active in creating a platform for learnings and discussion around impact practice. A five-part Impact Community <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/understanding-the-impact-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-digital-transformation-join-our-webinar-series\">webinar series</a> explored the impact of digital cultural heritage in digital transformation, while a successful two-day symposium, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/research-and-digital-cultural-heritage-new-impact-horizons\">‘Research and digital cultural heritage: new impact horizons’</a> discussed topics from policy and innovation to participatory practices to digital audiences and new socio-political perspectives. Recordings of all of these events are available to watch on our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/webinars#impact\">webinars page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Community members have also been busy working on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-lite\">Impact Lite Task Force</a> and at Europeana have looked to find relevant opportunities to encourage discussion about Europeana’s approach to impact, such as on the working group of the <a href=\"https://www.espon.eu/HERIWELL\">HERIWELL</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Impact research&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our ongoing impact research aims to strengthen our understanding of the impact of convening the sector through our events and Network. This year, we have published impact assessment reports of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/impact-assessment-report-digital-programming-series\">Europeana’s Digital Programme</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/convening-for-change-the-impact-of-our-annual-conferences\">2019 and 2020 conferences</a>, as well as exploring our Portuguese Presidency event in June 2021 and undertaking a survey of Europeana Network Association Members. For anyone looking to replicate our evaluation approach, our new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/events-toolkit\">Events Toolkit</a> includes a dedicated section on impact and measuring success for events!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Embedding impact practice in the Europeana Initiative</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In parallel with trying to support impact practice across the sector, we are also further embedding an impact approach within the Europeana Initiative. It was great to see that three of the six most recently funded Generic Services projects include impact assessment as a part of the work plan, and we have also established an evaluation template for all of our events, driven by the Impact Playbook. We have adapted the methodology in Phase one of the Impact Playbook to create impact-focussed planning and strategy workshops, including for the Europeana Network Association’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/supporting-new-professionals-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">New Professionals Task Force</a> and the Europeana Foundation’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-europeana-foundation-diversity-and-inclusion-cross-team\">Diversity and Inclusion cross-team</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are keeping our eyes firmly on the horizon for more opportunities to explore what our work can tell us about the value of digital transformation for digital heritage practitioners, organisations and audiences, and wider society. In the coming year, we will improve our data collection approaches and continue to build the evidence base. We will work to ensure that our Impact Toolkit is relevant through a revision of Phase two (data collection) and the publication of Phase four (evaluation) so that it meets sector needs in the context of rapid social and environmental change and digital transformation. We’ll hold capacity building activities like training on using the Impact Playbook, and aim to animate the community to increase the currency of the discussion around impact in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be the first to hear about this work as it progresses and opportunities to get involved, join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Europeana Impact Community</a> - it is free and easy to join today!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This report presents proceedings, findings and outcomes from the Portuguese Presidency Europeana Conference ‘Towards recovery: digital capacity building in the cultural heritage sector’ on 3 and 4 June 2021. This digital conference was part of the Europeana DSI-4 Year 3 implementation plan. It was held under the auspices of the Portuguese presidency, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and the National Library of Portugal. It involved 89 participants from 42 countries across the sector over two days. The event brought together policymakers from European ministries of culture, national coordinators, experts in the field, representatives of the European Commission and the Digital Cultural Heritage &amp; Europeana (DCHE) Expert Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This report provides insights and a brief analysis with regards to the goals that Europeana and the Portuguese partners set for this conference. This includes a discussion on the meaning of digital transformation, exploration of the digital capacity building in the sector, and the aspirations for achieving that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference aimed to stimulate reflection and dialogue around capacity building, to enable participants to make sense of their own contexts and experiences. The conference was part of a series of ongoing efforts to get a shared understanding of digital transformation and investigate digital capacity building across the European cultural heritage sector. The event provided an opportunity to help shape such understanding and&nbsp; placed cultural heritage in the spotlight as part of Europe's recovery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the conference, the participants exchanged views, successful approaches and common challenges around capacity building to deepen their understanding of capacity building for digital transformation across the European cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Parts of the event were invite-only - aimed at cultural policymakers from EU Member States. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/towards-recovery-digital-capacity-building-in-the-cultural-heritage-sector\">Other sessions</a> were open to the public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Four high-profile guests welcomed participants to the conference and shared their insights for how a 'digital decade' can ensure culture plays its role in Europe's social and economic development and recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A roundtable discussion on the meaning of capacity building saw the speakers Alek Tarkowski, Cosmina Berta, Jonas Heide and Susan Hazan explore and confront different perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Four case studies reflected on digital capacity building and showcased opportunities for and inspiring examples of growth and positive action to build capacity: Brigitte Vézina and Eveline Heidel (Scann) introduced the Creative Commons training and certification programme. Elizabeth Rosenberg talked about a study by NEMO on the consequences of COVID-19 and building resilience in European museums. Adriana Nogueira presented the Algarve Digital Newspaper Archive to the audience and Maaike Verberk introduced the DEN Academy Leadership Programme Pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two workshops aimed to help participants and Europeana shed light on what we mean by digital capacity building and how it can empower the cultural heritage sector in its digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For this report, we summarised, condensed and simplified notes, transcripts, recordings of the speeches, roundtables and case study presentations as well as data from the workshop Miro boards down to a summary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We learned there is no one-size-fits-all approach to capacity building. The needs, challenges and approaches, as well as the key components of capacity building models, outcomes from these models, and the road ahead for the Member States and their institutions are many and diverse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We found the following elements to be important in supporting digital capacity building:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">integration of cultural heritage goals into national strategies&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">clear policy direction&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">advocacy for the sector&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">allocation of sufficient funds to the cultural sector and its digital transition&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">the European Commission’s support and leadership&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">training&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">multilinguality&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">collaboration within the sector&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">cross-sectoral collaboration at local, national and European level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The variety of these considerations from diverse perspectives reflects the multi-faceted nature of capacity building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshop process proved meaningful to the Foundation team. It helped us to better understand the problem space and shed light on how Europeana can support building capacity in the sector. The process proved to be a capacity building exercise in itself both for the Europeana Foundation and hopefully for many individual participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Initiative will continue to reflect on and facilitate conversations on capacity building, building on the outcomes of this meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A solid synthesis of the outcomes of the conference will inform the Europeana Capacity Building Framework for digital transformation currently under development. The framework models how we approach capacity building to harmonise activities - contributing towards empowering and motivating professionals, and driving a sustainable change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will develop an impact model for our capacity building work and we will continue to interrogate the vision of digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using feedback from the conference workshop participants we have documented and refined the workshop exercises in a Capacity Building Playbook. The playbook supports a structured approach to capacity building and the development of a shared vocabulary for it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Download the full report below.</strong></p>\r\n"

We’ve seen the importance of digital for the cultural heritage sector grow but also the widening of the digital divide. We are not all born-digital equal and there is now a greater need than ever to empower the sector to embrace, manage and benefit from digital change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We thank Europeana Foundation staff, our partners and friends in the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and all of the projects we are part of across the sector for their continued dedication and hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is Europeana DSI-4?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Union is working to create the infrastructure that will support its citizens, sectors and public administrations in their access to digital services. It is building ‘digital bridges’ through what it calls Digital Service Infrastructures&nbsp; (DSIs), to provide access to those services for the benefit of all.&nbsp; Europeana is the DSI that delivers services to showcase and provide online access to Europe’s digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana service is provided by a consortium of 21 partners, coordinated by the Europeana Foundation, and is funded under the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility\">Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)</a>. Europeana DSI-4 is the current project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Explore significant highlights from the third year of DSI-4 (September 2020 - August 2021) below.</p>\r\n"

The impact of these issues informs every decision we make, no matter what the area of work. They are topics under discussion in relation to the European Commission's <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus#interviews\">New European Bauhaus</a>, as well as in-house across all our teams and communities, and we are pleased to be including them across our work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>How did you enter your profession?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That is a long story! I did a PhD in Philosophy, on the notion of predicate in Logic, and worked as a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Arts KU Leuven&nbsp;when it still included the Philosophy Department. In the late eighties and early nineties my interest for (personal) computing and subsequently the internet grew stronger, and I landed a job as ICT coordinator for the Faculty of Arts. I effectively coordinated large university projects on web information systems, e-learning and library systems. Eventually I was appointed as Professor of Data Processing for the Arts, and later for Online Publishing at the Department of Cultural Studies. I helped to found the Photolab of the Faculty, which would become the Imaging Lab of the university.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After running some local projects on image databases, my first contact with Europeana was as coordinator of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeanaphotography\">Europeana Photography project</a>,&nbsp;in which we delivered about 450,000 images from&nbsp;the first 100 years of photography. From this project, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/photoconsortium\">Photoconsortium</a> - the accredited aggregator for photography - emerged, of which I am the current president.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently I’m mostly working on projects relating to digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector. This is in line with my original ICT career, in which I worked on building bridges between the needs of humanities education and research and information technologies. I’m interested in how we can capture more aspects of cultural processes in data streams, for example, the event or usage history of art objects and representations. This is also related to understanding how ICT solutions can support true interaction and user engagement with heritage collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I like to interface between disciplines, and have always worked - after my PhD&nbsp;- in interdisciplinary research. It is what sociologists Harry Collins &amp; Robert Evans call ‘interactional expertise’ in their <em>Rethinking Expertise</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2008). Often, you need to learn the ‘language’ of other professionals to be able to collaborate, even if you are not supposed to be able to do their work. I see this as a main challenge in the heritage profession, as it touches upon so many dimensions of life. This leads me to an interest in the development of multi-perspective metadata.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I joined the Europeana Network Association (ENA) to help grow the Europeana Initiative, as I strongly believe the European Union needs large digital platforms of its own. I like the democratic nature of the Network, and see the Members Council as a sort of parliament representing the thousands of members. This gives real 'clout'&nbsp;to the Europeana Initiative and is, in my opinion, one of its main assets. I strongly encourage other members to come forward and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/come-forward-in-the-europeana-network-association-members-council-elections\">stand for election to the Members Council</a>!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While my tenure is reaching an end, I was happy to contribute, in the last two Management Boards, to the development of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/communities\">ENA communities,</a> making sure there is some funding available for the much needed voluntary work contributed by ENA members. My heart goes out to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-education\">Education</a>, as it holds the key to any sustainability effort. My dream is that every schoolchild in Europe has the chance to discover Europeana at least once in their curriculum!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You are on the Europeana Education Community Steering Group; as we focus on educational activities this month on Europeana Pro, can you tell us what the community has been up to recently?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is so much to tell! We were delighted to launch <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/built-with-bits-designing-virtual-spaces-for-the-future\">Built with Bits</a>, through which educators can learn how to contribute to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a> movement by taking part in a mentoring programme and educational challenge to design beautiful and sustainable spaces with Mozilla Hubs. There is an <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/built-with-bits-kick-off-workshop-tickets-168263186721\">introductory workshop</a> open to anyone on 30 September for those who want to know more about the project with a great panel of European commision representatives and experts on immersive technologies for education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/audiovisual-material-in-europeana-classroom\">Audiovisual Task Force</a> which ran last school year, led by EUScreen, will also soon publish a White Paper on Audiovisual Material, and we hope to kick off a Task Force on newspapers in education in collaboration with EuropeanaTech Community members in the coming months!</p>\r\n"

The project aimed to support European cultural institutions to give digital access to 10,000 new objects related to Chinese heritage. It envisaged the enrichment of 20,000 Europeana objects by using Linked Open Data Vocabularies and of 2,000 records through crowdsourcing via the <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en\">CrowdHeritage </a>platform. The project also committed to creating editorials for Europeana, presenting a travelling physical exhibition, a collection day and a conference. Finally, one of the tasks entailed traveling to China to establish new collaborations in support of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-china\">Europeana China initiative</a>, launched in 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All that was on the menu at the beginning of the project early April 2020. A few weeks later, the COVID-19 crisis forced the project to recalibrate and devise new ways of engaging content providers and target audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rising to the occasion with reimagined events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because of travel restrictions, all physical events for the project were put on hold and eventually cancelled. Initially a hybrid approach was considered but by late 2020 the crisis forced the project consortium to re-tune to the digital realm, which resulted in the ‘<a href=\"https://photoconsortium.net/pagode/festival/\">PAGODE Digital Festival</a>’. This programme of online events was coordinated by Photoconsortium with collaboration of PAGODE partners and <a href=\"https://fashionheritage.eu/\">EFHA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project's&nbsp;final conference was also transformed into a two-day online programme of keynote speeches, presentations and collection showcases, while the physical exhibition was reimagined as a hybrid concept entailing <a href=\"https://photoconsortium.net/pagode/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-PAGODE-book-september-2021.pdf\">a catalogue in printed book form</a> as a companion piece to the Europeana exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/china-in-perspective\">China in perspective</a> (21 September 2021).</p>\r\n"

The project gathered around <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/search?page=1&amp;view=grid&amp;query=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%2APAGODE%2A\">16,000 items</a> from 11 content providers (as opposed to the 10,000 items envisaged initially), digitised at top quality standards and at the highest Tier of the Europeana Publishing Framework. These new collections fed into 21&nbsp;published pieces of editorial and 22 browse discovery points on the Europeana website,&nbsp;many more than the 10 originally planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of the continuous dialogue with Europeana <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/chinese-heritage\">a feature page </a>was established to showcase these items, hosting both the entity collection on ‘China’ and all editorial produced within the project. This page is a substantial legacy that hopefully will serve as a jumping board for more ventures into Chinese cultural heritage. The PAGODE project partners have also provided new blogs and galleries to be published after the end of the project term, and added additional browse discovery points to keep the Chinese heritage page and other pages on the Europeana website updated after the end of the project.</p>\r\n"

Building on their work on a semantic and conceptual framework for Chinese heritage in Europe, the University of Ljubljana then compiled lists of keywords. These were used for creating metadata, for extracting metadata properties from existing collections, adding information via AI and automated semantic enrichments (c. 22,000 records), and executing three annotation campaigns (<a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/china\">Scenes and people from China</a>, <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/artefacts\">Artefacts</a>, <a href=\"https://crowdheritage.eu/en/summer-pagode\">Summer sprint</a> - c. 4,000 records).&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />This means that people using Europeana will be able to more easily explore and find more information about the objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, PAGODE fulfilled its promise to guide China-related content towards existing Europeana thematic pages, by identifying cross-over opportunities and providing a set of topics and collections for future blogs, galleries and exhibitions. Through these efforts, PAGODE has been exemplary in furthering the diversity of collections on Europeana, on the path to a more inclusive cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

During the events, people with different language levels work together to create and add subtitles to archival media clips provided by various European collections available on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en\">t</a>he <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana website</a> and <a href=\"https://www.euscreen.eu/\">Euscreen.eu</a>. These events can take place in person or online and are facilitated through the <a href=\"https://subtitleathon.eu/\">subtitleathon.eu</a> platform, which was created as part of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-xx\">Europeana XX - Century of Change</a> project and uses technology from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-media\">Europeana Media</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-subtitled\">Europeana Subtitled</a> projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For cultural heritage professionals and language teachers working in formal or non-formal education, Subtitle-a-thons can be a fun and participatory way to engage students with audiovisual heritage. Find out more about how Europeana and EUscreen are working together to make audiovisual content fit for education through <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/599539201\">this video</a>, and follow the steps to run a Subtitle-a-thon below!</p>\r\n"

They can offer support, answer questions and help plan your event. Setting up your challenge is free, and you can also find more information from platform administrators <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/contactus/\">Noterik</a> or the <a href=\"https://subtitleathon.eu/\">Subtitle-a-thon website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Plan the challenge</strong>. When planning a Subtitle-a-thon challenge as an educator, keep in mind your learning goals and the age of your audiences. This will help you to have an engaging event with a rewarding outcome.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Curate your own audiovisual collection for participants to work with</strong>. Depending on your goals, you will have to select the clips that you want to be subtitled during your Subtitle-a-thon challenge. You can curate your collection by creating your own <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/en/how-to-create-and-use-a-europeana-account\">Europeana account</a> and using the gallery feature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Choose your clips and languages for the challenge</strong>. Don’t forget to select clips in the languages that you and your participants will be able to translate. From French to English, Dutch to German, Turkish to English -&nbsp; make sure you decide on the languages of subtitles. You or someone from your team needs to be able to check the quality of the new subtitles in order to select a winner.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Keep it sweet and short</strong>. We advise you to select short videos to be subtitled (five minutes at maximum). Keep in mind that short and entertaining videos are also more fun to work with! Try to avoid clips with literary texts like poems or songs - these tend to be trickier to translate. Make sure you have at least five clips available per person.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Set up the event</strong>. Whether the Subtitle-a-thon takes place online or in-person, we recommend having up to 40 participants per challenge. Hosting shorter online events is also advisable, from two days up to one week.&nbsp; For onsite challenges, we recommend a one day event. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/events-toolkit\">Europeana Events Toolkit</a> offers tips on how to run an online event. Whether you are setting up an online or in person event, you will use the&nbsp; <a href=\"https://subtitleathon.eu/\">subtitleathon.eu</a> platform which offers a specialised <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-media-rolling-out-the-new-audiovisual-player\">AV player</a> for participants to add subtitles to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Set the rules.</strong> Set clear and concise rules and remember to share these with all the participants at the start of the event. Be clear about the duration of the event, eligible languages, registration rules and timeline and who can take part. Have an open communication channel - email or messenger -&nbsp; throughout the event in case participants have questions or comments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Set up a review procedure</strong>. In your group there should be a team of language experts willing and able to verify the quality of the subtitles. That’s why it is so important to select the languages of the subtitles beforehand. You want to make sure you have the right knowledge at the organisers’ table.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Hold an opening session</strong>. Start your Subtitle-a-thon with a bang! An opening session serves to clarify any questions or comments. Preparing an agenda with the following points: introduction to the subtitle-a-thon format; explanation of the rules (including gamification, copyright, etc); live <a href=\"https://subtitleathon.eu/subtitle-editor/\">tutorial</a> on the use of the website; some subtitling tips, Q&amp;A session.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Gamification</strong>. Not all Subtitle-a-thons challenges have to be competitions but having rewards will incentivise the participants. Provide certificates of participation for every participant and a certificate of recognition to winners of the event. Awarding a prize - no matter how small - to participants who subtitled more content is also a nice touch when possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Have fun!</strong> The Subtitle-a-thons challenges are meant to raise awareness about the value of multilingual access to audiovisual archival footage and improve your language skills in a fun and innovative way. The events are not intended to compete with or replace professional level translation. So don’t forget to enjoy yourself and have fun!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Review the submissions</strong>. You’ve already set up a group of reviewers (see step eight) and now is their turn to validate the subtitles. This may take a while, depending on the number of participants involved in the challenge, so give yourself and your team space for this work. Once ready, please get back in touch with <a href=\"https://www.noterik.nl/contactus/\">Noterik</a>, the platform administrators.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Announce the winners</strong>. All the hard work should be acknowledged and rewarded. This is the moment to announce those who contributed most to the challenge. Make sure you let them shine!</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Keen to get started?

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>About the WEAVE project</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Generic Services project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/weave-widen-european-access-to-cultural-communities-via-europeana\">WEAVE - Widen European Access to Cultural Communities via Europeana</a> - will work to provide guidelines for linking and presenting this relationship, and support efforts to make the rich cultural heritage of different cultural communities more accessible by helping them to share their content with Europeana. Under the project, some communities and organisations will work with Europeana for the first time - including the Roma community represented by ERIAC, traditional Portuguese dance groups, represented by PEDEXUMBO, and the tourism destination management organisations of Slovenia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By supporting efforts to make the cultural heritage of these communities more accessible and providing a framework for future communities to use as well, WEAVE will help to preserve the richness of European identity and work towards a more inclusive representation of cultural diversity in content hosted on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project will also support activities which build capacity for cultural heritage institutions, SMEs, cultural communities and Europeana to work together by creating the WEAVE Toolkit, which will employ a mix of AI, machine learning, natural language processing, big data analysis and innovative interface engineering. It will allow the management of annotations, semi-automatic recognition of specific gestures and movements and visualisation of performances and 3D models. WEAVE aims to use the WEAVE Toolkit to support CHIs to promote collections that may otherwise remain hidden, in educational and destination tourism contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, the project partners will engage Europeana audiences with tangible and intangible stories and editorials from cultural communities on the Europeana website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Events to support cultural heritage institutions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Between October 2021 and January 2022, the WEAVE project will host <a href=\"https://weave-culture.eu/labdays/\">11 LabDays</a>, collaborative workshops where participants can learn, reflect and share through an open dialogue between presenters and participants. These events are for professionals working in and around cultural heritage, especially those who work at institutions that have cultural heritage content or collections relating to groups that are historically repressed, underrepresented, disenfranchised, and disempowered. The LabDays will cover a range of topics, bringing together discussions around digital technologies and 3D modelling, innovative solutions and inspiring practices for cultural and minoritised communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February 2022, there will also be a series of three Europeana WEAVE Cafés for cultural heritage professionals on the topics of diversity and inclusion. These sessions will provide an opportunity for participants to get a better understanding and inspire each other on how cultural institutions can support more diverse and inclusive practices. These sessions will be carefully planned and moderated by WEAVE partners with the support of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-europeana-foundation-diversity-and-inclusion-cross-team\">Europeana Foundation Diversity Inclusion Cross-Team</a> to facilitate a safe space for conversations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rosemary (Rosa) Cisneros, who is leading capacity building activities for the WEAVE project, says, 'These sessions will provide an opportunity to the participants to get a better understanding and inspire each other on how cultural institutions can support a more diverse and inclusive sector as well as giving cultural communities and minoritised communities a voice in the cultural sector.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll be announcing the dates of the Europeana WEAVE cafes through social media soon. So keep an eye out there and on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">European Events page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Join the next LabDay</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />We’re excited to announce the next <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-labday\">LabDay</a>&nbsp;in our series will take place on 18 October 2021, and will offer cultural heritage professionals the opportunity to learn more about working with Europeana, exploring how institutions can open their collections through Europeana so that they can be shared with wider audiences and enhance access to diverse content. The event will also touch upon Europeana’s efforts to be more inclusive and diverse in its approach to heritage collections, and encourage cultural heritage professionals to learn more about how WEAVE is supporting the representation of historically marginalised and underrepresented groups in Europeana.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>About the report&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the goals of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/indices\">inDICEs project</a> is to understand how value is being created through the use of digital heritage resources. Knowing more about this value will help us to advocate for policies that support the development of new or improved services, initiatives and products that create even more impact through their added cultural, social and economic value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of this, we are developing policy recommendations, guidelines, how-to's and other tools to support systemic changes that strengthen the potential of cultural heritage institutions. We have recently worked on&nbsp;a<a href=\"https://www.zenodo.org/record/5140001#.YU2lnn0wiUl\"> Policy analysis of value chains for Culture Heritage Institutions in the Digital Single Market</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the report, we wanted to take the changing social and economic role and responsibilities of cultural heritage institutions, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, into consideration. We decided to look at the culture heritage sector in the context of the impact it has on other sectors. We based the report on case studies analysis of the (re)use of digital cultural heritage to foster understanding of current business models of interaction between culture heritage institutions and creative industries and how such models can reinforce access to culture and European identity. You can check out our<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c1y0qdk2BGlOMcARFeXR3iS9FmD7N8VYFYgsohkRAEU/edit#gid=1486439956\"> open spreadsheet with case studies collected</a> and contribute to it!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Findings and recommendations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We emerged with a number of recommendations which can help&nbsp;cultural heritage institutions to make strategic decisions&nbsp;to increase their positive contributions to the creative industries and reinforce access to culture. Below you can read the key points from the summary of the report (p.15 - 19) and access it in full!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Quality-focused approach in the cultural heritage sector&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digitisation of cultural heritage remains a significant issue for the whole cultural heritage sector. It is essential that while increasing the volume of digitised heritage, cultural heritage institutions also become more vigilant about the quality of the digitised content and its copyright.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a growing demand from various stakeholders (including educators, researchers, cultural and creative sector, IT) for rich metadata and high-quality digital items, allowing for their use and reuse within the context of both cultural heritage and other sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Museums as market reuse facilitators and promoters&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our research showed that museums are the most active (if not to say dominant) actors in executing reuse projects. However, they may be reluctant to collaborate with other sectors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We suggest developing ‘regranting’ schemes that would make use of the experience and expertise of museums in order to encourage and support reuse outside of the institutional context. This would, for example, see&nbsp;museums and other cultural heritage institutions as the operators of open calls targeted (mostly but not exclusively) at firms operating within the creative sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Promoting collaborative reuse of digital cultural heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As well as promoting the reuse of&nbsp;digital cultural resources (both content and data) among other sectors it is also crucial&nbsp; to promote and encourage cross-sectoral collaboration on the reuse of digital cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of conducting digital projects in the model where an institution hires a contractor (such as a software developer), it would be beneficial to encourage a more collaborative approach where projects are developed in even closer partnerships. Initiatives such as collaborative labs, hackathons and incubation projects could be a way to stimulate such collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital transformation with the help of digital cultural heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ongoing policy debates on the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data\">European strategy for data</a> and related issues of data governance need to include digital heritage, considered as a specific type of data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the European data strategy, a digital heritage data space is needed to fully support the development of modern data access, sharing and use practices in the cultural heritage sector, other public sectors (such as education or research), and creative and cultural sectors (both public and commercial).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Shared platforms and innovative tools to reach audiences faster&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While many institutions across Europe invest time and effort to bring their collections online, this does not always go hand in hand with raising audience awareness about what is actually offered online and how it can be used.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although aggregators have been around for some time now, many institutions still publish their collections using solely (or primarily) their own websites/platforms, meaning that they are not yet capitalising on the opportunity to bring their content to much wider audiences. This underlines the importance of platforms such as Europeana that give the global audience an easy-to-use tool to browse Europe’s heritage collections, discover new institutions and reuse their content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital cultural heritage has educational value</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remote education during the pandemic has created opportunities for much greater use of digital resources, including cultural heritage. In a study conducted by Centrum Cyfrowe in September 2020 in Poland, 35% of teachers said that while teaching remotely, they had used resources from cultural heritage institutions – making them one of the top five most used sources of educational content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This requires dedicated programs that support the reuse of cultural heritage collections by educators, educational systems and institutions, or educational start-ups.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Heritage in Motion is a multimedia competition for the creators and users of films, games, apps and websites on themes related to Europe’s heritage, cultural and natural, tangible and intangible. This year’s winners were revealed on 22 September on <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/european-heritage-summit/\">Europa Nostra’s livestream</a>, from the Doge’s Palace in the World Heritage City of Venice, Italy, as part of the European Cultural Heritage Summit programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prizes were awarded in four categories, with a further two projects celebrated with special mentions, and the top accolade of Best Achievement Award given to one of the category winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year’s award-winning projects take advantage of innovative technology - from video and games to artificial intelligence, augmented reality and machine-learning - combined with creative reimaginings of what might seem familiar to create something new and exciting. They all push the boundaries of the experiences we can create and share with digital culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Best Achievement Award, and winner of the ‘Games and interactive experiences’ category, was <a href=\"https://heritageinmotion.eu/himedition/submissions-2021?category=interactive\">Casa Batlló 10D Experience</a> - an immersive experience covering 2,000 square metres. The Gaudí Dôme introduces visitors to the genius of Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí via more than 1,000 screens. And the Gaudí Cube - a six-sided LED cube - takes the visitor into the mind of Gaudí through the work of digital artist Refik Anadol. All with a soundtrack and audio story in 15 languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJs4k8sQe4c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eleanor Kenny, Head of Communications and External Relations at the Europeana Foundation was part of the jury. Reflecting on the overall winner, she says, ‘Casa Batlló is a worthy overall winner. It is an exciting and inspiring project in its imagination and its ambition for how digital can be used to share and promote cultural heritage. What is particularly wonderful is that it focuses on the individual experience, creating something unique for each visitor. I cannot wait to experience Casa Batlló in person.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The quality of the submissions across all categories this year was so impressive. I was also very drawn to work of the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/embed-redirect/465143508?embedded=true&amp;source=video_title&amp;owner=1114429\">Carrickmacross Workhouse</a> in the film and video category. It is a very powerful, evocative and modern storytelling of the Irish potato famine - an important historical period that is not widely enough known.’ says Eleanor.</p>\r\n"

These approaches are not without challenges but that is why this category of awards is so important - by showing what is possible, others will be inspired to follow and even go further. This provides new opportunities for society to relate to our shared heritage,&nbsp; and helps reinforce the sector’s continued relevance in this digital era.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Europeana Conference is one of the the leading events of the year for those who work in, with and around digital cultural heritage in Europe, and this year will be no exception. Europeana 2021 aims to raise voices from across the sector to empower digital transformation and explore the role digital cultural heritage plays in today and tomorrow’s world. It will inspire and support the sector as it looks to recover, rebuild and grow in a post-pandemic world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference will cover themes key to the future of digital cultural heritage - and our world as a whole. Sessions and speakers at the conference will explore the digital public sphere and data spaces, participation, diversity and inclusion, collaboration, climate action, and more as we equip participants with new knowledge, skills and connections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A conference by and for you&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are delighted that, following the success of last year’s conference, 70% of the programme will be populated with sessions submitted by professionals across the sector through our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/submit-your-proposal-for-europeana-2021\">call for proposals</a>. The program is being coordinated by a program committee made up of representatives from the Europeana Network Association, Europeana Aggregators Forum and Europeana Foundation, including representatives from diversity and inclusion, climate action and new professionals working groups and task forces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The direction will be set each morning of the conference through an inspiring keynote and panel session from experts across the sector. Day one will shine a light on discussions on Europe’s digital future and what it might mean for digital cultural heritage. Day two will explore what sustainable digital transformation might mean for our future, and day three will address how technology can drive social change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Afternoon parallel sessions of presentations, workshops, lightning talks and training will shine a light on key topics throughout the sector and offer an opportunity to interact with, learn from and share your knowledge with your peers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our full programme has now been announced. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/post/announcing-our-programme-for-europeana-2021\">Find out more about it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Designed for digital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 will once again be an online conference, allowing you to join from wherever you are in the world. We’re building a designed for digital conference which will allow you to build your own programme and attend the sessions that interest you the most. Learning from last year, we’re giving you longer breaks between the morning and afternoon sessions and we’ll be experimenting with a new social platform to enhance your online experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are looking forward to seeing both regulars at Europeana events and those new to the sector at the conference - join us to connect with an engaged and innovative audience!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Secure your free place now</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is free and easy to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2021-tickets-181607050577\">book your place</a> for Europeana 2021.

                body: "<h3>Why is a digital public space an important topic for the cultural heritage sector?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital space is integral to how we all live today.&nbsp; It’s often where we find ourselves working, playing and coming together. It is as much a part of our daily life as our physical surroundings, and increasingly it’s also how we use and experience those physical spaces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How the cultural heritage sector works, shares and connects with its communities within that digital space is important, because access to cultural heritage is vital to society - to our knowledge and understanding of who we are, where we've come from and what we can become.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital space, and digital technologies, can help to democratise that access in ways that promote inclusivity, creativity, critical engagement, education and knowledge-sharing. All of which are essential to empowering people and creating fairer societies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we need to make sure that our digital space can foster these types of goals and activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the digital space isn’t always a positive environment. I think we can all, whether as citizens, professionals or public organisations, recognise that we have become increasingly reliant on the services of a small number of for-profit media platforms and there is an ongoing discussion on issues such as trust, privacy, bias and fake news.&nbsp; There is a growing call for an open, trusted environment and for alternative platforms - for a value-led approach to shaping that digital space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a sector, we need to be part of these conversations and hopefully part of the solutions too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What activities is Europeana undertaking in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Commission has set out a vision for digital in Europe in which citizens, public institutions and the commercial sector alike can all make full use of and benefit from digital opportunities and technologies. The hope is that this will be Europe’s ‘Digital Decade’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The path to that vision includes the digital transformation of businesses and public services but it also introduces the idea of digital citizenship - making sure that the same rights that apply offline also apply in the digital space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help make that happen, the Commission is proposing and consulting on a number of 'Digital Principles', based on existing offline rights. Proposed principles include universal access to internet services, a secure and trusted online environment, universal digital education and skills, and access to digital devices, systems and services that respect the climate and environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Foundation, Network Association and Aggregators’ Forum prepared and submitted <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/consultation-on-a-declaration-of-digital-principles\">a joint statement in response to the Commission's Digital Principles consultation</a> this summer. And we encouraged the Network and the wider sector to respond too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our joint response broadly supported the Commission’s proposals but with two important&nbsp; additions - we proposed that there should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Universal access to cultural heritage online</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">An expansion to the principle of a secure online environment to an open, decentralised and trusted European digital public space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

                body: "<p>We’ve also seen the introduction of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">New European Bauhaus</a> by the European Commission - a major value-led policy initiative to support its ambitions for a greener society that aims to create spaces that are beautiful, sustainable and inclusive.&nbsp; When you listen to how the European Commission describes its vision for this approach, it is clear that cultural heritage and digital cultural heritage have an important role to play in realising it. They talk of common spaces of work and leisure, of bridging art and culture on one side and science and technology on the other, of involving the whole of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the summer, Europeana promoted the Commission’s call for ideas on what the New European Bauhaus could look like in practice, and provided opportunities for conversation about the role cultural heritage can play through our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus#reflections-from-europeana-cafes\">Europeana Cafe series</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus#interviews\">interviews with cultural professionals and heritage advocates</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;What we do next will be important. It will be up to us as a sector to make sure that we go beyond discussion and actually make that contribution that digital cultural heritage offers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who do you look to for best practice and inspiration in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our sector is a constant source of inspiration to me.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our work on the New European Bauhaus, we’ve developed <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/new-european-bauhaus\">a dedicated space on Europeana Pro</a> to share information and highlight developments around the initiative. The page shares examples of how our cultural institutions are already using digital cultural heritage to help shape a more open, inclusive and sustainable society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That ranges from projects creating enriching and inclusive social experiences to contributing to accessible, welcoming spaces, and to thoughts on how as a sector we can help create a greener, more sustainable world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It includes examples of innovative collaboration with other sectors such as education and smart cities, and perspectives from people across our Network. I’d really suggest visiting the page - it is inspirational!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Update&nbsp;August 2022:&nbsp;Building a common European data space for cultural heritage is the central theme for the Europeana 2022 conference, Making Digital Culture Count.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The global COVID-19 pandemic stopped many of the activities which the <a href=\"http://www.horniman.ac.uk\">Horniman Museum and Gardens</a>&nbsp;had planned for 2020, when, like many cultural organisations, we had to close to visitors. But behind these closed doors our work continued, based on the priorities of our <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/story/resetting-the-agenda-for-the-hornimans-future/\">Reset Agenda</a>, which seeks to address long-standing issues of racism and discrimination within our history and collections and attract a more inclusive audience and workforce that better reflect the diversity of the London population.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More than a year later, we have seen Black History foregrounded in our permanent gallery, our temporary exhibition space, our performance venues and our online spaces. Explore details of our 2021 programme - which spans a multitude of stories, including pre-colonial and colonial African history, and more recent Black British history - below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Displays and exhibitions - Nigeria60, a collaborative perspective&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/event/nigeria60/\">Nigeria60</a> display should have opened during Black History Month last year, to mark the 60th anniversary of Nigerian Independence on 1 October 2020. The display sits at the heart of our World Gallery, and finally opened in May 2021, when the museum reopened to the public. Created in collaboration with designer and artist Alafuro Sikoki-Coleman, the display features the Horniman’s collection from 1960s Nigeria, and objects collected by Sikoki-Coleman from the same period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is part of a <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/project/nigeria60/\">wider conversation at the Horniman</a> focusing on the way memories of Nigerian independence are imprinted in the present through objects, images, and words. This conversation continued throughout the pandemic in the form of Instagram discussions, supported by <a href=\"https://www.artfund.org\">Art Fund</a>, around photographs of Nigerians in Nigeria and the UK in the 1960s, led by Oluseyi Awolesi, in conversation with historians Amanda Kirby Okoye and Emeka Keazor, poet Yomi Sode, and ASIRI Magazine; a series of online conversations between Dr Yewande Okuleye and influential Nigerians who work with Nigerian culture and heritage, focusing on poetry, music, art, theatre and food; and conversations about the future of the Nigerian collections at the Horniman, linking with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/project/rethinking-relationships/\">Rethinking Relationships project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Senior Curator of Anthropology Johanna Zetterstrom-Sharp, says: ‘Nigerian independence could never be represented by the museum alone. This was an opportunity to collaborate with and learn from a range of transnational Nigerian artists, researchers and creatives to develop an exciting programme of conversations about independence 60 years on, in the gallery and online.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Podcasts to engage audiences with Black History</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to this work, <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/project/community-action-research-african-and-caribbean-collections/\">The Community Action Research: African and Caribbean Collections (CAR) project</a> supported members of diaspora communities to investigate the Horniman collections. Project lead JC Niala says: ‘Originally conceived as an in-person project, CAR was adapted due to lockdown and ran as a virtual project instead. But in fact this proved to be an advantage. It allowed us to reach people who might otherwise not have been able to be involved – so it’s fitting to share the outcomes now, in a podcast which can be listened to from anywhere in the world’.</p>\r\n"

Each episode gives a fresh perspective on African histories through objects at the Horniman – including masks and musical instruments, cigarette cards and coffee pots, and many more. The overarching theme of the series is movement, with episodes focusing on trade, religion and technology. Listeners (we’ve reached people in 31 countries, and on every continent bar Antarctica) hear about a host of subjects from Mpingo wood to milk technologies, and people such as King Solomon and Stormzy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In creating Afro Historyscapes, JC Niala&nbsp;gratefully acknowledges the support provided by the Joint BME Events and Activities scheme administered by the Social History Society in partnership with Economic History Society, History UK, History of Education Society (UK), History Workshop Journal, Royal Historical&nbsp;Society, Society for the Study of Labour History and Women's History Network.​</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The 696 season - live music and the role of public spaces in sharing culture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/series/696/\">696 season</a> has brought us almost full circle to a taste of pre-COVID life, with a return to live music – albeit with restricted numbers and safety measures in place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The festival took its name from the Metropolitan Police Risk Assessment Form 696, which made it harder for London music venues to put on Black music events. For the Horniman, the 696 season of sell-out live performances, residencies, installations and events was about platforming this music. As Music Curator Adem Holness says, ‘so often, it can feel like our music, creativity, and culture aren't welcome in spaces funded by public money. I hope people see the festival and know that they are more than welcome at the Horniman’.</p>\r\n"

Dance Can’t Nice, by artist Naeem Dxvis, explores the relationship between Black British music and physical space, and includes a video installation produced by D/deaf rapper SignKid, looking at Black British music slang through British Sign Language.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Explore more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Visitors to the Horniman Museum and Gardens can enjoy Nigeria60 throughout Black History Month and beyond, and Dance Can’t Nice until 24 October. This will be followed by a new exhibition – Hair: Untold Stories, opening 4 December – which will also include Black people’s voices and experience, from wigs and weaves and the international hair trade to barbershops on the Horniman’s doorstep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are also ways to engage with our work online. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oAty1c6_Ay4\">Watch a film</a> about the 696 Festival at the Horniman, <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/tag/nigeria60/\">explore responses</a> to the conversations we’ve been having about Nigerian independence and listen to the 10 episodes of Afro Historyscapes <a href=\"https://www.horniman.ac.uk/story/afro-historyscapes-podcast/\">on the Horniman's website</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Between February and July 2021, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#steering-group\">Copyright Community Steering Group</a> ran a series of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-office-hours-supporting-each-other-with-copyright-challenges\">copyright office hours</a>. These sessions provided space for lively and engaging discussion and knowledge exchange on different facets of copyright, including open licensing, re-use, and digital cultural heritage. After reviewing the first run of these sessions and the feedback that we gathered from participants, the Steering Group is pleased to announce a second round of copyright office hours starting at the end of October 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike during the first series of office hours, sessions in this round will each focus on a specific topic. We hope that this will allow you to attend the sessions that most align with your needs and interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How it will work</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will set up a call approximately every six weeks. The conversations will be informal, and will not be recorded. The aim is to help each other by taking advantage of being part of such a broad network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will focus each call around a theme. The themes we are considering for the sessions include&nbsp;open licensing, education and learning, a post-Article 14 world, archival material, copyright exceptions, licensing for augmented reality and virtual reality, risk management approaches to rights clearance, social media and promotion and using copyright material for content creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can come with any type of questions that are relevant to you on the theme of the session, from the very specific to very broad. On each call, one or more members of the Copyright Community Steering Group will be there to moderate the discussions and share their thoughts, point you to relevant documentation or showcase examples. Others in the call might also have advice, and if not, we can try to find an answer together. In any case, please note that this will by no means constitute any legal advice. We will also aim to be joined at each session by one or more special guests who are particularly familiar with the selected theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first of this season’s copyright office hours took place at 1.00pm CEST on 25 October, on the theme of ‘open licensing’. It was hosted by Copyright Steering Group members Karin Glasemann and Fred Saunderson with special guests Brigitte Vézina and Camille Francoise from Creative Commons.&nbsp;The second session was on the theme of ‘copyright in education and learning’ and took place on November 30 at 5.00pm CET.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The remaining sessions will be held in 2022. Reminders will be sent via the Copyright Community Listserv and shared on our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanaIPR\">Twitter account</a>, and you can sign up for the following sessions below:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: dealing with different copyright durations, 1 March 2022</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: using copyright material for content creation, 16 March 2022</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: risk management approaches to rights clearance, 19 April 2022</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: licensing for AR &amp;, VR, June 28 at 5.00pm CEST&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: Archival material, July 19 at 1.00pm CEST</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: Social media and promotion, September 20 at 5.00pm CET</li>\r\n    <li>Policy office hours: A post-Article 14 world, October 25&nbsp;at 1.00pm CET&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: Copyright exceptions, November 22 at 5.00pm CET</li>\r\n    <li>Copyright office hours: Out of commerce works, December 13 at 1.00pm CET</li>\r\n    <li>Policy office hours:&nbsp;Best Practices in Creative Reuse for Immersive Experiences, December 20 at 5.00pm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are not a member of the Copyright Community, you are still very welcome to participate in the call. If you wish to join the community for more support and resources, you can do so <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-copyright#join-us\">here</a>.</p>\r\n"

You can read more about each of them and&nbsp;explore their profiles on the dedicated <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/members-council-election-candidates\">Elections page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The candidates work in a variety of areas (including academia, education, research and the creative industries), organisations (including cultural heritage institutions and nonprofits) and professions - you can find teachers, researchers, curators, archivists, librarians and aggregators amongst them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of them has put forward interests that they wish to work on and represent as Councillors: education, research, innovation and technical development, open data, copyright, policy, and impact. We are also pleased to see candidates with varied length of experience in the cultural heritage sector. This wide range of interests and expertise will allow us to select the very best representatives for the ENA members and leaders of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">Communities</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/task-forces\">Task Forces and Working Groups</a> for the coming three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The candidates have an opportunity to campaign and will be seeking your support from now until the elections kick-off during the ENA <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/ena-general-assembly-2021\">General Assembly meeting 2021</a> on 3 November. We invite you to follow their campaigns on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?lang=en\">Twitter</a> (under the hashtag #EuropeanaElects), as well as the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\">Europeana LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All ENA members who joined before October 2021 can vote in the elections, and you will receive an email with full details. If you would like to vote in future elections, as well as access a range of other benefits and the latest news in digital cultural heritage, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join the ENA today!</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once&nbsp;we launch the elections on 3 November, our members will have one week until 10 November to select up to 27 of their preferred candidates in the online voting. Additionally,&nbsp; members will vote on formal ENA documents such as the Annual and Financial Reports. The results of the Council elections will be announced on 12 November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We wish all the candidates the best of luck and look forward to the election of a dedicated Members Council to lead the ENA as it continues to evolve. You can see the candidates below and through our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/members-council-election-candidates\">Election page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Meet the candidates</strong></h3>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Tell us about Black Central Europe.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s my pleasure, and thank you for drawing attention to Black European histories. Put simply, <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/\">Black Central Europe</a> is a web resource dedicated to connecting people to histories of Blackness in the German-speaking lands over the past millennium. At the core of our work is an extensive and ever-growing collection of historical documents, images, and videos that chronicle experiences and ideas of Blackness, supplemented with mapping projects, teaching resources, and links to activist and artistic projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What approach underpins the work of Black Central Europe?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our starting point is understanding that there are a thousand years and more of Black history in the German lands, and most people know very little about it. By making this more visible and accessible, we can undermine exclusionary myths and open new perspectives on diverse histories of Germanness that connect the past with the present. Some may assume that this is just a project about and for Black Germans, Black Austrians, Black Swiss, Black Luxemburgers. Rather, it’s a project that counters the myth that these lands are and always have been monolithically white places disconnected from the wider world. By exploring often surprising histories of contact, mobility, inclusion and exclusion, we come to a better understanding of how residents of central Europe have always grappled with ideas of difference and commonality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What projects are you currently focusing on?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have three big projects underway. First, as always, we are working on filling out the historical collections. Our focus at the moment is the post-1945 period. We are fortunate to have been working with Philipp Khabo Koepsell and the Each One Teach One archive and empowerment project in Berlin, exploring <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1945-1989/beschuldugung-der-volksverhetzung-gegen-fasia-jansen-1970/\">familiar stories</a> in some depth and also revealing unknown or unexpected <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1945-1989/founding-a-black-information-center-in-berlin-1970/\">examples of Black activism and community-building</a>. We are also working to expand the collection to include more materials from outside Germany. For example, Patrick Edore, a PhD student at the University of Lincoln (UK), is generously sharing some of his research to help us better understand <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1989-today/the-marcus-omofuma-memorial-in-vienna-2003/\">developments in Austria</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Second, we are working to include ever more work from our university students. This project began as a way to support the teaching of new classes in Black German history, and it has always been important to have students engaged not just in learning but also in writing that history. Kira Thurman’s students at the University of Michigan have produced an <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/interactive-maps/\">interactive map</a> over a number of years, and this past year Kristin Kopp’s students at the University of Missouri put together an extensive <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/biographies/\">collection of Black German biographies</a>. Some of my students at University College London have produced <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1914-1945/black-gis-in-german-home-front-propaganda-1943-1944/\">entries on historical documents</a> that have been incorporated into our broader collection of sources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Third, we are looking to update the website to account for the changed context produced by the waves of activism awareness&nbsp;and artistic production since the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in this work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the most immediate sense, being able to post these materials online has meant making previously unknown or inaccessible stories available to broader communities around the world. In the first instance, this means instructors, but we’re gratified to hear from people who have stumbled across the site and found useful materials there. We have done some work with digital mapping and plan to explore this further. We could definitely do more on social media, and if anyone wants to share our materials on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or even - why not? - TikTok, we’d love it!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What were the biggest challenges that you encountered?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’d say there are two big ones. The first challenge is funding the website, which seems to fall in the cracks between the different sorts of projects that get supported by major funding agencies. We’ve been fortunate to have support from our home institutions, but this is in small doses, and that means the work has to proceed slowly and sometimes haphazardly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The other has been getting familiar with the technology and also working with copyright regulations. While our web platform (we use Wordpress) makes this relatively straightforward now, it hasn’t always been the case, and figuring out the principles of designing for the history web has been a steep (but enjoyable) learning curve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>From your experience, do people in Europe know about the history of the Black Diaspora in their countries, especially Germany?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the whole, there’s relatively little awareness of the grand sweep and diversity of Black histories in Europe, and that’s as true in Germany as it is elsewhere. There are historical reasons for this, much of it based on processes of active forgetting or erasing or marginalising that have served colonial and racist national myths. It is these that have been challenged by projects trying to either write Black people back into European histories or (I would argue, better) to re-write European histories altogether to account for those diverse experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role can heritage institutions play in teaching people about this?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heritage institutions can do a lot to support this work, and I think it’s a great thing that regular exhibitions are happening across Germany, supported by major museums and funding agencies (<a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1989-today/looking-back-exhibition-2017/\">see an example</a>). This simply wasn’t the case to this extent even a decade ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One thing that heritage organisations can do is undertake a project of critical self-reflection on their collections and past practices and do so publicly (<a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/addressing-the-histories-of-slavery-and-colonialism-at-the-national-trust\">see an example from the UK’s National Trust</a>). This is a useful way of interrogating an institution’s investment in exclusionary patterns but, more importantly, can offer visitors a model for how to have conversations about power dynamics, historical legacies of inclusion and exclusion and present responsibility. This is often uncomfortable, and it certainly can draw sharp criticism in the current political environment, but who is better placed than heritage institutions to show us how to come to grips with such complicated histories?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Heritage institutions, especially in Germany, can support this work by supporting the work of younger scholars, often People of Colour, who are doing excellent historical research in these areas but often struggle to gain purchase within academia. Larger heritage institutions can also partner with those organizations that already are working in these areas, for example <a href=\"https://domid.org/en/\">DOMiD</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eoto-archiv.de/\">Each One Teach One</a>, or the organisers of the <a href=\"http://www.dmsubm.de/\">Deutsches Museum für Schwarze Unterhaltung und Black Music</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you share with us a Black German figure who inspires you either from history or is still alive and why?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are so many whose stories both inspire and intrigue! If I had to pick one to highlight it would be the singer-songwriter-activist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xq7-kXylnVE\">Fasia Jansen</a> (1929-1997) . Growing up under the Nazis, she was repeatedly told that she was not really German because of her Blackness, despite being born in Hamburg and raised there by her German mother and stepfather, both committed Communists. She was forced to work as a cook in the Neuengamme concentration camp, but, as she remained a German citizen, she could leave after a year’s labour service. Her parents’ example, her own childhood experiences struggling against marginalisation and the distressing work in the camp helped forge a sense of justice that made her seek out opportunities for activism after the war, when she joined protest groups singing in the streets. She became a leader of the anti-nuclear and peace movements, was prominent in the women’s and labour movements and was an <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/sources/1945-1989/fasia-jansen-summoned-for-incitement-of-the-people-1970/\">assertive voice against fascism</a>. She remained a sharp critic of the Federal Republic, even when she was honoured with the Bundesverdienstkreuz for her activism in 1991.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond providing an example of courageous and forthright action for social justice, her story reminds us that Blackness and Germanness are not mutually exclusive categories, even when the state tries to say otherwise. She also shows us how Blackness can shape Black Germans’ experiences without determining the totality of their lives and perspectives. As such, she invites us to explore the range of Black experiences both in the present and in the past, to seek connections that cross presumed lines of race and nation that can help us draw entirely new maps of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can <a href=\"https://blackcentraleurope.com/\">explore Black Central Europe online</a> and get in touch at <a href=\"mailto:blackcentraleurope@gmail.com\">blackcentraleurope@gmail.com</a> with questions, materials and ideas for content or suggestions. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>How did you enter your profession?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have a degree in architecture and worked in planning and construction, but always more in terms of digital planning and control of building processes. I came to information infrastructures via a project on the integration of 3D models of architecture in digital libraries and eventually ended up in cultural heritage data. Building and art history was of course already part of my studies, but more at the level of content and always as a basis or for a better understanding of place and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Almost simultaneously with <a href=\"http://edoc.hu-berlin.de/18452/17520\">my doctorate in this field</a>, with a colleague I established the <a href=\"https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/open-science\">Open Science Lab at TIB</a> - German National Library of Science and Technology, where I now work. In an interdisciplinary team, <a href=\"https://vivo.tib.eu/fis/display/n0000-0002-3075-7640\">I carry out applied research and development</a> and acquire and supervise projects in the context of OpenGLAM. As a professor at <a href=\"https://f3.hs-hannover.de/en/\">Hannover University of Applied Sciences and Arts</a>, I also integrate students into my projects and communities and work to familiarise them with open cultural data, open knowledge in general and Wikidata at an early stage in subjects such as Semantic Web or Data Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My most important project at the moment is <a href=\"https://nfdi4culture.de\">NFDI4Culture - Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage</a>. This is currently the only major infrastructure project for non-textual research data in the humanities in Germany. The NFDI projects obviously have strong links to international initiatives such as the European Open Science Cloud EOSC, and NFDI4Culture in particular has <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e57036\">links with&nbsp;Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At TIB alone, we have six colleagues working on this project in a very dynamic team. They are a lot of fun to work with! For example, we aim to combine and extend existing FOSS tools for structuring and searching data with those for visualising and annotating 2D and 3D, so that they are really usable in both scientific contexts and for GLAM institutions. The development happens iteratively, openly and directly with the users and their data. Furthermore, I am involved in work for the Culture Knowledge Graph, which will integrate the data managed by NFDI4Culture on the semantic level and connect it to data offerings of other NFDI consortia as well as important international information infrastructures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's not easy if you want to deliver good teaching on the one hand and good research and development on the other. I know very few people who are really good at both, and if you then also have the ambition to open up your science; to communicate; to have your students generate usable output for the community as early as possible; and to always bring in enough new projects to ensure the continuity of the team - then you sometimes reach your limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But I can't imagine a nicer job, and I am really passionate about the content, especially of course all the projects and data that has to do with art and architecture, as I know the different users and developer communities very well. You have to understand the perspective of each player and what drives him or her (and what does not). I think I'm not bad at bringing teams together and giving individual members the support but also the autonomy they need to develop truly intrinsically motivated dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, it was curiosity about a large European community in my field and its developments and products. For my dissertation, for example, I had worked very intensively with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/metadata\">Europeana Data Model</a>. It's quite different whether you just use Europeana's services and let your students try things out, for example, or whether you are really part of it and can co-determine and collaboratively contribute to its development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Probably in my case the question should rather be what I have done, because after my two years in the Council I will not stand for election again due to time constraints. I was involved in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">3D Content in Europeana Task Force</a> and of course in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeanatech#steering-group\">EuropeanaTech Steering Group</a>, where I will continue to be involved. I think it is important not to hold on to positions but to make room for young colleagues who bring in more ideas. I believe this is also an important principle in the transformation of the academic system in terms of Open Science. And if I may take this opportunity to suggest a good successor: in the upcoming <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/2021-members-council-elections-presenting-the-candidates\">elections for the Members Council</a>, my esteemed colleague <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/rebecca-kahn\">Rebecca Kahn</a>, whom I was happy to support as a mentor in the <a href=\"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Deutschland/Open_Science_Fellows_Program\">Wikimedia Open Science Fellows Program</a>, is a candidate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network members will be able to vote for Council members from 3 - 10 November after the elections kick off at ENA General Assembly 2021 - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/ena-general-assembly-2021\">register now if you are a member</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you for speaking to us today! Can you tell us how Museum X came about and your aim to establish a Black British Museum in the UK?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sandra Shakespeare, Cheryl Bowen and I formed <a href=\"https://www.themuseumx.com/\">Museum X</a> as a CIC (community interest company) in March 2021. In the UK, a CIC is a company which can trade commercially, but reinvests its profits back into the community and not for shareholders. As a CIC, Museum X undertakes paid consultancy work as well as projects which further Black history, like the Museums Journal takeover in September/October 2021. Sandra began exploring a Black British Museum project in 2020, and we hope to begin work on this in earnest in the near future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Having a Black British Museum will be a big step in recognising Black British accomplishments throughout British history; would this be a first in Europe?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As far as I know this will be the first, but I am happy to be corrected on this fact! There is, of course, the wonderful Black Cultural Archives in the UK, which in itself was a major step in recognising the long and rich history of the African diaspora here. A Black British Museum would be able to build on and enhance this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of its aims in particular is to ensure that there is a physical space for permanent exhibitions. Over the past few years there have been some incredible exhibitions which have showcased Black culture and art; <em>No Colour Bar</em> at Guildhall (2015) and<em> Get Up Stand Up</em> at Somerset House (2019) are two examples of wonderful temporary exhibitions. We want to showcase this talent in permanent exhibitions in the physical Black British Museum space and online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What other projects are you currently focusing on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year has been very busy for Museum X! We have produced a takeover edition of the Museums Journal where we commissioned articles from across the UK, USA and Africa. We have also worked with English Heritage and we have conducted a research project for the Art Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us more about the Black History Month takeover of the Museums Journal and its importance?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We began working with the <a href=\"https://www.museumsassociation.org/\">Museums Association</a> in November 2020, after Sandra Shakespeare’s panel about the Black British Museum at the virtual Museums Association conference. The Museums Journal editorial team were fantastic and supportive throughout, and behaved like true allies. We were able to commission and edit all of the articles ourselves to shape an edition which truly reflected the experiences of ourselves and our contributors, and how we feel about our history. So often, the heritage of people of colour is mediated and repackaged by mainstream heritage institutions in a way that it loses its meaning and connections to its origins and uses. The Museum X takeover was an opportunity for us to speak about our heritage and what it means for ourselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does digital technology, practices or engagement have a role in this work?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For me, definitely yes. I am a great believer in the democratic potential of digital technology and the ability to reach audiences. The Museum X takeover of the Museums Journal is <a href=\"https://www.themuseumx.com/post/museums-journal-museum-x-takeover\">online</a> which means that all of our community can read it. We have also discussed a range of activities which Museum X could deliver online.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am also a Director of Brick by Brick Communities CIC. We have delivered a lot of wellbeing and creative activities and programmes online during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you share with us a Black British historical figure that inspires you and why?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are so many! Ignatius Sancho, Phillis Wheately, Lilian Bader – I could go on and on. But the most inspirational at this moment for me are the activists and publishers Eric and Jessica Huntley. From their bookshop during the 1960s, this couple established Boogle-L’Ouverture, which published and sold works about the African diaspora, history and culture, written by Black authors, which were unavailable for the Black community elsewhere. The Huntleys were activists and fought fearlessly for racial and political equality and continued to do this even after their bookshop was firebombed by fascists. The title of the biography written about them is <em>Doing Nothing is Not an Option</em>&nbsp;(Andrews, 2014). And that’s how it feels today as we continue to fight racism and oppression. Eric and Jessica Huntley are an inspiration to us all as we continue the struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What steps can cultural heritage institutions take to acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many things. Working with people of colour in the interpretation of Black history in their collections is a must, so that high level research can be undertaken to improve our understanding of items in collections which relate to the African diaspora. I am also now an evangelist for a new model of international research, that is partnerships between European institutions and university and heritage groups across the world; for example, one organisation that we have worked with recently commissioned research from Caribbean scholars when reinterpreting the trans-Atlantic slave trade. I believe that such additional perspectives are essential in telling the whole story of Black history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another step which would help in discovering and disseminating Black history in collections is cataloguing and metadata. It is impossible to search for what you don’t know exists! Ensuring that accurate and well-researched information is available on digital catalogues would also help enormously.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You reviewed Europeana’s Black Lives in Europe exhibition - could you tell us about your experience?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I was very honoured to be invited to review the Black Lives in Europe exhibition, and I also had the chance to see many works of art which were unknown to me. It was frustrating at times to read the way that some of the Black people were described in the metadata of the content. But it’s good to be part of the change!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reaching wider audiences</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage organisations&nbsp;across Europe are developing exhibitions both online and on-site to showcase their collections to audiences in their localities and beyond. The blogs on Europeana - which showcase the collections and stories related to physical exhibitions - have offered a way to share them with international audiences. This is a wonderful way to give this storytelling a digital legacy and wider reach through the Europeana website. We’ve now brought stories from exhibitions from countries across Europe to wider European audiences and showcased universal topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Anna Jansson at Nationalmuseum Sweden, it is important to highlight the portrait collection as part of Sweden’s core cultural heritage while also sharing it to a wider international audience. 'The benefit of sharing an exhibition digitally and explaining the theme in a blog is that we reach a wider audience with what is being produced in the cultural sphere of Sweden,' she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nicola Scott at the Scottish Maritime Museum says 'our museum is a national museum but we tell stories that link to places all over the world. The exhibition ‘Into the Maelstrom: The Scottish Kayak Expedition to North West Norway 1980’&nbsp;was one such, and sharing it with a wide audience beyond the reach of the physical exhibition was important to us.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engagement through digital storytelling</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than focus on the exhibitions themselves, these blogs aim to bring out stories through showcasing digitised collections, and in particular in 2021, the role of digital storytelling was important in both exhibitions. Nicola Scott says, 'telling a wider audience about the exhibition was really helpful during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the museum was open after lockdown, our footfall was still low and it was very sad to think we would not get as many people seeing the exhibition as we usually did. The exhibition was predominantly photos taken from the expedition - this translated well into being displayed online and really gave the Scottish Maritime Museum an opportunity to reach the wider audience the exhibition deserved.'&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nationalmuseum Sweden were also able to use the blog on Europeana to share their exhibition and collections more widely. Anna Jansson says 'we used the blog post on Europeana as an in depth-reading that we linked from our social media. When pushing to sites and exhibitions online outside our own website, which mostly is to prepare for a visit in real life, we provide the digital visitor with the possibility to discover even more heritage online'.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Share your own collections</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in sharing your physical exhibitions and work through an editorial collaboration with Europeana?

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>About Generic Services projects</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generic Services projects support cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation and aim to increase the amount of high-quality content and metadata provided to Europeana. Currently, there are<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/generic-services-projects\"> 12 running projects funded under four CEF Telecom calls</a> for a total of nine million euros. The majority of these projects (75% or nine projects) operate under the 2019 and 2020 Europeana Generic Services calls, whereas the remainder have been granted financing under the 2018 Public Open Data and 2020 eTranslation and eArchiving calls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of these projects contribute to Europeana’s strategic areas: infrastructure, data quality and capacity building. They also strengthen the connections to other digital services infrastructures, such as automated Translation and eArchiving, expanding Europeana’s interoperability, capacity and outreach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The projects aggregate millions of high-quality items and metadata to the Europeana website, including data in great demand (like 3D models, audiovisual records and enrichments). The projects also deliver innovative tools and services to extend infrastructure capabilities, particularly supporting multilinguality, 3D representation and automated enrichments. To ensure the successful adoption and long-term use of the above developments, the projects develop a wide array of multilingual online resources and capacity building activities to help cultural heritage professionals build up their skills and knowledge in these respective areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, the projects enhance the outreach to, and connections with, Europeana’s new and existing audiences through various editorials and events. Some of the projects engage with specialist (craftsmen) and minoritised (Roma) communities and support cultural heritage institutions in exploiting opportunities related to tourism and territorial development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An event to explore, share and connect&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In mid-October 2021, our online, two-day event brought together the professionals and experts working on Generic Services projects as well as&nbsp;the European Commission’s funding and executive bodies DG Connect and HaDEA. The event showcased the goals and achievements of the current Generic Services projects and also provided a forum to discuss common challenges, find synergies and strengthen connections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the first day of the event, running projects presented their work, while on the second, breakout sessions explored specific topics in depth. User engagement was on the agenda, with participants exploring how projects can work with Europeana to improve the discoverability, accessibility and multilinguality of the editorials. Key to supporting this work, data aggregation was also discussed, with participants showing great interest in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-metis-sandbox-or-finding-joy-in-working-with-data\">Metis Sandbox tool</a> as well as the potential of 3D content - and the challenges of its aggregation. Two sessions focusing on advanced technologies (including AI, enrichments, annotations and APIs) were the most popular. They featured guest mini-presentations on specific project developments and made clear the need and shared aspiration for continuous discussions and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the technical topics, two sessions also looked into impact and capacity building - key areas of work for Europeana. Participants explored how to embed a standardised approach to impact assessment in the early stages of the projects as well as how to make&nbsp;impact a central element of their capacity building planning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, to support participants in improving their project management practices,&nbsp;Kyriaki Tragouda, Project Officer at HaDEA, shared insightful information and tips around project reporting, management and validation. You can find out more about this by watching the video recordings of <a href=\"https://hadea.ec.europa.eu/programmes/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/beneficiaries-info-point_en\">HaDEA’s webinars</a> on grant agreement preparation and implementation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The value of the Generic Services projects was also highlighted by the European Commission. DG Connect representatives Katerina Moutogianni and Fulgencio Sanmartin, who oversee the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi\">Europeana DSI programme</a>, said, &nbsp;‘The Generic Services projects play a key role in achieving the strategic objectives for the Europeana DSI; therefore, the high quality of their results can’t be emphasised enough. We strongly encourage the closer collaboration between the projects and the Europeana Foundation to ensure best outcomes and their successful integration into the Europeana CSP [Core Service Platform] to the benefit of all’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Couldn’t attend the event or would like to refresh your impressions?

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Begin your day with inspiring keynotes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana 2021 will explore how the cultural heritage sector can recover, rebuild and grow in a post-pandemic world. Each day will begin with an address from a leading keynote speaker to inspire and inform your experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Wednesday 10 November, the conference will explore putting values at the heart of Europe's digital future. We are delighted to be joined by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/yvo-volman\">Yvo Volman</a>, acting Director of the Data directorate in the Directorate General for Communication Networks, Content and Technology of the European Commission,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/george-oates\">George Oates</a>, CEO &amp; Founder Museum in a Box, for keynote speeches, followed by a panel session and Q&amp;A. Attendees will get a deeper understanding of the Commission’s vision for a digital Europe and its ambitions for Europeana at the heart of the data space for cultural heritage. You will be able to listen to and engage in debate around what constitutes a healthy digital public space, explore how a ‘single market for data’ relates to an open and trusted digital public space, and the unique contribution that the heritage sector can make to a values-led digital agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Thursday 11 November, the focus will turn to ensuring sustainable digital transformation. As challenges from climate change through to the COVID-19 pandemic drive us to look again at the lasting impact of our action, the conference will explore how policy agendas and initiatives such as the Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus provide us with opportunities to collaborate across sectors. This can help us to share knowledge, create new experiences and use our digital transformation to contribute to a sustainable future for Europe. The day’s keynote address will be given by Secretary General of Europa Nostra, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sneska-quaedvlieg-mihailovic\">Sneška Quaedvlieg-Mihailović</a>, who will be joined afterwards by thought-leaders in the sector for a panel and Q&amp;A discussion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, on Friday 12 November, the conference will expand on using technology to drive social change. Together, we will explore how technology can help our sector understand and improve its offer to the people we serve, provide access to previously inaccessible information, democratise knowledge, connect with audiences&nbsp;and give voice to marginalised groups. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/pier-luigi-sacco\">Pier Luigi Sacco</a>, Professor of Cultural Economics, IULM University Milan, will give the final keynote address of the conference and then explore the topic further in a panel session and Q&amp;A following his speech.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Follow your interests in the afternoon sessions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">70% of the programme for Europeana 2021 - over 30 sessions - was co-created with cultural heritage professionals across the sector who responded to our call for proposals. In the afternoon, you can explore the rich results and join a variety of interactive and engaging presentations, workshops and activities. Learn how to measure your institution’s carbon footprint, get tips on how to boost engagement and participation with new technologies, explore leading examples of sectoral collaboration, learn about inclusive language - and much more! Whichever sessions you choose to join, prepare to be informed, inspired and access leading examples of digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join social and networking events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our conference wouldn’t be complete without the chance to meet people, make new connections and socialise. Our programme also offers an exciting range of social events, including a pub quiz, a #DigitalAperitivo - and even mindful origami! We will be using the online networking platform Gather.Town which we hope will support organic online discussions and interactions in our social space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Enjoy the digital experience&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have all learned many lessons about interacting online over the past year, and our conference is designed to give you the best possible digital experience. Both the days and sessions are shorter than they have been in our physical conferences, and we have included longer breaks between the morning and afternoon sessions to give you time and space to recharge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also excited that your online experience will be supported by noted moderator <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/anna-gumbau\">Anna Gumbau</a>, who will guide you through the three days of the conference, orienting our morning sessions and helping us to reflect and look back on the day’s activities. Anna is a freelance journalist covering EU affairs and climate change in Brussels, and a moderator with the collective Moderating.EU.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Build your own programme&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, as part of our designed for digital experience, we are using Sched as our online programme so that you can create your own programme and sign up for the sessions that interest you the most. If you already have a Europeana 2021 ticket, we’ve emailed you a link to Sched already. <strong>If you haven’t, <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2021-tickets-181607050577\">sign up now</a> to get access to the programme</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are confident that Europeana 2021 is going to be one of our best conferences yet, and whether you are a regular at Europeana events or completely new to the cultural heritage sector, we can’t wait to welcome you. See you there!</p>\r\n"

Their work results, for example, in reports, white papers and video interviews for the benefit of museums, libraries and archives in the process of their digital transformation. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research-grants-programme-2021-call\">2021 call</a> focused on crowdsourcing and research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, the proposals we received offered an enlightening overview of the variety of approaches to crowdsourcing alongside digital practices in Europe from the perspective of universities (46% of the proposals), cultural heritage institutions (24%) and research institutions (16%). We were delighted to award the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Estonian War Museum - General Laidoner Museum and the University of Warsaw&nbsp;a research grant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first half of 2022, Europeana Research will work in collaboration with these institutions to explore the value and reusability of data generated or enriched through crowdsourcing (also known as ‘crowdscience’), looking specifically at how this can then be used in research contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, Europeana Research awarded two special prizes which will support the creation of video tutorials designed to complement Digital Humanities courses in Higher Education. They will invite university students to experiment with digital resources, practices and tools. Find out more about these events and video tutorials below.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The winning projects</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, Germany: Anthropocenic objects. Collection practices for the ‘age of humankind’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project Leader: <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/about/team/elisabeth.heyne\">Dr. Elisabeth Heyne</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/about/team/ulrike.sturm\">Ulrike Sturm</a> und <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/about/team/elisa.herrmann\">Elisa Herrmann</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This proposal stems from theoretical discussions and practical work sessions on data from a current transdisciplinary European project at the natural history museums in Berlin and Paris <a href=\"https://www.museumfuernaturkunde.berlin/en/science/towards-a-collection-anthropocene\">(‘Towards the collection of&nbsp; the Anthropocene’</a>). Three workshops (digital and in person) will feature experts working on archives and cultural heritage collections, scholars focusing on the Anthropocene, and professionals working on digital and participatory practices. The workshops will address questions including: ‘what is an anthropocenic object?’ ‘How can it be collected and who collects (and owns) it?’ ‘How can it be stored and saved?’ ‘How could future collection practices and archives of the&nbsp; Anthropocene look like?’ while exploring the challenges of transdisciplinary, digital and participatory work with ‘anthropocenic objects’, both as natural and cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Estonian War Museum - General Laidoner Museum: Crowdsourcing for military heritage in Estonia</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project leader: <a href=\"https://www.etis.ee/CV/Mari-Leen_Tammela/eng\">Dr Mari-Leen Tammela</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is now easier than ever for individuals to contribute collectively through different web-based solutions, if such opportunities are provided. However museums are often cautious about starting crowdsourcing projects as they may not be familiar with how to run them, or be concerned that the ‘crowd’ does not have the appropriate skills. This project will address these concerns through four strands: analysis of the best crowdsourcing practices implemented in Estonian museums, a training event,&nbsp;development of crowdsourcing plans and a follow-up seminar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>University of Warsaw, Faculty of History: Cultural heritage data for crowdsourcing: Polish perspectives on the provision of geographical data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project leader: <a href=\"https://leibniz-ifl.de/en/institute-1/people/harvey-francis\">Professor Francis Harvey</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project will organise a research agenda-setting workshop which will bring together Polish institutions involved in collecting, curating, presenting and researching historical digital geographic data from digitised maps and other sources held by cultural heritage institutions. Historical mapped data, provided as geodata, can be used in a broad range of crowd-sourced, citizen-science and research activities, as well as in teaching and civic engagement. It is a central information resource to connect experiences and knowledge of the present with evidence of the past. The Spring 2022 workshop will stimulate discussions around four topics: crowdsourcing for cultural heritage; data infrastructure guidelines and best practices; institution perspectives;&nbsp; the way forward for cultural heritage geodata in Poland.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Special Prizes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>University Museums in Scotland: Teaching and learning online with digitised collections&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project leader: <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/contact/directors-team/dr-catherine-eagleton/\">Dr Catherine Eagleton</a> (University of St Andrews), in collaboration with&nbsp; <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kamila-oles\">Dr Kamila Oles</a> (University of St Andrews),&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/mariaeconomou/\">Professor Maria Economou</a> (University of Glasgow), <a href=\"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/geosciences/departments/archaeology/profiles/neil.curtis#about\">Neil Curtis</a> (Aberdeen University), and <a href=\"https://www.gsa.ac.uk/about-gsa/our-people/our-staff/w/waters,-susannah/\">Susannah Waters</a> (Glasgow School of Art).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to funding from the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council’s COVID-19 Urgency scheme, members of the University Museums in Scotland (UMIS) group are working together on the project: <a href=\"https://collectionteaching.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/\">Online teaching and learning with digitised collections in Higher Education contexts</a>. The research team is identifying best practice and case studies from the last two years, to understand what is currently possible, and what is needed next to support online teaching and learning with collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These tutorials will share the results of this one-year research project, so that the international GLAM sector can learn from its findings, and prepare for the post-pandemic future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital AV archives: The Webmuseum</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Project leader: <a href=\"http://mrezni-muzej.mg-lj.si/en/about-the-network/12/editorial/\">Ida Hiršenfelder</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These tutorials will be about knowledge transfer across institutional staff, especially in the case of wide-ranging digital projects. In them, an archivist at Museum of Modern Art plus Museum of Contemporary Art Metelkova (MG+MSUM), Ljubljana, Slovenia will focus on digital audiovisual archives, taking the <a href=\"http://mrezni-muzej.mg-lj.si/en/networkmuseum/\">Web Museum</a> as an example. The Web Museum is designed as a repository for storage and dissemination of digital audiovisual cultural heritage. It addresses the inventory, connection and networking of artistic practices based on media technologies. Its aim is to offer systemic assistance to non-governmental organisations by creating a common open source online interface for multiple users.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The dates and programmes of the in-person and digital events will be announced via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/about-us/events\">Europeana Pro events page</a>, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EurResearch\">Europeana Research Twitter</a> account and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">Europeana Research Community</a> discussion list. The outputs of the research grants and special prizes will be published on Europeana Pro. If you would like to be the first to hear about these, you are welcome to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-research\">join the Europeana Research Community</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you so much for speaking to us! What can you tell us about the history of the Black Archives?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Based in Amsterdam, The Black Archives is a historical archive with a unique collection of books, documents, photographs, audiovisual material and artifacts, which are the legacy of Black Dutch writers, scientists and activists. It documents the history of Black emancipation movements and individuals in the Netherlands. Currently, the archive consists of more than 10,000 items about the history of people of Surinamese or African descent in the Netherlands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We aim to inspire conversations, activities and literature from Black and other perspectives that are often overlooked elsewhere. The collections are intended as a starting point that can grow through donations and collaborations with others. In this way, Black literature, knowledge and information is made accessible for study and research. Based on these collections, we develop exhibitions, public programmes and other educational activities to share hidden and forgotten histories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For us, it is necessary to make Black (Dutch) history visible, as we want to share it from our perspective in a non-Eurocentric way. Our history is almost always written without us, rarely with us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What projects are you currently focusing on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At The Black Archives, we work on archiving, community work and social justice through various activities. Besides archiving, we use educational events and art as a way to share our findings and information. Currently, we are working on our exhibition ‘Facing Blackness’ to reflect on 10 years of peaceful demonstrations during the anti-zwarte piet movement which started in 2011. In our current anti-racism movement, the blackface character zwarte piet (‘Black Pete’) serves as a symbol in the fight against institutional racism in the Netherlands. We wanted to place the racist figure in a historical context of colonial imagery that has been (and still is) circulating in our societies for many centuries. Alongside our focus on racial imagery produced in the Netherlands and in other European countries, we will show the long tradition of resistance against zwarte piet and racism in the Netherlands, which is often forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does digital technology, practices or engagement have a role in this work? What&nbsp; challenges have you encountered finding, highlighting and digitising Black cultural heritage?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Definitely! Digital technology is key to conversations among archivists on how to sustainably archive cultural heritage. While The Black Archives has a physical space within the Surinamese historical building of Vereniging Ons Suriname (Association Our Suriname), which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2019, our collections are not completely digitised yet. Our biggest challenge is funding - archiving and digitising is another expensive component. However, we are aiming to digitise our collections to share hidden, forgotten and silenced histories from non-western perspectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you give us an example of a digital project you have worked on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We digitised many of the protest signs left by protesters during the 2020’s Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the Netherlands. An <a href=\"https://collection.theblackarchives.nl\">online collection of these signs</a> was established shortly after to archive an important moment in history and memorialise the protests and their wider socio-political contexts of 2020. The collection has a grassroots and community-based approach - people can make suggestions or corrections. On the same website, visitors are also able to search through&nbsp;and add donations of racist memorabilia and find more archived objects. This helps us to recognise how everyday items produce colonial structures. In order to execute an archiving project that is accessible and community-based, funding is crucial but still challenging. <a href=\"https://collection.theblackarchives.nl\">Explore the collection</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>From your perspective, what is the importance of digitising these materials in the Black Archives Amsterdam?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to make our histories available to our own community as well as wider society. From a young age, we noticed that we barely learned about what brought Surinamese (and other) communities to the Netherlands (from a critical perspective) in schools and universities. There is a large misunderstanding that migration and travelling was a one-way process and a phenomenon that is quite recent. However, there is a larger migration history between Europe and the rest of the world which involved colonialism, trade and oppression. We must know about the past to understand our current societies. Methods such as digitising help us to share knowledge and information, and have a better conversation about these topics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Have you also found that there is a disproportionate acknowledgment of Black&nbsp; women’s achievements and history represented in collections? If so, why do you think that is and have you also struggled with this in your collections?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In conversations on social justice and racism, we often forget how Black people and&nbsp; people of colour also experience multiple forms of discrimination such as transphobia,&nbsp;heterosexism and sexism, for instance. This translates into Black (trans/queer) women being ‘double (triple and more)’ silenced&nbsp;in various communities (see Claudia Jones’ theory of triple oppression). Given the hierarchical and social orders of current societies, even our archives are not immune to such structures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, if we don’t acknowledge the problem, there is no room to come up with solutions. At The Black Archives it is important to us to acknowledge that Black communities and communities of colour are rich in diversity, culture and intellectuality.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What steps can cultural heritage institutions take to acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If we don’t acknowledge the problem, there is no room for solutions. As cultural heritage institutions, it is important to understand that diverse organisations, teams, and collections provide a healthier and safer society for all. Changes must be structural, and structural&nbsp; changes need financial support. Within European countries, finances are often not a problem, but rather what we give priority to. Diversity is still much seen as a burden, rather than a long-term investment to make a better world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Patrick, you’re leading the Europeana Foundation’s internal ‘green team’, why do you think climate change is important for the cultural heritage sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Patrick</strong>: I think that climate change is an important topic for everyone. Everyone has a responsibility and the cultural heritage sector is no exception. In fact, the sector has an even bigger role since its goal is to inform people about culture, about things happening in the past that we can learn from. We need to learn from these climate changes as well. We need to understand how to deal with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Shadi, you’re collaborating with the new Europeana Network Association Climate Action Community as its community manager. Why do you think climate is an important topic for this sector?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shadi</strong>: Climate change has a direct, tangible effect on culture and cultural heritage sites, as well as social impacts related to poverty, inequality, loss of culture and identity. All of these will affect culture and heritage as a whole. The cultural sector has a responsibility in all social and humanity issues so this is no different.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What activities is Europeana undertaking in this area?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patrick</strong>: In April, the Europeana Foundation set up a ‘green team’. We are working to understand more about our carbon footprint with the aim of being able to take steps to reduce it.&nbsp;We plan to start compensating the emissions of the travel that staff undertake and have a policy of recommending staff take the train instead of flying if the travel distance is reasonable. We're also looking at digital services that we provide, for example, making sure that we don't let servers run unnecessarily if they're not used. We’re sharing good practice with staff too - the green team recently ran a session about the amount of data that we all store and how we can each do regular digital clean-ups of our emails, calendars and documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shadi</strong>: Building capacity for the digital transformation of the sector is what Europeana does. And digital transformation has many positive effects on climate and environment, but it also demands energy and natural resources. Our primary focus is on empowering the sector for a sustainable digital transformation. The Europeana Network Association has recently formalised a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community\">Climate Action community</a> which has the ambition to drive collective action in the sector and bring about real change in addressing the climate emergency. The Europeana Climate Action Community was born out of the work of the Europeana Climate Action Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And at the Europeana 2021 conference last week, we launched the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Europeana Climate Action Manifesto</a>. It sets out four guiding principles that will inform the concrete actions the Europeana Initiative will undertake to mitigate climate change through how we plan, collaborate, operate and advocate. The manifesto shows that we believe that collective action is essential and that acknowledging climate impact should inform all stages and elements of our work, while small and large, personal and systemic changes can all make a difference.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Who do you look to for best practice and inspiration in this area?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shadi</strong>: I think it's a very complex issue for any sector or industry, and similarly, for the cultural heritage sector, and the digital cultural heritage sector. It's a topic that we’ve only picked up recently, following the great work that the Climate Action Group started back in 2019, led by ENA Members Councillors Barbara Fischer, Killian Downing and Peter Soemers. Their work has brought us to where we are today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also inspired by things that the <a href=\"http://www.museumsforfuture.org/about\">Museums For Future</a>, the <a href=\"https://climateheritage.org/\">Climate Heritage Network</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europanostra.org/our-work/policy/european-cultural-heritage-green-paper/\">Europa Nostra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ne-mo.org/news/article/nemo/nemo-confirmed-as-a-eu-climate-pact-ambassador.html?tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&amp;amp;tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&amp;amp;cHash=dc4dc633904b2339d56a1bd8c2ec4656\">NEMO</a> do. And I read about what climate action and climate justice organisations around the world do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patrick</strong>: Being a software developer, I mostly look at the technical side. So inspiration primarily comes from communities like <a href=\"https://climateaction.tech/\">ClimateAction.Tech</a> and people who work on lowering the impact of digital services.Tom Greenwood wrote a wonderful book on <a href=\"https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/new-publication-sustainable-web-design-by-tom-greenwood/\">sustainable web design</a>. And there's Chris Adams, who's one of the founders of the <a href=\"https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/\">Green Web Foundation</a>, promoting service providers that use 100% green energy. And there's also Christian Kroll the founder of <a href=\"https://www.ecosia.org/\">Ecosia</a>, which is a climate positive search engine. He shaped that organisation in such a way that its goal is really to make a difference, to make the world better and and not to make a profit, which I think is a wonderful idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How can people get involved?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shadi</strong>: Read and share the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-climate-action-manifesto\">Europeana Climate Action Manifesto</a>, join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community#join\">Europeana Climate Action community </a>and share what you are doing in your institution. Let's collaborate and learn together. Let’s share knowledge, raise awareness and together drive impactful and sustainable action. It's a journey we are on together and every action really counts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patrick</strong>: It starts with people realising that everything they do can have an impact on carbon emissions and climate change. People look at the internet as something that's free, you send an email and that's it. But every email also has an impact. When you realise that, you can take tiny actions to reduce that impact. You can investigate if you can switch to a green internet provider, you can send fewer emails, you can turn off your computer monitor when you're not using it. All kinds of little things can help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Shadi said, this is really a learning opportunity, a journey for us all. We don’t have all the answers - if we did, we would approach it differently! But it’s great to find new ways to do things. It’s very, very exciting.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Thank you so much for speaking to us today! Tell us about the Museum Geelvinck.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://geelvinck.nl/en/\">Museum Geelvinck</a> is a historic house museum with a significant collection of stringed keyboard instruments from the 18th and 19th centuries, and by far the largest collection of early period pianos in the Netherlands. It offers audiences both a general overview of the development of the piano and its music, and a specific exploration of piano as a craft and industry in the Netherlands. For the Museum, this is living musical heritage: we support the vocational education of both musicians and piano technicians, (co-)creation by composers and performers,&nbsp;and academic research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Can you tell us about your history?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">30 years ago, we started as a historic house museum in which we presented the story of the building’s wealthy inhabitants from the 17th - 19th centuries. Unavoidably, their colonial pasts can be seen from alternative perspectives. This was reason enough for us to mount ‘Swart op de Gracht’ in 2013, an exhibition on transatlantic slavery. During that year, 150 years of the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colonies Suriname and the Dutch Antilles was commemorated. The preparations for this impactful exhibition, in which we involved the local communities from Suriname and the Dutch Antilles, took us over five years. Since then, this theme of our shared heritage has remained a significant part of our museum’s policy, albeit that we shifted emphasis to musical performances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>One of your main areas of focus&nbsp;is the ‘Beethoven is Black’ initiative; can you tell us more about this?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our culturally western biased view, we tend to think of classical music as a universal value. We commonly characterise traditional music from other cultures as ‘world music’. Within the museum world, we have started to look at our collections from more inclusive perspectives and, catalysed by the Black Lives Matter movement, we had to&nbsp;conclude that classical music is inextricably linked to western imperialism and white supremacy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Diving into this issue, we came upon the story behind ‘Beethoven is Black’ and its use as a metaphor in the US civil rights movement in the 1960s, and more recently, to highlight an exclusionary approach to culture. And so, we adopted it as a way to introduce people to our work in this area. We started out to decolonise the living heritage of our collection of early pianos and to strive to make the classical music sector in general more welcoming and inclusive for both musicians and audiences with roots in non-western cultures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What steps did you take to establish this initiative, and others in your institution which celebrate Black history?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From its very start, our museum has had an international outlook and has developed collaborations with institutions abroad; for instance, around the turn of the millenium, we collaborated with the United Nations within the context of the UN Dialogue Among Civilisations. The leadership of our museum includes one of the four initiators of ‘Dolle Mina’, an influential Dutch women’s liberation movement, which was inspired by the Black Power Movement with Angela Davis as one of its icons. For decades now our non-executive board has included members with African roots from the Dutch colonies. We strive to work with musicians of colour and we have been staging both cross-cultural performances and compositions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What role does digital technology, practices or engagement play in this work?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several years ago, we started recording some of our concerts on audio and video. We dreamt of the potential of a worldwide internet audience and the possibilities of streaming our events. The COVID-19 pandemic gave an enormous boost to this. Recording and sharing online became necessary to stage concerts and provide an opportunity for our circle of musicians to perform for a virtual audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The internet does not only give us the potential to gain a global audience. It opens opportunities to reach out in new formats to different communities and age groups, who may not otherwise feel welcomed and culturally safe in a traditional classical music concert setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What were the biggest challenges that you encountered in setting up these concerts?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First there were the technical challenges. Professionally developing an online project for streaming of classical concerts took far more time than we first anticipated. From the start, it was obvious that we had to adapt the format to reach out to new audiences. This meant a whole new approach for the way we present our concerts and interpret the repertoire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another challenge we came across is that musicians of colour often feel restrained to talk about their encounters with structural racism within the classical and early music sector, as this may backfire on their career. This while the sector considers itself already welcoming and inclusive. However until recently, the under-representation of Black musicians in Europe from students entering music schools and conservatories to ensembles and orchestras, has been paid little or no attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last, but not least, it is a challenge to reach beyond an audience, which is already convinced, or ‘woke’. Our aim is not only to address the issue within classical and early music circles of musicians of colour. Far more important is to create awareness and place the topic on the agenda within the classical and early music sector at large. When the sector ignores the issue, it refrains from the necessary changes in attitude to become more welcoming for both musicians of colour and new audiences and develop outreach to communities rooted in non-western cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What work can the sector do to promote these necessary changes in attitude?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To start with, we have to acknowledge that musicians and composers of colour are not only historically under-represented in early and classical music, but that their existence up until recently has been greatly ignored. Driven by the work of the Black Lives Matter movement and targeted incentives and funds for inclusion in the cultural sector, we have recently seen an increase in interest for performing works by composers of colour. Although this may be seen as a step in the right direction, and further research may bring to light more compositions by composers of colour from the past, the choice of repertoire remains quite modest. A more convincing approach could be to acknowledge different interpretations of classical and early music compositions, allowing for non-western musical influences.&nbsp;For instance, the renowned classical flutist Ronald Snijders introduces rhythms and tunes from his youth in Suriname, which have clear African roots, into his interpretations of classical compositions. He is indignant that within the classical music sector his efforts are dismissed as&nbsp;‘world music’, and not equally appreciated as classical performances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other approaches could include crossover contemporary classical compositions, which combine early pianos with instruments from non-western music cultures. Over the last 10 years, we have staged performances of such repertoire regularly in our annual festival. No difference is made between the cultural background of the western and non-western musical traditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another best practice is to deviate from today’s western classical concert etiquette, as well as to allow for orchestras with a wider scope of both classical and non-western traditional instruments. This could help to enhance cultural crossovers and give opportunities for new generations to enjoy and perform their parents’ non-western musical traditions as part of the global art music tradition, in which western classical music shares significantly, but is not the only choice. A less western-centred presentation of the story of classical and early music could also help to relate a wider, multicultural audience to classical music.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What steps can cultural heritage institutions take to acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking at an object from an alternative angle already offers a different perspective on the story behind it, which audiences may not have been aware of. For example, in our exhibition in 2013 ‘Swart op de Gracht’, we presented the visitor with the fact that when you sip a nice cup of coffee with a sweet, the coffee, sugar and chocolate all have a past directly linked to Black transatlantic slavery; these commodities are still linked to involuntary labour today. Black history often lurks just below the surface of our perspective. By making the audience aware of this, we widen their view and possibly appreciation of our shared past. The interpretation of objects from the past and the way these are publicly presented can highlight stories showing Black history. And the same goes for living heritage, such as classical music performances.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Sense-making in the pandemic</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are events that suddenly make (apparently) disconnected pieces of information all come together: this was the effect of Europeana’s series of sensemaking workshops on Digital transformation in the time of COVID-19 which I attended in 2020 (two excellent facilitators, Jasper Visser and Michael Edson, led the workshops).&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/building-digital-capacity\">Find out more about the workshops and Europeana’s work to build digital capacity</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The workshops triggered the emergence of a wealth of (dormant) ideas: they mostly emphasised the need (or urgency) to help cultural heritage institutions recover from the pandemic through knowledge exchange on engaging with remote audiences and bridging the digital divides prompted by the pandemic. What was missing was insights into how to engage audiences remotely through activities that are creative, original and (relatively) easy to set up. More importantly: the dialogical, creative and interactive dimensions of audience engagement needed to be emphasised.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a team of European partners, I applied for and was awarded&nbsp;an EU grant:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://glamers.eu/\">The GLAMers</a> Erasmus+ project started in March 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Research and findings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project aims to understand how the GLAM sector uses digital technologies to engage with and serve the needs of young people during the pandemic. It seeks to create dialogue within the cultural sector about the challenges and opportunities of using digital media to benefit young people in a time of crisis and change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A first result of the project was a European-wide identification of original initiatives organised by European GLAMs to reduce isolation and highlight the creativity of the crowd. We particularly sought initiatives that were designed to develop and deliver tactile, hands-on activities to families and young learners through the web.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By means of case studies, surveys and interviews with GLAM experts and amateurs, we produced the publication ‘Practices of digitally mediated youth engagement in GLAMs during the pandemic’ which is available <a href=\"https://glamers.eu/io1-use-cases-collection-of-digitally-mediated-youth-engagement-for-glams-during-the-pandemic/\">here</a>. The publication seeks to answer questions like: what kind of means cultural heritage institutions employed to connect and interact with their audience remotely? How creativity and imagination of young visitors was conveyed online? What concrete and original examples of engaging the audience remotely can act as sources of inspiration?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Engagement through events</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project has organised several events to share our learnings with cultural heritage professionals. For example, with the support of Europeana, in September 2021 we organised a webinar featuring three GLAM speakers directly involved in the creation of some of the 15 outstanding practices. The speakers were: Jennie Ryan (Museum of Literature Ireland, Dublin, Ireland), Tom Brink (Anne Frank House Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Peter Aerts, (S.M.A.K. Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art, Ghent, Belgium).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/practices-of-digitally-mediated-youth-engagement-in-glams-during-the-pandemic\">Watch the recording</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A series of training events for GLAM experts and amateurs started in October 2021. The first one took place on October 13. Speakers included Marta Kuliš Aralica and Vedrana Ceranja (Museum of Arts and Crafts (MUO), Zagreb, Croatia); Peter Aerts (S.M.A.K. Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art, Ghent, Belgium), Erik Boekesteijn (National Library of the Netherlands) and Maria Vähäsarja (EMMA – Espoo Museum of Modern Art). At the interactive&nbsp;workshop we explored&nbsp;how to implement a variety of digital audience engagement techniques.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/youth-audience-engagement-during-covid-digital-ideas-and-methods-from-the-glamers\">Watch the recording</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A second training event took place in November 2021. Invited speakers were Daphne Kouri (Museum of Cycladic Art Athens, Greece), Sylvianne Lathuilière (Museum of Contemporary Art, Lyon, France), Silvia Mascalchi (Uffizi Galleries, Florence, Italy) and Laura Pye (Liverpool Museums, Liverpool, UK).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/645284140\">Watch the recording</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are planning more training and knowledge exchange events, as well as a mentorship programme for GLAMs wishing to put in practice ideas implemented by pioneering cultural heritage institutions. Check The GLAMers <a href=\"https://glamers.eu/\">website </a>for updates!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would like to thank Michael Peter Edson for all his support with the project: as a reviewer of our publication, as a facilitator and as a host of the online events to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you a GLAM expert wishing to share how you engage your audience online? We collect practices and will share them publicly! Get in touch with us <a href=\"https://glamers.eu/contact-us/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Engaging with audiences also means being responsive to contemporary societal issues: climate change is one of them. The role of cultural heritage organisations in climate resilience is a current topic in many cultural heritage institutions. If you wish to learn more or play an active role, join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/climate-action-community\">Europeana Network Association Climate Action Community</a> and the <a href=\"https://climateheritage.org/\">Climate Heritage Network</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>On 2-3 December 2021, a fascinating and diverse group of speakers will explore current trends in digital participation and discuss the opportunities and challenges in this space, through presentations and interactive Q&amp;A sessions. Conference attendees will hear fresh perspectives on public participation in collecting and contextualising digital cultural heritage, and on crowdsourcing and gamifying data quality improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As background for participation, we know that younger generations in general are more likely to seek and share digital experiences that are participatory and community-oriented. Successful organisations in the 21st century are increasingly participatory, embracing open, collaborative, ‘read-write’ methods to accomplish their goals, in partnership with their community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will explore how this applies to cultural institutions and see how they are engaging communities with cultural heritage, crowdsourcing, citizen science, enrichment and digital storytelling, and what they recommend in terms of audience participation and public engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creating and caring for participatory communities requires care, time and commitment, and can be labour and resource-intensive. These factors can have a profound effect on the way cultural institutions approach digital transformation and participation. &nbsp;And so the conference will also explore how cultural institutions are addressing the sustainability of digital participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Guests on the first day – which is open to all – can expect a warm welcome from the Europeana Foundation, the Slovenian Ministry of Culture and the European Commission and then be inspired by guest speakers including George Oates (Flickr Commons), Susanna Anas (Open Knowledge Finland), Giovanna Fontenelle (Wikimedia Foundation), Virginia Poundstone (Mhz Curationist) and Medhavi Gandhi (The Heritage Lab). Experts on engagement and participation from the Europeana Foundation will also be on hand. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Event_documentation/Events/Presidency/Slovenia-Presidency-2021-Digital-Programme-Public.pdf\">Explore the programme.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conference attendees will take away actionable insights and inspiration for driving effective participation with digital cultural heritage. So, if you’re interested in participatory approaches to culture and public engagement, register now to join us!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Celebrating Black history, stories and achievements</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Black people have been part of European history, society and culture for centuries, but their presence has often been overlooked. Through editorial and digital storytelling, in October we aimed to bring a spotlight to Black history in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cornerstone for Black History Month on the Europeana website was a new exhibition ‘<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/exhibitions/black-lives-in-europe\">Black lives in Europe</a>’, which presents the stories and achievements of a number of Black figures from across Europe from the 1600s to the present day. The exhibition was published in English as well as French, German, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In October we also published <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/black-history\">three new galleries and seven blogs</a> which told further stories relating to the lives and communities of Black people in Europe. These were prepared by Europeana and partner projects, organisations and individuals including Europeana Sport, the Statens Museum for Kunst, Actions Culturelles Internationales, Dr Susan Hazan and Professor Johanna Fisher. Based on this editorial, we created an email course highlighting Black history through the stories of 13 individuals. More than 1,000 people subscribed to the course, and we were delighted that it received positive feedback from surveyed subscribers, with each respondent saying they had learned something new. You can still <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/hHGusb\">sign up for the course</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All these stories were gathered together on a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/black-history\">page</a> on the Europeana website which was promoted throughout October.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Learning from institutions</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also wanted to inspire cultural heritage professionals with examples of work from the sector which brings Black cultural heritage to wider audiences. We interviewed institutions including the Horniman Museum, Museum X, Black Central Europe and the Black Archives Amsterdam to learn more about the initiatives they are running which acknowledge, surface and highlight Black history in their own collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These institutions shared valuable perspectives on steps that cultural heritage institutions can take to share Black history. Among other things, we learned about the importance of acknowledging challenges and problems in the representation of Black history, in order to find solutions; undertaking critical self-reflection on collections and past practices; and working with people of colour in the interpretation of Black history. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/black-history-month-2021\">Explore the interviews</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Responsibilities and challenges</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As many of our colleagues who worked on editorial for Black History Month do not have the lived experience of being Black, we wanted to make sure that our writing for Black History Month was responsible, accurate and free from bias. To do this, we commissioned a 'sensitivity review' of the text of the Black Lives in Europe exhibition, which was undertaken by a Black cultural historian.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The lives and histories of Black Europeans - particularly women - are not well-represented in cultural heritage collections. In many cases, the language used to describe relevant records in metadata can be out-dated and offensive. In some of our editorial outputs, we put a content warning in place to alert readers to this possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also faced a challenge in promoting the season and related editorials. We create a bespoke social media advertising campaign for each editorial we publish. But some of our editorials relating to Black History Month (such as the Anti-Apartheid movement and Black people in European art) were flagged by Facebook as 'mentioning politicians or being about sensitive social issues' and we were unable to promote them, even after requesting a review. Similarly, our promotion of the exhibition Black Lives in Europe was permitted in some languages, but not in others. It is challenging to predict what will be rejected, especially when working on a variety of themes and in different languages. However, we found that promoting the landing page on which all the editorial pieces could be found was a solution that worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will continue to write and promote stories of Black figures both as part of Black History Month and throughout the rest of the year, and we will develop ways to support more diverse authors to curate editorials for the Europeana website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Would you like to get involved? You can continue to submit ideas for editorial which highlights Black history, or share relevant projects and initiatives through <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU9IOndv3-895jlCoqZ5wDHn-iRrOU6CFYQDrzNtQwfZ0FsQ/viewform\">our form</a>. And of course, continue to promote relevant content, blogs, images and objects from your own collections on social media. Use #BlackHistory and tag us @Europeanaeu when you do!</p>\r\n"

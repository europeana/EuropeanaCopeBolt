        title: 'European cultural heritage in educational activities on the itslearning learning platform'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A Europeana plugin has been added to the itslearning platform, used to create learning resources by teachers around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Itslearning is a cloud-based learning management system used by millions of teachers, learners, carers and others all around the world. One of its unique features is the extensive capability to integrate with content and applications from other sources - such as Finna (Finnish national archives) and Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In terms of integrating the content, a core area of the itslearning platform is the Library. In the Library, users can create and share educational materials with their school, city, or even globally to all itslearning users. Similarly, commercial vendors and publishers can publish their materials in the Library to their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are always on the lookout for open educational resources that can bring value to teachers and learners. We strongly believe in the importance of easy access to high-quality content. At its best, a library is a dynamic place for sharing, using and reusing content. To facilitate focussed search, \_content can be tagged in various ways, even with learning objectives. For example, you can search for content designed to support learning English at third-grade level. Also, you can rate content and, by doing so, help with further developing the content and search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"352\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NvCQYlOiEzNFhv4L1Wz4k8GP0xQB0dS3-vyEWHErsRUqjQfpcaFP_uHK7kVukCNcjhiU8AYpqa3QgJwMKXT1pSMQDAgkRKlYXFjh3Z_hCo9P0TLZ8sf-j0FoBZQGKrpGLPW1yefi\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot 1:\_The itslearning Library is a community of teachers and authors sharing content and learning resources. CC-BY-ND</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, we at itslearning Finland harvested content from the Finnish Finna service, importing thousands and thousands of free-to-use historical photographs, maps and art from the Finnish national archives. They are now readily accessible for all itslearning users, for any content or activity you can create in itslearning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"357\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gZPaAu3Dcax2MqNuw_6FVbuKBRR33_n17PgPOQR7UqAJzRZPVxHCCdKLCrJv5Ymj_msYXzwqryN4dsBOS_wN5LmT7QmP9VBTE5IyUYRQmSzS9g02NZAPtiO3WX08Ztz_vWg5YCnW\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot 2: An example of Finna content in the itslearning Library. CC-BY-ND</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we got in touch with the folks from Europeana. With Europeana, we wanted to provide an easy way to search and use content from the massive Europeana repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this effect, we developed a plugin for the itslearning rich text editor. With this plugin, you can start an image search from wherever you are working, be it an assignment, a test, or a page with engaging content. This search references the live Europeana repository, limited to free-to-use online contents. At the time of writing this, this amounts to a staggering total number of 12 million objects, including \_1.7 million photographs and 50,000 postcards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a simple click, you can add the selected image into itslearning. Importantly, only free-to-use content is returned, and the rights statement is displayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"359\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j6zZqNjZKSLbYezN8HjnQpDblJScNYzAi4Kr25sCIfOPVHKgnywuaT8zNK5hITpoPnNxxg_PaWhONsAqnJAc6EOGMhsGEnH7A2lUGF1s6XbuA4xnfbNPCtNdJvqZNsEPQw_HkKo\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot 3: The Europeana search plugin in itslearning. CC-BY-ND</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These resources are then easily accessible and usable in a pedagogic context. You can, for example, devise an assignment in which the learner has to describe what a picture tells a modern viewer. Or, you can ask learners to search for an image describing a given situation or related to an historic event. Furthermore, you can use the images as visuals in any of the materials you produce in itslearning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"428\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6ci9XdwZl3qjr8FRt7e7PHoJzTnMSeFpRrqpuBjVIPxmukSbs83I8dDnkqdkTK-H_5bKE_ls0RCrIrl9INzQgobAeVk4_x9TT_hLxlC1_AUdSZQx206Q64CP4Yaf8CdThC88EZuX\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot 4: An example of Europeana content in an itslearning assignment. CC-BY-ND</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plugin uses the REST-based Search API from Europeana, and the itslearning REST API for plugins. Both APIs are well documented so the core search and storing functionality of the plugin was fast to develop. The plugin is now live in its first version. Any input or improvement suggestions are warmly welcome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more about itslearning here:<a href=\"https://itslearning.com/global\"> https://itslearning.com/global</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for the techies:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>· \_\_\_\_\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-rest-api\">\_https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-rest-api</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>· \_\_\_\_\_<a href=\"http://developer.itslearning.com/REST_API_for_plugins_and_modules.html\">\_http://developer.itslearning.com/REST_API_for_plugins_and_modules.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Cinema met digital art in April in the MashUp Film Festival 2018, the only festival in the world dedicated to mashup works. We give you the lowdown on the festival’s film competition and its winning entry.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>The competition</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://mashup-film-festival.com/\">MashUp Film Festival 2018</a> organisers, who believe in the notion of sharing, participating and experiencing culture \_together and introducing the mashup phenomenon to an international audience, ran a short film competition as part of this year’s festival. The theme - ‘Utopia, Dream and Diversion’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrants were invited to create films using material made available to the festival by Europeana Collections and the French National Centre of Cinematography and the Moving Image (CNC). Approach, format and style were all up to the individual’s creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The entries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>33 films were submitted for the contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five finalists had their films shown at the award ceremony at the Cinéma Le Méliès in Montreuil, all vying for the prize for Best Film.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The jury</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts from content providers and film production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Virginie Lacoste, producer at ARTE Studio<br>\r\nEmeric de Lastens, film advisor at the Drac Île-de-France.<br>\r\nAntonio Maria Da Silva, film director<br>\r\nJérôme Lefdup, film director<br>\r\nAlexandre Blain from LaCinetek<br>\r\nAleksandra Strzelichowska from Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The winning film</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The jury unanimously selected 'Digital Girl Dream Opera'\_by Aurelio Càrdenas as the winning film. The jury members were really impressed by the director’s capacity to create something totally new from the archive material and for the great work with the music. \_\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/265407071\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/265407071\">Digital Girl Dream Opera (Aurelio Cárdenas) / Prix Mashup Film Festival 2018</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user10286413\">Aurelio Cardenas</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An interview with Aurelio, the winning filmmaker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Aurelio: I would like to thank the MashUp Festival, the jury and the spectators for this unexpected prize! The award will encourage me to continue creating mashup videos and other audiovisual projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana:\_So, Aurelio, where did the inspiration for this film come from?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aurelio: I created the movie starting with one fragment: the image of a woman on a videophone who mimics the tone of a phone (\"tut tut tut ...\"). Repeating this sound loop, I composed a piece of minimalist music that I then combined with images. I realised a kind of imaginary opera, illustrated almost exclusively by images of women performing (in beauty contests, dance shows, parades).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana: And what was your experience of working with archival material from Europeana Collections?<br><br>\r\nAurelio: It is very interesting material because of its extreme variety - in both themes and format.\_I downloaded about 30 clips that I watched before selecting a dozen for my film. The diversity of the material allows you to imagine an infinity of films with very different tones (comic, dramatic, historical, erotic, scientific ...).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana: Do you often use openly\_licensed content in your work?<br><br>\r\nAurelio: As an audiovisual documentalist, I sometimes use freely licensed content during my search for images for financial reasons but also for their documentary interest. As a videographer, too, I like reworking existing openly licensed images, and putting them in offbeat, often musical contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on the MashUp Festival, go to <a href=\"http://mashup-film-festival.com\">mashup-film-festival.com</a></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>If you attended the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeanatech-2018-gorgeous-data-glorious-technology-in-review\">EuropeanaTech conference 2018</a> this month in Rotterdam, you might recall a presentation we gave about innovation and research topics. For those who were not in attendance, here is a short preview of innovation topics that we as a cultural heritage community advocate for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Last Spring, the Europeana Foundation Governing Board gathered a group of experts to come up with the innovation agenda for the digital cultural heritage domain. Since then, we have worked to gather ideas that advocate for the renewal and innovation of the cultural heritage sector as well as supporting the sustainable growth of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do we mean by innovation? We have identified four broad areas that cover everything from the next ‘big thing’ in technological development to new business models, from improved infrastructure for sharing data and expertise, to redefining cultural heritage’s societal role. Some of you have already shared\_ideas with us via a postcard survey during the EuropeanaTech conference. We have gathered them all and created a list of innovation topics that we as a cultural heritage community advocate for. We have attached a short presentation on the results which includes references to the list of innovation topics and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-05/Innovation%20topics600px.png\" style=\"height: 663px; width: 600px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation topics by theme,\_Rasa Bočytė, 2018, CC BY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list aims to address the challenges that are faced by individual institutions as well as the cultural heritage sector as a whole. It advocates for research and innovation actions that are needed to enhance the positive impact that the sector could have in Europe and beyond. And most importantly, it highlights the role of digital heritage as an invaluable resource for a sustainable, socially conscious and technologically advanced society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s next? That’s where you come in! We need to assess the urgency and importance of each of these topics and make sure that we understand the needs of the cultural heritage community. Keep an eye out for our survey, we’ll be in touch soon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any comments or want to share your ideas with us, please contact Rasa Bocyte at <a href=\"mailto:rbocyte@beedengeluid.nl\">rbocyte@beedengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n"

Through Europeana Manuscripts, we’ll start bringing out the best of this content and celebrating the work of the experts and institutions who are working to preserve and digitise the textual heritage that reflects our history. \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/manuscripts\">Europeana Manuscripts</a>\_makes it possible for culture lovers, educators and researchers to explore the roots of European written culture through over 120,000 images (at the time of writing). The present collection will continue to grow thanks to ongoing work to digitise thousands more manuscript and textual records. This has all been made possible by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-rise-of-literacy-generic-services-project-digitizing-europe-s-textual-heritage\">Rise of Literacy</a>, a project led by a partnership of 13 libraries and institutes across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>High-quality content and experience</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To be included in any of our thematic collections, material has to meet our quality guidelines (that means at least Tier 2 of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Publishing Framework</a>). For Europeana Manuscripts, this high-quality material gives you the opportunity to explore the beauty of illuminated manuscripts from late antiquity to the introduction of the printing process. You can also browse the collection to find manuscripts in languages from Latin to Lithuanian, from Italian to Scottish Gaelic, and from Portuguese to Serbian.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Expert curation and insight</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As new content is digitised and made available on Europeana Collections over the course of 2018 and 2019, we’ll publish expertly curated editorial features like blogs, exhibitions and galleries, to guide you through Europe's rich and diverse cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exhibitions are planned that will bring together content from the project partners as well as that from existing providers to Europeana. Exhibition topics include an exploration of the transition from handwritten to printed texts and another that will show how the rise of literacy took place in Europe through formal and informal education. Blogs will tell stories about authors, texts and places of major prominence and introduce some of the curiosities and lesser-known items in the collection. Galleries will display beautiful images from the manuscript collections of the most ancient and active libraries of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Christ | Master of the Modena Book of Hours\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-05/9200122_BibliographicResource_1000056114534.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/9200122/BibliographicResource_1000056114537.html\">Christ\_|\_Master of the Modena Book of Hours</a>.<span>\_</span><a href=\"http://manuscripts.kb.nl/zoom/BYVANCKB:mimi_76f6:016v_017r\">National Library of the Netherlands</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A valuable resource for research, education and curiosity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Manuscripts opens up precious primary sources to research communities of historians, philologists, paleographers\_and art historians as well as to educators and students.

        title: 'Breathing new life into the Europeana Aggregator Forum'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A Steering Group has been formed to lead the Europeana Aggregator\_Forum and develop an accreditation scheme for aggregators.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Europeana and its aggregators</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana ecosystem builds on a network of national, thematic and domain aggregators enabling cultural heritage institutions to share their content on Europeana Collections and open it up to new audiences. Aggregators work with thousands of cultural institutions and collectors to gather authentic, trustworthy and robust data and make it accessible to Europeana Collections, education and research infrastructures, creatives, developers and the general public. An important source of expertise, aggregators offer their partner institutions advice and support in digitisation, content description, licensing, media formats accessibility, multilingualism and domain and subject vocabularies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Europeana Aggregator\_Forum - a potted history</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Aggregator\_Forum (EAF) was established in 2012 to enable aggregators to generate and exchange ideas, knowledge, experiences and best practices. Its purpose was to foster closer working relationships and two-way communication between all its members. Twice a year the members of the forum met face-to-face and these meetings were organised and hosted by the Europeana Foundation or one of the aggregators in the network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with the Europeana Strategy 2015-2020, to make it easier and more rewarding for cultural heritage institutions across Europe to work with Europeana, it is essential for the Europeana Aggregator\_Forum to function more effectively as a community and ensure its members feel united by the common principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A democratic new structure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first step to revitalise the Europeana Aggregator\_Forum, the aggregators agreed during their last meeting in Berlin on 22 and 23 March 2018 to establish a light organisation structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 26 April, the election of the first Europeana Aggregator\_Forum Steering Group concluded. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-rendina\">Marco Rendina</a> from the Europeana Fashion International Association was elected as the chair of the Steering Group. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> from ICCU representing CulturaItalia was elected as the vice chair of the Steering Group. The Steering Group will be completed by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/henning-scholz\">Henning Scholz</a>, representing the Europeana Foundation. The elected candidates will serve a two-year term after which elections will be held again.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An accreditation scheme for aggregators</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Steering Group will play an important role in shaping an accreditation scheme for aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scheme will help to identify active aggregators and acknowledge their role as active and trusted partners for cultural heritage institutions to work with, but also for other aggregators to share knowledge and best practices with. Accredited aggregators will be featured on a dedicated page on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A forum for the future</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Revitalising the Europeana Aggregator\_Forum will help to explore opportunities to increase the synergies between aggregators. It will also help to give increased recognition for organisations aggregating Europe’s cultural heritage. A revitalised forum should also be better placed to function as an instrument to influence political action on cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marco Rendina, new chair of the EAF Steering Group, says: ‘Aggregators have been the lifeblood of the Europeana initiative since its very beginning, and the Europeana Aggregator\_Forum, which represents all of them, should make its voice heard alongside the Europeana Foundation to advocate for the fundamental role of Europeana in our shared cultural heritage landscape, now and in the years to come.’</p>\r\n"

        title: 'From the earliest Scots Gaelic to Dutch children’s books - how we’re telling the story of literacy in Europe'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The partners behind the Rise of Literacy project talk texts and give us a glimpse into how they’ll use written material from across the centuries to showcase the history of literacy in Europe.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 18 April 2018, members of the\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy</a> editorial team representing eight of Europeana’s partner institutions, met at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh to discuss the delivery of the project’s editorial content. This group is leading the writing and coordination of exhibitions, galleries and blogs for the project, drawing together digital heritage content from all partners to shed light on the pan-European topic of the rise of literacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It’s all about teamwork</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our greatest gift is the rich content that is already on Europeana Collections or being digitised by the partner organisations. With material ranging from the earliest records of writing in Scottish Gaelic from the 16th century to Dutch children’s books from the 1950s, presenting a pan-European perspective on literacy is going to be a joy and a challenge!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A detail of St Margaret in The Blackadder Prayerbook (15th century). Elizabeth MacDonald, CC BY-SA.\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/NLS-Saint-Margaret.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>A detail of St Margaret in The Blackadder Prayerbook (15th century). Elizabeth MacDonald, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working collaboratively, our contributors will be writing draft texts and sharing images from their collections to produce editorials that showcase the history of European literacy, even before newly-digitised material is available on the Europeana platform (we expect most of this to arrive in October 2018).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our discussions provided very fertile ground for collaborative ideas and common themes between the content from partner institutions and that which is already on Europeana Collections. The platform already hosts a wealth of content from providers across Europe, so we may be in touch to let you know that we are featuring images from your collections as part of the story of literacy in Europe!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>'You may delay, but time will not' - Benjamin Franklin</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with content, an important part of our planning is time. Considering the digitisation and future ingestion of lots of new material, discussing timelines was essential. We drafted a workflow which takes us through each step of the editorial process, from planning to delivery. This will allow us to create content that is rich, consistent across editorials and, importantly, delivered on time! A visual timeline will also allow us to schedule a steady flow of editorial content throughout the project and beyond so that the celebration of textual content from libraries and institutions across Europe continues to grow and develop on Europeana long after February 2019. We also hope that these tools and methods will help provide a working model for future projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"‘Device of Androw Myllar’ from the Chepman and Myllar prints (left) and ‘Wryttar to the reidaris’ in the Banatyne Manuscript, f. 59 (right).

National Library of Scotland, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As hosts, we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to show our partners some of the exciting material that the National Library of Scotland will be contributing! For instance, we got to see and touch the first books printed in Scotland, the <a href=\"https://digital.nls.uk/firstscottishbooks/\">Chepman and Myllar</a> prints from 1508, and the\_<a href=\"https://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/15682.html\">Bannatyne Manuscript</a> from 1568, which sheds light on the manuscript culture of Scotland and contains Scottish poems that would otherwise have been lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The next steps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As the planning stage draws to a close, we can now focus on curating the material that’s coming in from 11 partner institutions to showcase the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-the-rise-of-literacy-generic-services-project-digitizing-europe-s-textual-heritage\">Rise of Literacy</a> across Europe, from manuscripts to newspapers and children's spelling books to bestsellers. In May 2018 we launched the new <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/manuscripts\">Europeana Manuscripts Collection</a>, showcasing the best of Europe’s manuscripts with expert editorial. Later in the summer, you’ll have access to an unparalleled collection of political, social and cultural history in the Europeana Newspapers Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Biblia pauperum (c. 1460) An example of early printed “block book”.

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>RightsStatements.org provides 12 rights statements that can be used to describe digital cultural heritage items and all of them have now been translated into German and Estonian</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We’re happy to tell you about the launch of German and Estonian language rights statements provided by the <a href=\"http://www.rightsstatements.org\">RightsStatements.org</a> Consortium. The German translation was undertaken by Europeana Network Association Members Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ellen-euler\">Ellen Euller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.iljabraun.de\">Ilja Braun</a>. And the Estonian translation by Europeana Network Association Member <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/vahur-puik\">Vahur Pruik</a> and <a href=\"https://www.etis.ee/CV/Tanel_Pern/est\">Tanel Pern</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Consortium publishes 12\_statements, developed originally in English. All of these have been translated into German and Estonian. They are the <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/documentation/translations.html\">first of a series of translations</a> that are underway. \_Europeana currently uses six of these statements. You can see the full list by consulting the list of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">available rights statements</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The translated statements will display automatically based on the browser's language settings of the. The <a href=\"https://sharingheritage.de/owner/deutsche-digitale-bibliothek/\">DDB</a> will be among the first German cultural heritage institutions to use them, and plans are underway with Estonian organisation <a href=\"https://ajapaik.ee/\">Ajapaik</a>. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't want to change your browser settings?\_ Check out the <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/de/\">German</a> and <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/et/\">Estonian</a> language version.\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s the benefit of providing multilingual rights statements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Up to now, anyone wanting to find out more about the copyright status and reuse possibilities\_ would only be able to read these in English. Now, if you have your browser settings set to German or Estonian - no matter where you are in the world - you will view the statements in German or Estonian respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do cultural heritage institutions need to do?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you provide data to Europeana and already use rights statements provided by the Consortium, then you don’t need to do anything. The urls you submit for publication remain the same as those published in the list of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">available rights statements</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A bit about the process</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Consortium published a <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/files/170612rs_translation_policy.pdf\">translations policy</a> in 2017 to enable a transparent and consistent approach is taken in publishing translations of the statements. The German translation was the first to be processed under this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Ellen’s and Ilja’s experience with translations, and Ellen’s familiarity with copyright law and the issues caused by digitisation of cultural heritage objects, this first run through of the process also highlighted some instances in which the statements needed to be refined in order to be consistent with each other. As part of this work, Ellen has joined the Consortium's Statements Working Group and will continue to offer her expertise in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re not finished yet! There are still more translations being developed. Check out the <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/en/documentation/translations.html\">translations page</a> of the Consortium website for the most up-to-date status, as well as information about how to make an application\_to develop a translation in your native language. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in providing a translation for the RightsStatements.org Consortium - you can also get in touch via <a href=\"mailto:info@rightsstatements.org\">info@rightsstatements.org</a>.\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Mainstreaming the use of digital cultural heritage in education'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Meet the champions mainstreaming the use of digital cultural heritage in education: the Europeana Teacher Developer Group.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over the last eight months, the Europeana Teacher Developer Group, coordinated by the European Schoolnet (EUN), have been designing learning scenarios with digital culture, testing them in their classrooms and helping to build the first <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-in-your-classroom-building-21st-century-competences-with-digital-cultural-heritage-mooc\">Europeana MOOC</a>. The group activities are coming to an end, but their work will have an impact on many students and educators across Europe and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Teacher Developer group was set up at the beginning of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-dsi-3\">DSI-3 project</a> (September 2017) with the aim to help mainstream the use of digital cultural heritage in the classroom and build a community of Europeana educators. The group consists of 18 primary and secondary teachers from Finland, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain. Meet our teachers and know what they think about cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rq-Zl91YCA?list=PL3mARAvoNP5SLtRw9hlOHoIR-AWU2-BIj\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Cultural Heritage in Education as European teachers see it. EUN Academy. CC-BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main task of the group has been to produce a set of learning scenarios (LS) using Europeana content and resources (along a series of workshops done in Brussels; October and December 2017 and April 2018). They are available for other teachers to use in the<a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/directory\"> directory of EUN’s Future Classroom Lab</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scenarios have been tested and implemented by each teacher among their students and they cover a range of disciplines and curriculum topics in primary and secondary education, such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and also art and languages. New trends and pedagogical methods, like project-based learning or inquiry-based learning, have also been applied with the goal of fostering uniquely 21st century skills: collaboration and teamwork, digital literacy, problem-solving and critical thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example of developing all these skills is ‘The Story of Darwin and the Comet Orchid’ scenario, as explained by the teacher Matteo Catadori.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8pWF9xehe4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Learning Scenario Implementation - Matteo Cattadori. EUN Academy. CC-BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While implementing the scenarios, the teachers had the opportunity to reflect on their own practices thanks to the assessment made by their peers (the Europeana Teacher User Group, which we’ll hear more about soon) and, most importantly, by their pupils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gwendoline Juilleron, a French History and Geography teacher, made a video showing her students’ impressions of the ‘Christianity in the Middle Ages’ scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFPLDhQpxbY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Student interviews Gwendoline Juilleron.

        title: 'EU copyright reform - June 2018 update'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>An update on what's been happening on the long road towards better EU copyright rules for Europe’s cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over the last few months, the discussions about the proposed <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market_en\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market directive</a> have continued in Brussels. As we head towards the summer break, it is time to provide another update on the latest developments and activities of Europeana and our partners. These aim to\_ensure\_that the new directive will help European <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/markets/chis\">cultural heritage institutions</a> better fulfil their mission in the digital space.<br><br>\r\nToday, we take a look at the negotiation position that was agreed upon by the Member States while we\_wait\_for the European Parliament to adopt its own position. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most significant development of the past months has been that the Council has adopted a negotiation mandate (late May 2018). In doing so, the EU Member States have agreed on a set of changes to the Commission's proposal that they will try to have adopted in the upcoming negotiations with the Commission and the European Parliament. Before these negotiations can start, the Parliament will need to agree on changes to the proposed directive that it can bring to the negotiation table. The vote in the Legal Affairs (JURI) committee is currently scheduled for 20 or 21 June 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the European Parliament indeed manages to wrap up its discussions and vote by the end of June 2018, then the negotiations between the Parliament, the Commission and the Council can start at the beginning of the Austrian presidency on 1 July 2018. At this\_stage, it is too early to make a prediction about the duration of these negotiations, but it seems at least possible that they could be concluded before the end of 2018 which would allow the directive to become adopted in early 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Member States' position</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So what have the Member States agreed on exactly? The following is an overview of the changes that Member States want to make that are most relevant from the perspective of cultural heritage institutions. In general, the Member States’ approach has been quite conservative in the sense that they do not propose any radical departures from the Commission's original proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The Member States have left the text and data mining (TDM) exception in Article 3 of the proposal largely untouched. The addition of ‘cultural heritage institutions’ to the beneficiaries who may engage in TDM for the purpose of scientific research is a small concession, but it remains problematic that the expiation does not apply to all beneficiaries and for all purposes.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>At the insistence of some Member States, the Council text contains a new Article 3a. This allows Member States to introduce an exception that would allow anyone to engage in text and data mining of lawfully accessible works unless the rights holders have explicitly stated that they do not allow this. This is a step in the right direction (in countries that will choose to implement such an exception), but it comes at the cost of further fragmentation of user rights in the EU.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The Member States have made only minor changes to the exception for online educational activities in Article 4. This means that they support the Commission's narrow approach that limits the beneficiaries of this exception to those who are enrolled in formal educational settings and allows publishers to override the exception via licensing.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The same is true with regards to Article 5 - \_the exception for ‘preservation of cultural heritage’. While cultural heritage institutions had asked for it to be clear that such preservation includes digitisation, the Member States only expanded the purpose slightly excluding the term ‘sole’ from the Article which now reads: ‘for the purpose of preservation’. This is a missed opportunity that could create legal uncertainty given that almost all preservation currently involves digitisation.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The Council text does propose some more substantial changes to the provisions on the ‘use of Out-of-Commerce Works by cultural heritage institutions’ in Articles 7-9. The changes proposed by the Member States simplify some of the overly complex procedures the Commission has envisaged (most notably the rules regarding in which Member States a licence needs to be sought for making Out-of-Commerce Works, OOCW,\_available). This will make such provisions more usable for cultural heritage institutions. Yet even with these changes, the fact remains that the Extended Collective licensing approach foreseen by the Commission will not work for all types of works and in all Member States. Without a fallback exception, the provisions aimed at enabling access to OOCW will provide a partial solution to the problems faced by Europe's cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The Member States have also agreed to add a new Article 9a to the text that would allow them to implement domestic extended collective management schemes that go beyond enabling access to OOCW (such licences could cover entire collections regardless of whether they are in commerce or not). Such a provision would be good news for institutions in Member States that choose to implement this Article. However, from the perspective of harmonising the conditions under which cultural heritage institutions across Europe (or a pan-European platform like Europeana) operate, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/02-11-17-eu-copyright-reform-update\">this is rather problematic</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Finally, while the Member States have backed the controversial introduction of a new right for press publishers, as foreseen in Article 11, they are proposing some positive changes that would benefit cultural heritage institutions. In the version proposed by the Member States, the duration of the right is brought down from 20 years after publication to a maximum of two years after publication and it would not apply retroactively (thanks to a last-minute intervention by the Czech Republic). This means that it would not affect any digitisation projects that have already been concluded.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>Looking ahead</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All things considered, these changes would amount to small improvements for cultural heritage institutions. However, it is clear that the version adopted by the Member States will not provide a comprehensive solution to the problems faced by Europe's cultural heritage institutions. It remains to be seen if the European Parliament will adopt a more forward-looking position later this month (in the parliament a fall-back exception for OOCW is still on the table at this moment; June 2018).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the parliament has voted on its position, we will be back with another update <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/tags/copyrightreform\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note:</em> On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">consensus driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organizations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Three days in The Hague - three data problems solved'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In 2009, the National and University Library of Slovenia became the national cultural heritage aggregator for Slovenia. In April 2018, two representatives - Matjaž Kragelj and Mitja Kovačič - visited the Europeana Foundation to discuss all things data. They tell us how their visit went.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Awareness of the importance of digitising cultural heritage in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=Slovenia\">Slovenia</a> is low. In particular, there is a lack of awareness of how important it is to keep digital archives in good shape. As a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">national aggregator</a>, it’s part of our role to try to change that. And that means we need to be really good at it ourselves. So we visited Henning Scholz (Partner &amp; Operations Manager)\_and his colleagues at Europeana HQ to get some help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to hear from Europeana about the data management processes, tools and services, and understand their various complexities. At the same time, we wanted to present our own position - how we prepare and export metadata and convert it to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">EDM</a>, which we believe allows for rich information to be made available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ljugljana (Licej)\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/92058_URN_NBN_SI_img_8NXWNT10.jpeg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/92058/URN_NBN_SI_img_8NXWNT10.html\"><span>Ljubljana (Licej)</span></a>. <a href=\"http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:img-8NXWNT10\">National and University Library of Slovenia</a>. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">Public Domain</a><span>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Problem one: Motivating our partners</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned before, there is a lack of enthusiasm in Slovenia for sharing digitised content. To help combat this, we’re welcoming a new team member to disseminate information about the aggregator as a service, and to inform potential partners about the importance and possibilities of providing their own data through Europeana to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the ever-energetic Nienke van Schaverbeke (Head of Europeana Collections), we now also have a useful tool - a Campaign Planning Template - to help us motivate our partners and institutions to work with us to provide data. We’re also organising a meeting with Europeana and our partners to highlight the benefits of publishing in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever I think about this subject, I always remember the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpro.europeana.eu%2Ffiles%2FEuropeana_Professional%2FPublications%2FPublishing_Framework%2FPublishing_framework_summary.pdf\">Europeana Publishing Framework\_slogan</a>, ‘The more you give, the more you get’, and I could not agree more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Problem two: Untangling our digital collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have made between 250,000-300,000 objects available on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> through a variety of routes and under a variety of names - e.g. National and University Library, National Library of Slovenia, National e-content Aggregator of Slovenia. For some collections, the name of the provider was written in Slovene - Narodna in univerzitetna knjižnica, Digitalna knjižnica Slovenije. We have even submitted the material through different projects (E-Travel, Europeana Newspapers, The European Library).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result? Confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our aim was to remove all of our objects and prepare materials in Europeana’s standard EDM format. But getting a definitive list of what we’d contributed was looking impossible. Until Henning called Hugo Manguinhas (Product Owner API)\_who arrived with a USB stick with all the information we needed - all the collection items and relevant metadata in a .csv file. We created a database, and with some simple SQL querying, we got exactly what we wanted. So now we can get on with preparing new exports for our old data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Problem three: Data processing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Adina took us through the ingestion process step by step, using one of our collections as an example - \_from harvesting from the aggregator, through all the processes in the Mint tool, to the output - the preview portal for Europeana. The procedure is really long, tedious and somehow stressful. But then, Valentine Charles (Product Owner of Metis) presented the new Metis tool, which seems much more intuitive, faster and with fewer steps. It seems that this tool will finally make it easier for those who deal with us and our metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank Henning and colleagues for their hospitality and professionalism and for solving every problem we brought up. Of course, we did not point out all of the issues – some have to wait until next time. And we do hope there will be a next time. In the meantime, we’ll continue improving our data, as well as contributing to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy</a> project.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Unlocking the British Library''s treasures online'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We spoke to Ben White, Head of Intellectual Property at\_the British Library, about some of the treasures (and challenges) he and the team of curators and project managers have uncovered in their efforts to bring\_hundreds of thousands of objects onto digital platforms, and show you how to use them.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>A bit of a copyright challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The British Library has developed a policy that guides people through the digitised collections, making it easy for people to see what they can do with its items, and encouraging them to use these objects in their own projects and activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No easy feat when you are dealing with, for example, \_one project alone spanning 60,000 books, or 100,000 sound recordings, over 20 different legacy digital content platforms\_and a UK copyright system that deems nearly all unpublished manuscripts in the European Economic Area as copyright protected (even if they are manuscripts from the Middle Ages).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the library’s latest projects ‘<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/projects/unlocking-our-sound-heritage\" target=\"_blank\">Unlocking our Sound Heritage</a>’ aims to make available online some 100,000 sound recordings (something Ben understates as posing ‘a bit of a copyright challenge’). The recordings range from animal and environmental sounds, to ethnographic field recordings, radio broadcasts, and popular and classical music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Ben, ‘Our policy encourages the use, where possible, of open licences. Where the material is public domain (or, given the uniquely long duration of copyright for manuscripts in the UK, public domain in most other countries), we also attempt to convey this. We encourage access and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/reuse-of-europeana-content-for-fun\">reuse</a>\_and make that very clear when we put material on the open web.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\r\nBen BL image 2.png\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/Ben%20BL%20image%202.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<address><em>An example of a digital object on a British Library platform, with the usage terms listed, curtesy of the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/likutim-bekabalah-pilosofiyah-veod-add-ms-27187\">British Library</a>.</em></address>\r\n\r\n<address></address>\r\n\r\n<p>This work requires attention to detail, as the appropriate usage terms need to be assigned to each individual digital object. And given the British Library’s extensive collections, this in some of projects, can add up to quite a lot of work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cultural treasures now online to explore and reimagine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is not without a sense of fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Library has developed a number of incentives to encourage people to view and reimagine content. \_This has resulted in digital cultural heritage objects being used as inspiration for fashion collections, card games, large-scale art installations, poetry writing and painting lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such incentive, a fashion competition, invited UK university students to develop a fashion portfolio taking inspiration from the 1 million images that make up the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/\" target=\"_blank\">British Library Flickr Commons Collection</a>. Eight finalists were selected, of which Alanna Hilton of Edinburgh College of Art was awarded the winning selection. Her ‘Unlabelled’ design portfolio used inspiration from the images to showcase a collection that ‘rejected labelling’ and branding and had a target market that was truly inclusive of all ages, sizes, ethnicities and gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, Victorian Era book illustrations from the Library’s Flickr Collection were also used as inspiration for David Normal's art installation which showed at the Burning Man festival. In line with the festival's ‘Caravansary’, (Caravanserai) theme, the mural installation took shape as a lightbox of imagery and collages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"image.jpg\r\n\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/image.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<address><em>David Normal's art installation for the Burning Man Festival, curtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/press-releases/2015/june/burning-man-installation-is-unveiled-at-the-british-library\">British Library</a>.</em></address>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sounds and sensitivity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However, these are not the only considerations when you use digital heritage content. In the case of the sound\_archives, not only will the British Library encourage people to embed and reuse the sounds through the development of innovative <a href=\"http://iiif.io/\">IIIF-compliant</a> embeddable technologies, they will also provide sensitivity guidelines that highlight the ethical considerations around, in some cases, even listening to the recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These may be specific to areas such as folklore, religious ceremonies, traditional knowledge, and people who access the content are asked to treat the recordings with respect, even if they are, in terms of copyright law, in the public domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a recording of a religious ceremony that a certain group specified can only be listened to by men, or people over a certain age, will be marked with sensitivity terms or guidelines. Links to this information will talk about the ethical terms of use for the collection and advise people how to treat this kind of sensitive object with respect.<br><br>\r\nHowever, for the British Library project members, this is all part of the great task of continuing the tradition of cultural sharing.<br><br>\r\nBen says, ‘What’s most important is that it’s online, and further, that we are investing the time and effort to tell people how they can use these items. That access and then reuse is really vital to facilitating engagement.’<br><br>\r\nView objects from the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=The+British+Library&amp;q=\">British Library</a> on Europeana Collections.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

This was a great opportunity for network members to learn more about Wikibase software, SPARQL query language, copyright in metadata, and so much more. The Wikidata workshop day was fully booked, with 50 registered participants from libraries, archives, and museums from Europe, India and Brazil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants learned all about the software Wikidata was built on - Wikibase - and discovered the opportunities of installing their own\_Wikibase to hold digital cultural collections. They took a deep dive into SPARQL to find out how they could easily answer their cultural queries, with beautiful outputs like ‘<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yd3cnqkz\">what are all the paintings by impressionist painters that have been in at least one exhibition?</a>’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop illustrated the possibilities of working with cultural heritage data as Linked Open Data, a message Europeana holds dear. Europeana can now also be accessed through a SPARQL endpoint, creating the possibilities for Linked Open Data querying that Wikidata also provides. For Europeana, the\_workshop's message\_centred on the ongoing inclusion of\_Wikimedia as an important partner in its activities, to let Wikidata add value to Europeana and vice versa, and to keep harnessing the power of structured data together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Jason Evans talks about Wikidata and the National Library of Wales at EuropeanaTech 2018\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/800px-Jason_Evans_at_EuropeanaTech_2018_01.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:500px;margin:0 auto;\"></p>\r\n\r\nJason Evans talks about Wikidata and the National Library of Wales at EuropeanaTech 2018. <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jason_Evans_at_EuropeanaTech_2018_01.jpeg\">Source.</a><p>These sentiments also present at\_the conference.

        intro: "<p>Evidence of the transformative nature of digital is becoming increasingly prevalent, with the digitisation of cultural heritage allowing new ways for cultural objects to be shared and used. But how does this technological shift affect cultural heritage, its societal role and the ways in which cultural identity evolves?</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>These questions are set to inform the discussion of digital heritage, a focus of discussion at a series of events in Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Cultural Heritage Summit in Berlin is one of the key public events of the European Year of Cultural Heritage (EYCH) and will be supported by the EU’s Creative Europe programme. The summit will bring together cultural heritage professionals, a wide variety of stakeholders and cultural heritage institutions, representatives from EU Institutions and Member states, to inform and discuss the cultural climate of Europe in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such digital event on 19 June ‘Cultural heritage communities and audiences in today’s digital environment’ at the Museum der Kommunikation explores topics linked to the digital, from people accessing cultural heritage and its increased visibility, to the transformation of exhibitions to the digital space. The event is co-organised by Institut für Museumsforschung Staatliche Museen zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz (IfM), Istituto Beni Culturali della Regione Emilia-Romagna, Musa Project, Michael Culture Association and Museum der Kommunikation Berlin under the umbrella of NEMO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 21 June ‘Visions for Cultural Heritage and Digital Platforms’ will add to the discussion. The one-day conference is dedicated to exploring topics from digital infrastructure for cultural heritage and cooperative platforms to encourage public participation, with keynotes and a panel discussion exploring the impact of digital cultural heritage on a European level. The event is co-organised by Institut für Museumsforschung – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz, Forschungs- und Kompetenzzentrum Digitalisierung Berlin (digiS) and Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This topic will also feature at the Young Professionals Summit, ‘The Future is Heritage’, from 19-22 June. The event will spotlight the next generation of cultural heritage, from students to young professionals, with expert discussions and workshops exploring culture and its shift with increasingly globalised societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These events underpin a wider discussion on a sense of shared history and common European identity, and the technological tools that are impacting this societal and digital transformation, as highlighted by the European Commission’s EYCH objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not in Berlin, we will be bringing news from each event over the next few weeks and we can expect much more from this topic throughout EYCH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find more information regarding the\_<a href=\"http://european-cultural-heritage-summit.eu/\">European Cultural Heritage Summit</a>, the\_<a href=\"http://european-cultural-heritage-summit.eu/events/cultural-heritage-communities-and-audiences-in-todays-digital-environment?card=7513\">NEMO and Michael Culture event</a>, or the\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">digital cultural impact</a> framework of Europeana.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In the shadow of ongoing discussions, the European Parliament has made some significant improvements to the provisions of the proposed directive that are directly relevant to cultural heritage institutions (CHIs).</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 20 June, the Legal Affairs committee of the European Parliament voted on the Parliament’s report on the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive. The vote follows more than 1.5 years of intensive discussions and allows for <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/20150201PVL00004/Legislative-powers\">trialogue negotiations</a> under the Austrian Presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the controversy over the last month (June 2018) has centered on Articles 11 (a new right for press publishers) and 13 (an obligation for platform hosts to filter user-uploaded content to prevent copyright issues). Both of these have been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44546620\">adopted by the Legal Affairs committee</a> and are thus likely to be part of the directive once it has been adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Steps taken\_towards improving access to cultural heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased that the members of the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/juri/home.html\">Legal Affairs Committee</a> have listened to the calls from Europeana, library organisations and cultural heritage institutions across Europe to add a fall back exception to Article 7 of the Commission's proposal. This would make the solution for access to Out-of-Commerce Works (OOCW) more robust and should contribute to\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-better-solution-to-making-out-of-commerce-works-available-online\">increased online availability of 20th Century works </a>held in the collections of Europe's CHIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to the preservation exception in Article 5 of the proposed directive, Parliament has followed the direction of the Member States and have not made any substantial changes (CHIs had asked for a clarification that the article also apply to digitisation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Parliament did however add a paragraph requiring Member States to ensure that faithful reproductions of works in the Public Domain should remain such (that is, in the Public Domain). This is a very welcome addition. The establishment of this principle in EU law would be an important step towards realising the principles established by our own <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Member States also made substantial improvements to the proposed exceptions for text and data mining and online education. While these improvements are not as progressive much of the \_cultural heritage community had wanted, they are a step in the right direction toward providing CHIs and users more room to engage with digitised cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What this means moving forward</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With the 20 June vote, the members of the Legal affairs committee have given the Rapporteur (German <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96761/AXEL_VOSS_home.html\">MEP Axel Voss</a>) the mandate to engage in negotiations with the Member States (who had <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/a-better-solution-to-making-out-of-commerce-works-available-online\">adopted their position</a> in May 2018) and the European Commission. These negotiations will likely start during the Austrian Presidency. The provisions directly relevant for CHIs should be relatively uncontroversial. On preservation, text and data mining, and online education, the Parliament and the Member States have adopted very similar positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the perspective of CHIs, it will be most interesting to see if the co-legislators will manage to reconcile their different approaches for ensuring increased availability of OOCW, in a way that allows greater online access to CHIs’ 20th Century collections. We will continue to work with all stakeholders involved in this discussion regarding the best possible outcome for Europe's CHIs and European citizens who deserve better access to our collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note:</em>\_On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">consensus driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organizations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Interested app developers and platform/service providers, such as Quizlet and Microsoft, reached out to panel members with follow-up conversations. Over the course of the day, we also discussed potential partnerships with EdTech accelerators and investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EdTechXEurope summit was a great opportunity for us to network with leaders in education and technology and creative thinkers across Europe. It was exciting to learn about the latest innovations in educational technologies and practices and to be part of the conversations about the EdTech future. We look forward to doing it all again in 2019!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n"

        intro: "<p>When we spoke to Europeana Network Association (ENA) member Kate Fernie, her background in archaeology became abundantly clear in her vision and role with the ENA. From her love of archives and passion to explore, uncover and build, Kate believes in looking to the past to\_offer insights into building for the future.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>A background in archaeology, archives and digital culture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate’s\_background in archaeology is complemented by experience in working with museums, digital libraries, digital preservation and the online cultural heritage. She has followed Europeana from its earliest days participating in a series of projects (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/carare\">CARARE</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/locloud\">LoCloud </a>and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/3d-icons\">3D-ICONS</a>) that have delivered content and developed technologies to assist people - largely curators, researchers, designers and planners - to manage and access information and content that fall within her specialist knowledge. This kind of content includes archeological monuments, architecturally important buildings, historic town centres and industrial monuments of heritage. For Kate, allowing people access to this kind of information allows them to gain insights into how the designing process has evolved, and further, to build on our historic foundations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"KateFernie_cover.png\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/KateFernie_cover.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 500px;margin:0 auto\"><br><em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/kate-fernie\">Kate Fernie</a></em>\_<em>speaking at the EuropeanaTech Conference, 2015, CC BY-SA.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her relationship with Europeana and its community also goes back a way. Kate is a regular participant at ENA meetings and events, including the aggregator forum and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeanatech-2018-gorgeous-data-glorious-technology-in-review\">EuropeanaTech</a>. She has spoken about the experience of providing metadata to Europeana and mapping to the Europeana Data Model (EDM). EuropeanaTech 2015, Kate gave a joint presentation with Valentine Charles about mapping the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/carare-final-conference-how-did-we-do\">CARARE metadata schema</a> to EDM and\_in the panel discussion that followed, she contributed to the discussion on the process of building on EDM. Further, she participates in Task Forces on metadata quality and on governance of EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A vision for building the community</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of community building is important for Kate; whether it is her community of metadata specialists or the network of people and organisations interested in digital culture. Her current role as operations manager for the CARARE association\_(a non-profit organisation which supports people and organisations with an interest in digital archaeology and architectural heritage) involves offering practical support, training and networking opportunities for members, and promotes the use and reuse of digital content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Kate, and like most archaeologists, she places importance on the promotion of\_understanding and appreciating the past. In doing so, this\_encourages the\_sustainable use of past monuments by contemporary society. These underpin her aims for Europeana and her participation in the network. Her vision involves enabling the reuse of content, maps, findings, drawings or other materials by researchers, students, in education, tourism and in the creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"2020739_object_DCU_24257302.jpeg\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-06/2020739_object_DCU_24257302.jpeg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 350px;margin:0 auto\"><br><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020739/object_DCU_24257302.html?q=Avebury+-+the+Cove\">Avebury - the Cove |</a> 2014 | Kate Fernie,\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/api/RbWPAapQ6/redirect?shownAt=https%3A%2F%2F2culture.locloudhosting.net%2Fitems%2Fshow%2F5&amp;provider=CARARE&amp;id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europeana.eu%2Fresolve%2Frecord%2F2020739%2Fobject_DCU_24257302&amp;profile=full\" target=\"_blank\">2Culture</a>\_| CC BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kate says, ‘I support the development of Europeana as a source for those interested in the building of our towns and cities, archaeological sites and historic landscapes. Through my work with the CARARE network, I would like to encourage examples of reuse of our content for education, research and tourism to be showcased and demonstrated to the whole network community. I will continue to contribute towards work on quality and standards through my work in Europeana Task Forces.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You hear more from\_Kate when she is presenting work on the CARARE metadata schema at the European Association of Archaeologists conference in Barcelona this September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about these activities and how to get involved, visit the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">Europeana Network Association</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The digital transformation - Europe''s defining transition'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana Executive Director Harry Verwayen was invited to speak at the European Parliament's 'Cultural heritage in Europe: linking past and future' conference on 26 June 2018. The speech he gave highlights the importance of digital cultural heritage within the current digital transformation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<div>10 years ago, the European Union took a bold and enlightened decision;\_it decided that our cultural heritage was too important to be left to market forces to decide if and how our heritage was made available to its citizens. From that big idea, Europeana was born.\_</div>\r\n\r\n<p>10 years later, we have a platform where close to 4,000 libraries, museums and archives have made over 50 million items from their collections available, in formats that allow use and reuse by researchers, creatives and interested citizens.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana did not deliver the next Google. It became something more than that;\_a thriving, distributed network of hubs and professionals who share their knowledge under open standards, solve common issues and develop new standards that empower others to learn and develop new creative works. Europe did not look for a cheap way to scan old things - it aimed to change a mindset. And that is the real power of a Europe based on values\_in action.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European model has become an export product that has been copied across the world,\_from the US to India, and from Mexico to Brazil.\_Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\r\nDgs_mt5W0AANvrx.jpg\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-07/Dgs_mt5W0AANvrx.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 600px;margin:0 auto\"><br><em>Harry Verwayen speaking at the conference, 26 June 2018, Eleanor Kenny, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It does not exclude private enterprise - far from it. It enables it. But at its core stands an economic model that drives change from within the sector instead of providing a cheap way out.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what about the future? We have heard many speak about the importance of cultural heritage to the social and economic environment. That makes a lot of sense. We spend much less than 1% of our GDP on a sector that is said to contribute over 4.5% of GDP in the form of cultural tourism, creative businesses and the regeneration of cities. That is a very solid return on investment by any standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the real value, the goldmine of culture, lies beyond this obvious return, embedded in such concepts as identity, of well-being, of behavioural change. This potential, however, is only unlocked in environments that are inherently participatory, that empower people to engage.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what of the future if we don’t create these environments, if we do not set the agenda? \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New radical technologies, like AI, are on the verge of breaking through. If we want to retain our competitive edge in cultural heritage, we need to make deep commitments and investments in our digital futures. In infrastructures like Europeana. In ambitious projects such as Time Machine. Or risk becoming the digital colonies of Silicon Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This requires the European Union to make another bold and enlightened decision: to once again promote digital transformation on our own terms so that we can continue to empower our cultural sector to unlock that potential, from within.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Speech given by Harry\_Verwayen, Executive Director, Europeana Foundation.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnUvso43aj4\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We will be covering the topic of Europe's digital transformation\_in\_a series of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/berlin-summit-explores-the-effects-of-digital-culture\">posts</a>.\_</strong></p>\r\n"

        title: 'The Power of Three: reflections on a Hungarian national workshop with Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>What motivates Hungarian cultural institutions to publish their collections with Europeana? The opportunity to inspire people by telling stories with the material.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Metadata and collections experts from Europeana spent two days in Budapest meeting the largest Hungarian aggregator, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/search?q=PROVIDER%3A%22Forum+Hungaricum+Non-profit+Ltd.%22\">Forum Hungaricum Non-profit Ltd.</a>, and running a workshop with Hungarian cultural heritage institutions</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The power of metadata quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>High-quality metadata is crucial for the visibility of collections in Europeana. The richer and more well-structured the metadata, the more likely it is that the material will be returned in search results. Aggregators are the key intermediaries between cultural heritage institutions and Europeana, enabling the full potential of digitised collections to be realised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s Federica Fantone and Douglas McCarthy visited Forum Hungaricum to explore ways in which improvements in metadata quality could enhance data visibility in Europeana Collections. Adding information about the language used to describe objects, and making a clear distinction between information about the physical object and information about its digital representation were identified as two priority tasks. Forum Hungaricum now has the chance to present this specific feedback to its network of partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The power of frameworks and case studies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While good collaboration between aggregators and Europeana is important, it is vital cultural heritage institutions express their opinions too. This is the basis for every national workshop that Europeana has organised to date. As at previous events, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> was the focal point for the Budapest workshop, which was co-organised by the <a href=\"https://pim.hu/en\">Petőfi Literary Museum</a>, <a href=\"http://en.mandadb.hu/\">Forum Hungaricum</a> and Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case studies are a great way to bring the Publishing Framework to life. Julia Katona from Budapest’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/search?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Schola+Graphidis+Art+Collection%2C+Hungarian+University+of+Fine+Arts+-+High+School+of+Visual+Arts%2C+Budapest%22&amp;view=grid\">Schola Graphidis Art Collection</a> explained how its splendid Art Nouveau collections were featured in <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/06/a-look-back-at-our-art-nouveau-season/\">Europeana’s Art Nouveau season</a> in spring 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just back from Europeana’s national workshop in Varna, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/michal-cudrnak\">Michal Čudrnák</a>, Head of Digital Collections and Services at the<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Slovak+National+Gallery&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\"> Slovak National Gallery</a>, introduced the <a href=\"https://www.webumenia.sk/\">Webumenia</a> portal and described how the Slovak National Gallery has benefited from publishing its collections in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"DouglasMcCarthy_presentation.png\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-07/DouglasMcCarthy_presentation.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 300px;margin:0 auto\"><br><em>Douglas McCarthy, Europeana’s Collections Manager, Art &amp; Photography, presenting at the Hungarian National Workshop, Etele Szüts, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The power of the network</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After the workshop presentations, there was a lively discussion amongst the workshop participants in the room. Two common challenges emerged: firstly, keeping pace with technical and legal developments. Secondly, operating in a framework of conservative policies within organisations. Both challenges can mean that the potential of digitised collections is not fully exploited. On the positive side, becoming acquainted with diverse audiences and involving them with engaging storytelling was recognised as a major opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By publishing cultural heritage on its platform, Europeana can support institutions with sharing and promoting their collections to new audiences. With a greater understanding of these possibilities, and closer connections with Europeana and its network of culture professionals, workshop participants in Budapest can share this knowledge within their own organisations and to communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I am glad to state that the workshop in Budapest was useful and successful for both the organisers and the participants. I trust that we will have opportunities to work together for European culture in the near future as well’. Etele Szüts from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/hu/search?q=PROVIDER%3A%22Forum+Hungaricum+Non-profit+Ltd.%22\">Forum Hungaricum Non-profit Ltd</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<address>\r\n<p></p>\r\n</address>\r\n"

It is based upon sharing knowledge and has the potential to contribute to greater research results and impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The European Commision and Open Science</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the end of May 2018, the European Commission published an update to its <a href=\"https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/676f8a3b-62f6-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Access to and Preservation of Scientific Information in Europe</a> report. This provides an overview of the progress made by the EU Member States in implementing an earlier version (2012) of that report. The 2018 report assesses the policies for open access to publications and research data, as well as for the development of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/einfrastructure\">e-infrastructures</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major undertaking over the next few years,&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />presenting a range of challenges and opportunities, will be the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud\">European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)</a> - the cloud for research data in Europe that the European Commission is working on with EU Member States.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Open Science and Europeana Research</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2018-1522768_en\">New European Agenda for Culture </a>of the European Commission presented&nbsp;in May, the Europeana Foundation is called upon to strengthen its link to the research world. Open access has been the backbone of the Europeana Foundation’s mission since its beginning over ten years ago. This commitment to open access extends to encouraging researchers and institutions to embrace the principles of Open Science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Research is strongly committed to promoting awareness and use of the Europeana platform in academia, its major achievements in terms of content and tools, and its upcoming developments. We also support early career social science and humanities (SSH) scholars within the Research Grants Programme, collaborate with research infrastructures, and hold a dialogue with research communities about EU policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Open Science and the Humanities Conference</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is in this context of a Europe-wide push for openness that the University of Barcelona held the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ub.edu/openscienceandthehumanities/\">Open Science and the Humanities Conference</a>&nbsp;on 21 June 2018 <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />in its historic Aula Magna room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>150 research professionals attended the conference, learning about projects embracing the values of Open Science, as well as leading European e-infrastructures active in the Humanities, specifically Dariah, Ariadne, Clarin and, of course, Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Representing the Europeana Foundation, we introduced our work in academic research, showing how open cultural data supports discovery, reuse and innovation in digital humanities.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>GLAM tech is a new series on Pro News about thought-leadership and digital innovation in the GLAM world.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Tech in focus: what you want to know</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on the momentum gained from the <a href=\"/event/europeanatech-conference-2018\">EuropeanaTech 2018</a> conference, the GLAM tech series talks all things tech: from APIs to IIIF,\_and from the challenges of link rot\_to the success\_of innovators in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing together almost 300 innovators, <a href=\"/post/europeanatech-2018-gorgeous-data-glorious-technology-in-review\">EuropeanaTech 2018</a> highlighted the need and passion for discussion and community in the GLAM sector. Some attendees focused on practical problem-solving, while others engaged in thought-provoking debate. So what have we learned since the conference? What are the next innovations within the <a href=\"/post/open-culture-cultural-heritage-professionals-tell-us-why-we-should-open-up-glam-collections\">GLAM community</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A space to share challenges and successes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked EuropeanaTech Community Manager <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/gregory-markus\">Gregory Markus</a> about the importance of digital innovation for\_cultural heritage institutions,\_and the benefits that communities can bring. Gregory says, ‘Next to content, tech is essential for all GLAMs. If we move forward together, we'll all benefit.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Gregory, the challenges faced by tech professionals are often universal. The overwhelming consensus from EuropeanaTech 2018 was that innovations and challenges are best shared and that there is a passionate group of professionals ready to contribute. Gregory says, ‘It makes the spirit of innovation and development more potent because the knowledge being shared is relevant to everyone.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each week we will be sharing insights and innovations, and looking at challenges\_that affect people working\_in GLAM tech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next edition of <a href=\"/page/europeanatech-insight\">EuropeanaTech\_‘Insight'</a>\_is set to\_be released before the end of the year, which will further explore some of the insights gained from the conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>More information about Europeana’s tech community (and our other communities) will be shared in a series of posts in August 2018.\_If you would like to contribute to the series, contact <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/emily-d-alterio\">Emily D’Alterio</a>, Europeana Editorial and PR Officer.</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Six specialist communities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the first day of the meeting (5 July), the Council formally approved six new communities where ENA members could work together to cultivate and share knowledge, expertise and best practices around a specific topic or area of common interest in a rewarding way. These groups are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeanatech\">Europeana Tech</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Europeana Impact</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">Europeana Copyright</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-research\">Europeana Research</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\">Europeana Education</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators Group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on personal preference, the Councillors were then divided into six groups representing each of the communities. Every group worked on specific community work plan with the objective to implement the new structure and come up with a strategy that can be acted upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A shift in structure: moving towards collaboration and communities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-2018-members-council-meeting-in-the-hague-rebooting-and-starting-afresh\">March 2018</a>, the Council decided to revive the network around special groups of interest. &nbsp;After analysing the existing Europeana and ENA community landscape, they have agreed to integrate these special interest groups into the existing Europeana’s communities in order to have an effective and well-functioning structure in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main focus of the July meeting was to work on developing and/or strengthening Europeana and Network work efforts in both plenary discussions and in breakout groups. The Chair of the Europeana Network Association (ENA), <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\">Merete Sanderhoff</a> explained that this process would mean a shift toward strengthening collaborative community groups. She stated that since the previous meeting, the Management Board had reflected on the structure of the communities and special interest groups, and decided that a collaborative, consultative community approach would be most effective.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What we want to achieve by 2019</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day (6 July), the Councillors then continued working in breakout groups, clarifying basic questions how the communities will function and what they would like to achieve within their first year. Each group has also appointed its Steering Group - a representative body composed of a Community Manager, Community Chair and Vice-Chair responsible for successful community governance, communication and workflow. They agreed on whether they would have Working Groups and Task Forces in place to address specific network and community-related needs, and the best means to regularly keep in touch and informed as well as sharing this to the wider Network through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/blog\">Europeana Pro News</a> articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transformation and Governance changes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides community-building, a number of other topics were also on the agenda. These included Europeana in the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework, preparing the Network for the governance shift, a budget update and the status of Task Forces and Working Groups. Given the incumbent elections of 28 new Councillors in December 2018, and of a new Board in January 2019, the Council discussed how to best prepare the Association for this shift in governance ensuring the continuity of institutional memory, knowledge and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, Europeana Foundation director <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry Verwayen</a> highlighted the most recent developments around Europeana and the ENA in light of the May 2018 <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8544-2018-INIT/en/pdf\">Council Conclusions</a> and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/news/new-european-agenda-culture_en\">New European Agenda for Culture</a>. This included funding and projects awarded for the upcoming four years. Our operational landscape has been changing and the Council will keep playing an important role in the ongoing transformation process in the coming years under the next <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/budget/mff/index2021-2027_en.cfm\">EU Multiannual Financial Framework</a>.</p>\r\n"

Millions of items that have formerly been held in libraries, museums or other cultural heritage institutions are now being shifted onto digital platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This shift towards the digital has amounted in some 300 million cultural heritage objects being accessible online, with access and reuse changing the way that we as a society engage with and experience culture. Ordinarily, we focus on the incredible benefits that these advancements have afforded the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a recent article that was published on (but has since been removed from) <em>Forbes </em>online titled ‘Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money’ highlights an important element of digital transformation: when digital transformation necessitates actions that fail to uphold social, cultural, and simply human, values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why do some digital transformations miss the mark where others do not? This can be surmised in two parts: digital transformation that ignores social responsibility and that which prioritises short-term financial return.</p>\r\n"

Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, combining a digital library with a Starbucks hasn’t really struck a chord with Twitter users, who have strongly criticised the initiative. Amazon itself has long held the blame for its negative impact on print book publishing and book retailers, and commentary within the cultural heritage sector shows fears of a similar outcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Panos himself points to this link but clearly misses the point that this is not a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What the digital initiative fails to include is the social importance of spaces like libraries - that are free and accessible for all. Spaces that showcase what we value as a society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Europeana Network Association Chair Nick Poole commented to the Bookseller Online that the inherent value of libraries had been missed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick states, ‘The role of libraries is not, and never has been, to solely provide access to books. The role of libraries is to equip the whole of society with the skills, information, connections and services they need to flourish.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are spaces for exchange, social or otherwise and are some of the last hubs for communication and sharing that is tax-funded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spaces where the goal is sharing, not buying.</strong></p>\r\n"

This is why Amazon should replace local libraries. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value or Amazon all in one fell swoop.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Librarian and writer Cyree Jarelle Johnson posted searing feedback on Twitter, pointing out the socio-economic disparity between an Amazon retailer and a public library. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cyree states, ‘Libraries by Amazon would eliminate the most important function libraries have - as a socialised daytime service to cash-poor and working class people left behind by digital advances.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Nick, the prioritisation of short-term financial gain undermines the overall worth of these spaces and is shortsighted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick states, ‘It is unfortunate to see an economist misrepresent our sector and fail to understand the value of investing in literature, learning for all.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The removal of the article and the ‘outpouring of support from people that love their libraries’ is a strong suggestion that this move is not representative of the majority. However, it is more important now than ever that this sector finds innovative ways to evolve with the digital so as not to be overtaken by those who do not hold our shared values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        title: 'GLAM tech: Making viewing items on Europeana Collections seamless with the Europeana Media Proxy'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>There’s always some construction going on\_behind the scenes of Europeana Collections. We're constantly making\_improvements to make searching for and viewing cultural heritage seamless. One of our tools is the Europeana Media Proxy. In this GLAM tech series post, we tell you all about it.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana Collections </a>displays\_images, videos and audio files through a standardised viewer. A\_piece of software called the Europeana Media Proxy (or EMP for short) helps display millions of media objects on the individual item pages of the Europeana Collections website in a consistent manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How it works</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you request a record that has a direct link to a supported media object, it is displayed on a page of the Collections website itself, as opposed to requiring you to first navigate to the data provider’s website to view it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana does not store media objects. We instead display them from the address provided by the data partner. This is where the EMP comes in: instead of including direct references to the media on the partner’s web systems in the HTML of the item page, we include a reference to the URL of the EMP configured to indicate which record and media object you want to view.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why it’s valuable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This has a number of advantages over directly linking to the item. Most importantly, it allows us to display media objects hosted on hundreds of different systems operated by our data providers in a uniform way. In addition, it also allows us to ensure that the entire user session is secured via SSL so that we can offer you \_a maximum level of security and privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EMP allows us to provide a state-of-the-art user experience without Europeana having to store the media objects. As a result, our data partners continue to have full control over all of the digital content that they make available on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to learn more about how the Europeana Media Proxy works on a technical level, please continue below where we have reproduced the section of the Europeana infrastructure documentation that describes the EMP service.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting technical</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana Media Proxy architecture\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-07/Europeana%20Media%20Proxy%20architecture%20diagram.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europeana Media Proxy architecture, Europeana, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Purpose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EMP serves media such as images, audio and video from data providers’ web systems to end-users. The diagram above shows its high-level architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The need for the EMP arose from the fact that Europeana Collections presents media from many different third-party systems and strives to do so as consistently as is practical. These third-party systems run a variety of web server software, resulting in a variety of HTTP headers being included in, and omitted from, responses, and a variety of error-handling strategies. The Media Proxy aims to normalise these various upstream HTTP responses to support consistent presentation in Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Functionality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EMP receives HTTP requests for media objects associated with the cultural heritage objects published by Europeana, either in the 'edm:isShownBy' or one of the'\_edm:hasViews' of the record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To prevent abuse as a general-purpose proxy, incoming requests are validated against the Search API to verify that the requested remote media object is in fact one ingested into Europeana. If not, the request is rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EMP then requests the media object from the provider’s web systems, normalises response headers, and proxies the media to the client. In the case of encountering errors from the provider, normalised error\_responses are sent to the client.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Structure</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Media Proxy is a simple Rack web application with one endpoint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tools</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://github.com/puma/puma\">Puma</a> is used as the web server.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Code library dependencies are managed with <a href=\"http://bundler.io/\">Bundler</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Automated testing uses <a href=\"https://relishapp.com/rspec/\">RSpec</a>.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Usage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the Europeana Collections item pages display media hosted on provider’s websites, they do so via the Media Proxy, with some exceptions for embedded media such as IIIF and iFrames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given a Europeana record with ID '/09102/_GNM_693983', and one of its media objects having the URL \_<a href=\"http://www.mimo-db.eu/media/GNM/IMAGE/MIR1097_1279787057222_2.jpg\">http://www.mimo-db.eu/media/GNM/IMAGE/MIR1097_1279787057222_2.jpg</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/09102/_GNM_693983.html\">Europeana Collections page</a> for this item will display this media object from the Media Proxy URL:\_<a href=\"https://proxy.europeana.eu/09102/_GNM_693983?view=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mimo-db.eu%2Fmedia%2FGNM%2FIMAGE%2FMIR1097_1279787057222_2.jpg\">https://proxy.europeana.eu/09102/_GNM_693983?view=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mimo-db.eu%2Fmedia%2FGNM%2FIMAGE%2FMIR1097_1279787057222_2.jpg</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The URL path for the request to the media proxy is the Europeana record ID. The view parameter in the URL query indicates an 'edm:hasView' of the record to proxy. If the view parameter is omitted, then the media object for the record’s 'edm:isShownBy' will be proxied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more articles like these, view the entire <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/glam-tech-a-new-series-focusing-on-all-things-tech\">GLAM tech</a> series on Pro News.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is digital transformation?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we discuss the digital transformation, sometimes it is difficult to pinpoint just what that means - let alone what it means for citizens in their daily lives. Is its importance cemented in the digital - with a focus on the capabilities of a new technological landscape? Or is it more important to focus on the aspects of social and cultural shifts - the much more abstract changes in behaviours, interaction and understanding?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Executive Director Harry Verwayen, it’s all of these things. It’s the European Union supporting Europe in realising its full potential through new technologies. And it is making sure that we as Europeana in turn support that goal, specifically for the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Digital transformation is an umbrella term that captures the impact of digital innovation on the ground in different sectors,’ says Harry, ‘but when we talk about digital transformation, we must also ask: transforming into what? And how? For us at Europeana, we do not simply apply technology, we apply it sensibly and with serious consideration to implementing our values.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Shaping tech innovation with values</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But how does this translate to our vision of a digital Europe?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>It means that content and technology needs to be accessible. It needs to be easy-to-use and open, otherwise, the reach of any social or economic impact will be limited to the privileged few. In action? This includes developing rights statements, such as those available through <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/\">RightsStatements.org</a>, to guide institutions and individuals how they can reuse digital cultural heritage objects.</li>\r\n    <li>It means that technological innovation needs to be community-based and reciprocal. We need to work as a network, rather than as individuals, combining the best of sector knowledge and practices. Offline, this looks like the Europeana Network Association. In the digital, this is seen in the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?locale=en&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A&amp;view=grid\">user-generated content</a> uploaded as a part of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration</a> campaign, whereby in addition to viewing Europeana’s digital cultural heritage, the public was invited to <a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/migration\">add to it</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>It means that technology needs to work and be well-structured, with users and their data safeguarded. In practice, this means supporting the GDPR processes. It means improving data quality and providing support to network partners in taking their cultural heritage online.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>For cultural heritage institutions, this also involves further shifting practices to the digital. While the shift has been progressing over the last 15-20 years, and some <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Presidencies%20White%20Paper.pdf\">300 million objects have been digitised</a>, the fact still remains that we are in the midst of shifting an operating system to digital that has been analogue for the last 500 years. We are still operating from an analogue paradigm and we still need to empower the public to make use, reuse, or put simply, do things, with their heritage. Only <a href=\"https://openglam.org/category/case-studies/\">7%</a> of digital cultural heritage is available for explicit reuse on social media, Wikimedia and so on. Europeana aims to accelerate these efforts through the implementation of frameworks, standards, projects and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Digital transformation is something that happens to society, and if you want to accelerate that, you have to remove obstacles,’ says Harry, ‘I think one of them is a lack of understanding and skills, and that’s where I would like Europeana and its network to play a role. To transmit all of the knowledge that we gather and bring that to the sector.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A ‘brilliant’ example of the digital transformation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Harry, in particular, digital transformation can be readily exemplified through initiatives like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/transcribing-europeana-1914-1918\">Transcribathons</a>. Transcribathons are competitions whereby teams (from schools, institutions or the general public) compete to transcribe handwritten texts online. Teams work on a digital object (for example, a diary from WWI) and a jury award points for the quantity and quality of the transcription and the presentation of the result, with a prize awarded to the winning team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For him Transcribathons symbolise cultural impact: they transcend age, race and time, and bring both young and old together through a shared experience of cultural history, creating a new ritual. Furthermore, reading and engaging with the stories from the First World War creates a connection to the past that is deeply moving for those who participate. It changes the way people interact with their culture and their history; facilitated by the digital and transformed by the connection to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I’m a huge fan of Transcribathons. They have an impact in many areas and are a way of making fantastic analogue content machine-readable, and therefore, translatable,’ says Harry, ‘but further, by going through this process, and this ritual, participants engage with each other and the past digitally in a way that has never been done before.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/246759639\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/246759639\">Berlin Transcribathon 2017 interviews (music)</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n<title></title>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What makes us different?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Europeana, our values are summarised in our mantra of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/guiding-values\">usable, mutual, reliable</a>. It is these values at the heart of Europeana that sets us apart from technological innovators of Silicon Valley - our focus on impact and a culturally rich and unified Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>‘Silicon Valley is really based on individualism and entrepreneurship, which certainly has some advantage,’ says Harry, ‘But Europeana is really here to build a common infrastructure and change from within.’</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The democratisation of information through technology has and will lead to endless opportunity for transformation. It is up to us to make that change worthwhile by implementing our social values, European values, onto the great and complex technological frameworks we are building. By recognising the social power of our cultural heritage, we can make the most out of evolving technologies.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the past ten years of &nbsp;Europeana, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/glam-tech\">GLAM tech</a> field has not stood still. Many positive developments in the area of metadata quality have increased the user experience, reusability, and accessibility of data shared by cultural heritage institutions. With a database of over 58 million objects, it is not only a daily task to publish new material, but to also work on cleaning and updating existing datasets on the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Collections</a> platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Metadata quality is one of the main areas of focus for the Data Partner Services team, in close collaboration with aggregators, data partners, and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee</a>. Together, we work towards polishing the database to make it shine a bit more every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Cleaning up data for an improved user experience</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a variety of data quality objectives that we work on, but one problem that particularly affects people’s enjoyment of cultural heritage material is the phenomenon known as ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">link rot</a>’. Sadly, this is a problem that we face on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not all datasets of institutions (especially those which were published on Europeana in its infancy) have been regularly updated to keep track of the latest data quality standards. In fact, there might be objects that have been published and not updated in line with the latest minimum EDM requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n"

In some cases, in addition to a broken link to an object on Europeana, the link to the holding institution may also be broken, preventing the visitor from finding and downloading the picture, sound file, video, or text directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such ‘dead records’ don’t do anyone any good, causing disappointment and frustration when a visitor finds something interesting and can’t use it as anticipated. Furthermore, it affects our Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) negatively and making it more difficult for people to find the cultural heritage objects that GLAMs have shared with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Fighting link rot and dying data: reviving lost culture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But there is a happy ending to this sad story of broken links. &nbsp;With the joint hard efforts of our aggregators and data partners, we work every day to fix the broken material and restore access to the users by bringing the records back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Of course, it is not always possible to fix some material. After close consultation with our partners, in some cases, we have to take the hard decision to take the material offline. It’s a difficult decision, but in disabling the broken material, the overall data quality of what we do offer increases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Have you found any broken links?

        body: "<p>In celebration of their 10th edition, the partners behind the European Union Prize for Literature (EUPL) reached out to the 108 previous winners, inviting them to write a European short story. The compilation includes stories from 36 authors in nearly as many languages. Translations of the original texts are also included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director of the Federation of European Publishers and Europeana Network Association member Anne Bergman-Tahon is part of the partnership behind the prize. She speaks highly of the cultural diversity of the project and is proud of the submissions and authors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne says, ‘This could be your summer read! It will definitely be one of mine. Think about it, 36 countries, almost as many languages, emerging authors whose literature can be promoted and shared with millions of European readers.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vote for your favourite story</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUPL is also asking readers\_to <a href=\"http://anniversary.euprizeliterature.eu/vote\">vote</a> for their favourite story. So embrace your inner literature critic\_and you might even win a prize - ten voters will be selected to attend the awards ceremony in Vienna in November. Voting closes on 21 October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also a heritage theme to this anthology. As it’s the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/european-year-cultural-heritage-2018_en\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>, stories in which European heritage plays a significant role will be eligible for a special jury prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the publication and voting process are accessible to people who are visually impaired.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Download the book</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the <a href=\"http://anniversary.euprizeliterature.eu/book/EUPLbookWeb_acc.pdf\">e-book</a>\_and enjoy your summer reading.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What motivated the Trust to develop an open access policy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ve been moving towards changing our policy at <a href=\"http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/\">Birmingham Museums Trust (BMT)</a> for some time. The Trust was founded in 2012 through the merger of Birmingham City Council-owned Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery and Birmingham’s science museum, Thinktank. At this point, we had started to use an <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">attribution-non-commercial</a> licence for images we shared online prior to 2009. At that time, it seemed entirely appropriate. Now it seems out of step with the digital age we live in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BMT consists of around 800,000 objects, displayed and stored in our nine venues. Most areas of the collection are designated as being of national importance, including the largest public collection of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world. We felt that the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/\">CC BY-NC</a> licence had too many drawbacks. For instance, it deflected people who wanted to use BMT’s images in ways that would have increased the visibility and knowledge of our collection. Academics, in particular, felt like we were acting as gatekeepers, blocking the use of images in research and academic publications. It was also very difficult for us to enforce this licence as we don’t have the resources to pursue people who use images commercially without permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The open access policy has developed from our values. It is in line with our charitable objectives and our aim to grow and diversify our audience.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>There was still some apprehension around the policy, but what made this the perfect moment to win approval for open access is the fact that Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery will be closing for a period of redevelopment, currently planned from late 2019 until 2022. We want to ensure that people can continue to access and use our collection digitally despite not being able to physically visit our flagship museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tell us about the decision-making process, the stakeholders and influencers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>BMT has much in common with other cultural institutions worldwide who have released their images into the public domain. We want to make our collection accessible to as many people as possible, and this includes extending the reach and use of its digital assets worldwide. I researched who had done what, the reasons they gave, and the pros and cons of their decisions. The Europeaneau blog series ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=Museums+in+the+digital+age\">Museums in the Digital Age</a>’ on GLAMs and open access was particularly useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As BMT is a charitable trust, I was very aware of the pressures to generate income. We do not make a great deal of money from licensing images, but nevertheless, it does bring in some money, and our digital assets are perceived as having the potential to generate more income as we develop products that are inspired from our collections. I knew that this could be a major issue for stakeholders. Working with BMT’s Digital Media and Rights Officer Nadine Lees, we came up with a compromise proposal whereby we would charge for licences of high-resolution images but we would release medium-resolution images (maximum of 300 ppi and 3Mb) into the public domain under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">CC0 waiver</a>. From her dealings with academics, Nadine felt that this image size would meet their needs. It would mean a small loss of income but would remove some of the concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I wrote a paper with a series of options which I presented to BMT’s Directors, and after their approval, it went to the Board of Trustees. I had full support from my Director of Engagement, Janine Eason, in this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was a question as to why we were not going for a CC BY licence. My argument was that we should not insist on attribution as we did not have the resources to monitor this. I also believed it could be a potential barrier to usage. Further, It also seemed very likely that most academics would give attribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The positive aspects of opening up collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The positive elements for the open access policy as set out included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>Meets legal requirements of the Re-use of Public Sector Information Regulations 2015</li>\r\n    <li>In line with international and national practice</li>\r\n    <li>In line with BMT’s charitable objects</li>\r\n    <li>Allows for commercial exploitation of high-resolution images</li>\r\n    <li>Allows academics and researchers to use BMT images for research and publication at no cost</li>\r\n    <li>Allows BMT to provide public access to the collection (digitally) during a period of closure for Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery.</li>\r\n    <li>Allows key partners, e.g. Wikipedia, to use BMT images, which they cannot at present</li>\r\n    <li>Increases public and commercial awareness of BMT’s digital assets</li>\r\n    <li>Clear and simple to understand (BMT currently releases images on a range of different licence arrangements which is confusing and difficult to manage)</li>\r\n    <li>Allows BMT to maintain the income we receive from print on demand services and commercial use of high-resolution images</li>\r\n    <li>Addresses criticisms by the academic community of current paid-for licences to use images for research and academic purposes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"

However, we were aware that we had to do more to get the message out there and to get people thinking creatively about what they could do with the images. We held our first Digital Lab in March 2017 in order to bring people from the culture sector and technologists together to explore what they could create when they worked together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the next couple of years BMT will hold a series of <a href=\"http://bmagremixed.co.uk/\">Digital Labs</a> (remix events), funded as part of Arts Council England’s NPO programme, that will introduce audiences to the idea of accessing and creatively using our images, whether by community projects, schools, FE/HE, SMEs &nbsp;or for individual use. BMT will also look to work with partners to encourage full access to images, particularly Wikipedia and Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who do you think will benefit the most?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think it will particularly benefit academics and researchers. I also hope that teachers will use the images in schools; that local community projects will find it a great resource for their work; and that creatives will be inspired to use them in things that they build and develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How will the policy work in practice?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Images will be released through the Asset Bank digital asset management system (DAMS) when we make it public-facing. At that point, people will be able to download and freely use all images in the public domain. We hope to make the first release of images via the DAMS in autumn 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have about 50,000 images and this number will grow. Over the next couple of years, we will be doing an increased amount of digitisation in preparation for moving objects out of Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, prior to redevelopment of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BMT will not release any images that are still in the copyright of the artist or maker, that have third-party copyright (e.g. trademarks) or are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_work\">orphan works</a>. We do not have the resources to undertake rights clearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What advice would you give to other museums considering open access?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It might be best to say come back in a year and answer that question! I would advise people who would like to do the same, but think it would be an impossibility at the museum they work for, to not give up. Find your case studies, identify the benefits, build your argument and look at ways that you might be able to minimise perceived risks. It may be difficult to create the change, but I think the first step is to make this an ongoing conversation rather than to accept that the answer is no.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>More than halfway through Europeana Migration, we stop to highlight some key takeaways already gained and get a word from our Chief Culture Officer Zubia Naqvi on the importance of multiculturalism and a globalised Europe.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Europeana Migration - what we've learned</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In celebration of the European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018, Europeana has been running a series of collection days and events involving cultural heritage institutions across Europe that focus on migration. We have now begun the process of unpacking the lessons learned and findings that have come of an exploration of migration both in and out of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It came as a surprise to us when political conversation centred on comments suggesting that migration into Europe was causing a loss of European culture. Because in August of 2018, after an intensive eight months of getting to the heart of migration, we couldn’t disagree more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month, we have been spotlighting the cultural impacts of communities as we launch\_the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">Europeana Network Communities</a>. This focus is also prevalent on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a>, with stories of migrant communities and their positive impacts on society showcased. The key learning that is increasingly coming out of these stories is that we function better in diverse communities - whether it be the broad special interest communities at Europeana (led by Foundation and Members Councillors from around the world) or the diverse migrant communities of Europe and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Communities, culture and inward migration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlighting this point, EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum, Dublin is offering to celebrate emigration and its great cultural impact on their August 18-19 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/288684085234980/\">Europeana Migration Collection Day event: New Irish Communities</a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EPIC museum curator Nathan Mannion says that it wouldn’t be possible to discuss Ireland and Irish communities today, without exploring the fact that these communities are made up of people from many cultures and nationalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nathan says, ‘Various different nationalities are living in Ireland today; some are Irish citizens. [We aim to] invite them to share their stories in particular. There is a whole host of nationalities that are engaging with the museum at present, so the focus on inward migration was an obvious choice.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, we've held six collection days in six European countries, collected over 200 stories from members of the public relating to their or their families'\_experiences of migration. We've heard stories of children, parents, grandparents, stretching across 17\_decades, from 1837 until today,\_and more than 70 countries. People of all ages have taken part: the youngest just five, the oldest 92. Just over the midpoint in our exploration of the topic, the message is clear: migration has strong democratising power and creates a space for exchange.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Diversity as a\_strength, not a weakness</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And our findings don't just come from our external campaign. They are also evident when looking at the staff within our own organisation. Chief Culture Officer Zubia Naqvi says that Europeana Foundation’s 26 nationalities is one of its strongest assets and greatest core strengths as a workplace community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zubia says, ‘We are a multicultural, diverse and dynamic group of people that work together because we believe that we can transform the world with culture. We see our diversity as a catalyst for change because we want to keep evolving, actively working, using our skills, and working with culture and technology to contribute to a more dynamic society.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are still learning about European migration, and understanding everything that makes up\_European identity. But what we know for sure?\_Cultural\_sharing does not equate to cultural dilution. This is key to what we believe at Europeana, and we hope throughout the European Year of Culture Heritage to amplify the messages and stories of Europeans, no matter their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In addition to the next event in Ireland, see the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration/collection-days.html\">full list</a> of planned collection events around Europe in 2018. See the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?locale=en&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A&amp;view=grid\">stories</a>\_we have collected so far, or\_<a href=\"https://contribute.europeana.eu/migration\">share</a>\_your own.</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is Erfgoed Brabant, and what are its main activities?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are an organisation at a regional level which assists museums and other cultural heritage organisations and we connect&nbsp;the cultural heritage sector and the Dutch province of North Brabant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We do this in a few different ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">applying for funds</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">organising activities</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">education (bringing schools and museums together)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">providing advice to various people</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You do a lot to support cultural heritage organisations. Do you also run projects by yourself?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We do run our own projects. The biggest at the moment is Brabant Cloud which is a technical support for smaller organisations to share their data. Most of these organisations can’t do this by themselves due to lack of funds or knowledge. By giving them access to this technical infrastructure, we can provide resources and skills to digitise and give access to their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also have a <a href=\"http://www.brabantserfgoed.nl\">website</a>. This showcases stories and also provides data from the smaller organisations. Together, you have the data, digital access and the stories. At the moment, around 100 organisations have their content in Brabant Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">You are very active on a regional level. Why did you decide to organise a youth event on a European level?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We first developed a Youth Panel for young professionals in 2017. I have been their coordinator since September 2017. We have a meeting once a month to talk about being young in the heritage sector, something that can be quite difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A few of my colleagues went to the 2017 Europa Nostra conference in Finland. The province of North-Brabant and Erfgoed Brabant itself have a membership and we wanted to present on a European level. However, my colleagues were quite shocked at the representation of young professionals, or rather, the lack thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People deemed a young professional in this sector may be in their late 30s or early 40s. If you are younger than that, it can be difficult to be taken seriously, and there are big age gaps between colleagues. It can also be very difficult to get your foot in the door. In this sector, it’s normal for young people to start as a volunteer or do unpaid internships. However, this is problematic when this is still expected at 35.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We wanted to show that young professionals have a lot to offer even if it is different from their more experienced colleagues. This includes developing&nbsp;innovative ideas and contemporary best practice. Organisations need staff of all ages. We wanted to show that on a European level with the advantage of our Europa Nostra membership and platform. We knew we were ambitious - but in the end - it really worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What reactions have you received when you presented the idea of organising an event for young people?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were glad that fellow project members, Provinces of Gelderland and Overijsel, think in the same way as we about young professionals. Our regional ministers were supportive of the idea and plans, which was great given that they provided the funding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had some very positive reactions from Europa Nostra, but we also had some difficulties. While we were able to run the programme, when we wanted to have a small presentation on stage, it turned out to be difficult to fit us into the larger programme (which had time constraints in terms of scheduling). So while the organisers of the European Policy Debate wanted to give us our moment, they also had priority, high-profile guests. We had a nice event, but there is still a long way to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was great to hold the programme that we paid for ourselves; the next step will be to become a more integral part of the Summit. We’re not quite there yet.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What were the steps that you took from the idea to the actual event in Berlin?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: In December 2017, we brought together a group of young professionals from the three provinces we were working with. They created ideas, tested them and made decisions as to how the Summit would run. The idea to call for proposals also came from these focus group meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: In February 2017, we started to work on the programme and got in touch with a few of the venues. We also contacted the British Council who became our event partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: In March 2017, we published a call for proposals which was open for a month. During the first three weeks it looked like there wouldn’t be that many sessions, but during the last week, the response exploded. In total, we had 25 presentations. People came from all over Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had around 60 participants from 16 countries covering different disciplines within cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 4: After we received all of the proposals, we made a choice to organise Skype calls to discuss each presentation personally. We thought at first that we would have, perhaps, ten presentations. But when we received so many great proposals, we decided to make the presentations shorter to accommodate more people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We wanted to communicate that&nbsp;we were aware that people had put a lot of work into their presentations. We wanted to help them make the best of it. We also knew that in different countries, universities and organisations, that there are different ways of communicating and presenting, and this is sometimes very formal. We wanted to make sure each person understood this and to prepare their presentations accordingly. I received&nbsp;very positive feedback about this approach and I would try to do something similar again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We had a lot of great presentations, a lot of diversity in themes and nice discussions. It was also the proof that statements like: ‘young people don’t care about cultural heritage’ are absolutely untrue. These sessions showed the complete opposite - people were so invested and put so much time into what they shared.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Young Professionals Summit was a great success. Do you have ideas or plans for the next steps?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’d love to do something more and continue the work we started in Berlin - especially because of all of the positive feedback we received. Not necessarily another Summit - but I think it’s great to try something new and explore different ideas and opportunities. Format aside, the most important thing is that young people become an integral part of discussions and activities in the sector. Young people are already here, they are cultural heritage professionals with so much to offer.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When speaking about his key takeaways from the recent collection day, Nathan remarks how struck he has been with the individuality of the significant items participants shared. At both collection events, ‘Share your Story’ and ‘New Communities’ supported by Europeana in celebration of the larger Migration project for the Year of Cultural Heritage, a total of 60 stories were shared and will form a part of the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration Collection</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From stories that centered&nbsp;on the sharing of food, to that of jewellery or photographs, Nathan describes how this symbolic act of sharing was a cathartic experience for those who were able to explore ‘their identity in a way that many people have never done before’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What was the process of organising these Migration collection events?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hosting three collections weekends throughout the year, we knew that we wanted to make each one unique. We felt that if we themed the events, it might promote wider engagement throughout the year. Our initial theme was on return migration. Our aim was to get people who had lived overseas for a period and had come back to Ireland to share their stories with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our second collection weekend on 18-19 August was held during the annual Heritage Week celebrations in Ireland. The theme of Heritage Week 2018 &nbsp;is ‘share your story’ so we felt it was the ideal time to record the experiences of our new Irish communities. Today Ireland is home to people from every corner of the world but their stories aren’t traditionally included in the Irish narrative, so we particularly wanted to give them a voice and record their experiences. &nbsp;People of every nationality are already engaging with the museum at present, so we felt ready to explore Ireland’s story of inward migration a little more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In November, for our final collection weekend, we are going to commemorate the centenary of women’s suffrage in Ireland. We have called the event ‘Migrant Women’, so any woman who has a story, we want them to share it. So whether they are Irish, or returning to Ireland, new to Ireland, or even a descendant or someone from elsewhere, we want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to share stories that they otherwise might not be able to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What surprised you most about the stories collected?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What surprised me most was the variety of experiences. I think even with a large sample, no two stories were alike. You might have stories from people who have left from the same place, who may use similar objects as a means by which to tell their story, but no two are ever identical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We learned that people often possess strong emotional connections to objects that would have no inherent financial value; they might not even have a strong familial tie. Taken out of context, you wouldn’t understand its significance. But to them, it's symbolic of a moment in their life that they wish to preserve. To them, maybe it captures that sense of transition from one identity to another. It might represent that duality to some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also found that by telling the story of an object, rather than just discussing their experience of immigration, some people found it much easier to explore their identity in a way that they may have never done before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had many people who came to the collecting weekend answering questions about their objects that they have never even posed to themselves before. It was a sort of journey of discovery that they found very surprising - which we found very surprising. And a number of them told us that they actually found the experience very therapeutic - it was a chance to unload a part of their story, or their family’s story, to somebody else. They felt that now that it had been shared and it would be displayed publicly, it was safeguarded for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many felt a sense of duty towards their families, or themselves, that a certain aspect of their identity should be preserved. They also shared a belief that museums, archives and libraries exist to help people embrace their past and to preserve their heritage for the future, for those who come after them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><img alt=\"Epic_image2.jpg\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/Epic_image2.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 550px;margin:0 auto\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2084002/contributions_cbd87c60_4191_0136_c953_1a35ead45b99.html?q=gerard+leen\">Wedding Present to Another Generation</a> | Gerard Leen, Europeana Collections, 2018, CC BY-SA</em><em><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How do you use the Europeana platform or services?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Migration project for the European Year of Cultural Heritage (EYCH) was our gateway to Europeana. Europeana reached out to us directly when they were looking for national partners to take part in the project. We are the Irish Emigration Museum; so these are the type of stories we interact with every day. We exist to share and record stories of Irish migration and to promote engagement with this aspect of our cultural heritage, so it was a natural collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we were introduced to the project, we thought it was fantastic, and we saw the potential for it. Also, the need for it, on the European stage, particularly in the EYCH. We had come across Europeana already but hadn’t yet found a way to collaborate, so for us, this project was almost tailor-made!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EPIC is a very young organisation. We’ve only been open two years, so it is very exciting to take part in something like this. We have found that it's been very beneficial to be able to meet and interact with all of the other cultural institutions from across Europe who also focus on migration. While we might have had links with these institutions on a one-to-one basis, this is our first experience working together on a core project that everyone can participate in. The opportunity to share knowledge, share wisdom, share training and to share feedback, we have found really beneficial, and it wouldn’t have been possible if we hadn’t been involved in the Europeana project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How does digitisation affect the works and projects you undertake?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EPIC is a digitally focused museum. We don’t have huge collections of historical objects. Instead, we use the personal stories of the individual as the means by which we shape, and share our narrative. So for us, nearly our entire collection could be considered ‘digital’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important for us to be at the forefront in terms of making sure that everything we record is available online and in a format that people can access widely. So for us, any project that embraces digitisation is a sound one, it helps us contribute to a valued public resource. &nbsp;As an institution, it also enables us to enhance our existing collection and provides new material for our education programs. Secondly, through participation in projects like this, we are also able to reach a much wider audience and create greater public awareness of our work. So, while such work will always be a key responsibility of ours, it also brings many benefits to the museum itself and is a real pleasure to collaborate on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are EPIC’s next big plans?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EPIC is constantly expanding. On-site, the physical footprint of the museum continues to grow. We’ve just developed a new education space and a new temporary exhibition gallery and they’re already hives of activity. We’ll also be officially launching our new education program next month in time for the new school term alongside our new programme of Autumn/Winter events guide. A highlight, of course, will be our final ‘Story Collecting Weekend’ focusing on the experiences of migrant women in November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Next year we’re planning to carry out a legacy project following on from the collection weekends. We’ll be launching an online campaign to gather more stories that illustrate Irish migration through our own web portal, so we’ll never really stop collecting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’re always looking to expand and grow, so as always there is a lot of work on our plates, but its blue skies on the horizon and we couldn’t be more excited!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Europeana Communicators today</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So where are we today? What do we want and what can we offer? This community is all about communicating - we discuss the latest cultural campaigns from Europeana and the group's members, as well as the important communications topics and approaches relevant to the cultural heritage world today. This way, every member becomes part of a movement promoting digital cultural heritage across Europe. We want to give a stronger follow-up to <a href=\"http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8544-2018-INIT/en/pdf\">recommendations</a> of the Council of the European Union “to continue the ongoing dialogue and cooperation with existing networks in the field of cultural heritage that has accumulated valuable experience and proved their competences in the field” (#24).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are about sharing our communications expertise, our tailored networks and our insights so that we can support the cultural heritage sector. It may not be about spreading the word by shouting more loudly. &nbsp;And we definitely don’t want to shout into a silo. We are open and accessible. We ask: how can we make and accept meaningful connections? What are the needs of institutions and the broader community? How do we communicate transparently not only what Europeana does and can do, but also what we still need to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Peter’s Vision</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to make our ideas tangible. We will begin by growing a community of people experienced in communications, social media and blogging in order to develop further ideas. We need to start or revive channels for two-way communication. We need people in all different roles, from advisors to connectors, but also people executing practical ideas that come up in the community - from the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the ideas of people like Michael Peter Edson, Merete Sanderhoff and Pier Luigi Sacco, we believe that even ‘the general public/culture lovers’ sometimes want to participate, that they can provide valuable input and&nbsp;cooperation on some matters. We are willing to try some new things and to accept new ideas and volunteers in our efforts to promote (digital) cultural heritage in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, in doing this, we much first ask some questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li>What is needed to get such cooperation from cultural workers, bloggers and culture lovers? Do they connect to our passion for the promotion of culture in Europe? Can they feel it?</li>\r\n    <li>Do we recognise that there is a need for cross-border&nbsp;exchange about culture in Europe and that we could contribute to that?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to answer these questions. And if you do too, then join us!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Talk to us! &nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Sign up for our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-communicators-group\">monthly newsletter</a>.

However, it's not enough to correctly apply rights statements, we have to do so in multiple languages. With this goal in mind, we instigated a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/can-we-achieve-multilingual-copyright-information-on-europeana\">multilingual translation trial</a> of basic copyright and reuse terms into 28 official EU languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because it is important for us to ensure that the translations are accurate and reliable, we decided to use the goodwill of our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">Copyright Community</a> and reached out to our members for their expertise and interest in copyright. Starting with a target of five translations of 26 expressions - general, descriptive and commonly used copyright terms - &nbsp;we’ve taken a conservative approach, to begin with, while being open to new ideas and trying out different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;A great community feel</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Advertising the trial in the second <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/cd92295482a1/welcome-to-the-first-newsletter-of-the-europeana-copyright-community-518729\">Copyright Community newsletter</a> brought us much more than we’d hoped for. We got an enthusiastic response from five fantastic community members, who were happy to help us and did a great job translating the 26 copyright expressions into German, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, and Basque language. Not only did they translate the terms quickly and correctly, but most even offered to help us with larger-scale translations and other copyright-related activities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs we wish to learn from this process and share our progress with the community, we asked them to provide us with a feedback on their impressions of the experience.</p>\r\n"

We couldn’t agree more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘As an active supporter of open access I believe it is also vital to underline the importance of copyright and contribute to help users understand it properly’, says Irina, ‘I found the translation was an extremely useful exercise for me personally since it required a deeper research of the copyright legislation in Romania.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A big thank you!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both Sara and Irina found the translation process a very positive experience - it only took them a few hours. We praise them together with the other translating Community members from Germany, Spain, and Turkey for finding the time and interest to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We couldn’t be happier with having such active and motivated community members, and would like to thank them all! This is the kind of community that we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile, we look for more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are delighted to achieve our primary goal, but we don’t want to stop here. Can you help? If you speak one of the 28 EU languages other than English, German, Romanian, Italian, Spanish, and are interested in providing a translation, let us know at <a href=\"mailto:copyright@europeana.eu\">copyright@europeana.eu</a>. Every contribution is very much appreciated!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe’ll keep sharing our progress. The changes are being implemented and will be visible in the coming weeks.

                body: "<p>By 1907, when the National Library of Wales was founded, Wales had gained a great reputation for its active printing press. In a sense, the Library was a culmination of the most proactive publishing period Wales has ever seen. It also provided an appropriate space for keeping an impressive collection of early Welsh manuscripts, stored at Aberystwyth University before the Library was founded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Originally, the institution’s main focus was to manage documentation and information, rather than understand or interpret sources. However, the establishment of a National Library in Wales emphasised the crucial role of the written word within the national cultural landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Library continues to acknowledge Wales as a singular entity, with its own unique heritage and culture. As stated in the institution’s Royal Charter; the Library is ‘to collect, preserve and give access to all kinds and forms of recorded knowledge, especially relating to Wales and the Welsh people.’. It is, therefore, a valued cultural institution that serves as the memory of a nation. The National Library of Wales unquestionably enhances the notion of Welsh identity, both through its collections and its very existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Changing role of the National Library of Wales with regards to national literacy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, it may be argued that the role of the library in promoting literacy is as important as ever before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As digital technologies make information more accessible, literacy skills, both traditional (reading, writing, etc.) and new (data analysis, coding, etc.), are needed to manage and interpret collections. Literacy, when defined in broader contemporary terms, are the sets of skills needed to create, manage and interpret information in the digital age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In a society where information is ‘universally’ accessible, does the role of a Library (rather than the information it holds) define its value to society?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The National Library of Wales is taking the initiative to embrace participatory technologies and movements that create opportunities to develop and exercise literacy skills, while also enabling deeper engagement with its collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

Likewise, crowdsourcing projects such as Cynefin and the transcription of the Cardiganshire War Tribunal Records have introduced participatory digital technologies to participants and created a space for further discussion regarding historical information. It is vital that libraries are at the forefront of innovation when promoting literacy in its many forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">True to its founding principles, the National Library of Wales continues to collect, preserve and give access to knowledge in all forms, which now includes born-digital as well as audiovisual and graphical works. Through digitisation, the Library’s collections are made more accessible both for viewing and re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Committing to widening access to knowledge and supporting individuals and communities in their interpretation and engagement with its collections, the Library has a dynamic role in lifelong learning, social cohesion and the ongoing evolution of Wales’s collective identity as a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>You can find 145,000 objects from the National Library of Wales on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22National+Library+of+Wales%22&amp;view=grid\">Europeana Collections</a>.

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Just a few months on from the third <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeanatech-2018-gorgeous-data-glorious-technology-in-review\">EuropeanaTech international conference</a> in May 2018, it’s become more apparent than ever just how important the EuropeanaTech community is to Europe and the world’s rapidly evolving technical landscape that offers millions access to digitised cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The evolution of a community</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The EuropeanaTech community was born out of the EuropeanaConnect project which ran from 2009-2011. From then, the EuropeanaTech community has been under the responsibility of the Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/research-and-development\">Research and Development (R&amp;D) team</a>, The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision and an invaluable rotating cast of R&amp;D partners (Humboldt, ONB, Sheffield, INESC-ID, AIT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The beauty of EuropeanaTech is that the community operates as a diverse technical network. EuropeanaTech serves as an umbrella body: everyone can come together to ask questions, share projects and transfer knowledge. Further, the community is so diverse and large that people and institutes that are part of the community are always engaged in interesting research, publishing new insights and presenting their work around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to the ever-expanding constituency of EuropeanaTech, at the June 2018 <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/second-2018-members-council-meeting-in-the-hague-transforming-the-europeana-network-association-communities-and-getting-to-work\">Members Council Meeting</a>, those behind EuropeanaTech along with members of the Members Council took a different perspective and began to collectively reexamine the shape of the community, the areas of focus within it, and how we can further empower and engage members. The meeting and the follow-up conversations that occurred since have been a wonderful catalyst for moving forward and will serve to strengthen the community in the future.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<div><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Research/\r\nRomanello_Photo.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\" />\r\n<h3>What is your current academic position and what is your research focus?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am a post-doctoral researcher in the <a href=\"https://dhlab.epfl.ch/\">Digital Humanities Laboratory at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</a> (EPFL). <a href=\"https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=264343&amp;op=publications&amp;lang=en&amp;cvlang=en\">My research</a> explores ways of extracting semantic information (citations, for example) from large collections of texts and how this changes the way scholars can access, read and analyse textual corpora. I have a background in Classics (Ancient Greek and Latin), meaning a substantial part of my digital humanities research and teaching has been devoted to Classics and Archaeology, but more recently I've been working on similar problems related to History. In the last project, <a href=\"https://dhlab.epfl.ch/page-127959-en.html\">Linked Books</a>, we developed a citation index of the literature about the History of Venice - the <a href=\"https://www.venicescholar.eu/\">Venice Scholar</a> – a sort of Google Scholar for Humanities scholars. Currently, I'm working on <a href=\"http://impresso-project.ch/\">Impresso: Media Monitoring of the Past</a>, a project where natural language processing (NLP) specialists, computational linguists, designers and historians are collaborating to co-design a new tool for working with a very large corpus of digitised newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How has Europeana helped you to achieve your research goal?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana research funds (8,000 EUR) enabled us to add two new important features to a tool I had co-developed, the <a href=\"https://www.venicescholar.eu/#search=&amp;ns=15&amp;p=1&amp;h=76f15\">Venice Scholar</a>, which makes the user experience of our users even richer. Any author or publication in our citation index now comes with a new sidebar where relevant objects from Europeana are dynamically retrieved and displayed (see <a href=\"https://www.venicescholar.eu/results#europeana=595faaf1fe768339c0f6c0bd&amp;rT=authors&amp;type=publications&amp;refcat=&amp;refid=\">Marino Sanudo's page</a> for an example). Moreover, the Europeana grant made it possible to design and implement a new section, that we called <a href=\"https://www.venicescholar.eu/venetica\">Venetica</a>, conceived as a visual gallery to present a thematic selection of Europeana contents. Users can pick authors and keywords related to Venice's history and start exploring Europeana's contents, without even leaving the Venice Scholar platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did you discover the Europeana Grants Programme and why did you decide to apply for it?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/giovanni-colavizza\">Giovanni Colavizza</a>, my colleague on the Linked Books project, alerted me to the Europeana call. Together we decided to apply, as this seemed a unique chance to connect the tool we'd just finished developing (the Venice Scholar) with Europeana. There is a large number of digital objects related to the literature about Venice in Europeana, and these materials can be very interesting for people who use Venice Scholar. We just needed a way of making this connection, of uncovering potential links between the two datasets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my research, the availability of digital resources through libraries, archives and museum is everything: no (digital) contents, no mining!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The increasing volume of digital resources available means I'm constantly faced with the issue of ‘finding solutions that scale’. The type of access to digital content offered by heritage institutions also varies a lot. Working with well-designed APIs, like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">those offered by Europeana</a>, can almost be considered a luxury. Often – if not most of the time – we are talking to human (instead of programming) interfaces, parsing exotic or idiosyncratic metadata formats, or scraping contents from static web pages. We’d just love to have an API to query. Cultural heritage institutions are a gold mine of carefully crafted and well-structured metadata, which are an essential resource for anyone working in the field of information extraction. Often, the issue is simply of not being provided with the appropriate ways of accessing those gold mines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find more information in Matteo Romanello’s report below, <a href=\"https://venicescholar.dhlab.epfl.ch/venetica\">explore the project website</a>, and hear from our previous grant winners <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/medieval-manuscript-databases-krista-murchison-europeana-research-grants-winner\">Krista Murchison</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/visual-representations-of-roma-in-19th-and-20th-centuries-caterina-preda-europeana-research-grants-winner\">Caterina Preda</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'From coding projects to 3D Modelling: enriched pedagogical material and recommendations from the User Group'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We get insights from the Europeana Education User Group as they build upon efforts of the Developer Group to mainstream the use of digital culture in education.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The DSI-3 project with European Schoolnet to mainstream the use of digital culture in education started in October 2017 with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mainstreaming-the-use-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-education\">Developer Group</a> (DG). Their task was to create a series of learning scenarios and professional development material as the base of our first <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-in-your-classroom-building-21st-century-competences-with-digital-cultural-heritage-mooc\">MOOC</a>. Over the second half of the project (March-July 2018), we set up the Europeana Education User Group to test and refine the material produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The User Group (UG) was formed as result of an open call released by European Schoolnet (EUN) throughout January and February 2018. 60 teachers from different European countries (Finland, France, Italy, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Romania, Croatia and Lithuania) and education levels (at around 30% from primary and 70% from secondary level) were finally selected. Their main tasks were 1) to test the usability of the learning scenarios produced by the Developer Group, and 2) to participate in the first Europeana Education MOOC, which ran from 30 April to 15 June. For both tasks they provided feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enriching pedagogical material \_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The contribution of the UG testing the DG learning scenarios varied from simple recommendations like including new images, adjusting the activities to a specific age group or advising different duration for the successful completion of the scenario, to more complex outputs, such as the creation of new pedagogical activities based or inspired on the original material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most interesting new activities designed has been <a href=\"http://3dalpha.blogspot.com/2018/06/from-pixel-to-plastic.html\">From Pixel to Plastic: Using Europeana as a resource for 3D printing projects</a>, produced by Prof. Artur Coelho, Coordenador PTE - Agrupamento de Escolas Venda do Pinheiro in Portugal. His scenario aims to use Europeana as a resource for 3D printing projects. The primary goal is challenging students to create 3D modelling projects using images found on Europeana, which can be either 3D printed (if the school has the device) or produced in a makerspace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the implementation of the activity, the learners have to search in Europeana for suitable content for their projects, set the goals and a work plan, use computational thinking (breaking complex shapes into modular parts), create 3D models using accessible modelling tools (Tinkercad, Sketchup Make/Free, 3DC.io) and write a project report. A beautiful example of the new 3D models designed by students is the manuscript’s miniature of an astronomical diagram as shown below (<a href=\"http://3dalpha.blogspot.com/2018/07/projetos-finais-de-tic-turma-f-2.html\">explore</a> more designs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"265\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FClAMWmnw63eQnDDQtnxZN0FVFep85xvOJ9C4zFlfGn9lKSU-L0UaOssX-impdPMCYyGa59_8fsiWefUDGbT76kyhUegt4BJwhGU11EVNN7PkpPDBluwk_He_mkvzD7xFps8S2Ak\" width=\"515\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Miniature 3D model recreation. Original reference on\_Europeana: <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200397/BibliographicResource_3000126281689.html\">Moon from BL Harley 4940, f. 37</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another promising initiative by one member of the UG, Miguel Angel Queiruga, is a coding project that will take place during the <a href=\"http://codeweek.eu/\">Code Week, 6-21 October 2018</a>. The project aims to create an interactive map of Burgos city (Spain), where students will geolocate and highlight local monuments, cultural and scientific institutions, artefacts or historical figures using Europeana content. The activity intends to give kids aged 5-18 a chance to engage with some hands-on learning experience creating with technology. The plan is to involve all the schools’ students in the region and the University of Burgos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"318\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ibixJTfC_xpEpLpMNgNgDgWsqeSzfkYM4sw-_Ktvr7bnsfdrRWSsc2ql8aDhg5JtJm6emD0RfHU1NL0n_guSmlbabT4OSXwL7arpYAzguXibq0oGbwRONMGhS8LVM4rNY6rfwHlR\" width=\"482\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>View of Burgos Cathedral by Waring, J. B. (1852). Biblioteca Digital de Castilla y Leon. CCO</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Recommendations and feedback</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to collect the UG’s recommendations after testing the DG learning scenarios and participating in the MOOC (we’ll know more about the course results in our next blog), EUN has evaluated the group through surveys: one after each implementation of the scenarios and one after finalising the MOOC in mid-June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some highlights from the survey\_results are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>they would like to find more pedagogical material related to physics, mathematics, music, language and technology\_in Europeana resources for education</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>they preferred content on Europeana Collections to be video, image and 3D</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>they would appreciate more translated content, either on our platform or in the resources produced</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to this evaluation we have also learnt that more than 70% of teachers recognised that their students developed their collaborative skills during the implementation of the LS, and more than 60% of teachers believe their students developed their digital competence, followed by critical thinking and communication skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUN will prepare a plan for the ongoing animation and sustainability of the Europeana User Group of teachers beyond the end of the DSI-3 project. For the next DSI-4 period, \_the group will grow to a total of 120 teachers from 12 countries and is expected to develop 60 new learning scenarios integrating Europeana resources at the end of the next school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about the UG activities for the next DSI-4 and join our Education Community and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13518332\">LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n"

And where people of all ages from all walks of life can get help for nothing from qualified people: help with their academic or family history research, advice about how to search online, or suggestions where best to look for particular information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How have libraries changed with the shift towards digital information sharing?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The increased availability appears to have made physical visits to libraries less important. The National Library of Scotland has seen a decline in users of the General Reading Room, where material printed after 1900 is consulted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conversely, though, the digitisation of rare books and manuscripts has resulted in an increased awareness of the special collections we hold and has actually attracted new readers who wish to consult the original material. The study of the book as an object rather, than as a carrier of information, is more popular than ever, and digital access is not sufficient to satisfy the needs of students of book history who are interested, for instance, in all extant copies of a particular work, or in recreating a dispersed library collection. Once such a library has been reconstructed, of course, it can be digitally re-assembled even though the physical items remain dispersed across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What initiatives or projects is the National Library of Scotland undertaking to evolve with the digital?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our strategy document for 2015-2020, “The Way Forward”, we state that by 2025, the centenary of the National Library of Scotland, we will have one-third of our collections in digital format. Apart from this mass digitisation programme, we also carry out boutique digitisation, as for instance the scanning of a collection of 2,200 broadsides for the Europeana Rise of Literacy Project.</p>\r\n"

I know about TEL, and that Rise of Literacy is not the only project that involves putting up text on Europeana. The difference is the access through editorials. Not only is Europeana aggregating thousands of pages of text both in manuscript and printed form in at least 12 languages (three for Scotland alone!), but it gives the general public a chance to find out about some of the material through dedicated blogs written by partners who are knowledgeable about their collections and keen to share their insights and observations about interesting aspects of their collections. The exhibitions tell the story of literacy from the pan-European perspective and bring together examples from all partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find out more on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy Project</a>.

        intro: "<p>In the Europeana DSI-3 project (September 2017 – August 2018) European Schoolnet’s task was to continue the work started in the DSI-2 validation pilot of reaching educators and mainstreaming the use of Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The project was structured in three different tasks: 1) Organizing a Developer Group of 18 teachers from Europeana’s six target countries who produced a set of resources and learning activities for students, and open source, professional development materials for teachers based on the Europeana Collections; 2) Identifying and providing a community and online support for an Europeana Education User Group of 60 teachers who tested the above mentioned resources and provided feedback; and, 3) Utilising these resources to develop a five-module MOOC for teachers on how to use Europeana in education, which took place from 30th April to 15th June 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final report compiles the outcomes of this project and the results of the surveys made to the different group of teachers involved in the respective tasks. From the data obtained, European Schoolnet provided the following conclusions and recommendations for the next phase of the Europeana project (DSI-4):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations related to educational content and resources:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Translation of educational materials and offer next editions of the MOOC in more languages.</li>\r\n    <li>The rerun of the MOOC: 80% of respondents agree that they feel more confident to use Europeana after the MOOC.</li>\r\n    <li>Development of more Europeana learning scenarios with more general topics and easier to integrate into the curricula.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Recommendations related to dissemination strategies:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Creation of a Europeana Ambassadors’ Network. Teachers reported a high willingness to recommend Europeana to their peers and students.</li>\r\n    <li>Collaboration with other teacher networks like eTwinning or Scientix.</li>\r\n    <li>Creation of a teacher blog, where all of the created learning scenarios are openly available.</li>\r\n    <li>Webinars at the national level to explain the use of Europeana resources to teachers.</li>\r\n</ol>"

        intro: "<p>The first Europeana Education MOOC, ‘<a href=\"http://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/europeana-in-your-classroom-building-21st-century-competences-with-digital-cultural-heritage\">Europeana in your classroom</a>’, delivered by European Schoolnet (EUN), ran between 30 April – 15 June 2018. The course introduced participants to the Europeana platform to help them build learning scenarios using digital culture and fostering the 21st-century skills.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Over 6.5 weeks and five modules, the course offered tested classroom activities using 1) a range of educational resources produced by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/mainstreaming-the-use-of-digital-cultural-heritage-in-education\">Developer Group</a> (DG), and 2) a range of Europeana tools and resources (Europeana collections, curated datasets or apps among others).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Europeana in your classroom’ course content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students learnt:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Why it is important to integrate European cultural heritage in education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) \_How to use Europeana Collections to teach their subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) \_How to navigate the Europeana Collections website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) How to explore and familiarise themselves with the various Europeana apps, tools and materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) \_How to build learning activities using Europeana Collections resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Over 2,000 registrants from 59 countries</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To evaluate the success of the MOOC, EUN compiled data from two sources: (1) course registration and participation (started/completed); and (2) data collected via two surveys completed voluntarily by participants before and after the course. The surveys provided information about the profile of course participants, their motivations for joining the course, and the participants’ course impressions and satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Europeana in your classroom’ got a high number of registrants (2,019 people) from 59 different countries across the globe, which indicates a clear interest in integrating digital cultural heritage in education. The course also had a satisfactory engagement rate of almost 50% (990 participants) and a completion rate of 35% (342 participants), exceeding the MOOC average of 10%.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"280\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/hhXlW7uKe1YRs8prKoijPWM3qd1HhCD91QuKJt2Iuog1IRo8TawT1Ck3mx9AIUEPOnZRwlCJ1RRc7KDpDyP3rrYOOqre2AOPu2VjPzE4wTtc8EoBm2aa8yJa8nw9XOKYd6neVTWm\" width=\"624\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Participant Map.

Among their main motivations to participate, bringing innovation into their practice came out top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Feedback from happy teachers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The post-course survey results (n=271) showed that more than 95% of survey respondents rated the overall value of the course as ‘Good’ or ‘Very good’. 95% of the survey respondents also ‘Agreed’ or ‘Strongly agreed’ that the course has made them more confident in using digital cultural heritage in their classroom and that they would recommend this course to a colleague or friend. A large number of posts on the Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EuropeanaInYourClassroom/\">group page</a> shows the satisfaction of the participants. Some of them said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Thank you European Schoolnet Academy and to all my peers! I had such a wonderful adventure, learning and exploring from the very beginning to the end of this course!! Mirela</em>.\_Mela Price (3 July)<br><br><em>Thank you Academy, moderators and all of the involved teachers for a great experience in this course!! Best wishes from Orhaneli-Bursa/Turkey, have a nice holiday!</em>\_Esra Demirhan Eroğlu (26 June)</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers also had the opportunity to suggest improvements for future editions of the course and there was a clear consensus for finding more translated material and more practical examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to include their suggestions and continue exploiting the clear benefits of the course, the MOOC developed during Europeana DSI-3 will be updated by incorporating the learning scenarios produced throughout the DSI-4 period, and run twice in English (January 2019/January 2020). Additionally, the MOOC will be translated and run in two additional languages in 2019 and two further languages in 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find out more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in the course and don’t want to miss the next editions, follow our news and updates by <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\">joining\_our Europeana Education Community</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Transcribathons are the means by which analogue cultural heritage can be transformed into the digital, in a way that is interactive, social and fun - and they could revolutionise the way in which we interact with history in the classroom. Essentially, the digital activity involves taken written cultural heritage - perhaps a diary, or a letter - and using your skills in reading and deciphering handwriting to transcribe these historical documents. People involved in transcribathons can join teams and work together (or in competition) to transcribe documents, as has been done in many <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/map/\">events and locations</a> across Europe. Not only does this make the documents more accessible to audiences digitally, but also allows for their translation so they can be read in languages other than which they were written. Not only are these events taking the general public by storm, but according to event organiser and long-term transcribathon partner Frank Drauschke (historian and founder of Facts &amp; Files), they are an important resource for teachers and researchers in bringing history to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bringing history to life for historians</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Frank, the relevance of transcribathons for researchers was one of the key motivators behind his organisation of the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/runs/historikertag/\">Transcribathon Historiker Tag</a> at the 52nd Biennial Meeting of German Historians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Frank says, ‘Transcribathon Historiker Tag is supposed to be the biggest humanities conference in Europe. There are about 4,000 people coming. I thought it would be a great opportunity to reach out to professional historians to get to know our tool, to use it and to see the potential of how they could use it for their own research or teaching.’ &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Frank, transcribathons are a great asset in university classrooms, with one example from Johannes Kepler University Linz, where the tool was used to aid in assessment activities for a class of 50 students. Students engaged in an internal competition to transcribe various documents, and by using the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com\">Transcribathon.eu</a> portal, the teacher to check each student’s progress, ranking and the kinds of mistakes they were making. Sharing this knowledge and examples with researchers, and giving them access to the tool was an obvious motivation behind organising the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/263874495\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/263874495\">Transcribathon - Cultural Institutions</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Digital lessons from the past in the classroom &nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This focus on transcribathon for research comes after its success in <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/education/\">education</a>, with the tool already proving a success in classrooms that are increasingly impacted by the digital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Frank says, ‘We also started to use it also in schools where we had <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teaching-history-in-an-interactive-way-with-the-transcribathon-for-education\">school workshops</a>. It is very useful for teachers and the good thing is the fun factor. Because they have this game, they are having fun, they’re getting points in a kind of in competition with each other and so they really get into the sporting spirit.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This kind of cross-media, cross-generational interaction with cultural heritage is exactly the kind of digital transformation that we at Europeana want to support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/223603761\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/223603761\">Europeana Transcribathon Berlin State Library, June 2017</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Finding the value in the cultural heritage's ‘unpolished diamonds‘</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital transformation means that we are engaging with cultural history in new and innovative ways. The value of the digital is its accessibility, ease and interactive qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘I think it is important the reach out to the academic and professional community so that they see the potential of this tool, and also how it can be used in research. Due to the transcription and annotation that we are doing - the sources are much more easily searchable, findable and usable,‘ says Frank, ‘I’m sure there is still a lot of value in this unpolished diamond (pre-transcribed documents), which we and other historians have to dig in and polish.‘</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historians are tasked with the great challenge of making sense of cultural heritage. With the advent of the digital transformation, tools and initiatives offer to make at least some of these challenges a thing of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Want to find out more? Attend the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/runs/historikertag/\">Transcribathon Historiker Tag</a>, Münster, Germany at the 52nd Biennial Meeting of German Historians at the University of Münster. &nbsp;Join professional historians, students and history enthusiasts from around the world to transcribe and annotate as many letters, diaries and other digitised documents as possible from the <a href=\"http://europeana1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> collection. </em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>This project was coordinated by the French Ministry of Education and Réseau Canopé, a national pedagogical resources provider, and ran from November 2017 to June 2018. The teachers used <a href=\"http://www.edutheque.fr/accueil.html\">Éduthèque</a>,&nbsp;a cultural and scientific resources platform for teachers, which included a selection of Europeana Collections content, translated in French and available online. The group was made up of 13 secondary-level teachers of various subjects such as history, French and literature, English, life and earth sciences, technology, arts and MIL (media and information literacy).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A collaborative workshop approach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to create the learning scenarios, the teachers attended three face-to-face workshops (29 November, 31 January and 16 May) organised by Réseau Canopé, in which they were introduced to the Europeana and Éduthèque platforms, as well as Creative Commons Licensed resources and the best information-seeking strategies for the Europeana Collections platform. They addressed questions such as whether it is better to search the entire collections, or use curated sets of data, such as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/collections/world-war-I?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+1914-1918&amp;q=women&amp;view=grid\">Women in World War One.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>French teachers inspired by Europeana resources</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the scenarios were created, the teachers were ready to take them to the classroom for testing. After the implementation, they re-grouped to discuss their findings</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Meanwhile, at the request of the French Ministry of Education, Réseau Canopé conducted over two months (February - March) a survey on teachers’ use of <a href=\"http://www.edutheque.fr/utiliser/partenaire/europeana.html\">Europeana resources available on Éduthèque</a>. The survey, with a total of 1,581 respondents, contributes to a more in-depth knowledge of how French teachers use online resources in their daily practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feedback from both the teacher group and the wider survey matched. These are the findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Europeana is new and rather unknown to teachers, but a resource that attracts a lot of interest and curiosity.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Europeana for Éduthèque is best known for history/geography/media and information literacy teachers and, to a lesser extent, by teachers of French and languages.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Teachers at all levels are interested in Europeana's resources and these resources are quite different from the resources they commonly use.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The European dimension is especially specific to Europeana.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The Éduthèque portal appears as a guarantee of reliability and pedagogical validity to access such resources.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>15 &nbsp;new learning scenarios to reuse in the classroom</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The learning scenarios were developed by 13 teachers, all of which can be downloaded on the <a href=\"http://eduscol.education.fr/cid106409/europeana-et-edutheque.html#lien2\">Éduscol portal</a> : &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Leaving Europe in the 19th century for <a href=\"http://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/Mediatheque/49/2/Europeana_Scenario_QuitterEurope2_web_997492.pdf\">English</a> and <a href=\"http://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/Mediatheque/49/1/Europeana_Scenario_QuitterEurope1_web_997491.pdf\">history</a> class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>History of travel: planes, trains and automobiles for <a href=\"http://cache.media.eduscol.education.fr/file/Mediatheque/48/7/Europeana_Scenario_HistoireMoyensTransport_web_997487.pdf\">Technology</a></em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Let your art speak in English class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Berlin, issue and symbol of Cold War in History class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>The function of women in the war Media and information literacy class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>European migrations in the USA in History class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Create a certificate subject in French and History class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Act in the society: words of women in French and History class (2 scenarios)</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Darwin’s ideas in the human evolution in L&amp;E science</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Food digestion in L&amp;E science</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Vaccination in L&amp;E science</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Representations of gods during Antiquity in Arts and Latin class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><em>Kamishibai in Arts and French class</em></p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-80741eed-7fff-4de2-c3eb-94870e54f9a7\">What’s next?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the next steps in the collaboration between Europeana and the French Ministry of Education will be making more and more Europeana selections available on Éduthèque by choosing various subject-related topics and offering a wide diversity of media and types of documents. The final purpose is to improve the visibility of Europeana resources on Éduthèque and show the pedagogical potentials of the resources, thanks to the learning scenarios created in this project. &nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We spoke to the team behind the award-winning app, Sofija Klarin Zadravec, Digital Library Adviser, from the National and University Library in Zagreb (NSK) and Dragana Koljenik from the Croatian Institute for Librarianship (NSK) about what it takes to bring cultural heritage to life, and their grand plans for new technological developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Bringing history and culture to life is no mean feat and something we in the cultural heritage sector are challenged with daily. However, creative <a href=\"/post/reuse-of-europeana-content-for-fun\">reuse</a>\_of digital cultural heritage brings with it some incredible results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exemplifying this is mobile application <em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/greetings-from-zagreb-1\">Greetings from Zagreb</a></em>. The award-winning app uses historical postcards digitised as a part of the Collections of South and East Europe in Europeana (CSEEE) project developed to address a lack of visibility of cultural heritage objects from non-EU countries. Content from the project feature in\_a number of creative reuse outcomes, including the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/picture-this-vintage-postcards-of-southeastern-europe\">Picture this!</a>\_Vintage postcards of Southeastern Europe\_competition, and the aforementioned app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spoke to Sofija Klarin Zadravec and Dragana Koljenik about the app’s recent award win, the process of developing technologies in the cultural heritage sector and their next big challenge: to take on Europe!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>You have recently been awarded the <a href=\"https://www.ifla.org/node/34315?og=75\">2018 BibLibre International Marketing Award</a> for your mobile application <em>Greetings from Zagreb</em>. How does it feel to be recognised in this way?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the launch of the\_<em><a href=\"http://pozdravizhrvatske.nsk.hr/zagrebapp/\">Greetings from Zagreb</a></em> application, we had excellent feedback from our users, as well as extensive media interest and coverage. When we applied for the award, we hoped that our innovative approach to digital library marketing would be recognised by library professionals. It seems that thinking outside of the box really pays off. The BibLibre International Marketing Award confirms for us that we have made a step forward in promoting digital collections. And yes, we are very proud that this recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you tell us\_about the development of the app?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the preparation for the project, we reviewed all of the available mobile applications created by libraries and concluded that there was room for a new approach. Our main goal was to reimagine the reuse of our digitised collections in a way that would allow the end-user to have interaction with the content in a meaningful way. The only logical interaction with postcards is sending them, so we decided to make that the main functionality of our application. There aren't many people who still send physical postcards while they are away from home, and instead use social media to share their whereabouts and location-based experiences. It is the new currency of the ‘good life’, so we thought – why wouldn't we use this in promoting our digitised content?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Dragana Koljenik receiving nthe BibLibre International Marketing Award at WLIC 2018\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-09/awardwinzagreb_1.png\" style=\"max-width:500px;margin:0 auto;\"><br><em>Dragana Koljenik receiving the BibLibre International Marketing Award, WLIC 2018,\_Sofija Klarin Zadravec, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did the project evolve?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Croatian Institute for Librarianship (NSK) wanted to develop a quality digital cultural product that coexists with the<a href=\"https://digitalna.nsk.hr/pb\"> NSK Digital Collections Portal</a> as its extension, but also as a standalone product that promotes NSK. On a deeper level, we wanted to reestablish the relevance of the Library to the local community and show what we can offer to the world outside our walls. We are proud that, with this app, we stand shoulder to shoulder with a number of different tourist market players and contribute to the positive impression of our capital. We hope this project can serve as a case study and prototype for other libraries and cultural institutions in Croatia and beyond for similar products that use heritage to create new cross-sectoral values.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you give us an update on the proposed\_<em>Greetings from Croatia </em>application?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Undoubtedly, <em>Greetings from Croatia</em> has firm foundations in the <em>Greetings from Zagreb</em> project but it is conceptually, financially and technically more demanding so we have to tread carefully. To ensure the success of the project, we are still in the phase of searching for the right partners. Our vision is a multifaceted project that is able to accommodate the biggest and smallest heritage institutions and their digital collections. Greetings from Croatia could become the first big cultural heritage brand developed by Croatian librarians that are recognised around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next? Will we see<em> Greetings from Den Haag</em> anytime soon?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from working on launching <em>Greetings from Croatia</em>, the <em>Greetings from Zagreb</em> app will get its first update in December 2018 - a holiday makeover in time for Zagreb's Christmas market (named <a href=\"https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/christmas-markets/\">the best in Europe</a> three years running).

European Union (EU)&nbsp;digital cultural initiative Europeana consists of a thriving network of close to 4000 memory institutions (libraries, museums, archives etc.) who have shared over 50 million digitised objects in a standardised format on the digital platform. This model, based on open standards and an inclusive, distributive approach, is being adopted as a model in the US and Japan to Brazil and Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago, the EU made a bold decision about our cultural heritage. They deemed it too important to leave to market forces alone. Two weeks ago, Europeana’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ten-years-europeana-bringing-europes-cultural-heritage-digital-age\">public evaluation</a> has shown that it is still very relevant to the challenges we are facing today in Europe and the EU has recommitted its support to the initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A challenge for audiovisual archives</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, we are facing some serious challenges and unfortunately, these affect audiovisual (AV) archives more than any other creative medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here is the issue: we have currently digitised around 10% of all our heritage. Of that 10% (which represents around 300 million objects), only about one third is available online, and of that, only 7% is available for reuse. At Europeana, we work very hard to improve this equation and as you can see almost 20% in Europeana can be shared, adapted (all within full respect of copyright of course) while the other 80% can at least be viewed online.</p>\r\n"

However, only 6,000 (0.5%) is explicitly labelled as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=SOUND&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=VIDEO&amp;view=grid&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open\">available for reuse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can be done about this? How do we have an impact on the big societal issues that Europe faces using a powerful agent like AV archives to our advantage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large part of this issue lies of course in copyright. We encourage institutions to adopt open access policies where they commit to publishing collections they own the copyright to under an open license. But at this point in time, it is more important that we work together with our partners to develop technological solutions that improve the access to content, within the current copyright framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think for example of embeddable players that allow image archives to stream their material in different contexts, still within the copyright frameworks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The potential of AI and data mining archives</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But we should think much further than that: what if we could make full use of the capabilities of AI and machine learning to mine these archives, at scale? We’d be able to make all kinds of connections, discover patterns and uncover the past in unprecedented ways!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>After last month's\_<a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/openglam/\">Open GLAM México</a> event, and with a national digital repository in development, these are exciting times in the Mexican cultural sector. Douglas McCarthy spoke with Agenda Digital de Cultura’s Vania Ramírez Islas to\_get the inside story.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Hi Vania, tell us a little about yourself and your work.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I work on digital strategy for the Mexican Ministry of Culture. I'm in charge of developing projects for the cultural sector, focusing on joint efforts to make Mexican cultural heritage available on the web through digitisation, preservation, and systems development. You can learn more about our strategy and current projects on our Agenda Digital de Cultura <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/\">w</a><a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/\">ebsite</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-10/ADC_Secretaria_Cultura%20graphic.png\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agenda Digital de Cultura.\_Secretaría de Cultura de México, <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/declaraciones-de-uso/page/NoC-MX/1.0\">NoC-MX 1.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last month we coordinated the first ever <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/openglam/\">Open GLAM México</a> conference, bringing together professionals from across Mexico and from overseas (including Europeana’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/douglas-mccarthy\">Douglas McCarthy</a>) to share experiences and best practices in the field of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did Open GLAM México come about, and who was involved?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open GLAM México was an initiative of the Mexican Ministry of Culture, the National Institute of Fine Arts, Wikimedia Mexico and the Cultural Center of Spain. We organised the conference to start a conversation about how we can best share knowledge, discuss the challenges of publishing digital collections, and connect institutions in a dialogue around the Open GLAM movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What did you hope the event would achieve?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We had three main aims: i) to share good GLAM practices and policies – in a Mexican and international context – on the distribution of data and digital objects; ii) to promote the opening of digital collections held in Mexican public and private institutions; iii) to establish an open dialogue on copyright issues focused on the use, reuse, and appropriation of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-10/MexicoII.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audience at Open GLAM México, 5-6 September 2018.\_Centro Cultural de España en México, <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/declaraciones-de-uso/page/NoC-MX/1.0\">NoC-MX 1.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What were the highlights and outcomes of the conference?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, all the sessions were exciting! On day one, we heard from the private sector about how it encourages the publication and promotion of digital collections. We also heard from the Director of <a href=\"http://www.ibermuseus.org\">Ibermuseos</a> on how his organisation works with museums across Latin America to open up data and to tackle shared challenges. The last session explored advances in the documentation and digital preservation of contemporary art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On day two, we got the inside story on large-scale digital initiatives like Europeana and the Wikimedia Foundation, learning how they publish cultural heritage online, and how they tackle the complex challenges of doing so. We also heard a fascinating roundtable discussion on intellectual property and right statements, from a variety of perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-10/DouglasMex.jpg\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Douglas McCarthy addresses Open GLAM México, 5-6 September 2018. Photo:\_<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martingersbach\">Martin Gersbach</a>, CC BY</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What surprised you the most?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, it was the passionate interest of GLAM sector professionals in these issues. A recurring question during the event was how institutions could transfer and apply the inspiration and ideas from Open GLAM México to their own circumstances, given their limited budgets and technical resources. Whilst this kind of event shows us the best practices and latest advances, we may sometimes be disappointed because we don't have the same opportunities. To see the changes that we and our users want, we need to change the paradigm in Mexican institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How is Europeana relevant to the Mexican culture sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The example of Europeana inspired us to create Mexicana, a digital repository of Mexican cultural heritage that is currently in development. Learning from the knowledge and experience that Europeana has gained over its first decade, we’re focusing our efforts on enabling institutions to share their collections together on the web. Mexicana will be the first step in a bigger project. We expect to expand the range of national and international contributors in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-10/Mexicana.png\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexicana, the forthcoming digital repository of Mexican cultural heritage.\_Secretaría de Cultura de México, <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/declaraciones-de-uso/page/NoC-MX/1.0\">NoC-MX 1.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexicana will be the first digital repository in our country. It’s a free and open platform that will allow and encourage interoperability between digital collections across the cultural sector. The scope of the repository makes it a landmark effort in the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by the high standards and international best practices of Europeana, Mexico will have a robust digital platform to share digital cultural heritage on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-10/MexicanaII.png\" style=\"\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexicana, the forthcoming digital repository of Mexican cultural heritage.\_Secretaría de Cultura de México, <a href=\"http://agendadigital.cultura.gob.mx/declaraciones-de-uso/page/NoC-MX/1.0\">NoC-MX 1.0</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with the organisers of Open GLAM México, we'll start working groups to discuss issues related to preservation, digitisation, documentation and open access. We want to support cultural institutions who wish to open their data and content, as well as organising events that promote open access to cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll also be working to promote changes to Mexican copyright law, to accelerate open access to state and federal collections in Mexico.

        title: 'Bringing culture back to the people: Transcribathon Italia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We talk to Sara Di Giorgio about the importance of digitising cultural heritage as she organises\_Italy’s first transcribathon as a means of connecting people with their own heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.transcribathon.eu/italy\">Transcribathon Italia</a>\_2018 is the first event of this nature to be held in Italy. The event takes place from 8-12 October, with two members of the winning team receiving a trip to Brussels to compete at the international transcribathon on 27-28 November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event will be held as part of the National Week of Digitisation. Event organiser <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sara-di-giorgio\">Sara Di Giorgio</a> of Culturaltalia and the Central Institute for the Union Catalogue of the Italian Libraries (ICCU), says this is\_an important time to remember the true purpose behind digitising cultural heritage - creating links between digital heritage and people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sara works to facilitate and improve the relationships between Europeana and the Italian knowledge community. She does through her work with digitisation, advocacy and engagement. She\_says, ‘Once heritage is digitised, catalogued and put online via CulturaItalia and Europeana, it must come back to the people. Transcribathon represents a new way to engage people with cultural heritage and share cultural commons.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Sara to tell us more about Transcribathon. Here's what she had to say...</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the value of digital initiatives like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/who-are-we-europeana-in-this-digital-transformation\">Transcribathons</a>?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital technologies have changed the way people access, produce and use the cultural content. The experience will engage students with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/collections/world-war-I\">historical sources from World War One</a>, raising awareness about the multiple aspects of the conflict. It can transform a digital resource or an image into a story, thanks to the transcription of the entire content of the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/documents/?tp=picture\">document</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/246759639\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/246759639\">Berlin Transcribathon 2017 interviews (music)</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who is the Transcribathon aimed at?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students from the Department of Humanities of the Roma Tre University will participate in this competition, \_guided by Professor Paolo Mattera who will add even more scientific value to the transcriptions. The students will gain an extra credit for their participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\">Harry Verwayan</a> recently noted that Transcribathons are his favourite example of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/digital-transformation\">digital transformation</a>. What do you think?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I totally agree with Harry! Transcribathons build and engage large communities all over Europe, especially young people, who can use digital means to learn more about World War One to create culture and to develop a European identity. At the same time, thanks to transcriptions, annotations and geo-tags, Transcribathon will amplify the usability of Europeana and ICCU’s vast World War One collection. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you hope to get out of the day?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The involvement and the cooperation of the participants, a deepening of historical understanding of the World War One through a scientific analysis of the transcriptions supported by the University and the experimentation of an innovative way of studying based on the primary sources provided by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Want to find out more?

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Creating fun and creative reuse ideas for digital cultural heritage is something we are passionate about at Europeana. We speak to Europeana Challenge winner Federica Pascotto about the launch of her educational app <a href=\"http://www.artstories.it/en/wonders/\">Wonders</a> and the chaos and constraints of developing an application game.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Engaging children in history in a fun way isn’t always easy - but it's this very challenge that Art Stories creator Federica Pascotto thrives on to bring art, history and architecture to young audiences. The educational app developers won the Europeana Challenge 2016 with the project <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/art-faces\">FACES</a>, in which children became art explorers.They’ve now also won the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-edtech-challenge-winners-announced\">Europeana #edTech Challenge 2018</a> for their app Wonders in which children get to explore and learn about different cultural sites by completing various challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-3eb12595-7fff-c17a-0392-5d936bcfe54f\">How did the 2018 Europeana <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/facilitating-innovation/take-the-challenge\">Challenge</a> win contribute to the app’s development? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provided us with a challenging exercise. We build educational products and never have to deal with constraints, we do what we like, in an anarchical way, which is lovely. With a Europeana Challenge, we have a set of tasks and boundaries challenging us to find a new solution to a problem. On top of this, Europeana provides funding that pays for the work we do. We’ve been cooking up ideas on an app for Wonders for a while, we already had ideas about it that we would constantly go back to but we were never able to stick to it. When the challenge came up, it was perfect for this app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/02_Wonders_preview-ipad-eng.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preview of Machu Picchu challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-7ea5ebce-7fff-077f-1a94-c3d288288e7f\">What was the process behind creating Wonders?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Well, firstly we knew that we wanted to do something fun about travelling to those major mythical iconographic sites such as Machu Picchu and Kyoto, so first we did some research on Europeana Collections to find images for each of the sites that we had chosen.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We then decided on the sites by integrating our wishes and what we found on Europeana. We added all the sites on the map and noticed that some places were empty. We wanted the globe to have bits and pieces everywhere. It was just difficult to be representative, which is why we included some natural beauties as well. The list is still incomplete, and we would love to (and will!) add to it.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Finally, we decided to integrate a gaming process where you are really challenged to do all the things that a video game requires such as catching things quickly, avoiding obstacles and picking the right elements -fast.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/04_Wonders_preview-ipad-eng.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preview of The Great Barrier Reef challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-dd4400e1-7fff-638e-43bb-c8de7fdcced9\">What were the most challenging aspects of creating the app?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge was to figure out where to put the educational content, considering that when a child plays with a digital tool they expect to be challenged -they need to be fast, quick and reactive to the game, while learning is a slow process - you need to read and think. If you put the educational content in the beginning, no-one will play, if it’s at the end, no-one will view it. In Wonders we feel gameplay and contents are nicely bound together and, since it is difficult to win the games, when a child finally gets the reward, they want to see what they won. This is the challenge we usually have with all our apps. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-43b37393-7fff-d076-f55b-6894f9997e98\">What makes Wonders unique?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gaming part makes Wonders unique: this is the first time we try to do something that relates to video games rather than illustrated books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-0f6bdfed-7fff-1094-6389-c9440f8d85a2\">How can digital educational apps like Wonders support children’s learning?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have fun and you play it doesn’t feel like learning. We saw it a lot in our experience: children remember the buildings they played with in the apps, they remember the information. It’s captured information and when they start understanding, then they will be curious: when travelling, they will be able to notice things and make connections which allow them to be more aware in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/03_Wonders_preview-ipad-eng.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preview of Kyoto challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-0f6bdfed-7fff-1094-6389-c9440f8d85a2\">Do you have future plans for the game’s development? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are building an extension to the app, we haven’t yet decided on the content. It could be Europe because of the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>. There are a few solutions which we are assessing the pros and cons for. The ambition would be to have extensions for each continent, however, we need to decide which is the most convenient place to start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were also planning to have a version of the app on <a href=\"http://bartolomeo.education\">Bartolomeo</a> which is only in Italian. We are discussing doing something more European for schools with a quiz online and a downloadable set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the Wonders app on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/art-stories-wonders/id1391606033?l=it&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8\">App store</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artstories.worldwonders&amp;hl=en\">Google play</a>.

        title: 'Building library labs - what do they do and who are they for?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>What do a library and a lab have in common? Well, not much, you may think at first. But the opposite is actually true. Clemens Neudecker tells us\_what\_a lab is in the context of a library, what activities it pursues and who it's for.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In recent years, labs have emerged across a growing number of libraries, first in the US, like at <a href=\"https://lil.law.harvard.edu/\">Harvard University</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/collections/labs\">New York Public Library</a>, but quickly followed by first initiatives from Europe such as the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/projects/british-library-labs\">British Library Labs</a> or the National Library of the Netherlands'\_<a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/\">KB Lab</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was also the agenda for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildlibrarylabs\">#buildlibrarylabs</a> workshop at the British Library from 13-14 September 2018. Within the roughly 60 international participants - coming to London from as far as Washington and Alexandria - there was great variation in terms of both\_maturity of the lab they represented (some labs have been established for several years while others were still in the planning and preparation phase) and in the\_aims and objectives of those labs. However, there was also a high degree of agreement and overlap with regard to the motivations behind the labs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Target 1: Open up cultural heritage data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key objectives that all library labs seem to have in common is\_opening up large(r) quantities of cultural heritage data and making it easier to reuse these assets. This can be achieved in various ways: by building APIs, by\_the creation (and curation) of datasets, but even\_just\_providing a simple bulk download can go a long way - to quote from one of the working group discussions: '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrbknudsen/status/1040544394699579392\">APIs are nice, but downloads are awesome!</a>'.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Target 2: Foster creative reuse</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason you open up cultural heritage data\_is so that people can do things with it. Here are some\_wonderful examples that have come out of various labs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Artist <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/case-studies/david-normal-burning-man\">David Normal used British Library images</a> as source material for his arresting artworks at Burning Man Festival (more at\_<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/case-studies?subject=digital%20scholarship\">British Library Labs</a>)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Researcher <a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/about-us/blog/find-what-you-were-looking-using-neural-networks-trawl-through-newspaper\">Melvin Wevers extracted advertisements</a> from historical newspapers of the National Library of the Netherlands (more at\_<a href=\"http://lab.kb.nl/about-us/blog\">KB-NL\_Lab Blog</a>)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Chris Hutchings produced a musical response to Scottish 1962 Mathematics (Higher Grade) Second paper Section I exam (more at\_<a href=\"http://digital.nls.uk/exams/re-sits/\">Re-sits</a>)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Laura Wrubel from George Washington University Libraries used the Library of Congress API to make a tool that allows people to <a href=\"https://loc-colors.glitch.me/\">explore the LoC Digital Collections by colour</a> (see also <a href=\"https://labs.loc.gov/experiments/?st=gallery\">Library of Congress Labs Experiments</a>)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\n<a href=\"http://labs.statsbiblioteket.dk/tags/\">Tags</a> lets you search the Danish webarchive by HTML-tags (more at\_<a href=\"http://labs.kb.dk/\">KB-DK Labs</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The variety of creative and artistic use of the cultural heritage data shown here has been truly astonishing. But the aims of the labs staff were even higher - to quote from the workshop again: '<a href=\"https://twitter.com/schambers3/status/1040266646177361921\">If the lab doesn’t bring down the infrastructure, you’re doing it wrong</a>'.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Target 3: Development of staff and services</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as a pre-event survey determined, internal staff came up second in terms of target audiences for the lab, directly after ‘researchers’. A shared objective amongst the labs is the development of internal staff, fostering digital skills and generally creating more engagement with digital collections across the whole organisation, thus resulting in incentives for more cross-departmental collaboration. This was another takeaway from the workshop: labs are about bringing the right people together and granting them the time and resources to come up with something new and special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a major issue with projects and experiments is their sustainability, there was a common understanding of labs as something that can stick around. Accordingly, it was good to hear that the British Library will be moving the (currently third-party funded) British Library\_Labs into permanent mode by integrating it with the regular activities of the Digital Scholarship Department. Also, Lily Knibbeler, Director General of the National Library of the Netherlands, who spoke to the group via video, was keen to mention that thanks to the successful work of the KB Lab team, the activities and services provided through the KB Lab have now become an essential part of the library’s service portfolio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>We are a community</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-labs\">Europeana Labs</a> was present at the workshop as well. Bringing together the massive volume of open and reusable data available in <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> with the labs crowd should result in many more innovative ideas coming out of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To get involved in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/buildlibrarylabs\">#buildlibrarylabs</a>\_community, you can contact <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/people/experts/mahendra-mahey\">Mahendra Mahey</a>, the British Library Labs Manager who carefully put this event together,\_and maybe we’ll see you at the next workshop!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Copyright ruling begs question: Does embedding of fine artwork images online really harm artists?'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Should libraries and museums stop secondary websites from republishing\_digital fine art? Ellen Euler,\_professor for Open Access &amp; Open Data in Germany at the University of Applied Science Potsdam, looks at a current case in point playing out in Germany.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>A common problem in the current copyright debate is that it is based on assumptions, not on facts and proven contexts. The same applies to some legislative proposals. If authors or rights holders actually suffer damage when licensed images of works of fine art are embedded, then this would, of course, need to be counteracted within the framework of the copyright reform. However, the mere assumption that this is the case should not be sufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent case where this issue was brought to the fore was between collecting society for visual artists, <a href=\"http://www.bildkunst.de/index.html\">VG Bild-Kunst</a>\_(Collecting Society for the Visual Arts), and the German Digital Library, Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (<a href=\"http://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/\">DDB</a>), an online portal that networks and makes the digital collections of German museums, archives, libraries and other cultural institutions accessible. Both have been disputing whether online platforms must technically prevent protected artwork images from being embedded on other sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>According to the Berlin Regional Court, ‘that would be too much to ask’.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The aim of negotiations between the DDB and VG Bild-Kunst</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The DDB began negotiating licences with the VG Bild-Kunst\_in 2013 in order to\_feature protected works on their platform. Their aim was to show these works on the DDB website, and also on cooperating cultural institutions’ websites.\_For example, the\_<a href=\"https://www.berlinischegalerie.de/home/\">Berlinische Galerie</a> could show\_<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Dix\">Otto Dix's</a> works on both the DDB and on its own website without having to create a separate licence agreement with the VG Bild-Kunst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works without clear rights ownership would be protected by the agreement. This would allow, for example, archives to digitise posters with unknown authors and publish them on both the DDB and their own websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a contract was negotiated at the end of 2014, but it was never concluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the interim, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling that concerned VG Bild-Kunst. The Court ruled that embedding (legal: framing) content on other sites is generally not relevant under copyright law. It is instead comparable to a link.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>VG Bild-Kunst: ’Only those who prevent embedding receive licenses’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>VG Bild-Kunst\_<a href=\"http://www.bildkunst.de/urheberrecht/die-hyperlink-problematik/eugh-enteignet-bildurheber.html\">feared that artists would be expropriated</a> of their rights if everyone could show their works by embedding them on their own pages. In order to protect their represented rights holders, VG Bild-Kunst requested to license to DDB only on the condition that they use technical means to prevent the content from being embedded on external pages. Such ’framing prevention technology’ is based on only providing images with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page\">dynamic web address</a> instead of a static\_one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DBB did not accept this condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2016, DDB brought an <a href=\"https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/content/journal/hintergrund/deutsche-digitale-bibliothek-vg-bild-kunst-musterverfahren-zum-framing\">action</a> before the Berlin Regional Court against VG Bild-Kunst in order to clarify whether the collecting society may demand that the works it licenses become protected against embedding. Both parties wanted to clarify the question in principle (if possible up to the Federal Supreme Court, and if necessary also with the European Court of Justice) and have taken the legal dispute to court as a ’model case’ in which each party bears its own legal costs. However, the Berlin Regional Court initially rejected the complaint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Embedding: No permission and no prohibition necessary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berlin Court of Appeal has now ruled that the action is admissible and has decided that VG Bild-Kunst\_must grant the DDB licences for its repertoire on visual arts, even if those may be embedded elsewhere (see\_<a href=\"https://irights.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KG-Berlin-DDB-VG-Bild-Kunst-Embedding-20180618-24-U-146_17.pdf\">judgment of 18 June 2018, 24 U 146/17</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, embedding would not fall under copyright law even if the ‘technical protective measures’ demanded by the VG Bild-Kunst were circumvented. In any case, embedding would not constitute public communication if the original work had been published openly and was accessible to all internet users with the copyright holder’s permission.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Court decision not final - appeal has been made</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical measures against embedding do not restrict the number of people who can access the protected work, only the number of those who can embed it. It is because of this\_that embedding is deemed not to reach a ‘new audience’. The required protection against embedding, therefore, does not affect any copyright-relevant acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the Court of Appeal, this would only be different if the numbers of viewers were already limited at the time of the original publication (e.g. with a paywall). If the works were freely accessible and legally published, the technology would not prevent unauthorised but permitted acts. Under such conditions, it would be disproportionate to oblige the DDB to implement such measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision of the Court of Appeal is not yet final; the appeal to the Federal Supreme Court has been admitted. Digital cultural heritage from cultural institutions and aggregating platforms in Germany will have to wait for a legally secure answer as to whether they have to protect their content against embedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The possible consequence of anti-embed regulation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the VG Bild-Kunst will continue to argue for embedding regulation and further protections if anti-embedding is subject to licensing, this would have far-reaching consequences. For example, the content could no longer appear in image search engines that use this technology, such as Europeana Collections. And when a museum publishes images of works of art on social networks, users would no longer be able to share the posting without permission.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proposing an experiment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While this case is still resolving, VG Bild-Kunst and its members could use the time until the fundamental clarification for an experiment to answer the fundamental question: Does the display of images of fine artworks online, where embedding is possible, really harm artists?\_Or is there actually a benefit if their works become part of the current and communicative memory? Does visibility increase the demand for high-resolution images and further licences?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By exploring these questions, the assumptions about the damage or benefit of embedding could be empirically proven. This kind of conversation is worth having, with the potential to benefit digital cultural heritage platforms globally.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Culture, impact and artistic expression in the digital transformation of society: Lessons from Professor Pier Luigi Sacco'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We discuss cultural heritage and impact with acclaimed professor of Cultural Economics and Deputy Rector for International Relations at IULM University, Milan, Pier Luigi Sacco - a self-proclaimed optimist who vividly illustrates the potential of free expression and unbridled content creation in the digital transformation of society.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Measuring the surprising consequences of culture</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Professor Pier Luigi Sacco initially studied economics, when it comes to measuring the impact of culture, he states that the current state of evaluating the economic impact is ‘really just a scratch on the surface’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco was invited to the Europeana Foundation offices to help progress our work on the development of a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">methodology for measuring the impact</a> of cultural heritage activities. During his time, he discussed the importance of measuring the different types of impact that occur as a consequence of interacting with cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco says, ‘The most relevant impact that I can think of is in behavioural change. The fact that people, when they get in contact with culture, have a powerful cognitive and emotional response that affects their behaviour. This is a relevant consequence for things like environmental sustainability, social cohesion, innovation, or health.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco’s own research shows the surprising societal consequences of connecting with culture. He explained that during his research project <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271134128_Recycling_Waste_Does_Culture_Matter\">Recycling Waste: Does Culture Matter?</a> he was able to show that when people engaged in a higher level of cultural participation, they were more likely to recycle, irrespective of education or income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco says, ‘I think this opens up a completely new kind of game, where culture can find a new citizenship in the policy arena, where it plays a fundamental, rather than an accessory, role. Rewiring the notion of impact connected to the most established policy agenda rather than trying for cultural policy in itself, conceived in its own way.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, we can see that interaction with cultural heritage is more complicated than a traditional consumer cycle of production and consumption. Through an evaluation of the impact of cultural heritage, it is possible to determine surprising social consequences that connect to <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/eu-in-brief_en\">European values</a> and impact on matters important to society and policymakers alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘The interesting thing about the digital is that it's not simply a way to dematerialise our expression, but also an incredible way to enhance our capacity to generate content.’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, if our behaviour is affected by our interaction with cultural heritage, how is this then impacted when we interact with digital culture? According to Professor Sacco, while he doesn’t deny the dystopian risk factors associated with the ‘wild-west’ digital space, the self-proclaimed optimist illustrates the beauty of digital transformation in its ability to democratise, and even at times homogenise, artistic expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘The interesting thing about the digital is that it's not simply a way to dematerialise our expression, but also an incredible way to enhance our capacity to generate content,’ says Professor Sacco, ‘You can compress in the space of a laptop what previously was a recording studio. The consequence is that the production of content has become so easy and so affordable, that basically everybody does it, the sharp separation between authorship and audience is blurred.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how then does the Mona Lisa compare to an image taken on a camera phone? How does Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata compare to a piece built on Garageband? At Europeana, we pride ourselves on democratising culture and placing one’s personal legacy item next to acclaimed cultural heritage objects - but does this somehow diminish the value of the latter - or both?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Professor Sacco admits that the evaluation is often that these modern expressions cannot stand up to the comparison, the tools in which we measure the items do not equate either - essentially, the rules are different. He states that the Mona Lisa was produced under completely different circumstances to that of an iPhone image and the tools and processes we use to measure the impact of these need to also change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way that society responds to culture is ever-changing. Unlike the Romantic artist, whose individualism creates the meaning in itself, the meaning in a digital space comes from the shared experience of many people using digital tools to create content at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Sacco says, ‘This is interesting from the cultural point of view because it's still the production of meaning, but it’s now less individualised and more collective. So we are entering a new phase, in which we have to rethink most of the categories through which we have evaluated the meaning and the importance of content creation.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is clear that the digital has created new opportunities for collective expressionism. However, these new processes of content and cultural creation as necessitated by the digital require a new set of tools for measurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Removing abstract concepts and measuring culture’s true value</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Measuring the impact of culture has always been a difficult task. As Professor Sacco says, ‘There are no other human activities which are solely purposed to generate meaning. This is one of the reasons why we think of the appreciation for culture as something that does not need any further justification.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Rather than just developing abstract arguments about how important culture is, I want to show you that culture plays a much bigger role in what you already deem important than you could think of,’ says Professor Sacco. ‘If we start thinking that culture is really powerfully influencing our way to adapt to societal challenges, to all kinds of circumstances, then we need to develop compelling methods for measuring this.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interaction with culture has extensive, and incredibly important, consequences. The ability to interact with digital culture and repurpose it in areas of content creation has social effects we are only just beginning to comprehend. With the further development of measurement tools and further research, it is easy to see why Professor Sacco is optimistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He concludes, ‘Unleashing personal interest in creating content doesn't necessarily make humankind better, but certainly makes us more aware of the potential, and this is something that I like.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you want to measure how culture transforms the world? <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Download the Impact Playbook</a>\_today.

        intro: "<p>THE ARTS+ festival in Frankfurt this week released\_a manifesto on supporting innovation for culture and creative sectors - the result of several months of work from the 14\_partners (including Europeana) of its #InnovationSummit.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>Identifying an innovation gap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/2018/10/11/european-manifesto/\">The manifesto </a>states that there is a growing gap between technology and culture. While technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, 3D printing and big data can trigger innovation, very few initiatives and start-ups that are embracing those technologies are currently managing to scale up sufficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Culture is one of Europe’s biggest assets’, says the manifesto, but ‘Europe needs a more effective innovation strategy for culture.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A united\_cultural and creative sector</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The manifesto asks ‘players’ to come together, rather than grapple alone to overcome this innovation gap. It calls for a ‘wider European ecosystem of support for innovation’, one that cuts transaction costs and boosts creative sectors to a digital level. In essence, to come together as a ‘European key sector - a sector whose significance in terms of jobs compares to the likes of the automotive and chemical industries’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The manifesto outlines six main structural problems for innovation in the cultural and creative sectors at European, national and regional levels. And then suggests six measures to overcome them, including raising public investment, making investment in innovation easier and more attractive, and working to recognise the diverse nature of bodies within the cultural and creative sectors while increasing the sectors’ international character, and establishing and strengthening new definitions and dialogues around innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>It's time to be bold</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, backs the manifesto, saying, ‘New radical technologies, like AI, are on the verge of breaking through and if we want to retain our competitive edge in cultural heritage, we need to make deep commitments and investments in our digital futures, in infrastructures like Europeana, or risk becoming the digital colonies of Silicon Valley. This requires the European Union to make another bold and enlightened decision: to once again promote digital transformation on our own terms so that we can continue to empower our cultural sector to unlock that potential from within.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get involved</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the full\_manifesto on <a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/2018/10/11/european-manifesto/\">THE ARTS+ blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share the manifesto and contribute to the discussion on social media using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/theartsplus18\">#theartsplus18</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://theartsplus.com/\">THE ARTS+ festival </a>continues in Frankfurt until 14 October.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>How can the cultural and creative sectors thrive in the digital age, and cope with the challenges of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality and blockchain?<br><br>\r\nPress release first published at <a href=\"https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-releases/2018-10-11-european-manifesto-supporting-innovation-cultural-creative-sectors\">Buchmesse.de</a></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Frankfurt, 11 October 2018 - What are the best ways of supporting technology-driven innovation at European, national and regional levels? What will happen if we, as a society, do not act now? Today, 14 European partners presented their new “European Manifesto on Supporting Innovation for Cultural &amp; Creative Sectors” at a press conference at THE ARTS+, the festival on the future of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first time, Europe’s creative sectors are making a united call for large-scale support for innovation in culture. At the same time they have issued a stark warning that, without such support, the success of the sectors – including journalism, broadcasting, cultural heritage and publishing – is at risk in the near future. As the 14 partners state in their manifesto: “Culture is one of Europe’s biggest assets. But in an era of big technological change, Europe needs a more effective innovation strategy for the cultural and creative sectors. Right now, the logic of the big commercial platforms is reshaping not only Europe’s markets, but also its societies. Culture helps us make sense of our world, and it should provide a moral compass for technology. To empower culture in this function and to empower citizens to make the most of culture, we need massive public support for innovation in culture, but such support is currently lacking.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The social, cultural and economic relevance of the creative and cultural industries is enormous”, said Christian Ehler, Member of the European Parliament, at today’s press conference. “They are a key sector in Europe – bigger than the automotive or chemical sectors when it comes to their impact on jobs, for example. It is about time that we treat these sectors as a key sector, give them the importance they deserve and put them at the centre of innovation policies at the European level.” Ehler was also a co-rapporteur for a report by the European Parliament which – already at the end of 2016 – called for a coherent European policy for the creative sectors, and highlighted the relevance of the sectors in providing “more than 12 million full-time jobs, which amounts to 7.5% of the EU’s workforce, creating approximately EUR 509 billion in value added to gross domestic product (5.3% of the EU’s total gross value added).” The Manifesto supports the demands made in the European Parliament’s report, and urges the swift implementation of a coherent innovation policy for the creative sectors at European, national and regional levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“New radical technologies, like AI, are on the verge of breaking through and if we want to retain our competitive edge in cultural heritage, we need to make deep commitments and investments in our digital futures, in infrastructures like Europeana, or we risk becoming the digital colonies of Silicon Valley. This requires the European Union to make another bold and enlightened decision: to once again promote digital transformation on our own terms so that we can continue to empower our cultural sector to unlock that potential from within,” said Harry Verwayen, Executive Director, Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Although there are plenty of innovative initiatives and start-ups in the creative and cultural sectors, very few of these achieve a sufficient scale for them to have a bigger impact on society or the market,” said Holger Volland, co-founder of THE ARTS+.“ We can see a growing gap between technology and culture. Culture, and with it society, are struggling to catch up with the exponential speed of technological innovation.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ugo Bacchella, president of the Italian Fitzcarraldo Foundation and strategic partner of THE ARTS+, observed that “tailored investments and structural support are needed if we are to benefit fully from tech-driven innovation, and for innovations in cultural production and distribution to bring more culture into citizens’ everyday lives. That’s how to make the most of cultural diversity and overcome the fragmentation of the cultural sectors.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last few months, 14 European partners have been cooperating in an effort to identify the most significant structural barriers to innovation in the creative sectors, and to find the best solutions for a coherent strategy. The result – the Manifesto – was presented for the first time at yesterday’s THE ARTS+ Innovation Summit in front of over 100 international experts from the fields of culture, technology, politics and business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The biggest barriers to innovation identified in the Manifesto:\_</strong><br><br>\r\n1. A high degree of fragmentation and a silo mentality that reflect sectoral, language and country divisions, despite the fact that cross-sector and cross-boundary collaboration are crucial.<br><br>\r\n2. A general lack of investment, funding and financing: little investment comes from outside investors, and few public funding policies of an appreciable scale exist.<br><br>\r\n3. The specific characteristics of the creative sectors, and how they affect innovation, are not easily measured nor readily understood. They have not yet been recognised by public policy makers.<br><br>\r\n4. Technical and entrepreneurial skills are poorly integrated.<br><br>\r\n5. Value networks are changing, bringing a need for new value and business models.<br><br>\r\n6. Culture and creativity exist in an increasingly global context, yet cultural and political actors often still have a local mind-set.<br><br><strong>The Manifesto proposes the following support measures for the cultural and creative sectors:\_</strong><br><br>\r\n1. Acknowledge the converging and hybrid structure of the sectors, and introduce more explicit policies to support their innovation potential.<br><br>\r\n2. Raise public investment in the cultural and creative sectors to a level which befits their relevance as a key sector and tailor funding programmes to their needs.<br><br>\r\n3. Make it more attractive to invest in the sectors by strengthening alternative forms of investment and enabling new revenue sources.<br><br>\r\n4. Strengthen the dialogue between policy, culture, technology and industry stakeholders, as well as intermediaries, research actors and civil society.<br><br>\r\n5. Support a broader definition of innovation to include “soft” innovation.<br><br>\r\n6. Strengthen the international character of the cultural and creative sectors, by enhancing the role of supranational policies and innovation support measures, especially at EU level.<br><br>\r\nThe European Manifesto on Supporting Innovation for Cultural &amp; Creative Sectors is an outcome of THE ARTS+ Innovation Summit (10 October 2018), which was organised as part of ALDUS (the network of European Book Fairs,\_<a href=\"http://www.aldusnet.eu/\">www.aldusnet.eu</a>) and is co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.<br><br>\r\nThe strategic partners for the Manifesto’s publication are the Fitzcarraldo Foundation/ArtLab and the European Creative Business Network (ECBN)/european centre for creative economy (ecce). Together with THE ARTS+, these were the initiators of the Manifesto. Further programme partners are the Federation of European Publishers; the Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels (German Publishers and Booksellers Association); the Italian Publishers Association AIE; Europeana Foundation; NEMO (The Network of European Museum Organisations); and Studies in Media, Innovation and Technology (SMIT), a research group at the Free University of Brussels (VUB), part of the research network imec (Flanders) and a partner of the EU-funded project MediaRoad. Network partners are the Fundación Germán Sánchez Ruipérez; Deutscher Museumsbund e.V.; German Commission for UNESCO; I3, a coordinated support action (CSA) funded by the European Commission (represented by T6 Ecosystems); New European Media (NEM), a partner of the EU-funded project VitalMedia; and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA), through its Global Alliance for Media Innovation.<br><br>\r\nFind the Manifesto\_<a href=\"https://fbm.cloud.booklan.de/index.php/s/t18uzRmVjOnHYd8#pdfviewer\">here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>QUOTES BY ARTS+ INNOVATION SUMMIT PARTNERS &amp; SPEAKERS\_</strong><br>\r\n“Without adequate support for their ongoing technological and digital development, museums won’t be able to make the most of their full potential, and they run the risk of becoming irrelevant to large parts of society.” David Vuillaume, Chair of NEMO, The Network of European Museum Organisations, and Director Deutscher Museumsbund,\_<a href=\"https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-releases/vuillaume@museumsbund.de\">vuillaume@museumsbund.de</a><br><br>\r\n“New radical technologies, like AI, are on the verge of breaking through and if we want to retain our competitive edge in cultural heritage, we need to make deep commitments and investments in our digital futures, in infrastructures like Europeana, or we risk becoming the digital colonies of Silicon Valley. This requires the European Union to make another bold and enlightened decision: to once again promote digital transformation on our own terms so that we can continue to empower our cultural sector to unlock that potential from within.” Harry Verwayen, Executive Director, Europeana Foundation,\_<a href=\"mailto:harry.verwayen@europeana.eu\">harry.verwayen@europeana.eu</a><br><br>\r\n“It is time for Europe to put in place support policies for innovation in the book sector and the creative industries in general that truly reflect their role and their potential, while acknowledging their needs and specificities.” Rudy Vanschoonbeek, President, Federation of European Publishers (FEP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Examples like the start-up accelerator Contentshift or the ebook ecosystem Tolino, developed by the German publishing industry in cooperation with ICT, illustrate the interest in innovation in the book publishing sector. But to ensure the diversity and quality of content in the future, there is a strong need for effective financial and structural support for innovation.” Cigdem Aker, Head of Strategy &amp; Innovation, Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels (German Publishers and Booksellers Association),\_<a href=\"mailto:aker@boev.de\">aker@boev.de</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“The Book industry would have great opportunities if there were adequate innovation support policies in place. We need this support firstly for forging innovative partnerships with libraries and schools, aiming to tackle the changes in reading behaviour and, secondly, for creating ‘out of silo’ strategies to counter the power of the platform model of the huge tech companies.” Luis González, Director of Fundación Germán Sánchez Ruipérez (Spain),\_<a href=\"mailto:lgonzalez@fundaciongsr.es\">lgonzalez@fundaciongsr.es</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Publishing industry needs both rules and tools: in last months the debate was focused on the first – the copyright Directive –; it is the time to look also at the second: the support to innovation in all the creative sectors. The vote yesterday in the CULT Committee is very promising: the Parliament is proposing to dedicate funds to support creative industries and in key area, such as copyright management and accessibility. We hope that this direction will be followed in the next steps.” Piero Attanasio, Head of European Affairs and Research and Innovation at AIE (the Italian Publishers Association),\_<a href=\"mailto:piero.attanasio@aie.it\">piero.attanasio@aie.it</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Platformisation and digital transformation are increasingly affecting the role of European media players in international competition. To face this issue, the cultural and creative sectors need better support from the European institutions – especially when it comes to the development of sustainable business models allowing small and medium European actors to compete on a level playing field with the big platforms. These issues should also be reflected very clearly in the next European budget (2021-2027), which is currently being debated in the European Parliament and the European Council.\" Simona De Rosa, Senior Researcher, T6 Ecosystems,\_<a href=\"mailto:s.derosa@t-6.it\">s.derosa@t-6.it</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“In a platform-led digital future, innovative European media sectors are crucial to ensure that citizens have access to diverse content. This can only happen with increasing support at European, national and local levels, in order to ensure a level playing field for these sectors.” Heritiana Ranaivoson, Senior Researcher, Studies imec-SMIT-VUB,\_<a href=\"mailto:hranaivo@vub.be\">hranaivo@vub.be</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Culture and technology are human creations and, as such, share a common DNA. In this sense, the cultural sector must be fully involved in the digital environment. Not as visitors to a foreign land, but as social actors laying claim to what is theirs by right.\" Octavio Kulesz, Editorial Teseo / UNESCO expert,\_<a href=\"mailto:ok@editorialteseo.com\">ok@editorialteseo.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>“State-of-the-art innovation support policies and programmes are crucial for the European cultural and creative industries. Major efforts must concern the modernisation of policy making in the sense of intensive collaboration across silos and based on the concrete needs of the sector. Longer term and reliable cooperation is required. Main debates for future-proof support programmes must include the digital world, global connections and enhancing exchange and cooperation.” Sylvia Amann, inforelais, Co-Chair of the EU-OMC-expert group,\_<a href=\"mailto:office@inforelais.org\">office@inforelais.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&gt; Find further press releases here &gt;<a href=\"https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-releases\">https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-releases</a><br>\r\n&gt; Find further press photos here &gt;<a href=\"https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-material\">https://www.buchmesse.de/en/press/press-material</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>About the Frankfurter Buchmesse\_</strong><br>\r\nThe Frankfurter Buchmesse is the international publishing industry’s biggest trade fair – with over 7,300 exhibitors from 102 countries, around 286,000 visitors, over 4,000 events and some 10,000 accredited journalists and bloggers in attendance.

        intro: "<p>Last week, Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, appeared at THE ARTS+ festival in Frankfurt to take part in visionary discussions about a new ecosystem for the future of culture as part of an #InnovationSummit.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Here, following on from our interview about <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/culture-impact-and-artistic-expression-in-the-digital-transformation-of-society-lessons-from-professor-pier-luigi-sacco\">digital transformation with Professor Pier Luigi Sacco </a>- also part of the #InnovationSummit panel - we hear how\_Harry thinks we should respond to the\_main barriers to tech-triggered innovation in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let's think about culture differently</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry zoomed in on one of the identified barriers - the importance of rethinking the value chains of cultural production. His take is that for too long we have borrowed semantics and structures from the business world, including the concept of a business model. This is a limiting frame because inherent in that borrowing is the idea that in business, returns should directly outweigh investments. And that’s not always the case with culture which should be evaluated by its long-term multiplier effects on society. He poses the question, ‘Surely the value of culture cannot be boiled down to a simple business deal?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what then? Harry argues for a move towards an ‘impact model’ rather than a ‘business model’ as a more constructive frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He says, ‘Cultural heritage significantly contributes to tourism, to education and in a wider sense, identity, social cohesion and a variety of behavioural changes that are highly valued by our society.’ This line of thinking is increasingly adopted in policy circles, says Harry, for example, in the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/sites/culture/files/factsheet-culture-may2018-en.pdf\">New Agenda for Culture</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Europe needs to continue to deepen its investments in culture and innovation so that we can support the so-called <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=digital+transformation\">digital transformation</a> on our own terms.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about Harry's vision of the future for culture, see his interview on the THE ARTS+ festival blog:\_<a href=\"https://www.buchmesse.de/en/node/2489\">WHEN WE BUILD STANDARDS TOGETHER, WE CAN CREATE DATA THAT FLOWS ON THE WEB, WHATEVER THE PLATFORM OR THE SYSTEM.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Following a trip to visit libraries in Latvia and Lithuania, blogger Marlene Hofmann gives us her insights into the future of the museum in a digital world.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em>Marlene works freelance and looks after communication, websites and social media at the German <a href=\"http://burg-posterstein.de/\">Museum Burg Posterstein</a>. She <a href=\"https://www.marlenehofmann.de/\">blogs</a> on </em><em>digitalisation</em><em> and social media in cultural </em><em>organisations</em><em>. Right now she is curating the exhibition project <a href=\"https://salon-europa.eu/en/welcome-to-salon-europa/\">#SalonEuropa</a> for Museum Burg Posterstein - a big online and </em><em>analogue</em><em> interactive experiment.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of September, the <a href=\"https://www.bibliotheksverband.de/metamenue/english\">German Library Association</a> invited me as a culture blogger to visit libraries in Latvia and Lithuania. We wanted to explore how digitisation works in the Baltic countries, which are famous for their ambitious digitisation projects. Many of the Baltic cultural heritage collections are open for everyone and are public domain marked. But what does that mean for the future of cultural institutions?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>When cultural heritage is digital, do we still need museums?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was one of the journalists,\_also invited along for the journey, who discussed this question with me. His arguments were: When cultural heritage is fully digitised and you can access it from wherever you are, why should you visit a museum to see the original? Mostly, you are not allowed to touch the originals and you can only see them behind glass. You cannot zoom in or see them from different sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not know what future technologies will achieve, but most likely, we are going to see high definition virtual reality versions of cultural heritage items. Perhaps we can see more items than museums can put on display today. And of course, we can look at digital items 24 hours a day. Visit many different museums at the same time. For free. Maybe future technologies will imitate reality so perfectly that it will feel as if we were in the real museum – or even better. So, why should society still have real museums?</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is a museum anyway?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://icom.museum/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2017_ICOM_Statutes_EN.pdf\">International Council Of Museums' definition</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘A museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems to me that public domain marked cultural heritage perfectly fits into that definition of ‘museum’. Perhaps then the thing that will change for future museums is the day-to-day work they undertake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definition is so open that the tasks of a museum can be fulfilled digitally as well. Of course, there will still be a need for depot spaces, both analogue and digital conservation, acquirements and staff. In addition, there will still be a need for research, analogue and digital exhibitions and education projects and the related communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether or not museums should charge an admission fee\_is discussed again and again. Museums are administrating society's heritage, they are financed by society and they should be open for everyone. With <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\">OpenGLAM</a>, this openness can only become wider and include everyone in the whole world. Digital exhibitions can even be more interactive and involve more partners and researches. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/foyer\">Europeana Collections exhibitions</a> give an idea of the way future museum exhibitions could evolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Open attitudes to OpenGLAM in Latvia</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In Latvia, I was impressed by the openness towards OpenGLAM\_of all the people we were talking to. For them – librarians, politicians, cultural workers – it was common sense that digitisation included open access to cultural heritage for everyone. Nobody was fearing that GLAMs would not survive digitisation. Nobody was questioning that GLAMs are important for a society to administrate cultural heritage. Nobody was questioning that cultural heritage is important for society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Latvian National Library in Riga we talked to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uzarins\">Uldis Zariņš</a>, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of Culture,\_Europeana Network Association Members Councillor\_and former Director of Development at the National Library of Latvia. His hope is that digitisation can help to unify the Latvian cultural heritage which is spread over archives, libraries and museums in different countries. The Latvian government is planning that in future, only the digitisation projects that make cultural heritage open to everyone will be supported by the state. In my eyes, that's a big statement and a remarkable step towards a democratic use of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The future is digital and analogue at the same time</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We will see how digitalisation changes cultural institutions' daily work. But I am sure, digitalisation will not be the end of museums, archives and libraries as a physical place. Perhaps they will be a meeting place for future culture lovers, too.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>To mark the ending of the World War One centenary, and to showcase Europeana 1914-1918, we have joined forces with the House of European History for a very special series of events on Tuesday 27 and Wednesday 28 November.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Europeana 1914-1918</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, Europeana invited Europe’s citizens and cultural institutions to tell the story of WW1 in a new way by helping to build an online resource, the digital collection Europeana 1914-1918.<br><br>\r\nSince then nearly 15,000 citizens from 24 countries have digitised and shared around 200,000 objects - from letters and diaries, to life-saving bibles and toys carved in trenches - to help tell their family stories. Stories that shine a light on the shared human experience of the conflict, the telling of which has brought people together across borders and generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Europeana 1914-1918 has grown, so has the potential for how the collection can be shared and used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Europeana Transcribathon</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918 builds on the crowdsourcing trend for volunteers to transcribe large numbers of historical documents with the help of a specially designed online tool. The initiative aims to create a fully accessible record of the unique unpublished stories found in Europeana 1914-1918.<br><br>\r\n8 Transcribathon events and 7 <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/runs/\">online runs</a> have taken place across Europe, with more than 23,000 documents having been, or currently being, transcribed by over 1,700 volunteers. In 2018 the Europeana 1914-1918 Transcribathon Centenary Tour has so far brought events to Warsaw, Athens and Rome (with Nicosia to come) as part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage.<br><br><strong>A very special event</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve teamed up with the House of European History to showcase these projects and mark the centenary of the end of the First World War - the huge historical and cultural influence of which inspired their creation. With a variety of events taking place, we invite anyone involved with Europeana 1914-1918, its Transcribathon challenges or with an interest in the First World War to come and join us. You will be able to learn more about the history of the war and how people across Europe remember it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can do so by visiting the House of European History’s gallery on WWI history in their permanent exhibition, showing the European and global dimensions of the first industrialised mass war. There will also be an exclusive display curated especially for the event, including both Europeana 1914-1918 campaign objects and artefacts from the House of European History collection. The exhibitions are free for anyone to attend and you do not need to book tickets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have also organised two roundtable discussions on the transnational legacy, memory and representation on the web of World War One. At these events you will be able to hear from and ask questions of experts from a wide range of fields, from memory organisations to academia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join us on the afternoon and evening of Wednesday 28 November for the closing ceremony during which you can discover how Europeana 1914-1918 inspires creativity with the opportunity to experience <a href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/11-11-memories-retold\">11-11: Memories Retold</a>, a brand new video game based on real events and stories collected in Europeana 1914-1918. You will hear from Commissioner Mariya Gabriel on why cultural heritage is important to the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economies, and we’d love for you to join us at our closing party drinks reception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tickets for the roundtables and the closing event are free, but due to limited space you will need to reserve your place.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

Inviting GIF-makers to use the WWI material in their creation is a great way to bring people’s attention to the topic and available content. It’s also a chance for the creators, but also viewers, to explore non-military aspects of the conflict, including personal experiences expressed through user-generated content. There is a lot of interest in the category and we’ve already received some great submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/i2tgK7vY33kDfxl2yI\" width=\"435\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/gifitup-gifitup2018-i2tgK7vY33kDfxl2yI\">via GIPHY</a>\_Ilona Serbulenko from Odessa, Ukraine Source material: Marie Trovaslet, ouvrière </em><em>d'usine</em><em> chez Bessonneau à Angers | Archives départementales de Maine-et-Loire, Natural straw broad-brimmed hat trimmed with fabric flowers and wheat.

        title: 'Running workshops and translating impact in Poland - a user perspective'
        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Since we launched the first phase of the Impact Playbook, we’ve been delighted to see how many different institutions around the globe have been using it, testing it and holding their own impact workshops. We hear from Maja Drabczyk, Chief International Projects Expert at the National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute Poland on her work running impact workshops in Poland.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>I was first introduced to the Impact Playbook in the fall of 2017 in Tallinn, during one of the workshops run by Europeana. The meeting was kicked off by a truly inspirational presentation \_from Professor Pier Luigi Sacco on Culture 3.0. and the impact cultural participation and cultural heritage has on our creativity, our welfare, and our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until that point, when I needed to report back about the results of my work and the projects I ran, I mostly had to stick to page views and other quantitative statistics. I was missing a qualitative approach to reporting. The Playbook seemed to be offering this different tactic. Therefore I decided to learn more about the methodology and the set of tools and solutions the Playbook offers and became an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/impact-assessment-2-0-task-force\">Impact Task Force member</a>. I decided I wanted to have it tested back home and to verify whether the approach could also work on the Polish GLAM scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What we’ve been doing in Poland</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past three years, together with Marcin Werla, from<a href=\"http://www.man.poznan.pl/\"> the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center</a> (PSNC), I’ve been co-ordinating<a href=\"http://www.tueuropeana.pl/\"> TuEuropeana</a> - a project inviting potential users and institutions with digital archival collections to exchange knowledge and experiences. Our aim is to raise awareness of online repositories, including Europeana Collections, and promote free access and reuse of digital archival content. This year, among other things, we decided to focus on GLAM institutions operating on a local and regional level. Over the course of 2018, we are running \_four seminars for GLAM experts from different parts of Poland during which we are discussing strategies, challenges and opportunities linked to providing free access to and reuse of digital heritage in a local but also in an international context. We are halfway done with two workshops already behind us and with two more to come in the fall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From my experience of running these workshops I can say that the Playbook helps structure group discussion, especially if the focus of the discussion is on stakeholders, strategy, workflow, and finally also impact. It puts the necessary questions in a certain order, at the same time leaving room for a flexible discussion. It supports the project- and process-based approach. I believe that this holistic approach, placing the stakeholders in its centre, could be of much use to colleagues in Poland. And I do hope that the Impact Playbook will play a part in changing our status quo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/DSC_7039_fot_klaudyna_schubert.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translating impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve translated the Playbook into Polish. The translation was a necessary measure if we wanted to have any chance of testing the Playbook with the Polish GLAM community. It took us two weeks to have the Playbook translated and another week or two to have the text integrated with the original layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turned out good translation is key as words can be tricky. For instance, in the Polish language we do not have a direct translation of the word ’impact’ which slightly complicates the whole discussion on the phenomenon of… impact. We needed to refer to synonyms, to create a clear definition of the word. I believe we succeeded and the workshops have helped prove that the instructions and descriptions in the Polish version of the Playbook called ‘Myślenie Efektami’ are intelligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/DSC_6878_fot_klaudyna_schubert.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits, recommendations and what the future holds in store</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest added values of having the Playbook integrated in the seminar’s programme so far is the fact that it enables human interaction. The exercises as well as the encouragement of opinion-sharing and discussion support the group process. In my opinion the Playbook works best when it is in the hands of a set of experts with various knowledge and skills. This highlights \_how relevant the initial preparatory, pre-workshop phase is: I recommend you think carefully about who to involve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At our first workshop in Kraków, during which we used the Playbook to plan an imaginary regional case study promoting access to digital archives, I saw people from the same city but different GLAM institutions passionately discussing aspects of their work which were unknown to their counterparts… At the end, they were exchanging business cards, planning to continue to work together in the near future. I want to believe that our one-day workshop helped them identify the potential there is in their community and how much can be achieved by joint effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still have two more workshops to run this year. Still plenty to learn and some things to improve. For this reason, I am also very much looking forward to my work to come in the Impact Task Force on the parts of the Playbook that still need to be developed. Sometime soon I would also like to run my own impact assessment on one of my projects at FINA. It’s brilliant how easily adaptable the Playbook is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in planning and running your own impact workshop, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">download our Impact Playbook</a> for a step-by-step guide. If you’d like to help translate the Playbook into your language, <a href=\"mailto:impact@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>In our latest Impact case study, we hear from Professor Jens Bley, co-founder of <a href=\"http://live.flyp.tv/eculture/homepage/\">eCultureLab </a>and initiator of <a href=\"https://live.flyp.tv/pg/6mPAO7UvYzXP/home\">SmartSquare</a>, an initiative using digital culture in the revitalisation of an urban square in Hamburg, Germany. Read on to find out more on some of the theoretical questions posed by running an impact assessment with multiple stakeholders.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Our project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SmartSquare is about the revitalisation of an inner city square in Hamburg, Germany, by means of cultural storytelling, data analytics, simulation and service scenarios. The square is the founding area of Hamburg, close to the most frequented shopping streets of the city, yet lesser used. Hardly anyone knows that this is the birthplace of Hamburg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have multiple stakeholders that are relevant in our SmartSquare urban testbed project. The project partners are the eCultureLab and <a href=\"https://www.hcu-hamburg.de/research/csl/\">CityScienceLab</a> of the HafenCity University, the <a href=\"https://amh.de/en/\">Archaeological Museum Hamburg</a> and Hamburg@Work, the cluster of digital economy in Hamburg. Added to this, at the SmartSquare itself the church, the civic foundation, retailers, the district municipality and the Archaeological Museum are all relevant stakeholders. These stakeholders have different yet also overlapping cultural, social and economic impact perspectives that can enhance the project. It’s vital for us to understand these different impacts to ensure we continue to provide a service that makes a real difference to these stakeholders, and the city and people of Hamburg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/SS1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Impact Assessment journey</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Impact assessment looks into the (potential) effect of cultural storytelling with digital signage (in shop windows for example), chatbots, audio tours, beacon paths etc. to increase the physical usage of the square, its relevance and the cultural awareness of people, as well as service scenarios that are developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We observe the square with analog and digital means in regard to the frequency of people, their pathways, their time spent, the interaction with the cultural installations (physical and digital) and the social media communication about the square and its cultural meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin with we held impact workshops with three major stakeholders that are also residents at the square: the Archaeological Museum, the main church St. Petri and the organisation of civic foundations. We focused on the impact perspectives, the measurability of such impacts and the activities. In the course of these workshops we have adapted the process (starting with impact perspectives) and reported this back to the impact modelling team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact workshops were very helpful in identifying the impact perspectives and the commonalities between multiple stakeholders, offering cooperation potentials to achieve a greater joint impact. One unexpected but reassuring outcome from this process was that our stakeholders were surprised how many activities and partial strategies they had in place already, but without having them organised in impact perspectives. The Europeana Impact Playbook allowed them to structure these and make the whole process less daunting and more manageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our next steps are to bundle the “results” from all the stakeholder workshops into a joint impact perspective matrix and analyse the tangible cooperation potentials between the stakeholders. With these joint impact perspectives we can start to connect and coordinate some of the individual activities of the stakeholders into a more unified and joint activity plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/SS3.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our findings so far</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>We found it of utmost importance to get senior executives of stakeholders involved in our impact perspectives workshop. This created a bigger buy-in into a workshop-driven process.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>We found that there is a fine line between the social and economic impact perspectives, however it is important to collect all these perspectives even if they might appear double in the different categories. For example, both the church and the archaeological museum view the potentially increased content-driven contacts with citizens not only as a means to thought leadership and cultural information dissemination, but also as a means to convert these citizens into paying users of their facilities or donors.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n    <p>Finally, we found that the discussion about measurability of each impact perspective is key to a true outcome of the impact process. It converts lofty perspectives into tangible avenues. We have analysed the impact perspectives jointly with the stakeholders in regard to their ability and requirements to deliver on such an impact perspective and their own accountability. For example, ‘thought leadership’ can be measured by quotations, but also by usage of so-called certified content by city guides. We consider these tangible outcomes of activities in the context of impact perspectives.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/SS2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our recommendations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Europeana Impact Playbook as a process to organise your desired and your actual impact perspectives and then map your current activities against this matrix. It will show that there are many activities that can be clustered into a more meaningful strategic impact roadmap. In a multiple stakeholder setting like ours, the impact perspectives have to very clearly stated in order to be able to assess cooperation potential or adverse momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in planning and running your own impact workshop,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">download our Impact Playbook</a>\_for a step-by-step guide.\_</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We speak to Europeana #EdTech Challenge Winner Léna Mazilu about the launch of the educational app Birdie Memory, which brings together the digital and physical to teach children about 20 European birds and their songs.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In today’s digital world most children do not play outside as much as in the past, hence are less aware of nature around them. Fascinated by nature, and working on meaningful projects that educate the young, multimedia designers Léna and Yoan developed \_<a href=\"https://birdiememory.com/en/\">Birdie Memory</a>\_- a beautiful hand drawn poster of common birds and an app which, when pointed at the poster, brings the birds to life and song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As one of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-edtech-challenge-winners-announced\">Europeana #edTech Challenge</a> winners, how did this contribute to the development of your app?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been attracted to biology and natural sciences and as a designer have already worked with augmented reality in children books. I found a wonderful selection of bird songs on Europeana which sparked ideas in my mind. \_With no other project constraints I had time to design the concept. Yoann as a software developer was looking to work on projects with more meaning, and so it was perfect timing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/birdie_team.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>#EdTech Challenge winners Maxime Zucca, Léna Mazilu and Yoann Guény (L-R), 2018, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is it for?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is for everyone, it’s especially good for children from the ages four and above but adults get hooked too. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What were the easiest and most challenging aspects of creating the app?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hardest part to me was communicating and deciding on the business model, this is not our field so we had to decide on the price and look for shipping solutions. The easiest part was painting the birds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoan on the other hand found that the easiest aspect of creating the app was to develop the user interface, because we made it clean and simple for the user. But on the other hand, the design (conception) of it was the most challenging part, because we had to understand how our users think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/12.9_05.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screen of Birdie Memory, 2018, CC BY-SA.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>How did you choose the sounds for the app?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of sounds, for example 20 sounds of the woodpecker and we didn’t know which one was the most representative. We let Maxim who is the ornithologist do the search, he selected two or three sounds per bird and then we decided on which sound was best suited in terms of length and quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is Birdie Memory app different from other educational games? What makes it unique?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of apps on learning bird sounds but, to my knowledge, there are no augmented reality apps for birding. \_For me, this kind of hybrid tool, a mix\_with a tangible object and the digital is really powerful because it uses the best of the two materials. With the digital you can have sound and feedback on your sound choice, if you selected the right or wrong one. \_You can repeat it a number of times, which makes it very good for your learning process, and at the same time having a physical support seems to be very important. It keeps the images fixed in your mind - if you read an article on the web, you are more likely to forget it and if you read the same one on paper, you will remember it. We memorise things a lot easier when they are part of our physical world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why do you think digital educational apps such as Birdie Memory can benefit learners?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We live in cities, children hardly go to play outside as much as in the past. We are very cut off from nature. This is an easy and simple way to reconnect a bit, for example if a child can recognise a blackbird then they are more aware, if one day he or she reads that they are disappearing then it can create an impact on them that may trigger them to be more invovled in preserving nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/43287020_2003477783046028_1427791714969452544_n.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Children playing Birdie Memory at Fête de la Nature in Paris, 2018, CC BY-SA.\_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you have future plans for the game’s development? If so, what are they?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our immediate plan is to launch the <a href=\"https://www.ulule.com/birdie-memory/\">crowdfunding campaign</a> which will allow us to print a lot more posters. We will try to make partnerships with NGOs and sell the posters in physical shops as well as our e-shop. If this proves successful, it will allow us to work on adaptations of the poster into books, puzzles, or cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then our other ambitions would be to make some posters with birds of America and Australia, we would then go into also making posters with other animals as well. There is a lot that can be done with sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like the idea, the app can be downloaded for free on the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/birdie-memory/id1436059317?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D2\">AppStore</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.berlobi.birdiememory\">Google Play</a> while the poster can be purchased at a small price on the Birdie Memory <a href=\"https://www.birdiememory.com/en/buy\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<h3>The cultural relevance of GIFs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GIFs are a great example of the contemporary <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/culture-impact-and-artistic-expression-in-the-digital-transformation-of-society-lessons-from-professor-pier-luigi-sacco\">remix culture</a> where audiovisual materials are continuously reused and reinterpreted. Giving immediate visual cues, they help us tell stories, express our feelings and give new meanings to the existing visual material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GIF is a community-oriented medium;\_something that originates in community efforts and becomes distributed across digital platforms by and for people recognising the same cultural references.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since GIFs draw meanings from other cultural texts, their interpretation is not always universally accessible. When extracting particular moments from audiovisual culture, GIF makers represent the outlook of certain communities who are able to decipher their meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:80%;position:relative;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3o7aD8NttMtdKBog4U\" style=\"position:absolute\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/benglabs-film-1980-3o7aD8NttMtdKBog4U\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Preserving GIFs for future generations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When thinking about archiving GIFs, the action of saving the GIF file is not enough. To make the process successful and useful, we have to think about capturing the context of the culture and the community that creates and uses it. Archiving GIFs requires an investigation of methods that would preserve and represent these frameworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring the possibilities of preserving GIFs raises questions around authorship, contextualisation, the role of users and presentation of digital objects with multiple meanings. Rasa and Brigitte plan to research these questions, which\_institutions would need to address when making their attempts to preserve GIFs and create GIF collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Dutch GIF Collection for World Day of Audiovisual Heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>On 27 October, we celebrate the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/audiovisualday/\">UN World Day of Audiovisual Heritage</a>. It’s a great opportunity to promote the work of archives holding audiovisual materials and spread the message about the importance of cultural heritage preservation to wider audiences. The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision has decided to use this day to announce the start of a new venture - a Dutch GIF collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:76%;position:relative;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/1dOdEwCx2pfIUU9gRa\" style=\"position:absolute\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/benglabs-camera-photoshoot-photographer-1dOdEwCx2pfIUU9gRa\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 26-28 October, the public will be able to vote on the GIFs that they want to see preserved for the future using Sound and Vision’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/beeldgeluid/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>. They will also invite the audience to submit GIFs that they would like to preserve for the future generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GIF collection would offer an entry point into the analysis and discussion of the Dutch society, its behaviour and representation in the digital space.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"100%\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/1yTehJohntMp6PddUC\" style=\"position:absolute\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/benglabs-summer-beach-sea-1yTehJohntMp6PddUC\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        title: 'What Dutch GLAMs want from Wikidata'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>After the past few <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/harnessing-the-power-of-structured-data-a-wikidata-workshop\">Wikidata workshops</a>, it has become clear that Wikidata is in demand in the GLAM\_sector. The main question now is: ‘How do we start?’.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Dutch galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) are interested in the value that <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/linked-data-looking-ahead\">Linked Data</a> can bring to their collections. They are looking for insight into how they can turn this theoretical value into practice, and they seek more workshops and tutorials on using Wikidata tools in their daily work. These are the outcomes of the Wikidata workshop from 12 October, organised by Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed, Wikimedia Netherlands and Europeana. The workshop, packed with data enthusiasts from all over the Netherlands, showed that Dutch GLAMs are enthusiastic about taking the quality of their collections to a higher level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what is Wikidata’s value to GLAMs? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Structuring the metadata of cultural heritage objects as Linked Data brings a lot of potential benefits: it can increase the findability of your objects, allows for multilingual searches for the same term and automatic translations, and the addition of more information on an object from other sources, to name a few. Both the workshop organisers as well, as some representatives from GLAMs themselves, talked about the ways that they find value in using Wikidata in their collections. Learn more about how and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/why-data-partners-should-link-their-vocabulary-to-wikidata-a-new-case-study\">why we think you should create Linked Data vocabularies.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>On the one hand, I would love to see more of these kinds of workshops, especially ones combining theory and practice. On the other hand, as someone working in a Museum, I feel the need to situate all these opportunities: how are we going to implement this in our institution? What does it mean for our collections? Will data from Wikidata flow back into our own Collection System? I feel like I want to learn more about how the<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/social-semantic-web-interview-with-europeanatech\"> semantic web</a> can feed into our own collections and processes.<br><span style=\"text-align:right\">     - Wikidata workshop attendee</span>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Putting Wikidata into practice</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Testimonies from GLAMs provide a lot of insight into taking the first steps towards using Wikidata in cultural heritage collections. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z_kSU5iyNA9cDnJepE00ZwvCXAfcYZfco69kI78wiFM/edit?usp=sharing\">Erfgoed Gelderland</a> showed how setting up pilot projects and recruiting a Wikimedian-in-residence are great ways to start collecting expertise and building a linked data infrastructure in your own institution. Jesse de Vos and Ursula Oberst showed how they went through the process of using available open-source free-to-use tools to connect their cultural heritage collections to Wikidata entities (presentations <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ztXKyG6S9Zu83T_dGEq08dpStQzaVVlGZOznOMcPy-k/edit?usp=sharing\">here </a>and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IBoNd3rHtoJk5xFnO5MUpBCZcMmoFCdU\">here</a>). Knowing that there are tools like OpenRefine and Mix’n’Match out there to help is great, but learning how to use them and get the most out of features is where the real value lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Europeanaeu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DigitaalErfgoed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DigitaalErfgoed</a> ❤ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wikidata?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wikidata</a> at Workshop Structured data in The Hague <a href=\"https://t.co/cjkkOoikyy\">pic.twitter.com/cjkkOoikyy</a></p>\r\n— Wikimedia Nederland (@wmnl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wmnl/status/1050665337895628800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2018</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Find introductions and tutorials to start using Wikidata today</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the biggest request from people attending the workshop was that they wanted to find more workshops, tutorials and places to get hands-on beginner experience in using Wikidata. There is a myriad of resources already available, from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVrAx3AmUvA\">gentle introduction to Wikidata for complete beginners on </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVrAx3AmUvA\">Youtube</a> to steps on <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata:WikiProject_Cultural_heritage/Guidelines/Ingesting_Datasets_into_Wikidata&amp;oldid=605260785\">how to ingest data into Wikidata</a>, and the more advanced guides on <a href=\"https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/writing-a-wikidata-query-discovering-women-writers-from-north-africa-d020634f0f6c\">how to understand (and maybe even write) a SPARQL query</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the success of these kinds of Wikidata workshops in the Netherlands, other Wikimedia chapters across Europe could start doing the same to engage their local GLAMs to become more involved in Wikidata to enrich their collections. Where would you like to see the next Wikidata workshop take place?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>Recommended tools &amp; resources on getting started w wikidata <a href=\"https://t.co/m1VRdNpqbq\">pic.twitter.com/m1VRdNpqbq</a></p>\r\n— Chris Meyns (@chrismeyns) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrismeyns/status/1050686292986609665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2018</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Find this workshop’s <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Events/WMNL_NDE_Europeana_wikidata_workshop\">information and presentation slides</a>.</b></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Ten years ago, the European Union was inspired by its Member States to make a bold statement \_- that access to our cultural heritage online is too important to leave to market forces - and Europeana was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the Europeana initiative provides a platform where everyone can freely access tens of millions of items from thousands of cultural heritage institutions online, for education, research, creativity and pleasure. But, over the past decade, it has also become more than a portal – it is a movement for change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this anniversary series, we look at what the Europeana initiative is doing, what it has achieved, and how it is looking to the future. At its very heart, of course, is cultural heritage and in this first post, we look at 10 reasons to open up cultural heritage data for <a href=\"https://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/\">free reuse</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ca31099b-7fff-3cd7-8715-96452134370e\">10 reasons to open up!</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Fulfil</strong><strong> your mission</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making your collections available for research, education and creativity is often part of an organisation’s mission, which an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">open approach can help fulfil</a>. Research and education are perceived as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">top motivations for digitisation</a>, reflecting a desire that people do something with digital heritage content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Get more people to notice you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An open approach can increase the public’s awareness of and engagement with an institution’s collections, both <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09548963.2016.1241342\">online</a> and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/2159032X.2016.1246156\">in person</a> - because if it’s not open, people can’t use it, play with it or share it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Get higher up on Google</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening up helps bring the best of a collection to the <a href=\"https://medium.com/barnes-foundation/open-access-at-the-barnes-e08daf2c5a33\">top of Google search engine rankings</a> and helps searchers <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/democratising-the-rijksmuseum\">find high-quality images</a> first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Make better use of social media</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage institutions (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">surveyed</a> in 2017) expect significant growth in social media as a channel for their collections. When cultural heritage items are openly licensed, they can be shared, shared and shared again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Work with other </strong><strong>organisations</strong><strong> and join high-profile campaigns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partner with organisations like Wikipedia and Wikimedia, Flickr, Europeana and Google Art to <a href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/digital-underground/2017/open-access-at-the-met\">engage with new audiences across the world</a> and to find new uses for your content.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>I've been looking at the 'impact' of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/I_W_M?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@I_W_M</a> collections images on Wikipedia. The stats are absolutely mind blowing - thread ...</p>\r\n— James Morley (@jamesinealing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesinealing/status/984817180578664449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2018</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Build and capitalise</strong><strong> on a stronger brand</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening up can improve an organisation’s <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf\">brand and reputation</a> which can lead to new funding avenues (many of which require openly available outputs) and income streams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Capture the knowledge and enthusiasm of the crowd</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been said that ‘the organizations that prioritise openness and sharing...are <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf\">reaping the most benefits</a>’ from crowdsourcing. In one\_example, opening up allowed members of the public\_to help <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">identify problems</a> with an institution’s metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Join the broader ‘open’ movement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as furthering campaigns like <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/open-culture-cultural-heritage-professionals-tell-us-why-we-should-open-up-glam-collections\">Open Culture</a> and <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\">OpenGlam</a>, you’ll be joining the broader and growing ‘open’ movement, including Open Education, Open Data and Open Government as well as contributing to the developing <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=digital+transformation\">digital transformation</a> of society through culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Make your </strong><strong>organisation</strong><strong> more efficient and effective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Removing barriers to access (where they are not required) can <a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf\">save time and money </a>and help you <a href=\"http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2015/04/10/reusing-te-papas-collections-images-by-the-numbers/\">focus on the most important objectives</a>: ‘retaining more restrictive terms of use may cost organisations in funding, staff time, and reputation’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Move beyond image licensing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">survey</a> in 2017 showed that ‘sales and commercial licensing’ was the least important motivation for digitisation, confirming that 'Revenue [from exploiting digital collections] matters less than many institutions think it does'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take action</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out more about how opening up your data can benefit your organisation in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a> and by reading our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-case-studies\">impact case studies</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’d like to publish new or improved data with Europeana, see <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reasons-to-share-your-data-on-europeana-collections.\">reasons to share your data on Europeana Collections</a> and our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services\">resources for data providers</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sources and recommended reading</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">Enumerate survey 2017</a>, DEN and Europeana</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf\">The Impact of Open Access on Galleries, Libraries, Museums, &amp; Archives</a>, Effie Kapsalis (2016)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub157/\">Images of Works of Art in Museum Collections: The Experience of Open Access</a>, Kristin Kelly (2013)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/democratising-the-rijksmuseum\">Democratising the Rijksmuseum</a>, Joris Pekel (2014)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/hjk/article/view/1191\">MKG Collection online: the potential of open museum collections</a>, Antje Schmidt (2018)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/making-impact-on-a-small-budget\">Making impact on a small budget</a>, Joris Pekel (2015)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/OIR-06-2015-0193\">Opening Access to collections: the making and using of open digitised cultural content</a>, Melissa Terras (2015)</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>"

        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Everybody wants to understand the impact of their work better, but for many the process can seem daunting. In this case study, we hear from Leiden University Libraries’ Marco de Niet on their novel approach to an impact workshop.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Impact Awareness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This summer, I organised an impact workshop based on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">Europeana Impact Playbook</a> at Leiden University Libraries (UBL). As co-chair of the Europeana Impact Taskforce and as a new employee at the library, I was eager to introduce the Playbook to my colleagues there. As some of the terms and concepts of impact assessment can be daunting at first look, we decided that the goal of the workshop should be to let staff members of UBL familiarise themselves with the Europeana Impact Framework and the tools and methods described in the Playbook, in order to get a shared understanding of impact with digital heritage collections. Because we didn’t aim to establish a fully developed impact assessment, the workshop could probably better be qualified as an Impact Awareness Workshop rather than an Impact Assessment Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We used a UBL project that develops educational tools for students with digitised medieval manuscripts as a case study. Led by Erik Kwakkel and supported through the services of the UBL and social media channels, the digital collection and its tools will also become available to the wider public. This project was chosen as a case study for the workshop because we think the impact of this digital collection on its users could be discussed from various viewpoints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve colleagues joined the workshop, comprising members of staff from a range of departments and disciplines. Through them, the wide range of user groups of the UBL (academic/non-academic, local/virtual, professional/general interest) could be assessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the workshop, a slide deck was created to control the progress and the timings of the workshop. The slide deck was based on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-resources\">Europeana Impact Slide Deck</a>. This was augmented with specific information on the Dutch national strategy on digital heritage, the specific user groups of the UBL, the case study and instructions (in Dutch) for the workshop activities in subgroups. The slide deck was used throughout the workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three out of five tools from the Europeana Playbook were downloaded, printed and used in the workshop: the Empathy Map, the Change Pathway and the Strategic Perspectives. The Pathway Builder and the Value Lenses were not used, due to the nature of the workshop as a one-off impact awareness event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/MDN1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Europeana impact tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the workshop, we worked with three tools from the Playbook. All three were evaluated positively:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. The Empathy Map proved to be a good start for the subgroups and the individual participants to put themselves in the shoes of a specific user. In the workshop, two subgroups chose a professional researcher at the university as a stakeholder, one group chose an advanced student and the fourth group a general student. Some groups wrote elaborate notes on the Empathy Map, others mainly used the print-out as a starting point for a discussion on impact on a specific user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/MDN2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. The Impact Pathway was the most important tool used in the workshop to better understand the notion of impact and to understand the differences between buzzwords like 'output', 'outcome' and 'impact'. A key factor of success in using the Pathway was to state that the participants needed to start at the right end of the sheet (the impact statement) and work their way back towards the left (ending with describing the resources and activities). All groups were inclined to start from the resources and activities (their daily reality) and then work towards impact assessment. It was an eye opener to start with the notion of the impact you intend to achieve in the long run, instead of taking your current daily activities as the starting point for assessing impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Impact/impact%20images/MDN3.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. The Strategic Perspectives were used as a tool to have a fresh look at the Impact Pathway as created by the subgroup. It was not really a surprise that all the subgroups had automatically chosen the Social (socio-cultural) perspective when building the Pathway, as this perspective is closest to the nature of the jobs of the staff members that participated. Bringing in the other perspectives (Economical, Organisational and Innovation) proved to be useful to deepen and expand the discussions on the Pathway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting up an Impact Awareness Workshop: Our learnings</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>While having a case study helped to get a better focus on the academic user groups, in the end the discussions in the subgroups were not very specifically focused on this case. Indeed, it may not be necessary to have such a case study, as it could even limit the discussions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Think very carefully about how you place your subgroups. With 12 participants we decided to do the exercises in small groups of three people. This provided a good opportunity for all participants to be actively involved and not let a single person be too dominant in a subgroup, however some of the groups worked better together than others. If we did this again, we might choose to work in three groups of four instead.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Even though our workshop lasted four hours, we did not have enough time reserved for group reflections. Our participants’ feedback suggested they felt this was a missed opportunity.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>One element of the Impact Pathway caused some confusion. In the example in the Impact slide deck (slide 48), the stakeholder is a History Teacher. But the explanation below the pathway seems to indicate that the true stakeholders are the students of the teacher. If that is the case, then why aren't the students mentioned in the example in the stakeholder box on the left? This confusion about who is the real stakeholder led to a discussion away from the model of the pathway. We gave this feedback to Europeana and they are developing a clearer approach for the next version of the Playbook.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Setting up an Impact Awareness Workshop: Our conclusions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop definitely helped to increase a common understanding at UBL of what impact is about, and the participants felt the Europeana approach to impact could also be useful\_in contexts other than digital cultural heritage (for example for assessing impact of academic\_information services).\_The methodology and tools received positive feedback and the Europeana Slide Deck proved to\_be a very efficient and comprehensive tool to help prepare and execute the workshop. My goal was to raise awareness and familiarise my colleagues with impact - and this awareness workshop helped us do just that. As an organisation we were not yet ready to dive straight in to a full impact assessment, including impact design and impact narration, as described in the Playbook. So I can strongly recommend that if your colleagues are not yet very familiar with impact assessments a similar awareness workshop is a very good start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in planning and running your own impact workshop,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">download our Impact Playbook</a>\_for a step-by-step guide.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The potential for the use of digital cultural heritage in education is widely acknowledged, but it doesn’t happen just by providing access to the material. Sources need to be selected, contextualised, and (crucially) become part of learning activities for students.

        body: "<h2>A practical tool for teacher trainers available now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Teacher Training Guide <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Teacher%20Training%20Package%20-%20Europeana%20DSI3.docx\">How to use online tools to promote historical thinking?</a> is designed for teacher trainers to challenge and support their trainees or colleagues to create, adapt and use <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/history-educators-can-now-create-their-own-online-learning-environment-with-europeana-1\">eLearning activities</a> that promote historical thinking using the Historiana eLearning Environment and European Source Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Teacher Training guide focuses on the needs of teacher trainers to make it easy for them to provide workshops that are motivating and meaningful for the trainee teachers that participate. The guide gives teacher trainers access to the ready-to-use peer-reviewed material. And it supports teacher trainers in encouraging trainees to create their own eLearning Activity based on a historical thinking challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-92b13a5b-7fff-c713-b1d1-a6f565ce3821\"><img height=\"334\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3ef9qp-bcRjzWbOMDr7Lhzo5CWESqft4VaVulW1Oz4CHGitpqXd-E9SXwCaXSwnshrYbDWEsXYTNwJBv6gBMcj649CU2Jtot1d6aIfVa_TVrjsNURHABEft6CTFixE7YlD0TDR9J\" width=\"252\"></b></h3>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s in the guide?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Guide opens with some background information on the developers, the Historiana eLearning Environment and why the guide was developed. It includes practical information on how to set up a workshop that teacher trainers can use as a guide to construct their own way to deliver the training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One section, Setting a challenge for teachers, presents a set of six challenges to teachers to create an eLearning activity that helps students to think and work historically.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>\r\n<br>\r\nSource material</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All the source collections, eLearning activities and other materials are open source and available on the Europeana Collections and Historiana websites. These sources include a wide range of collections from <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/different-views-on-Napoleon-Bonaparte\">Different Views on Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/post-war-europe\">Post War Europe</a>, to <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/orientalist-art\">Orientalist Art</a> and <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/schisms-within-christianity\">Schisms within Christianity</a> (see image below). Examples of eLearning Activities focus are <a href=\"http://hi.st/EI\">Writing good historical narratives</a>, <a href=\"http://hi.st/EH\">How did a World War break out in 1914?</a>, <a href=\"http://hi.st/EG\">What can sources reveal about Europe 1945-47?</a> and <a href=\"http://hi.st/EF\">Why did so many Europeans migrate to the USA?</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The source collections are not only available but are curated, contextualised and licensed to be reused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-e80c9f4e-7fff-e3af-9dd4-25bc7743046e\"><img height=\"440\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fNAlcil_YxO4fH9wim9xW21CUuDzdvasqYS69eMGGzwWg0k1VL8WI7RShMbuM02NPtJvYq18UuTMIr8NMxXn5cDJ7e5b4UhtZAm8gUalhpMd1wyHOWTGt699QJOgKBejcuBLsVll\" width=\"624\"></b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next for Europeana and EUROCLIO?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the workshops, the trainee teachers are asked to give suggestions and imagine what should be improved, thereby ensuring that the Historiana web resource (from EUROCLIO) is further developed in a way that meets the needs of its audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the upcoming months, the Teacher Training Guide will be used by trainers during professional development events with EUROCLIO members and Teacher Training Institutes. EUROCLIO and Europeana will also work together on workshops using the Europeana Collections content. In parallel, EUROCLIO and Europeana are working with professional historians and practising history educators to develop eLearning activities and Source Collections, so that trainers can select from a much broader range of themes and topics for their workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, help organising a teacher training event, please contact steven@euroclio.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Impact Playbook is helping cultural heritage institutions around the world discover and analyse the impact of their activities. We’ve been working with some of them to help develop our work on impact further, and we’ve been talking to others about their experiences with the first phase of the Impact Playbook. Together these experiences are helping to shape the next version of the playbook - due to be released in beta by the end of the year. \_We hear from 3 very different projects about the things they have done to help understand their impact.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Our impact case studies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each study presents a very different perspective on exploring impact. Developed by members of our community, they are useful for anyone interested in understanding the impact of their work. From those considering starting an impact assessment to those who have already done so and might want to consider getting further buy-in among colleagues, stakeholders, and the wider cultural heritage community in their country and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discover how Leiden Universities Libraries chose to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/using-the-impact-playbook-to-raise-awareness-and-build-confidence-with-impact\">adapt the Impact Playbook to run an Impact Awareness Workshop</a>, with the aim of getting colleagues from a number of different disciplines familiar with impact and using the same language to talk about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘The workshop definitely helped to increase a common understanding at UBL of what impact is\_about, and our participants felt the Europeana approach to impact could also be useful\_in contexts other than digital cultural heritage.’</em>\_Marco De Niet, Leiden Universities Libraries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find out how about the impact created by revitalising an old urban square in Germany as well as some of the theoretical considerations for <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/what-the-europeana-impact-playbook-taught-a-city-about-revitalising-an-inner-city-square\">running an impact assessment with a large number of stakeholders</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘One unexpected but reassuring outcome from this process was that our stakeholders were surprised how many activities and partial strategies they had in place already, but without having them organised in impact perspectives.’</em>\_Jens Bley, SmartSquare</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, read how the Impact Playbook has been used to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/running-workshops-and-translating-impact-in-poland-a-user-perspective\">run workshops across the cultural heritage sector in Poland, including how it was translated</a> ensuring that the common language we’ve created for the cultural heritage sector to talk about impact knows no borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘One of the biggest added values of having the Playbook integrated in the seminar’s programme so far is the fact that it enables human interaction. The exercises as well as the encouragement of opinion-sharing and discussion support the group process.’</em>\_Maya Drabczyk, National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute Poland</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can read all of the case studies mentioned above, and others, in our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/impact-case-studies\">case studies</a> section. and if you haven’t already, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\">download the Impact Playbook </a>to help you start your impact journey.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The individual sides to history: human aspects of WW1'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We speak to Yoan Fanise, creative director and co-founder of (the independent video game development studio) DigixArt about the launch of the moving WW1 video game <em>11-11: Memories Retold</em> and the importance of highlighting the differing and personal aspects of historical events.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Often, history books tell a specific perspective on historical events. This is perhaps most relevant in the retelling of wars. War is hardly ever told through the eyes of common individuals who may have been dreaming of a heroic adventure sold to them through unrealistic <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Wellcome%20Collection&amp;f%5BMEDIA%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;locale=en&amp;q=proxy_dc_creator%3A%20%22http%3A%2F%2Fdata.europeana.eu%2Fagent%2Fbase%2F717%22%20OR%20proxy_dc_contributo&amp;view=grid\">propaganda</a> or the viewpoint of those forcefully enlisted. The human element is so often left out of retellings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captivated by his own family history during WW1, Yoan Fanis brings to us <em>11-11: Memories Retold</em>\_- a touching story about the relationship between two men on different sides of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How did your relationship with Europeana begin?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s funny because I met both Europeana and Aardman (the animation studio who worked with us on <em>11-11: Memories Retold</em>) at the Games For Change Festival in Paris a couple of years ago. Because of Europeana’s interest in creating a space for interaction with creatives on meaningful projects, we decided to keep in touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After starting the discussion with Aardman about this project, I began digging into the historical aspects of World War One and decided to contact Europeana to work on this together. We already had two historians but found that Europeana would be a useful partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In collaboration with the team from the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918 Collection</a>, we selected the documents to be used in the game and transcribed their meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/11-11_DigixArtDevTeam2.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>DigixArt dev team, 2018, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Who is the game for?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The game’s minimum age is 12 years old. During the Paris Game Week, we discovered that young people really like this game; however, we were not sure they were completely aware of the meaning behind it. Therefore, due to its mature topic, I’d say that the game is more suitable for older players. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of creating <em>11-11: Memories Retold</em>?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest challenge was the creation of the painterly effect (when a video game animation takes on a ‘painting-like’ quality). I wanted an art style that would allow us to explore and show emotions and was convinced that with impressionism you can express feelings better in the pictures. We needed to make this work and not be too disturbing for the eyes which (with the hard work and determination of the programmer and art director in Aardman) took two years to accomplish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another challenging aspect was working together as two studios in different countries. It’s hard because when you are not with the person, like the animator or programmer who works on the animation of the playable characters, and it’s treated in two studios, it can be quite challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/11-11_Gamescom2018_UnderVimy_1534540480.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of 11-11: Memories Retold, 2018, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How did you choose content for the game and what drew you towards the Europeana 1914-1918 content?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The game is about the two sides of World War One, shown from the perspective of the Canadian allies and the German army, in which you play both characters. We had a lot of sources from the allied side, but not from the German side. For the character of Harry - the German soldier - we needed more materials and Europeana was a great source for that. Europeana 1914-1918 has so many documents,\_some of which are very personal, especially those collected from families. Those are the stories that I was looking for in order to humanise Harry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has a nice licence filter, we know what we can and can’t use and since we wanted to put the documents into the game we needed to make sure the copyright is cleared. This was one of the reasons we used Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/11-11_Gamescom_AcrossTheTrench_1534523355.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of 11-11: Memories Retold, 2018, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How is <em>11-11: Memories Retold</em> different from other World War One games? What makes it unique?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are not many World War One games, and only a few with mainstream popularity. These tend to focus on shooting. The graphism and environment are nice and they respect a lot of uniforms and the historicity of things, but the subject often fails to take into account the human stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>11-11: Memories Retold</em> is really mature and talks about complex, human feelings. For example, the Canadian character Kurt is a father and, as Kurt, you have to write letters to your daughter. She is just eight years old so you have to figure out what you can and can’t tell her about the war in order to not traumatise her. Sometimes you have to decide to lie for a good cause. These kinds of questions you have as a father are interesting and make for a mature game. Everything about the game is adult in an emotional way, even the visuals - although there is no graphical violence in it, it triggers very strong and deep emotions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s unique about the game is the number of choices you have to make. At first, they are not exactly noticeable, but as you head towards the end, you start to realise that all the choices you made have consequences. What you’ve done will cause certain things to happen and you can decide to start again at a certain point in the game to try and have a (hopefully) happier ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Blog%20Posts/11-11_Gamescom_KartinAndLucy_1534523367.jpg\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;display:block\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Screenshot of 11-11: Memories Retold, 2018, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>How do you think the game can benefit learners/people?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the game is not explicitly made for teaching, we notice people are getting more curious about it. When they finish the game, they want to know more about what happened to their own families and about that period of time. This is great - \_if it shows the human element\_and taps into people’s emotions, then that’s perfect for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Do you have future plans for the game’s development? If so, what are they?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have so many game ideas that it is hard to choose. We are waiting for the launch of the game to see if it’s a success or not. \_If it is, then we want to make other games similar to this one that would be under the brand of Memories Retold, on different topics. \_For example slavery, again from two characters’ perspectives. These games would question what was normal at the time and our own morals and values as we play. \_Or even set the game in modern settings with men and women, like identical twins, one brother and a sister, and show how their lives evolve differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of the negative things that happen - even now with nationalism, inequality and so on - are because people don’t see perspectives outside of their own. If we show people another perspective, they are more likely to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find <em><a href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/11-11-memories-retold\">11-11: Memories Retold</a></em> or the many <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/pages/apps/showcase/markets/creative-industries\">games</a> that have been developed using content from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl\">Europeana Collections</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'How to bring digital cultural heritage to 3D design and virtual reality'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>As the technological capabilities to digitise cultural objects in 3D increases, so too does the value of these data sources for architects, designers, and video game creators. The real challenge lies in making 3D cultural heritage easily accessible and reusable for those audiences. That is precisely the challenge that the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/v4design\">V4Design project</a> is taking on.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2016/07/bigartride-exploring-art-cycling-and-a-virtual-city/\">several </a><a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/12/virtual-reality-and-the-museum-of-the-future/\">Virtual Reality</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2017/01/exploring-3d-on-europeana-with-sketchfab/\">3D projects</a> that reuse cultural heritage can attest, it’s<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/creating-3d-content-for-europeana-a-big-challenge\"> not easy</a> to seamlessly import digital cultural heritage objects/ into a 3D-modelling environment. It’s a long and often painstaking process to create a reproduction of a painting by Rembrandt in your VR museum experience or to reconstruct the Venus de Milo in your 3D-modelling program. A lot of GLAMs producing full 3D digital objects don’t release those models for free, raising the barrier to entry for reuse of cultural heritage. On top of that, creating 3D models isn't cheap.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, however, an immense amount of 2D digital cultural heritage content. What if we could bring ready-made 3D objects closer to the audience that wants to reuse them, and make it easier for that audience to reuse 2D cultural heritage in a 3D environment at the same time?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the V4Design project is to make it as easy to reuse cultural heritage in a 3D environment as it is to drag and drop. We aim to do this by importing cultural heritage assets from a number of sources, enriching and transforming them to be easily reusable in 3D programs, and then serving them through plugins into your favourite 3D editing tool (e.g. Rhino3D, Unity). This is important because of the current size and growth of the 3D and VR creative spheres, and those audiences could benefit from initiatives focused on providing them with useful source data for their work. (Watch the video below for more info!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxH3jU-qrlI\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is filled with exciting cultural heritage, a lot of which is free to reuse and repurpose by all. Not a lot of the content is in 3D though, and when it is, it’s mostly stored in non-reusable formats like 3D PDF. There have been <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/advanced-documentation-of-3d-digital-assets\">efforts to address this</a>, but none that have reached conclusive success. The V4Design project is looking at this problem from another angle: instead of getting more 3D objects in Europeana, V4Design is researching ways to create 3D objects from previously digitised 2D cultural heritage material. These are state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction tasks that pose their own unique challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"giphy-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/88inqBZiII3M3oRr4N?video=0\" width=\"480\"></iframe><br><a href=\"https://giphy.com/gifs/3d-delphi-reconstruction-88inqBZiII3M3oRr4N\">via GIPHY</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s impossible to create a 3D model from a single photograph or image of a cultural heritage object. This makes the majority of digitised cultural heritage, therefore, ineligible for 3D reconstruction. There’s the possibility of 3D reconstructing an object when several photographs have been taken from the same object, at different angles. It’s also possible to 3D reconstruct objects from a video taken from an object, given the right circumstances. V4Design wants to create an easy tool where you can input your digitised 2D cultural heritage objects, like photo series or historical video snippets, and have 3D objects extracted from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of trying to create 3D models from already digitised 2D cultural heritage, V4Design further aims to enrich already-existing 3D cultural heritage models. There are already some great sources to find free 3D cultural heritage objects, like <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com/museums\">SketchFab </a>and MyMiniFactory’s <a href=\"https://www.myminifactory.com/scantheworld/\">Scan the world</a>. Getting as many of those beautiful 3D objects as close to those who can reuse them as possible is V4Design’s mission for the next two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read more about V4Design on\_<a href=\"http://v4design.eu\">their website</a>, or on their Europeana Pro<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/v4design\"> project page</a>.

                body: "<p>From 8-12 October, the <a href=\"http://iswc2018.semanticweb.org/\">17th International Semantic Web Conference</a> took place in beautiful Monterey California, USA. The conference attracted some 470 participants from 33 countries. The main conference was preceded by 16 workshops, six tutorials and the doctoral consortium. The conference itself featured three excellent (female) keynote speakers, 27 paper sessions (three or four in parallel), a posters and demos session and various social events (such as the Ada Lovelace celebration during which participants could edit Wikipedia entries for women in STEM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cultural heritage gets everywhere</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As has been the case for many years in the conference, cultural heritage use cases are presented in many different sessions (all session information, papers and presentations are linked at the end of the article). There was for example a presentation on the <em>The Rijksmuseum Collection as Linked Data</em> in the Scholarly Data session, a presentation on <em>Building Linked Data from Historical Maps</em> in the Semantic Science Workshop, a resources paper in the Ontologies and Data Integration session on&nbsp;<em>DOREMUS: A Graph of Linked Musical Works</em>, a paper on a historical recipe data web that I co-authored in one of the Information Extraction sessions, research on <em>the Exploration of Grateful Dead Concerts and Memorabilia on the Semantic Web</em> and <em>U.S. Congress Prosopographer—A Tool for Prosopographical Research of Legislators</em> in the Posters and Demos session, an industry track paper&nbsp;<em>How to Maintain a Linked Data Cloud in a Deployed Semantic Portal </em>using a WOII use case, and an entire workshop&nbsp;devoted to Semantic Application for Audio and Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I was excited to see that so many different perspectives on semantic web research cultural heritage in all ‘corners’ of the conference this year. Especially the move to modalities different from text such as maps and audio is quite exciting. Whilst there were no dedicated cultural heritage sessions such as that for healthcare, it was difficult to not come across any cultural heritage work at the conference.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Even non-linked data has value</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three keynotes were definitely among the highlights of the conference (<a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/\">Jennifer Golbeck</a> on <em>Personal Data, Privacy and the (Semantic) Web</em>, <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/people/NatalyaNoy\">Natasha Noy</a> on <em>Not linked data is data too</em>, and <a href=\"https://vanessaevers.wordpress.com/\">Vanessa Evers</a> on <em>Socially Intelligent Robots</em>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In particular, Natasha Noy’s keynote illustrated what many practitioners in the cultural heritage data have long known: we don’t need to use RDF or link our collections to make our data valuable as datasets can have great value in and of themselves. However, we do need to know the provenance of our data and provide good metadata. CHIs have long been keepers and describers of collections, so we are probably a step ahead of some other fields here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She also presented some more background to the new <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/making-it-easier-discover-datasets/\">Google Dataset Search</a>. It is, of course, interesting to link cultural heritage datasets, but only when there are relevant sources to link to. And of course, converting to linked data is not something that is possible for every institution so I think it was good that this perspective was heard (loud and clear) at ISWC.</p>\r\n"

Where in previous years DBpedia would have been the default knowledge base to link to or derive factoids from, Wikidata was mentioned in more and more papers (e.g.<em> A Novel Ensemble Method for Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation based on Neural Network</em> and <em>That's Interesting, Tell Me More!

This collaborative platform may be an interesting venue for CHIs to collaborate and showcase (parts) of their data.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Four new projects for Europeana receive  €3.7 million in EC funding'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The European Commission has awarded over\_€3.7 million in funding to four new projects contributing to the Europeana initiative.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This funding comes from the European Commission's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/apply-funding/2018-cef-telecom-calls-proposals\">Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme</a>. In total, <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/news-events/newsroom/nearly-%E2%82%AC30-million-eu-investment-to-connect-europe-digitally\">nearly\_€30\_million</a> in funding has been awarded to Digital Service Infrastructures delivering networked cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations\_in the telecommunications sector. Europeana is one of these DSIs.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful Europeana projects are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Europeana Common Culture, coordinated by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/our-mission/who-we-are\">Europeana Foundation</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Judaica Europeana 2.0, coordinated by the <a href=\"https://jck.nl/nl/locatie/joods-historisch-museum\">Jewish Historical Museum</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Europeana Archaeology, coordinated by <a href=\"https://www.vu.lt/en/\">Vilnius University</a>\r\n</li>\r\n    <li>Linking Biodiversity and Culture Information - LinBi, coordinated by <a href=\"http://rbb24.de\">Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These projects deliver new and improved content to Europeana Collections, allowing for better access to and reuse of new types of data through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Common Culture will improve the contents of Europeana’s national aggregators.\_Judaica Europeana 2.0 will deliver new and updated content on Jewish cultural heritage.\_Europeana Archaeology will improve access to archaeological heritage. And LinBi will do the same for biological and natural historical heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants in these projects are in\_23 EU countries, plus Serbia. The projects will begin in early 2019. The Europeana Foundation will coordinate the collaboration and integration of these projects’ outcomes in the Europeana Core Service, when and if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation\_Executive Direction Harry Verwayen says, 'The Connecting Europe Facility programme allows for project funding to supplement and innovate aspects of the Core Service of Europeana. It is really critical that these projects complement what we are already doing and are in sync with the overall strategy. I am therefore very excited that these four projects have been selected as each of them has great potential to achieve these aims.'\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last May, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/european-commission-awards-3-8-million-to-8-new-europeana-projects\">eight other proposals were awarded CEF funding</a>, taking the total of current Europeana CEF-funded projects to 15, three of which will end in February 2019.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/301802558\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/301802558\">Europeana Thanks You - #Europeana10</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>10 years ago, on November 20 2008, the first Europeana website went live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We support museums, libraries, archives in making their collections available on the web in open and standardised formats. We are obsessed by that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? This creates building blocks that can be reused anywhere: You might find a set of stunning Art Nouveau drawings to use as a background for your presentation. Or\_designers can find source material for new works - whether that’s a video game, a remix film, a T-shirt, you name it. Teachers can find unique course material on the first world war for their class. And researchers can find new patterns that change their views on any aspect of history or science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What's really important is this. It's the people behind it.\_A lot of hard work from thousands of people - the tireless guardians of our heritage who operate the museums, galleries and archives across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re doing this together. And that’s why I’m here today - I want to say thank you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our cultural heritage, even the small and seemingly insignificant, just deserves to be preserved and find its audiences. That it is as essential to us as roads to travel on and water running from the tap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s been a roller coaster experience. And I think what happens next is going to be challenging as well. There’s so much still to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We'll need to focus more. First of all on\_making it easier for institutions to share their collections with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also will need to develop standards for emerging formats like 3D and harness technologies that we are only just starting to get a glimpse of - machine learning, artificial intelligence, those types of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to put ourselves right at the heart of the global movement for open culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a sense of urgency about all this: culture is one of the key drivers for the social and economic regeneration of Europe. \_I'm convinced of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It already contributes massively to the economy in the form of cultural tourism, creative industries. And it also\_has the potential to impact the way we think and feel about ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But right, that’s for tomorrow. Today, we celebrate ten years of teamwork. Ten years of transforming the world with culture, together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>In today’s article on the topic of 10, we look back at the last ten years of social, cultural and tech innovation, and draw parallels between the cultural zeitgeist and Europeana activities.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<div>\n<img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-11/culture%20and%20techTimeline%20Infographic.png\" style=\"max-width:400px;float:left;margin-right:40px;\"><p><strong>2008: </strong>Ten years ago, tech was becoming sophisticated and far more ingrained in society - in our behaviour and in our daily lives. Google launched Chrome and mobile voice search, advertising grew in apps and other platforms and Twitter usage became mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertising became sophisticated, as tech giants started to play with new ways of reaching and persuading markets recovering from the global financial crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this same moment, the European Union was inspired by its Member States to bring Europe’s rich cultural heritage into the digital age away from the influence of private market forces. Europeana was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a> started with approximately 2 million items in its collection (this has now grown to more than 58 million) and\_so the transformation began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2009: </strong>Tech giants were now a household name. While we were previously familiar with their brands, they were increasingly finding their way into our everyday lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the launch of the Apple App Store and the mainstreaming of smartphones, society was increasingly hooked to a gadget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Europeana launched the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/prestoprime\">PrestoPrime project</a> which would revolutionise the preservation and storage of digital media objects, integrating these records and media archives into the European digital library. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2010: </strong>iPads, e-readers and 3D technology - welcome to 2010. That was the year that Apple launched the iPad, making social media more accessible and interesting than before. Micro-blogging started trending, with Twitter and YouTube shifting away from traditional modes of production and consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, Europeana focused on a promotion of tech initiatives that exemplified social responsibility, values and social\_consciousness, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/hope\">Heritage of People’s Europe (HOPE) project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project aimed to collect cultural heritage items under themes of the emancipation movement, environmentalism and equal rights for immigrants, amongst a few. The project <a href=\"http://shp2.amsab.be/Search/Results?lookfor=&amp;type=AllFields\">collected</a> some 850,000 items from posters to films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2011: </strong>2011 was a huge year for world events. Globally, major political, military and terror events took place. The world was struck by a series of environmental disasters. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> protesters took up their place and the year was marked by a greater sense of loss than usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tech world mourned the loss of Apple’s Steve Jobs, and protestors in the Arab Spring were lauded for using social media to mobilise - in a truly exemplary show of technology ingrained in the human consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana projects in 2011 would highlight the humanity in traumatic events, and the human stories in times of adversity. The <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> project held its first collection day in Germany, creating a space for the personal stories from everyday Europeans as they related to all sides of World War One.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unbeknownst then to the project partners (Europeana Foundation, the University of Oxford and Facts &amp; Files), 1914-1918 would turn into a major pan-European collection which now hosts more than 600,000 items and became \_Europe’s largest online resource on World War One and lead to the incredible Transcribathon initiative (more on that in 2016) and celebrated in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/document-archive/europeana-in-the-news\">media</a> globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2012:</strong> Perhaps in backlash to the darkness of 2011, the world seemed to share in a general sense of uprising. The arts, films and literature spotlighted corruption in militaries. In the US, big businesses like Goldman Sachs, Apple and MacMillan and in India, the government, all faced major backlash over unethical or fraudulent dealings. Southern Europe faced mass protests against the Eurozone Crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a year of social upheaval and rebellion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana content too took on a revolutionary new endeavour - the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/europeana-1989\">Europeana 1989 project</a>. Taking a pan-European perspective in the lead up to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the project focused on collecting and highlighting objects, videos, photos and stories from this revolution ary period, showing the changes to Central and East Europe through the different perspectives of those affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2013:</strong> The world began to see the true power of technology and social media - with some instances more virtuous than others. \_US Police departments used social media to capture Boston Bombing suspects and civilian journalists in Syria used mobile phone images to show apparent chemical attacks on civilians. The major story of the year, however, came from former CIA employee Edward Snowden, who stole and leaked thousands of classified documents alerting the world to the major surveillance schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a political level, the European Commission highlighted their priority towards harnessing technology for good. As such, they named Europeana as the second priority of the new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-named-in-digital-agendas-new-priorities-for-2013\">Digital Agenda (2013-2014)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, the European Commission stated, 'The digital economy is growing at seven times the rate of the rest of the economy, but this potential is currently held back by a patchy pan-European policy framework. Today's priorities ... place new emphasis on the most transformative elements of the original 2010 Digital Agenda for Europe.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2014:</strong> There were a number of big\_technological steps in 2014 - from the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission leading the world’s first comet landing to advances in AI and virtual reality technologies, with the advent of a robot with in-built agility and the mainstream sale of the Oculus Rift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Europeana, the focus was also based on changing technologies and user needs. Amongst a number of new initiatives, this would mean the election of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/members-council-getting-to-work\">first Europeana Network Association Members Council</a>. The election solidified a commitment from Europeana to an open and collaborative operational approach that was cemented in an empowered Network of cultural heritage professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2015:</strong> The year was host to events that touched the world, and social media became a space to share views in a symbolic way with the advent of specific display picture filters\_(for example, rainbow flags in celebration of marriage equality, or je suis Charlie and the French national colours in commemoration of the deaths at the Charlie Hedbo headquarters).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana grew and increased its strategic focus for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/five-strategic-objectives-for-2015-2020\">2015-2020</a> period. In furthering its previous agenda of\_user-autonomy and empowerment, areas identified were those which would lay the foundation for Europeana today: A vision which included a transition from portal to platform ('portals are for visiting, platforms are for building on'), improvement of data quality, accessibility, discoverability and reuse, and the development of the first thematic collections in Art and Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2016:</strong> Changes to US and UK government policies heralded a transition period that mobilised political and social perspectives from both sides of the spectrum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driven to continue connecting to the human stories behind adverse times, Europeana launched the <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/\">Transcribathon</a> initiative. \_The digital tool relies on the unique skills of the community - teams of school children to pensioners - who compete together to transcribe documents from World War One collected during the aforementioned 1914-1918 collection so that they can be digitised, and translated for all to access and read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can read more on Transcribathon from project partner Frank Drauschke <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/transcribathons-in-education-and-research-digital-lessons-from-the-past\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to initiatives like these, Europeana was named by the Nominet Trust as one of the 100 inspiring tech-for-good projects for providing better access to knowledge and fostering understanding, knowledge and cultural value in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2017: </strong>The general public were increasingly empowered by technology. There was an increase in techno-literacy, and the concept of being critical against social media, news agencies and other tech-mediated spheres was cemented. AI and augmented reality technologies felt more accessible than ever before.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already operating with the technical end-user in mind, Europeana was named the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-rest-api-wins-the-2017-data-apis-category-award\">best data API for REST API technology</a>\_at API World 2017. The REST API is a digital tool that allows people to build applications that use the cultural heritage objects stored in the Europeana repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2018:</strong> And now for Europeana? In 2018 we celebrate the end of an era and the beginning of something exciting and new. The time has come\_to be bold once again. We must take inspiration from the visionaries of 10 years ago. We must feel pride from the actions, successes and hard work of those over the past ten years. And we must once again commit to safeguarding Europe’s cultural heritage - preserve it, innovate it, and uphold the humanist values and perspectives that sit at the heart of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>This article is a part of the Europeana Anniversary series - 10: legacy and moving forward. Keep up-to-date with all of the anniversary content we will be releasing on Europeana Pro and Europeana Collections, either <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/europeana10\">here</a> or on Twitter. #Europeana10.</strong></em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana 10 years on: It is time to be bold again'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana, Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage, celebrates 10 years of digitising culture and challenges Europe to shape the next 10 with bold digital innovation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Ten years ago, on the 20th of November 2008, the first Europeana website was launched in Brussels. This was an initiative of the European Union to make sure that Europe could take ownership over the digitisation of its heritage and make it an integral part of its future. Today Europeana makes over 50 million items from close to 4,000 libraries, museums and archives across Europe available on the web in standardised formats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elisabeth Niggemann, Director of the German National Library and Chair of the Europeana Foundation governing board said: ‘The unique achievement of Europeana is that it provided a vector for the sector and the policymakers in Europe to give unobstructed access to our heritage. This changed a mindset.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years later Europe is entering into a new era of digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation said: ‘Today we celebrate our achievements but we also call for action. With the advent of artificial intelligence and mixed reality, it is vital that the cultural heritage sector is empowered to make good use of these technologies, on its own terms.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlights:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Europeana Collections - the digital portal provides a doorway to some of the world’s most iconic and local cultural heritage items and collections. These are presented alongside user-generated content from everyday people - in an effort to preserve cultural heritage at all stages throughout history from, and for, all Europeans.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Europeana awarded best REST API at API World 2017. The REST API is a digital tool that allows people to build applications that use the cultural heritage objects stored in the Europeana repository. It is open-source and the code is available online. The API allows people in all industries - from creatives to researchers - to use the digital cultural heritage in a practical way to create new products.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The pan-European, cross-generational, multilingual Europeana 1914-1918 Transcribathon initiative. The initiative uses the unique skills of the community - teams of school children to pensioners - who compete together to transcribe documents from World War One so that they can be digitised, and translated for all to access and read.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The development of RightsStatements.org - a platform that guides cultural heritage institutions on copyright information so they can get the best use out of digital cultural heritage, whilst protecting the rights of institutions and creators.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Europeana was named by the Nominet Trust as one of the 100 inspiring ‘tech for good’ projects. The award recognised Europeana as a tech innovator providing better access to knowledge and education and fostering understanding, knowledge and cultural value in society.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p><br>\r\nENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily D’Alterio - Europeana Foundation<br><br>\r\nE: emily.dalterio@europeana.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notes to Editors:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/who-are-we-europeana-in-this-digital-transformation\">Digital Transformation </a><br><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/culture/news/new-european-agenda-culture_en\">New European Agenda for Culture</a><br><a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org/\">RightsStatements.org</a><br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-rest-api-wins-the-2017-data-apis-category-award\">Europeana REST API wins the 2017 Data APIs category award</a><br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’.\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

Each of them with their own background and area of expertise. Their professional activities range from education and research to GLAMS, non-profit and the creative industries. Amongst them, you can find many teachers, researchers, curators, archivists, librarians and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These candidates have interests in a broad variety of areas that they wish to work on and represent as Councillors: innovation, technical development and open data, copyright, measuring of impact, communications, or history. We believe that such variety of interests and expertise will allow us to find very good representatives for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">six ENA communities</a>, and Network Association members overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The candidates have an opportunity to campaign and get your support from now until the elections kick-off during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association AGM 2018</a> on 5 December. We invite you to follow their campaigns on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> (under the hashtag #EuropeanaElects), and in the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we launch the elections at the AGM, our 2,100+ Network Association members will have over a week until 14 December to select up to 28 of their preferred candidates in the online voting. Additionally, the members can vote on some key Association documents such as the Annual and Financial Report. The results of the elections and voting will be announced on 18 December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish all the candidates the best of luck!</p>\r\n"

Each of them with their own background and area of expertise. Their professional activities range from education and research to GLAMS, non-profit and the creative industries. Amongst them, you can find many teachers, researchers, curators, archivists, librarians and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These candidates have interests in a broad variety of areas that they wish to work on and represent as Councillors: innovation, technical development and open data, copyright, measuring of impact, communications, or history. We believe that such variety of interests and expertise will allow us to find very good representatives for the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">six ENA communities</a>, and Network Association members overall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The candidates have an opportunity to campaign and get your support from now until the elections kick-off during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association AGM 2018</a> on 5 December. We invite you to follow their campaigns on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> (under the hashtag #EuropeanaElects), and in the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana LinkedIn group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we launch the elections at the AGM, our 2,100+ Network Association members will have a week to select up to 28 of their preferred candidates in the online voting. Additionally, the members can vote on some key Association documents such as the Annual and Financial Report.The results of the elections and voting will be announced on 18 December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish all the candidates the best of luck!</p>"

        title: 'Technoculture podcast - Creating value from cultural data in the age of digital transformation with Harry Verwayen'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>'Technoculture' is a series of podcasts about culture, technology and the human condition. In episode nine, Federica Bressan, a post-doctoral researcher at Ghent University, talks to Europeana Foundation Executive Director Harry Verwayen about all things Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>What is Technoculture?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking about the podcast series, Federica says, 'I find myself critical of generic statements like \"digital technology has revolutionised our lives\" or \"robots will steal our jobs.\" These statements are true... but not true enough. I want to look into these statements and see what we’re overlooking. This podcast is not about my research work - nor about myself. It is about people, words, and ideas. I talk to guests with the most diverse backgrounds in the fields of research, technology, art, and science. I ask questions. Because I am curious and that’s what I do!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topics covered by the podcast series so far include digital forensics, Marie Curie, the European Year of Cultural Heritage and musical robotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating value from cultural data in the age of digital transformation with Harry Verwayen</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this 50-minute episode, Federica talks to Harry Verwayen with an eye to getting to the bottom of what Europeana is, does and aspires to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federica says, 'I asked Harry what the objectives of Europeana as an organisation are, and how they have changed during the past decade; who supports Europeana and most importantly what it does for the communities of users across the world. What is its asset, its vision, and what services it offers. Turns out, Harry is very passionate about his job and showed a genuine love for our collective heritage, love that means knowledge and understanding of its meaning and value. However Harry's talents are also grounded in management and practice, and most needed in this sector: I asked him about his ideas on making cultural heritage more 'appealing' from the economic point of view, that is, how to combine culture and economy in a virtuous way.'\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Listen to the podcast to find out what Harry had to say...</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F8zuGz1PjDk\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More episodes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are all sorts of ways to listening to the Technoculture podcast including\_<a href=\"http://technoculture-podcast.com/europeana.php\">on the Technoculture website</a>,\_on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/technoculturepodcast\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/it/podcast/technoculture/id1441328514?mt=2&amp;app=podcast\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/0kbEvnTIwCfLSU9lhyYuI1\">Spotify</a>\_and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJ5DHOMVJqXZMxMjHl5qhmV9_iAppaea\">YouTube</a>.\_<a href=\"http://technoculture-podcast.com/listen.php\">More listening options here</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23technoculturepodcast&amp;src=typd\">#technoculturepodcast</a> on social media for updates.</p>\r\n"

However it’s equally important to encourage engagement and reuse of the collections we give access to, and the story of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Williams,_1st_Baronet,_of_the_City_of_London\">our portrait of Sir John Williams</a> is a great example of the opportunities open access can present. The story began with the Europeana 280 project. Among 10 high resolution images shared by the Library with Europeana and <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_John_Williams,_Bart,_GCVO,_MD_-_Christopher_Williams.jpg\">Wikimedia Commons</a> for the project was the portrait of Sir John - founder of the National Library of Wales. The image was widely reused on Wikipedia and a Welsh language Wikipedia article was created about the painting itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HBkPY__x2--YLjw74wgZoA6Gxr6WIs1hhfA77tgjLWIzTVjla-Stq3kk15hoJYiH147XGOUQQ7bu-9n20nghNFyp41iVs--5bPDfQtnNEYEZnuFdD74Nste3xTIES1AQQ6XffvP9\" /><br />\r\n<em><cite>No no no no</cite>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.erikari.it/\">Erika Inzitari.</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\">CC BY-SA.</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe image was later discovered on Europeana Collections by a student and developed into a superb gif. Much like the paintings on the walls of Hogwarts, Sir John was brought back to life, nodding his head and raising his eyebrow. Europeana even adopted our founder for their error page, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/xxx/xxx.html\">sternly shaking his head</a> to tell users that something has gone wrong. For me, it is this kind of creative reuse which demonstrates the true value of open access.</p>\r\n"

This artwork is unique for me as it depicts not only the art collector with his friends in his house-cum-gallery but also gives the viewer the opportunity to admire 16 gilded framed artworks (and some more in the second room) from different worldwide collections of Dutch Golden Age painters, animal and landscape painters, draughtsman and etchers, painters of pastoral landscapes, history, still life, portrait painters, as well as Flemish artists (Rubens). All in one picture.</p>\r\n"

(Great article on this <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings/Catalog/Theatrum_pictorium_by_Davidis_Teniers\">here</a>!) This book is held by libraries worldwide and the listed engravings are in Europeana Collections many times over (example: engravings by one of the pictorium engravers <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?per_page=48&amp;q=Nikolaus%20van%20Hoy&amp;view=grid\">Nikolaus van Hoy</a>). Some of the most complete datasets based on this book are also in Europe and in Europeana Collections, such as the one in the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Slovak%20National%20Gallery%22&amp;view=grid\">Slovak National Gallery</a> (example <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/07101/G_11965_166.html\">07101/G_11965_166</a>). Though the painting this record represents has been lost, the miniature by Teniers used to make the engraving has survived in a <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:David_Teniers_after_Bassano_-_An_Allegory_of_Winter_d5529765g.jpg\">private collection</a>. Many of the paintings and their miniatures that the engravings illustrate are also in Europeana Collections as they have remained in the Austrian state collection known as the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=DATA_PROVIDER%3A%22Kunsthistorisches%20Museum%22&amp;view=grid\">Kunsthistorisch Museum</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I discover more gallery paintings by Teniers, I try to create Wikipedia pages for them that include all depicted images, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallery_of_Archduke_Leopold_Wilhelm_in_Brussels_(Schleissheim)\">this one</a> (<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2064137/Museu_ProvidedCHO_Bildarchiv_Foto_Marburg_obj00060263_T_004.html\">obj00060263</a>), since only the Italian paintings were published. The collections holding individual miniatures, paintings, copies or engravings are spread around the world. Here is a map from a <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ydfl945o\">Wikidata query</a>. Only a subset of these currently have Europeana IDs, but there could be many more.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><img alt=\"Theatrum pictorium\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-11/Majerus.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p property=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title dc:title\"><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063622/LUX_280_001.html\">Halbzeit | Majerus, Michel</a>, Mudam Luxembourg,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\" rel=\"xhv:license http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/rights\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY-NC-ND&nbsp;</a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On a cold winter morning in 2012, I found myself in Stuttgart, where I paid a spontaneous and unplanned visit to the Kunstmuseum. At that time, practically the entire museum was taken over by <a href=\"https://www.kunstmuseum-stuttgart.de/index.php?site=Ausstellungen;Vorschau_Details&amp;id=51\">a retrospective of the Luxembourg artist Michel Majerus</a> (1967-2002). That exhibition was one overwhelming onslaught of enormous, powerful canvases and installations, in Majerus' signature mash-up style of brightly coloured references to popular culture. It impressed me deeply, and I have been a Majerus fan ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I prepared to participate in the Europeana 280 challenge on Wikidata and Wikipedia, I was delighted to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2063622/LUX_280_001.html\">discover in Europeana Collections a work by Majerus</a>: Halbzeit (2002), in the collection of Mudam in Luxembourg City. I promptly decided to dedicate a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halbzeit\">Wikipedia article</a> to it. Now - writing about contemporary art on Wikipedia is a nice challenge! It takes quite a bit of thought and effort to translate the often theoretical and lofty texts about today's art to Wikipedia's factual, neutral encyclopedic style. I hope I succeeded in summarising the work's meaning in a legible way, understandable for a broad audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to copyright restrictions, Wikipedia entries about contemporary art usually include few or no images, but I wrote this article on the English-language Wikipedia, where I was able to include a very small illustration for educational purposes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-free_content\">under the fair use doctrine in US copyright</a>. This case reminds me of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">the 20th century black hole</a>: due to copyright restrictions, we see very few images of recent and contemporary works on platforms like Europeana Collections and Wikipedia… I wonder if an artist like Majerus, who built his entire oeuvre around remixing popular culture, wouldn't have approved of broader availability and reusability of digitised representations of his artworks? Unfortunately, Majerus himself can't tell us anymore (he died in 2002 in a plane accident), but I certainly would love to see more clear and well-informed choices by contemporary artists in this area.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'The untold story of World War One artefacts: The Geiler Bible'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>100 years have passed since the end of World War One and we are still unlocking the personal stories and experiences from this period. In the lead up to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/centenary-tour-finale-europeana-1914-18-transcribathon\">Centenary Tour Finale</a> event in Brussels, we offer to shed more light onto one such story and artefact; that of Kurt Geiler and his life-saving bible. We share an in-depth interview with Kurt’s grandson Markus Geiler, exploring the digital transformation of this artefact and the impact of digitising cultural heritage.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana 1914-1918 project grew from a desire to represent the personal stories from all sides of World War One, using the advantages of digital technologies to preserve, unlock and share cultural heritage items. Launched in 2011 and based on an idea by Oxford University, the Europeana 1914-1918 project held its first collection day in Germany. The then project, now <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Collection</a> and associated campaign, invited and continues to invite, people to participate by digitising a family item related to World War One to be published online as part of the greater Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its launch, nearly 15,000 citizens from 24 countries have digitised and shared approximately 200,000 objects. Further, through digital tools, content and events, the greater campaign it offers people a new way to interact with their culture, their history and each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such item is the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020601/contributions_1817.html?q=geiler+bible\">shrapnel-pierced bible</a> of German soldier Kurt Geiler. The bible saved a sleeping Kurt, who was resting on it in a trench during warfare in North-East France. When a direct hit on the area sent shrapnel through the bible, it acted as a barrier between itself and Kurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Markus, the process of sharing in the digital sent a powerful message about the realities of the war, symbolic in the family as ‘a kind of personal anti-war memorial’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markus says, ‘I think that exhibits like this one, struck by a shrapnel, very vividly depict the whole futility and cruelty of war. These items should also come out of the family archives and into the museums and online, where they can be made accessible to a wider audience.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This audience has been expanded even further with the advent of <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/\">Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918</a>. Born from the desire to make the shared handwritten letters, diaries and postcards more widely accessible, the initiative relies on volunteers from the public to transcribe these documents and digitise them, making them accessible and translatable online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, more than 23,000 documents have been transcribed by over 1,700 participants across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/246759639\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/246759639\">Berlin Transcribathon 2017 interviews (music)</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For Markus, illustrating the humanity behind World War One, and the human loss acts an important reminder not to repeat past actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markus says, ‘I just believe that history can be repeated. And I believe that mistakes are repeated. After the gift of a long period of peace and the creation of the EU as a peace project, there is suddenly a penchant for nationalism and selfishness. Peace is a fragile entity, so we need to talk about the war, its causes, its upheavals and its atrocities.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>100 years on, it even more important to continue telling these stories and connecting to the real emotion of adverse periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this spirit, the Centenary Tour Finale offers to brings together people and cultural institutions and their contribution to the online <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918 Collection</a>. The event is held in collaboration with Europeana and the House of European History and supported by the European Commission’s DG Connect. A series of activities offer to showcase the impact of the Collection: from the Transcribathon finale to the presentation of a new World War One\_game, <a href=\"/post/the-different-individual-sides-to-history-human-aspects-of-ww1\"><em>11-11: Memories Retold</em></a>, panel discussions and speeches from European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel and Member of European Parliament and Chair for the Committee on Culture and Education, Petra Kammerevert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>_________________________________________________</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Read the original full interview with Markus below in German.</strong><br><br><strong>Was empfinden Sie, wenn Ihr Familienerbstück öffentlich gezeigt wird?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ich freue mich, dass die Bibel meines Großvaters jetzt für einige Jahre öffentlich zu sehen ist und so viele Menschen an dieser faszinierenden Geschichte seines Überlebens im Ersten Weltkrieg vor Verdun teilhaben können. Ich finde, Exponate wie diese von einem Granatsplitter getroffene Bibel zeigen sehr bildhaft die ganze Sinnlosigkeit und Grausamkeit von Krieg. Deshalb sollten sie auch raus aus den familären Archiven und rein ins Museum, wo sie einem breiteren Publikum zugänglich gemacht werden können.<br><br><strong>Können Sie die Person, die die Bibel ursprünglich besaß, etwas ausführlicher beschreiben? Was haben diese Person(en) über den Krieg erzählt / wie wurden sie beeinflusst oder verändert?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mein Großvater Kurt Geiler wurde 1894 in Waldheim in Sachsen geboren. Er wuchs mit sechs Geschwistern auf, die Familie war sehr arm. Er zog 1913 nach Leipzig, wo er eine Kanzlei- und Sparkassenlaufbahn einschlug und nach Kriegsende und Rückkehr bis zum Oberinspektor aufstieg. 1915 wurde mein Großvater mit 22 Jahren zum Heer eingezogen und kam an die Westfront wo er in den Vogesen, Flandern, Verdun und an der Somme zum Einsatz kam. Er wurde zweimal verwundet, davon einmal schwer. Vor Verdun bewahrte ihn zudem die Bibel, die er als sehr frommer Mensch immer bei sich trug und die er nachts als Kopfkissen nutzte, bei einem Granatvolltreffer in seinem Unterstand vor dem Tod. Seine Kameraden kamen dabei alle um. Nach dem Waffenstillstand am 11. 11. 1918 machte er sich zu Fuß auf den Weg in seine Heimat. Die Bibel mit dem Granatsplitter bewahrte er immer auf und übergab sie vor seinem Tod 1950 meinen Vater, Gottfried Geiler. Mein Großvater, den ich nie kennengelernt habe, sah als frommer Mensch in ihr ein Zeichen einer gnädigen göttlichen Fügung, hat mein Vater mir und meinen beiden Brüdern immer berichtet. Immer wenn es um Krieg, Geschichte oder das Andenken an meinen Großvater ging, wurde uns Kindern die Bibel als eine Art persönliches Anti-Kriegs-Mahnmal gezeigt.<br><br><strong>Was ist Ihre Meinung - warum ist es wichtig, dass wir über die Erlebnisse des Ersten Weltkriegs sprechen?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ich glaube eben doch, dass sich Geschichte wiederholen kann. Und ich glaube, dass Fehler wiederholt werden. Nach dem Geschenk einer langen Friedensphase, und der Schaffung der EU als Friedensprojekt gibt es plötzlich wieder einen Hang zu Nationalismus und Egoismus. Wohin das führen kann, zeigt nicht nur der Erste Weltkrieg. Ich war am 11. November 2014 mit einem deutschen Fernsehteam und der Bibel auf den Soldatenfriedhöfen in Verdun. Ich habe damals gedacht, wie dankbar wir in Europa sein können, dass wir diese Grausamkeiten eines Krieges nicht erleben müssen und dass die Menschen schlauer geworden sind. Ein halbes Jahr später annektierte Russland die Krim und der Krieg in der Ostukraine begann. Frieden ist ein fragiles Gebilde, deswegen müssen wir über den Krieg, seine Ursachen, seine Verwerfungen und seine Grausamkeiten sprechen.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'From the trenches to the web: World War One centenary event'
        posttype: Pressrelease

        intro: "<p>Europeana brings its Centenary Tour Finale to the House of European History\_27-28 November 2018.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>From a life-saving bible and a hand-carved violin to handwritten letters from the trenches, the personal stories and objects of European soldiers and their families will be given new life at a two-day event in Brussels to commemorate the centenary of World War One ending. Europeana and the House of European History join together to organise this event which highlights the relevance to the digitisation of these objects to the digital transformation of our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the centre of this commemoration stands the Europe-wide campaign, Europeana 1914-1918. Since 2011, more than 15,000 people from 24 countries have shared family stories and nearly 200,000 items online as part of the campaign, offering a unique perspective of the shared human experience of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Executive Director Europeana Foundation said: ‘This collection of letters written in the trenches provide a unique insight into the lives and feelings of the people who wrote them. We are excited to hand these over to the researchers to reveal their untold stories, which can be used and understood by the generations to come.’ \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constanze Itzel, House of European History Director said: ‘The way Europeana has been collecting personal stories and items shows just how strongly historical events can affect our own lives. They bear testimony to the many different perspectives according to which European history is experienced. It is extremely valuable for museum work to find this multiplicity of perspectives in just one repository.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the public from across Europe have been invited to attend the event and take part in a series of activities that reflect on the different ways we can remember the war. Highlights include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>The final event of the Europeana Transcribathon 1914-1918 Centenary Tour. Teams from across Europe, including school pupils and pensioners, will compete to digitally transcribe handwritten letters, postcards and diaries written from battle and home fronts so that they can be more widely shared and read by all.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel will share why cultural heritage is important to the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economies, and will also present prizes to the winning Transcribathon team.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Member of European Parliament and Chair for the Committee on Culture and Education, Petra Kammerevert will share the importance of cultural heritage in education, and will also present prizes to the winning Transcribathon team</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>The new 3D painted animated game 11-11: Memories Retold - animated by Aardman and developed by DigixArt and voiced by Eliahja wood and Sebastian Cox - will be presented by its creators. Telling the story of a Canadian soldier Harry and a German engineer Kurt, the game draws on letters written by and to real life German soldiers and shared on Europeana 1914-18, which helped inspire Kurt’s character and journey.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>An exclusive physical display curated especially for the event, with Europeana 1914-1918 objects and artefacts from the House of European History collection, including the bible which saved the life of soldier Kurt Geiler, taking a direct hit from a shrapnel as he slept. Shared online by his grandson, Kurt’s bible and his story is now part of the House of European History’s permanent collection.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Two panel debates bringing together voices from civil society, the museum world and academia. The panels will reflect on the legacies of World War One and debate how academic research, history exhibitions and social inclusion projects can make remembrance meaningful and engaging for people of all backgrounds and ages.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>The event is held in collaboration between the House of European History and Europeana, supported by the European Commission’s DG Connect, and is part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contacts:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily D’Alterio - Europeana Foundation<br>\r\nE: emily.dalterio@europeana.eu</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notes to Editors:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Event details</strong><br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/centenary-tour-finale-europeana-1914-18-transcribathon\">Programme</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Items mentioned</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/2020601/contributions_1817.html?q=geiler+bible\">Shell-struck bible</a><br><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-different-individual-sides-to-history-human-aspects-of-ww1\">11-11: Memories Retold video game </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’.<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\"> Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

        intro: "<p>As part of our tenth anniversary celebrations, Europeana Foundation Executive Director, Harry Verwayen, introduces 'The gates are open: 10 perspectives on the future of digital culture'.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Ten years ago, on 20 November 2008, Europeana catapulted into the world. A small team, led by its Director Jill Cousins, had worked frantically for months to prepare for the launch that would make Europe’s cultural heritage available to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there it was: a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not just another website. It was the result of the inspiring idea, backed by a letter from six heads of state to then President of the European Commission Mr Barroso, that Europe should take ownership and responsibility of its past and make it an integral part of its future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was immediately hooked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Europeana is still that place designed to empower cultural heritage institutions to share their collections, freely and unobstructedly, with the world. Over the past decade, we have experienced highlights that we cherish and moments when it felt like everything was in vain. You win some, you lose some.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the drive and energy that sparked this initiative have always remained with us. This spirit is alive in our team at the Europeana Foundation, the thousands of people that form the Europeana Network Association, the friends we have in civil society organisations like the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons, all the cultural innovators that we have worked and played with over the years. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To celebrate our anniversary, it therefore made perfect sense to ask our friends to give us a sneak preview of how they see the future. No heavy-handed manifestos but freestyle provocations about the opportunities and pitfalls of a world transformed with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future is here. ‘The gates are already open’, informs George Oates. How that future shapes up is, to a large extent, up to us, our friends suggest. ‘It will take imagination and courage to rethink old assumptions, lift our vision, and make the world anew’ says Michael Peter Edson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you game? Read on.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>My name is José Ramón González Quelle. I am currently the Secondary-School Principal at Corazón de María’s School in Gijón, Asturias, Spain. Our school has 1,690 students from 3 to 18 years old. I have used Europeana Collections resources since 2015 in order to integrate cultural heritage into my lessons. At the same time, I also promote the use of these resources among my fellow teachers.<br>\r\nOur main aim is that technologies for learning and knowledge give way in our school to technologies for empowerment and involvement.<br><br><strong>Can you tell us a little about your educational background?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hold a BA in History and I \_specialise in geography. Since 2015 I have attended many seminars and trainings about innovation in schools and I have learned about Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences and how neuroscience can help us, teachers, to shift from an old-fashioned way of teaching (lecturing the kids) to a more 21st century approach based on such things as cooperative learning, flipped learning, inquiry, etc. Since then I have done my best to adapt my lessons according to these new teaching methods and I am deeply convinced that this is a path of no return. \_\_<br><br><b>How did you find out about Europeana resources for education?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four years ago I had the opportunity to learn about Europeana's resources through the European Schoolnet (EUN) portal. I started using Europeana Collections at that time to develop a cooperative project related to the First World War. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+1914-1918&amp;q=letters&amp;view=grid\">letters</a> from the trenches, we analysed the feelings of the men who were off at the front and also the feelings of their families during the war. We also studied the effects that the Great War had on Europe by using the pictures of the conflict. Finally, we held an exhibition commemorating the beginning of the First World War in which all our findings were shown. We even dared to rewrite the First World War using our smartphones to post on social media as though we had played a role in the conflict!<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img height=\"347\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qdMVfb4NNOXjPv4OonipiCne-OyTc1p36EdqgxX3BpD0OVbyDAUMkNPiaf8iMTverdBnZQSQjZR8G2BUXXza4MX8pyPys9UGp-x1ZbWoKg35ZoeqJvZWYR9LU7TBEF78noPZmfxh\" width=\"624\"><b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>José Ramón González Quelle. Children’s project using Europeana. CC-BY</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, I am using the collections related to <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">migration</a> and 20th century <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/art\">art</a> by including both of them within the syllabus. Students are using them in their own projects, in this way they can reach a deeper understanding of the historical facts. And the result? Cultural heritage becomes important and integrated into their lives!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year I was involved in the last Europeana project with EUN as a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/from-coding-projects-to-3d-modelling-enriched-pedagogical-material-and-recommendations-from-the-user-group\">User Group teacher</a>. The experience of making up a learning scenario was very interesting for both teachers and students. By using Europeana resources we could go from recorded history to first-hand storytelling using images and voices obtained from Europeana.<br>\r\nWe started this school year with the news of the appointment of the Coordinator of International Projects at our school, Rafael Montero, as Europeana Ambassador for Spain. This is a way to acknowledge the work he has developed in different European Schoolnet projects recently!<br><br><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fafdaeef-7fff-ec92-e7bb-4a0360b14821\">How is your school integrating digital culture into the classroom? Can you give us an example?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an interesting challenge at the beginning. Several social sciences teachers who were taking part in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-europeana-education-mooc-giving-teachers-confidence-to-use-digital-cultural-heritage\">Europeana MOOC </a>were willing to create activities using the resources available on the platform. We realised that by working together we were able to learn from each other and the process was definitely easier. We think this can be one of our added values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now our goals as a school are more ambitious and other subjects are starting to get involved in carrying out different activities. Technology teachers are designing a project to build a stereoscope and work with the stereoscopic images available on the platform. Rafael Montero, who is a STEM teacher, also developed an activity for his physics class in which he used some recordings of birds available in Europeana Collections. The possibilities are endless!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fafdaeef-7fff-ec92-e7bb-4a0360b14821\"><img height=\"351\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PD4st3bMru_Zz8_88sXXDDpScvWfYNxEDCwOBMcoDrt50ba4ivQUzhCJGdSDs_i9hFKiD-mgFi8aQPxbznaZZwZjxoVSA4AjGm9cYISM4GVt94Laq6GbkxGaS9FHgH6U738zrBFh\" width=\"624\"></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>José Ramón González Quelle.

At the end of the school year, some of their parents emailed me to say it had been a very enriching academic season and my subject seemed to be a real example of both motivation and creativity.<br><br>\r\nAll this is possible thanks to the use of resources\_that allow us to gain an insider understanding of history: with the project on the First World War, students shared the feelings and emotions of those who visit the battlefields today and relive the events.<br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2FCcjAS\">https://bit.ly/2FCcjAS</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By implementing\_<a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/directory/details?contentId=1112\">Europeana's learning scenario on Alsace and Lorraine </a>they understood the importance of keeping the peace over all wars.<br><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2DJeyQS\">https://bit.ly/2DJeyQS</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these pedagogical materials and scenarios, they are able\_to interpret the past to understand the present and to analyse the future of the European Union.<br>\r\nWhat is the result? This year we are preparing an exhibition about the 20th century using Europeana resources that will allow us to explore the history of European people. In March 2019 it will be ready!<br><br><b>Do you plan to go on using digital culture at your school?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our school has just begun creating interdisciplinary projects. They are usually a one or two-week activity involving different subjects. The teachers help the students work on items of the syllabus with a more hands-on approach.\_We believe this will be another opportunity to integrate digital culture in our lessons as a means of sharing the know-how of the social sciences teachers with other departments of our school. This is the great challenge: to integrate arts into any subject to make learning visible and supply students with references to understand the world.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Meet the winners of the Europeana Research Grants Programme 2018'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Yesterday, at the House of European History in Brussels we were thrilled to have Professor Lorna Hughes, Chair of the Europeana Research Advisory Board, present the recipients of the 2018 Europeana Research Grants with their awards. Read on to find out about the projects and to hear what a Europeana grant might mean for early-career scholars interested in the digital humanities.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>The grants winners</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this year’s Research Grants Programme, Europeana’s third annual call, we invited early-career scholars to apply with project proposals connected to the theme of The First World War. We received high-quality responses from all over Europe and are delighted to announce the winners: Dr Berber Hagedoorn, Dr Saverio Vita and Dr Elizabeth Benjamin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The winning proposals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rug.nl/staff/b.hagedoorn/\">Dr Berber Hagedoorn</a>, University of Groningen, the Netherlands<br><strong>Europeana 1914-1918: AV Storytelling Data in a European Comparative Perspective.</strong><br><br>\r\nThis project uses data science and qualitative analysis to understand and map out how the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection is used for creative storytelling practices, to share and contextualise audiovisual content and to engage people. In particular, sentiment analysis and topic modelling (with annotated descriptions) will provide new understandings of how creators share and contextualise content for successful user engagement, categorising important topics and creative narrative strategies. Surveys to professional storytellers across Europe will help to uncover what motivates the (re)use of Europeana 1914-1918 Collection material for creative storytelling purposes; how makers share and contextualise content to achieve successful user engagement; and how makers perceive the platform as an effective tool for storytelling. Co-creative lab sessions will be organised to understand how 40-60 (digital) humanities scholars use Europeana 1914-1918 to interact with and reuse content, focusing on storytelling (since academics are storytellers too), search and research, measuring engagement through eye-tracking, participant observation and post-task questionnaires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Dr Hagedoorn about her project and what the Europeana research grant means to her:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>“My work aims to help understand motivations for online platform use in today’s attention economy, and how media professionals share and contextualise content for creative storytelling practices and successful user engagement. The study will provide further insight into how Europeana works as a creative storytelling tool. I will be blogging about my research activities <a href=\"https://berberhagedoorn.wordpress.com.\">here</a>.<br><br>\r\nAs a specialist working with audiovisual sources, cultural memory and digital heritage, the grant is a very exciting opportunity to continue my digital humanities research with Europeana, on a European comparative scale. Furthermore, as an early career scholar, it \_allows me to take an important step in my career with research of high and broad impact.<br><br>\r\nI believe that in today's 'post-truth', overloaded information landscape, it is vital that we create more insight and transparency into the processes of selection, bias and meaning-making around audiovisual media. It is important to support scholars carrying out research that critically addresses the collection, selection and (re-)use of data. Datafication and the data-driven society is an innovative and quickly evolving field of study, and funding awards for research projects in the digital humanities help humanities scholars to be a part of this innovation.”</em><br><br><a href=\"https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/saverio.vita2\">Dr Saverio Vita</a>, University of Bologna, Italy<br><strong>Upgrading History. Diaries from the War Front.</strong><br><br>\r\nThe project focuses on diaries of European soldiers in the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection, which include a good amount of soldiers’ writings (especially in Italian, French and English), as well as a collection of letters from the trenches by Isaac Rosenberg. Rosenberg’s letters and at least eight diaries in Italian and French will be processed.<br><br>\r\nThe materials will be arranged on the StoryMap platform, highlighting the different itineraries travelled by a single soldier. Each itinerary will begin with an introduction (a historical and linguistic comment, both in Italian and English) and will be enriched by other media from the Europeana Collections platform, as well as the text of the diary itself. The itineraries will be displayable all at once, or one at a time, to highlight the possible overlapping of paths and to reveal the differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Vita commented: <em>“Considering how the First World War affected both great History and private lives, the aim of the project is to share research that focuses on the diaries of European soldiers in order to make them accessible to both the academic and the general public. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Receiving this grant means a lot to me. Professionally, it is an honour to be chosen by such a prestigious foundation. It provides a real chance to actively engage the preservation of our memory during a time when Europe needs to recognise itself as a solid community. Many people have walked our streets, and will continue to do so: both soldiers and ordinary people.<br><br>\r\nReceiving funds for research in digital humanities is essential as humanistic research has similar needs to those of applied sciences. Researchers in digital humanities need updated technology to allow us to disseminate humanistic knowledge to widespread networks and to engage more effectively within our society.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elizabeth-benjamin\">Dr Elizabeth Benjamin</a>, Coventry University, the UK<br><strong>Return to Sender: Mapping Memory Journeys in the Europeana 1914-1918 Postcard Archive.</strong><br><br>\r\nThis project proposes an original, dynamic visualisation of the postcards in the Europeana 1914-1918 Collection. The postcards’ metadata will be used to create an interactive website plotting their transnational movement and exploring the resulting narratives of war and the memory thereof.<br><br>\r\nThrough tracking the details of the postcards’ content and journeys through and beyond the duration and locations of conflict, as well as inviting contemporary annotations and new narratives, the project aims to uncover new findings on the effects of war on movement, communication, and the creation of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Dr Benjamin’s words:<em> “Revealing the narratives of postcards which embody movement allow us to examine the effects of the war on international travel. This includes the sociocultural impact of restrictions on movement and the enforced movement of armed forces and those fleeing conflict.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Freedom of movement is an important part of European culture, particularly today with the rise of populism and the risk of disunity. We will be looking at a time when movement was restricted or enforced, to understand our shared histories and emphasise the need for international collaboration. We appreciate the support of interdisciplinary projects such as ours, which bring together different approaches to highlight the relevance of archives for contemporary society.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>It is important to support the development of new digital tools for looking at society. In particular, funding awards such as the Europeana Research Grants, which promote tools that are open, accessible and usable within and beyond academic research. By using new technologies we are able to gain new perspectives on important issues, which in turn embeds research within society.”</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Follow Europeana Research for updates</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted a proposal for this year's Research Grants Programme. The three funded projects will start in January 2019.

        intro: "<p>Together with the National Library of The Netherlands, we’re celebrating International Migrants Day and the end of the European Year of Cultural Heritage with a special day inviting people to share their migration stories and objects in the Hague.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In 2018 the European Year of Cultural Heritage, Europeana has been working with cultural heritage institutions and people from across Europe to collect stories that show how Europe has been influenced and shaped by migration. These stories cover a wide variety of topics: love, education, war, persecution, cuisine, sports, weather and more, and convey as much happiness, love and life as sadness, war and tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the course of the year, we have held 17 events across the continent, engaging over 3,000 people in 12 countries. The <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?locale=en&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A&amp;view=grid\">stories and objects</a> collected reflect the global movement of people. Stories have been submitted in 15 languages, and feature migration to and from 100 countries globally. They are helping us to tell a really big story - the story of Europe and the people who live here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For our final migration event in 2018, Europeana and the National Library of the Netherlands invite you to share your personal or your family’s migration stories and the objects that represent them. These objects and stories are part of Europe’s shared history of migration, and will take their place alongside Europe's rich cultural heritage on Europeana.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Event details</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The special event will be hosted on International Migrants Day (18 December). We invite members of the public to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Share their migration stories</li>\r\n    <li>Enjoy musical performances</li>\r\n    <li>Listen to an expert panel discussion on the topic of migration.</li>\r\n    <li>Hear stories of migration</li>\r\n    <li>View an exclusive photo exhibition showing portraits of students from the Foundation for Refugee Students (UAF)</li>\r\n    <li>See a special display,\_<a href=\"http://eacanniversary.com/about-saudade/\">the Saudade Exhibition</a>,\_from the Expatriate Archive Centre.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Tickets are free and you can choose which parts to attend, either to share a story, attend\_the music and talks, or join us for the whole event.</p>\r\n"

The renovation resulted in a rejuvenated, world-leading museum. Delivered by developing methods and new preservation technologies, the Rijksmuseum has become an inspirational physical space to house national treasures, reflected with equal splendour online with the opening up of its collections through the Rijksstudio. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the holistic renovation blazed a trail through the cultural heritage sector. With its digital strategy indistinguishable from its core strategy, the Rijksmuseum transformed perceptions of what it meant to open up both their physical and digital archives. Through the Rijksstudio, it encourages creative use of its collections, rewarding visitors with breathtakingly high-quality digital images.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><em>‘The first challenge was to open the building. The second was to open the collection. The third was to open the idea of the museum in the minds of the people who work there.’</em> - <a href=\"https://www.nationalmuseums.org.uk/media/documents/publications/striking_the_balance.pdf\">Wim Pijbes, EC event, Rome</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the museum reopened in 2013, the first challenge was complete. An impact report undertaken by Booz &amp; Company explored the economic and social impact of renovation, and in particular what it brought at a local, national and international level. This report projected that the renovation of the Rijksmuseum would contribute €90 million per year to the Dutch economy. This projected economic impact was based on a combination of factors such as the anticipated increase in employment levels from 2,063 FTE p.a. before the renovation, to an average of 2,700 during the renovation and 3,759 after it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘International research suggests major museums such as the Rijksmuseum are a crucial element in the economic and societal well being of a city.’&nbsp;</em>- Professor Tony Travers, Director of LSE London, a research centre at the London School of Economics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The positive effects of the renovation were also seen in more indirect outcomes such as increasing the appeal of the city of Amsterdam to tourists and contributing to increased employment from the regeneration of its vicinity, the Museum Quarter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a local level, increased standards and improvements to the local environment benefited both the organisation and its visitors, while the efforts to open up led to an improved network of local museums in the establishment of the new Museum Quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of the renovation is also evidenced by the Rijksmuseum’s provision of new professional courses in preservation techniques, enabling skills for conservation and restoration to be revived and further developed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And at a national level, the renovation enabled innovation among the organisations that contributed to it. Restoration company <a href=\"https://www.koninklijkewoudenberg.nl/\">Koninklijke Woudenberg</a>, for example, invested in technology that can produce a replica of a sculpture based on a 3D scan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the full <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/press/press-releases/the-new-rijksmuseum-boosts-the-dutch-economy\">economic and social impact assessment of renovation of the Rijksmuseum.</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Leaving a lasting impression throughout the sector is the Rijksstudio - innovative in both how it presents the museum’s collections visually, and the policies under which it does so. Developed as an integral part of how the Rijksmuseum engages and attracts visitors to its collections in either the physical or digital space, the Rijksstudio is more than a section of a website. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘The [Rijksstudio is the] cultural digital heritage benchmark for connecting people and the collection’</em>- Peter Gorgels, Digital Communications, Rijksmuseum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For visitors, the Rijksstudio offers unprecedented access to high-quality artworks free from copyright. Over 200,000 personal collections have been created by visitors in the first five years. The strength of the Rijksstudio lies not only in the artworks it presents, but in the way visitors can take ownership of them, exploring, creating and curating collections according to their own interests and associations. Sharing these bespoke collections online, the Rijksstudio can showcase the same artworks in many different contexts, inspiring enquiry in myriad ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spurred on by the Rijksstudio’s encouragement to reuse material, and supported by a collaboration with Etsy, lovers of the Rijksmuseum’s collections have created thousands of new applications for its artworks - from wallpaper to eye masks and temporary tattoos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ‘Rijksstudio award’ was launched in 2014 to reward the most creative uses of the Rijksmuseum’s collections. The award demonstrates a truly global appetite for the open collections of the Rijksstudio. In 2017, the award had launches around the world - in Berlin (Blogfabrik), London (Design week), and New York (MOMA) - and attracted over 2,600 applications from 62 countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The decision to present the collections in the public domain, in high quality with no restrictions on reuse, was a bold move. Remember, at the time, providing people with information about the rights to collection items was uncommon. And making the decision to allow free reuse of collections by transferring them to the public domain with the appropriate metadata was one that required the practical and collegiate support of the open community - including the Europeana Foundation, Kennisland, the Open Knowledge Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation.&nbsp;These two decisions proved fruitful and have been crucial to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Democratising%20the%20Rijksmuseum.pdf\">transforming the public’s perception&nbsp;of the Rijksmuseum as a modern and open museum</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approach of the Rijksstudio has fast become the gold standard for open access to digital cultural heritage. The Rijksmuseum’s renovation showed the sector that digital strategy need not stand alone from that of the physical space, and provided proof that engaging audiences online can lead to many positive results, from the creation of beautiful products, to artworks becoming better-known and to the organisation developing a reputation for being a thoroughly modern museum.</p>\r\n"

Killian Downing, National Archives of Ireland, nominated a fascinating story about Thomas McGarry, a fireman on the HMS Laurentic who died when it sank. Sharing the story on Europeana 1914-1918 brought new aspects of the story to light, demonstrating the importance of sharing and discovering archives online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Cristina Roiu, The Romanian Academy Library, presented the Europeana 1989 Bucharest campaign, describing it as ‘a necessary remembering and a cross-generational dialogue’. In December 1989, Cristina’s childhood friend Andra was shot in the head and military tanks crushed her body. Europeana 1989 enabled Cristina to tell her story and gave the young digitisation team the opportunity to learn about the events of December 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Paul Keller, Kennisland, talked about the moment on 12 September 2012 when all Europeana metadata (20m items at the time) was released under a Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication. At the time, this was the largest one-time dedication of cultural data to the public domain using CC0. Paul chose this moment 'Because of all the hard work that went into it, because we achieved something that few considered realistic and because this positioned Europeana as a standards bearer in the open data world.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Larissa Borck, University of Hamburg, celebrated finding European heritage in her everyday surroundings. She spoke about the personal connection that she felt to cultural content, and how Europeana facilitated her access to it where there was none before, so she could reuse and be surrounded by her most cherished artworks in her everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>“How did we meet so late..?” - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Larissa_Borck?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Larissa_Borck</a> shares how discovering &amp; using &amp; working with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeana?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@europeana</a> was her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Wow</a> moment along with her hopes for a future filled with conscious access to digital cultural heritage<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AGM2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AGM2018</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uDopAMOarE\">pic.twitter.com/uDopAMOarE</a></p>\r\n— Julia Fallon (@julia_fallon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/julia_fallon/status/1070319469669560320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Marco de Niet, Leiden University Library, relived the moment when everybody said ‘Yes!’ to central indexing of collection metadata and the European Digital Library project began in September 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Jurga Gradauskaitė, Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania, described a project that used teamwork, workshops, smartphones and a labelling app to teach arts and music students about applying rights statements to Lithuanian heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Joke van der Leeuw-Roord, EUROCLIO, and Merete Sanderhoff, Statens Museum for Kunst, took us back to Friday 30 October 2014 and talked us through from the creation of the Europeana Network Association and its Members Councils over the years, to its position today with 89 candidates up for 28 places and a membership of 2,100+.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p>WOW moments at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeanaeu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Europeanaeu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AGM2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AGM2018</a> ... <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MSanderhoff?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MSanderhoff</a> presenting WOW moment of absent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joke_leeuw?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@joke_leeuw</a> the establising of the Europeana Members Council of which the 'first timers' (including Merete and Joke) are now about to hand over the torch, ty ladies, great job! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Europeana10?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Europeana10</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rixsCT4ARI\">pic.twitter.com/rixsCT4ARI</a></p>\r\n— Wim van Dongen (@dongensis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dongensis/status/1070322818183782411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 5, 2018</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Stephan Bartholmei, German Digital Library, talked about a chain of events that began with the creation of Europeana and ended with Stephan stepping off a train to see\_a news teaser on Apple CEO Tim Cook's visit to Germany displayed on\_big screens in Frankfurt\_station. In the photo, Tim Cook and app developer Peter Kolski were using an augmented reality smartphone app to show historic pictures, video and audio of the Berlin Wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Sara Di Giorgio, CulturaItalia, discussed ‘Houston, we have lift off!’ - the moment when the content the Israel Museum of Jerusalem provided to ATHENA (the largest Europeana aggregator at the time) finally appeared in Europeana after months of work, in November 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Georgia Angelaki, National Documentation Centre, Greece, relived the launch (and crash) of the first Europeana website in November 2008 and revealed what led to a press headline calling it ‘Europe’s sexiest search engine’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s your Europeana ‘Wow’ moment?

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 5 December, over 200 members of the Europeana Network Association gathered in Vienna on the occasion of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2018, dedicated to building communities and celebrating 10 years of Europeana. We would like to thank all of you who came and made this event such a success!</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On 4 December, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\" target=\"_blank\">Members Council</a> came together for their last meeting of 2018, this time at <a href=\"https://www.onb.ac.at/en/\">Austrian National Library</a>\_It was also the last meeting of the current Council as we know it - 28 of the 36 Councillors will step down as they reach the end of their term. Their successors will be decided in this month’s <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/2018-members-council-elections-we-are-presenting-89-candidates\" target=\"_blank\">Members Council elections</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors assessed the achievements of 2018, principally the formation of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">Network communities</a>, discussed the progress of community-building efforts since the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/second-2018-members-council-meeting-in-the-hague-transforming-the-europeana-network-association-communities-and-getting-to-work\" target=\"_blank\">July meeting</a> and approved the new formal rules and terms of reference for the communities and Task Forces. Afterwards, they formed six breakout groups, each representing one of the six communities, and worked on drafting community work plans for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on, all the present Councillors took a moment to reflect on the successes and lessons learnt from their overall electoral term of the past two years, and each of them gave us some good suggestions for the future improvement of the functioning of the Members Council and Europeana Network Association. The Council then worked on formulating a common ‘welcome’ message as part of their legacy for the newly elected Council members who will take on their roles in January 2019. The end of the meeting was dedicated to the preparation of the General Assembly meeting of the following day. We thanked the Councillors for all their efforts and good work with a famous sachertorte and champagne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/AGMblog1.png\" style=\"height: 599px; width: 800px;\"><br><em>Europeana Network Association AGM 2018, Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>AGM - praising Europeana as a movement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day, Chair of the Association, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, opened the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/event/europeana-network-association-agm-2018\" target=\"_blank\">Annual General Meeting</a>\_at <a href=\"https://www.technischesmuseum.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Technisches Museum Wien</a>. A welcome was given by <a href=\"http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;nodeID=3404266&amp;personID=497020\" target=\"_blank\">Rehana Schwinniger-Ladak</a>, representative of the European Commission, who talked of Europeana’s achievements and challenges of the past 10 years and discussed the importance and positive impact of cultural heritage for European society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The keynote speaker <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/chris-sigaloff\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Sigaloff</a>, Advisor for the Council of Culture in the Netherlands, then discussed the power of culture in driving societal change and of Europeana’s role at its forefront: ‘Europeana is not only a database, a library or a service organisation. It is an activist movement. A movement which has the ambition to transform the world through culture.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wrapped up the morning session with the Executive Director of the Europeana Foundation, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/harry-verwayen\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Verwayen</a>, signing a Memorandum of Understanding with representatives of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as a gesture of closer international cooperation within the cultural heritage domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Building communities in action</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest achievements of the Network Association in 2018 was the launch of six communities: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeanatech\" target=\"_blank\">EuropeanaTech</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Copyright</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/impact\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Impact</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/research-community\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Research</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Education</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-communicators-group\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Communicators</a>. After the introduction of the community concept, Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-de-niet\">Marco De Niet</a> moderated a highly interactive panel discussion between the chairs of every community. The audience had an opportunity to interact directly with the speakers and ask questions using <a href=\"https://www.mentimeter.com/public/769386fa4dae2fed1e348fefca0e1aff/e859e858d557\" target=\"_blank\">Mentimeter</a>. During the lunch break, the AGM attendees had chance to chat with community managers and chairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/AGMblog2.jpg\" style=\"height: 533px; width: 800px;\"><br><em>Europeana Network Association AGM 2018, Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>General Assembly 2018</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As is now traditional, the General Assembly session was chaired by the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\" target=\"_blank\">Management Board</a> members and focused on important Network Association formalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff</a> gave an overview of the 2018 activity highlights and outlined the priorities for 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Keller</a> presented financial reports for 2017 and 2018 together with a proposed budget for 2019.

These impressive stories reminded us of how the existence of Europeana has influenced people's lives, and how together we’ve been transforming the world with culture since 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We then had the pleasure of awarding the top four Unsung Heroes and recognising the extraordinary things they've done for Europeana in the last 10 years: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/tamara-butigan\" target=\"_blank\">Tamara Butigan</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/dafydd-tudur\" target=\"_blank\">Dafydd Tudur</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marzia-piccininno\" target=\"_blank\">Marzia Piccininno</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/steven-stegers\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Stegers</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Thank you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/AGMblog4.jpg\" style=\"height: 533px; width: 800px;\"><br><em>Europeana Network Association AGM 2018, Europeana, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank all who contributed to this successful event, including our fantastic speakers and presenters, and of course our hosts in Vienna.

                body: "<h3>Hi Jacqueline, tell us a little about&nbsp;your role at&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.lenbachhaus.de\">Lenbachhaus</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I take care of everyday digital activities&nbsp;including our social media, website, blog and newsletter — and now our new baby, <a href=\"https://sammlungonline.lenbachhaus.de/\">Collections Online</a>. I try to convey the diverse content&nbsp;of our museum to&nbsp;a broad audience and to engage online users in experiencing&nbsp;our collections and the&nbsp;stories behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What motivated the Lenbachhaus to adopt its new open access policy?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a cultural institution, we are not just a storage space for artworks. To us, a&nbsp;museum is a place where people meet, learn, and exchange ideas. Enabling everyone not only to experience art but to interact with it, is a central part of our educational mandate as a municipal institution. We strive to be an open house, offering free exhibitions at least once a year, and developing a comprehensive and participative art education programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we had joined <a href=\"https://artsandculture.google.com/partner/lenbachhaus\">Google Arts &amp; Culture</a> it seemed a natural extension of our mission to make our collection available online and to adopt an open access policy. The positive response&nbsp;to Collections Online already shows that this is the right way to meet the expectations of our audiences in the digital age — it's been&nbsp;amazing to receive all the&nbsp;encouragement and feedback.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Tell us about the process and stakeholders behind Collections Online and the open access policy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to develop Collections Online — not just for our museum but for all five municipal museums in Munich — was initially made by <a href=\"https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kulturreferat/Wir-ueber-uns/Anton-Biebl-wird-Kulturreferent.html\">Anton Biebl</a>, currently Municipal Director and future Director of Munich’s Municipal Department of Arts and Culture. We were the first museum to start the process last winter. The project was strongly supported by our museum's director and our administrative director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily the team in our museum is, for the most part, very open-minded with regard to digital media. We formed a cross-team from different departments as we believe that the project affects, and relies on, active collaboration of nearly everyone in the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although our collection artworks are internationally renowned (especially <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Blaue_Reiter\">Der Blaue Reiter</a>&nbsp;paintings), online you often see&nbsp;poor quality digital versions&nbsp;with bad lighting and inaccurate colours. So we wanted to counter those images with higher quality images, in keeping with our mission to respect and safeguard the artworks we are entrusted with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the open access policy, we had to work within our municipal guidelines, which stipulate that we charge for high-resolution images. We decided that it was possible to publish&nbsp;high-quality images online but&nbsp;still charge for very high-resolution images with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorChecker\">colour checker</a>. Fortunately, our management did not need much convincing and it supported the&nbsp;open access policy early on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who are the open access influencers&nbsp;in the German museum sector?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, a large number of German museums have published their collections online but many are still hesitant to adopt&nbsp;open access policies.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the topics of open access and copyright have been discussed widely at&nbsp;various conferences, and documents such the&nbsp;“<a href=\"http://hamburger-note.de/\">Hamburger Note</a>” (2015) and “<a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de/muenchner-note\">Münchner Note</a>” (2018) have been published and signed by numerous cultural institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding open access advocates in Germany, one can name a few. The <a href=\"https://www.mkg-hamburg.de/\">Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg</a> with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_AntjeSchmidt\">Dr Antje Schmidt</a>&nbsp;must be mentioned, as it was one of the first German museums to adopt&nbsp;an open access <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/museums-in-the-digital-age-insights-from-the-museum-fuer-kunst-und-gewerbe-hamburg\">policy</a>. It's always an inspiration to listen to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elleneuler\">Ellen Euler</a>&nbsp;too, Professor for Open Access and Open Data at FH Potsdam. Our colleagues at the <a href=\"https://www.pinakothek.de\">Pinakotheken</a> use the same CC BY-SA licence as us and their 2017 conference&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">Museen </a><a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">im&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\">digitalen</a><a href=\"http://www.pinakothek.de/musmuc17\"> Raum</a>&nbsp;</em>addressed common&nbsp;concerns relating to copyright and open access.</p>\r\n"

Digital exposure to our collection can inspire users to experience the originals while other visitors might want to sum up their museum visit by consulting the collection online. We think that the works in our collection are of great importance and that they tell stories relevant to life today. Open access gives the&nbsp;artworks and stories the chance to become part of everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What's next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Collections Online&nbsp;is our first big step towards better digital access and engagement. One of our goals is, of course, to put&nbsp;more artworks online and to develop additional features. A project like this is never complete. We see Collections&nbsp;Online as becoming the&nbsp;central platform where we'll share the Lenbachhaus’s scholarly activities and archival research with the public. We're&nbsp;thinking about ways to connect this platform with others too, especially Wikipedia and Europeana. We're evaluating opportunities for new partnerships and collaborations. In 2019, we plan to take part in <a href=\"https://codingdavinci.de/\">Coding da Vinci</a>, which will take&nbsp;place in southern Germany for the first time.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Introducing the Europeana Innovation Agenda: priorities of the cultural heritage community'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Network Association has grown to be a thought leader in the cultural heritage sector. So, how could we harness this potential to help steer the European heritage community forward? The Europeana Innovation Agenda was created with exactly this purpose in mind.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>The Europeana Innovation Agenda</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For 10 years now, Europeana has played an important role in supporting memory institutions to reap the benefits of the digital transformation. Now, we need to think about the future challenges - how to equip the heritage community so that it is ready to keep up with technical, social and economic changes. To guard the heritage sector against undesired consequences and explore its potential, we look towards the opportunities for innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this light, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-innovation-agenda\">the Europeana Innovation Agenda</a> was developed. It is the result of research conducted by a dedicated Task Force under the guidance of the Europeana Foundation Governing Board and in consultation with Europeana Network Association members. It highlights the most prominent and urgent research and innovation trends that will help to steer the heritage community forward.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Innovation in the cultural heritage sector</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>But what kind of innovation do we need? The first thing that comes to mind when we talk about innovation might be novel technological solutions, but it’s so much more than that. Of equal priority are the needs to provide strategic support for individual organisations, to overcome barriers for leaving a stronger social impact and to become more resistant to financial fluctuations. Only when all of these factors are addressed in unison, can we unlock the full potential of the heritage community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that these four overarching areas \_-<strong> institutional strategy and impact, technological innovation, social change, and economic innovation</strong> - constitute the cornerstone of what will foster an innovative culture heritage sector. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Innovation agenda topics\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/Innovation.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great example of how these four areas come together is the EuropeanaTech community. Even though its primary mission is to lead the way in technological innovation, the impact of this community has branched out way beyond tech and has greatly contributed towards institutional, social and economic welfare. The projects highlighted in the latest issue of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-10-innovation-agenda\">EuropeanaTech Insight</a> show just how much innovation in these four areas overlaps to drive the heritage community forward.<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Community input - your priorities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the core of the Agenda are 13 research and innovation topics that point to the most prominent trends within the cultural heritage community. While all of them call for action, the impact of these actions and the level of readiness to take them on varies. That is why we consulted the members of the Europeana Network Association via a survey to evaluate the Agenda and determine the direction for its execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey indicated the priority and role that should be assigned to each topic. And <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Innovation_Agenda/Europeana%20Innovation%20Agenda_community%20input.pdf\">the results</a> send a clear message - we need to act now. The consensus is especially strong in the areas of institutional impact and strategy and social change. Opinions were more distributed around some of the technological and economic innovation topics - here more readiness is needed to prepare the soil for further innovative steps and our efforts should be concentrated on influencing the strategies that could help to achieve this. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Certainty matrix\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/Matrix.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make sure that all of these innovation priorities find a place within the European policies and research and innovation frameworks. With the input gathered from the heritage community, the Europeana Innovation Agenda presents a strong call to action that cannot be dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Foundation will use the Agenda in its advocacy campaigns to invest more in the potential of the cultural heritage sector. It will serve as a tool to showcase the impact of an innovative sector that needs more support to serve as a continuous source for inspiration, learning and entertainment.</p>\r\n"

The vote was opened during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/agm-2018-in-vienna-building-communities-and-celebrating-10-years-of-europeana-in-style\" target=\"_blank\">2018 AGM event</a>, and remained open from 5-14 December. Of the 2,198 members eligible to vote, 889 participated in the elections - a 40% participation rate, which is the same as in 2017. Participants campaigned on social media under the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PSoemers/statuses/1072787074842091520\" target=\"_blank\">#EuropeanaElects</a> hashtag - it was used 96 times and reached a total audience of 96.996 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as choosing their new representatives, the members voted in favour of key documents, including the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2018/Activity-plan-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Activity Plan 2019</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2018/Annual-report-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Annual Report 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2018/ENA-Financial-report-2017.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Report 2017</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/Association_Updates/General_Assembly_Meeting_2018/ENA-Budget-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">provisional budget for 2019</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>And next? Electing the new Management Board</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Members Council is composed of 36 elected representatives who will start working together on 1 January 2019. They will hold their first meeting in spring to draw up work plans and priorities for the Association and its communities. However, their first task will be to elect a new Management Board. Between 7 and 20 January 2019, the 36 Councillors will have an opportunity to step forward to be elected as one of the six board members. The elections will take place between 21 and 27 January, internally within the Council. We will come back to you with the results on 28 January 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2018-12/Electionsblog2.jpeg\" style=\"height: 365px; width: 582px;\"><br><em>Mogelijk de installatie van de carnavalsprinsen in het stadhuis, op het podium de jeugdprins, wethouder Steeghs en burgemeester Van Maaren-Van Baalen, Gemeentearchief Weert, CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A big thank you</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank all the candidates who ran for this election, and hope to see you remain as active members in our communities, and possibly campaign again in the future!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would also like to sincerely thank those Councillors who completed their terms and will be leaving the Council after two or four years for all their expertise and good work: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/francesca-di-donato\" target=\"_blank\">Francesca Di Donato</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/wim-van-dongen\" target=\"_blank\">Wim van Dongen</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sergiu-gordea\" target=\"_blank\">Sergiu Gordea</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sanja-halling\" target=\"_blank\">Sanja Halling</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/gill-hamilton\" target=\"_blank\">Gill Hamilton</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/george-homs\" target=\"_blank\">George Homs</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/lizzy-jongma\" target=\"_blank\">Lizzy Jongma</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/max-kaiser\" target=\"_blank\">Max Kaiser</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/julia-katona\" target=\"_blank\">Julia Katona</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Keller</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jef-malliet\" target=\"_blank\">Jef Malliet</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/johan-oomen\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Oomen</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/lars-rogstad\" target=\"_blank\">Lars Rogstad</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/cristina-roiu\" target=\"_blank\">Cristina Roiu</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/sorina-stanca\" target=\"_blank\">Sorina Stanca</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/romain-wenz\" target=\"_blank\">Romain Wenz</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/uldis-zarins\" target=\"_blank\">Uldis Zariņš</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\" target=\"_blank\">myself</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also thank my colleagues in the elections and voting committee - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/jef-malliet\" target=\"_blank\">Jef Malliet</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/marco-streefkerk\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Streefkerk</a> - for their efforts to make this election process transparent and smooth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, we are grateful to all the voters who dedicated time to approve the formal documents and choose their new representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We invite you to have a look at the complete\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Europeana_Network/General/Results-of-the-2018-MC-elections.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">final results</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Taxonomies for Natural History Collections'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Presenting digital collections of natural history has its own unique set of challenges. This is something that Europeana's natural history aggregator OpenUp! knows well. With almost 9 million objects on Europeana Collections - visibility and search come with some very specific parameters. The below explores some of these key elements behind presenting natural history objects online and lets you know the best ways to find what you are looking for.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Natural history collections in museums worldwide are repositories of huge amounts of preserved biological specimens that document the past and present biodiversity of our planet, including many extinct species. Those collections contain objects like stuffed and mounted animals, pinned insects, dried plants, seeds, and fruit as well as all kinds of fossils. In the past, most of these specimens were accessible only to scientists, but today digitization makes them increasingly visible to the public. Virtual galleries of images and 3D models, as well as videos and audio files, allow exploring the hidden treasures of the museum’s depots that are usually off limits for regular visitors. Europeana’s natural history aggregator, <a href=\"http://open-up.eu\">OpenUp!</a>, currently contributes <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5bPROVIDER%5d%5b%5d=OpenUp!\">8.7 million objects from 34 institutions</a> to the Europeana portal. That data provision relies on established data infrastructures in the natural history domain, namely the Biological Collection Access Service for Europe and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-01/Ursusthibetanus.jpeg\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\">To find these objects in <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/nl\">Europeana Collections</a>, the most common access point is the name of the organism. Biologists use binomials – names consisting of two parts, such as Ursus maritimus for the polar bear – to designate species. In contrast to common names in various languages, these (Latinised) names are used internationally. Species sharing certain characteristics are grouped into genera, which in turn are grouped into families. By defining several hierarchical groups of organisms with shared characteristics and ancestry (so-called taxa), biologists (taxonomists) create taxonomies. The species Ursus maritimus would be at the bottom level of such a taxonomy, together with Ursus arctos (brown bear) and Ursus thibetanus (Asian black bear) it belongs to the genus Ursus, which in turn belongs to the family of Ursidae; at the top level would be Animalia as a kingdom.\r\n\r\n<p>Taxonomies represent our understanding of species biodiversity and evolution, which is subject to permanent research. Consequently, taxonomies are in constant flow. As new species are discovered, new names will be added. Systematic research might discover that a certain species is more closely related to another genus, so that part of the species’ binomial has to be changed. A genus might be merged with another genus or split up in several genera, which requires several species names to be changed. Whole taxon groups can be moved to other parts of the hierarchical tree as the result of newly discovered knowledge about common ancestry, e.g. in cases when traditionally used morphological characteristics have to be reconsidered in light of molecular evidence. Peculiarities such as homonyms (identical names for different species) and synonyms (several names for one species) add up to the difficulties dealing with taxonomies. The complexity of handling such dynamic data gave rise to the new field of taxonomic computing.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-01/Taxonomies_for_Natural_History_Collections_Biologicalclassification.png\" style=\"max-width:250px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\"><p>Traditional taxonomies often deal with a defined group of organisms, e.g. a certain family, class or kingdom, and refer to a certain geographic region, in which the described group is well-known and documented. Examples are regional ‘taxonomic checklists’ such as <a href=\"http://www.emplantbase.org\">Euro + Med PlantBase</a> (vascular plants of Europe and the Mediterranean region) and <a href=\"https://fauna-eu.org\">Fauna Europaea</a>\_(European land and fresh-water animals), which are joint efforts of taxonomists from many institutions and are constantly\_being\_updated. Initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://www.eu-nomen.eu\">Pan-European Species-directories Infrastructure</a> (PESI) merge taxonomies from different communities into a single, all-taxa checklist. Similar initiatives exist on a global level: The <a href=\"http://www.catalogueoflife.org\">Catalogue of Life</a> pools data from 168 taxonomic databases into an authoritative index of known species of animals, plants,\_fungi and microorganisms, which currently lists 1.8m of the world's 1.9m named species. GBIF’s <a href=\"https://www.gbif.org/dataset/d7dddbf4-2cf0-4f39-9b2a-bb099caae36c\">Backbone Taxonomy</a> builds\_upon the Catalogue of Life and is regularly assembled in an automatic process from 56 sources.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say that the decision on which checklist should be used for a collection depends on the taxonomic and geographic coverage. Taxonomies undergo constant updates, so the matching of collection objects to any of the mentioned checklists should be performed at regular intervals. Most of them are available through web services that allow easy integration into existing infrastructures and products. Regional and global synonymised checklists such as PESI and the Catalogue of Life can be used to implement query expansion mechanisms that extend user queries for a taxon to all known synonyms of this taxon. Such query-expansion functions are already state-of-the-art in biodiversity portals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For natural history specimens, Linked Open Data identifiers have become widely used in the recent past, for example by implementing the <a href=\"https://cetaf.org/cetaf-stable-identifiers\">HTTP Stable Identifiers</a> of the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities (CETAF). For taxa, similar initiatives are being discussed, but the inherent uncertainty and the constant flow of taxonomies make taxa not easy to grasp and hamper such efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A problem that cannot be solved by using canonical taxonomies is the issue of misidentifications – specimens mistaken for a certain species, which results in incorrect names being used for objects. This cannot be completely avoided considering that some collections contain millions of specimens, which cannot be updated constantly. So this should be taken into account when using the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-01/Taxonomies_for_Natural_History_Collections_TestudohermanniGmelin_1789.png\" style=\"max-width:800px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For OpenUp!, no uniform taxonomy is used for the specimen objects. As the data are provided by institutions that are experts in their respective fields, they are expected to apply appropriate checklists on their data before feeding them to OpenUp. However, to increase accessibility, OpenUp! enriches the objects’ metadata with common names in 300 languages and dialects, so that a species can be found (with some certainty) without knowing its scientific name. Further enrichment includes links to scientific literature available in the <a href=\"https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org\">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a> (BHL), a consortium dedicated to making legacy literature on biodiversity accessible online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acknowledgements: I’d like to thank my colleagues Walter Berendsohn, Petra Böttinger, Gabi Dröge, Anton Güntsch, Agnes Kirchhoff and Gerda Koch for their valuable comments and suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image attributions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/11622/_MFN_MAMMALIA_MFN_GERMANY_ZMB_Mam_000761.html?q=ursus+thibetanus#1543931391363\">Ursus thibetanus G.[Baron] Cuvier, 1823,</a>\_Museumfür Naturkunde Berlin, Germany, CC BY-SA</em></li>\r\n    <li><em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg\">A biological classification’s seven major taxonomic ranks</a>,\_Peter Halasz, Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain.\_</em></li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/11620/_MNHN_RA_0_9340.html\">Testudo </a></em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/11620/_MNHN_RA_0_9340.html\"><em>hermanni</em></a><em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/11620/_MNHN_RA_0_9340.html\"> Gmelin, 1789</a>,\_Muséum national d'Histoire </em><em>naturelle</em><em>, France,\_CC BY-NC-ND</em>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n"

My father came here with the first army in August 1914. He was also an artist, a painter, and he gave a very vivid description of Brussels. And when I arrived here, I shed some tears when I was in the park, as I remembered those times with my parents.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the actions of digitising content, participants saw their connection to the past changed. Whether it be through seeing new-found humanity in people from past generations, or similarities between themselves and the people they were often so intimately reading about - every participant interviewed commented on their transformed view of historical events and people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competition finalist Anastasija Smirnova said, ‘I feel really grateful that I had this opportunity to come here and participate here. Also, I think Europeana gives people a chance to look inside everyday life because before that we were looking just on political stuff, political levels, whereas now we know we are going inside common ordinary people’s lives.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transform culture, transform people, transform the world</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Europeana, we aim to do more than provide access to cultural heritage - we also aim to connect to the humanity that lies within these cultural heritage objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Europeana Foundation Executive Director Harry Verwayen <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/who-are-we-europeana-in-this-digital-transformation\">stated</a>, 'When we talk about digital transformation, we must also ask: transforming into what? And how?'</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">See, the difference between digitisation and digital transformation is that which is being transformed. We digitise things: books, paintings, letters, even processes, mathematics and music. But digital transformation, it is us - people and society - that is the ‘thing’. We are the ones being transformed, it is the disruption to our mechanisms and behaviour that is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Transform the world with culture</em>. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have an opinion on digital transformation? An example of it in action? Do you still see it as a buzzword?&nbsp;Get in touch!

        title: 'Europeana’s Carbon Footprint'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We estimated the carbon footprint of Europeana in three different areas: our online services, our office and foreign travel. Learn how we did it, what our results are and what they could mean for your organisation or business.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2018, as part of a project in the annual Europeana Hack Week, we published <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-s-carbon-footprint\">a report</a> on Europeana’s carbon footprint \_While the project aimed to further Europeana’s mission to 'transform the world with culture', it's vitally important that we also be aware of the impacts of our actions, their effects on the world and that we strive to mitigate those. The carbon footprint project was awarded as ‘most impactful idea’ by \_Europeana Foundation staff and our findings and process are worth sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We focused on calculating the footprint of all <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services\">our online services</a>, of our offices and of all foreign travel undertaken in 2018. We had to make several assumptions as not all data is available at the ideally detailed level. For example, no electricity consumption figures are available for most of our computer servers so we calculated and used an average electricity consumption for three different types of servers. This does mean that all footprint numbers are approximate, but this is the case for most carbon footprint calculations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this in mind, we found that:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the carbon footprint of all online services is around 113,700 kg of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per year,</li>\r\n    <li>the footprint of office utility usage (electricity, heating and water) is around 127,600 kg CO2e per year,</li>\r\n    <li>the footprint of all employee foreign travel is around 37,800 kg CO2e in 2018.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana's carbon footprint\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-01/Carbon_footprint_table.png\" style=\"max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, we have a footprint of 279,000 kg CO2e which is roughly the same as the footprint of:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>12.1 average Dutch households (27.6 people); or</li>\r\n    <li>1.1 million kilometres driven with an average passenger car; or</li>\r\n    <li>1.2 million large cups of cappuccino</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Interestingly, this energy consumption could be sequestered by letting 4,600 new tree seedlings grow for 10 years, every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, to have a more complete carbon footprint picture we would also need to include the daily commutes of Europeana Foundation staff and all travel undertaken by members of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">Europeana Network Association</a>. We hope to include these in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s next</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that our calculations will be the first step towards reducing our carbon footprint. We already know that our online services footprint will reduce in six months when we will decommission all servers used for our recently-replaced, old ingestion system (more on this to come in future articles). We calculated that this could lead to a reduction of up to 42% of the current online services footprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Read more</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The full carbon footprint report is online as a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BLXUsOJuplH_9qFbAIsMeai7ECwAi9PhoBCIZe_Ivdw\">Google Drive Document</a>. We would love your feedback on it or to hear about the footprint of your organisation. You can make comments directly in the report or send an email to <a href=\"mailto:patrick.ehlert@europeana.eu\">patrick.ehlert@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What has been the impact of open access for the museum, and who does it benefit? Has anything surprised you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several benefits. Firstly, open access brings greater visibility to the museum. It gives the Musée de Bretagne a positive and innovative image in the French culture sector. It also generates new knowledge about the museum’s collections, thanks to feedback from online visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A \"win-win\" relationship is established between online visitors and the museum team. A variety of people benefit from open access, from video artists using the collections in their work, to the Wikimedia community that gives our collections greater visibility. Publishers often send us books in which the museum’s images have been used, without us having asked them to – a nice surprise!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do you measure the impact of open access?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One impact has been the number of enquiries we receive from colleagues in other institutions, who are keen to learn from our approach and our policy. We receive many requests to speak at professional conferences and events, and a number of articles have appeared in the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traffic growth on our collections portal also tells us that users have taken notice. They’ve become self-sufficient in their research to the point where the museum rarely receives research requests – so the time spent on this previously can now be allocated more usefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What advice would you give to other museums considering open access?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Diligent copyright and legal assessment of the collections is crucial to understanding risks and to inform licensing, rights holders and contracts. This takes time so it should be undertaken well in advance of the planned launch date. For our museum today, this process is far from complete and further releases of open data depend on the continuation of this work.</p>\r\n"

Just six years ago, we barely knew what a CC licence was! Since then, we’ve developed our understanding through our commitment to communities in Rennes, such as the local Wikipedia chapter and individuals involved in the movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum of Brittany’s roots in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomuseum\">ecomuseology</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomuseum\"> </a>means that notions of community and sharing are woven into our professional culture. We take pride in being open access pioneers in France and we want to share our experiences, whether positive or less successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We remain optimistic that open access in France will continue to grow, as we saw recently with the Paris city museums’ <a href=\"https://www.wikimedia.fr/2018/12/07/les-collections-publiques-de-la-ville-de-paris-passent-en-open-content/\">opening of data</a>. The status quo – especially the fee-charging model of the Réunion des Musées Nationaux - Grand Palais – is not sustainable for much longer. It’s counterproductive and contributes to give a feeling of spoliation of our shared heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Museum directors can provide strategic visions for their institutions but at the national level the Ministry of Culture and the government must provide leadership in these matters.</p>\r\n"

What key aspects should our readers know about?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Cleveland Museum of Art is making all images of public-domain works in its collection available under<a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\"> Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>. This provides access to as many as 30,000 high-resolution images of artworks from the CMA’s collection to use without restriction, as well as the associated metadata and scholarship for the entire collection – over 61,500 works. We are offering both high-resolution JPEG and TIF files, enabling a greater range of uses of images for commercial and non-commercial purposes than has previously been possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CMA’s Open Access initiative brings its mission into the digital age. As with our <a href=\"http://www.clevelandart.org/artlens-gallery\">ARTLENS</a>&nbsp;Gallery and other digital initiatives, we’re offering the most complete and accessible digital package at launch. We’ve redesigned our collection pages to display over 35 fields of metadata, including descriptive text and provenance. The publishing of descriptive text with Open Access creates more possibilities for semantic relationships, contextual interpretations, and translations related to artworks in the collection.</p>\r\n"

This allows us to be a highly sought-after dataset for developers to use around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are the motivating factors behind the CMA’s new policy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Open Access initiative is tied directly to the <a href=\"http://www.clevelandart.org/about/history-and-mission/mission-statement\">CMA’s mission</a> and helps to advance our institutional goals as a museum of the 21st century. Our art has always been and always will be for the people. We truly believe that there is something for everyone in our collection. Beyond fulfilling our mission, this project allows our collection to be used and recognised more broadly around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Access is a continuation of the investment the museum has made in advancing digital engagement and making art accessible to all. It was the logical next step that celebrates the collection, as well as curators, research, and scholarship.</p>\r\n"

Why is this important?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open access to artwork information like descriptive text, provenance, and catalogue raisonné enables users to explore the context of artwork at new levels, something not possible with other initiatives that limit metadata open access to identifying or 'tombstone' data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Descriptive text is often where connections are discovered and meaning is found for works of art. For example, the CMA is a leader in research for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://clevelandart.org/research/curatorial/nazi-era-provenance\">Nazi-era provenance</a> and in promoting the history of collecting. The open sharing of provenance data acknowledges the importance and generosity of the museum’s donors. Catalogue raisonné numbers are also relevant, as CMA works may now be linked with artworks in other collections that have also catalogued these important index numbers, migrating research practices from analogue to digital methods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The elements of description, provenance, and catalogue raisonné are part of an enhanced and enriched metadata offering that can be especially useful for data scientists and art historians alike.</p>\r\n"

In your view, how does it connect with the role of museums in the 21st century?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open access is the ability for a museum to easily share its collection with the world. Openness becomes part of an institution’s fundamental identity. Openness becomes a core trait of an institution’s internal working culture through collaboration across divisions and teams. Openness informs how an institution carries out scholarly practice with respect to cataloguing, research&nbsp;and publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Openness becomes a mantle for executive leadership of the institution. Openness that promotes the conservation of the institution through a greater and more resonant connection with its public. Openness, especially through copyright-waived public-domain assets, publications, and projects with <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a>, powers engagement in an interconnected and global 21st-century society.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How was CMA’s Open Access initiative developed?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The initiative required building consensus and conducting educational work with key stakeholders. Thorough explanations from the ambassadors of the project helped to drive home the meanings and nuances of Open Access and Creative Commons legal tools. People are familiar with copyright but often have been trained to fear it as a punitive rather than inspirational instrument for making new culture.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Who was involved?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our entire staff had to support this initiative for it to be a success, especially the leadership team, and a collaborative cross-team enabled the overall success of this project. The team includes representatives from the Digital Innovation and Technology Services and the Collections Management Department, with support provided by the chief curator as well as the CMA’s director, William Griswold, in consultation with our legal counsel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the museum, we were fortunate to consult with <a href=\"https://www.nealstimler.com/about.html\">Neal Stimler</a>, senior advisor at the Balboa Park Online Collaborative, and to have the guidance of Creative Commons to ensure best practices were implemented. The museum gratefully acknowledges the CEO of Creative Commons, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/author/ryancreativecommons-org/\">Ryan Merkley</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/author/janeparkcreativecommons-org/\">Jane Park</a>, Director of Product and Research, and <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/author/dianecreativecommons-org/\">Diane Peters</a>, General Counsel, for their critical contributions to this initiative. The CMA recommends working directly with Creative Commons when designing and implementing an open-access initiative. &nbsp;I am personally grateful to Loic Tallon, CDO of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for openly sharing the strategy and data that underpins their Open Access Program and for helping transform the conversation about Open Access in the museum field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to museums considering a similar initiative?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Open access demands an institution make a commitment to accepting and facing dynamic change. The absolute support of a director or chief executive is a must for an organisation’s open access initiative to advance successfully from a potential internal conversation to a fully and publicly implemented project. <a href=\"http://www.clevelandart.org/about/museum-leadership/william-m-griswold\">Director William M. Griswold</a>’s support has been certainly important to bringing Open Access to the public. A director who supports such an initiative is a leader among leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infuse your organisation’s project with expertise by bringing in external help and the support of community leaders who are experienced, knowledgeable&nbsp;and steadfast. The project needs to be socialised within an organisation to rally enthusiasm and build confidence, and internal colleagues need to be supported as they become more comfortable with the idea of open access. Peer allies give the initiative the greatest opportunity for success at important stages of development in the internal process.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>A common argument that museums make <em>against</em> open access is, 'We don’t charge admission fees so we can’t afford to give our images away for free.' The Cleveland Museum of Art is free to the public, so what’s your take on this?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admission to The Cleveland Museum of Art is free of charge. The decision to provide existing high-resolution images of public domain artworks in CMA's collection to the public, without an additional fee or restriction of any kind, is aligned with the museum's mission 'to create transformative experiences through art for the benefit of all the people forever' in the 21st century. The accessibility to, engagement with, and usability of CMA's artworks in the collection, as manifest through images and data, are the decided and firm priorities for the museum.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Director of The Cleveland Museum of Art, William M. Griswold, remarked in his opening address of the Open Access program: 'Open Access with Creative Commons Zero will provide countless new opportunities to engage with works of art in our collection. With this move, we have transformed not only access to the CMA’s collection but also its usability—inside as well as outside our museum walls. Whenever, wherever, and however the public wishes to use, reuse, remix, or reinvent the objects that we hold, our collection is available; we are but caretakers of these objects that belong to the artistic legacy of humankind.'</p>\r\n"

Users take what image is already available on the internet at no cost to them because it is easy and expedient. It is better for CMA to acknowledge that this shift in user behaviour and revenue has occurred and work to provide the best quality images from the museum itself to be used by the public. It is expensive and inefficient to administer burdensome rights and permissions&nbsp;for artworks in the public domain. Costs are saved by institutions who reallocate staff time and labour to more beneficial activities that build possibilities for new growth and understanding of the collection, such as more in-depth and complete cataloging of the collection, as well as the development products in strategic partnerships with new commercial ventures that spread awareness about the artworks in CMA's collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Image rights and production fees have been well studied and documented with publications by: <a href=\"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/reproduction-charging-models--rights-policy-for-digital-images-in-american-art-museums(95d04077-f8ec-4094-b8c1-d585c6b16d9b)/export.html\">Simon Tanner</a> (2004); <a href=\"http://www.kressfoundation.org/research/copyright_museums_and_licensing_of_art_images/\">Kenneth Crews</a> (2010-12); <a href=\"http://msc.mellon.org/msc-files/Open%20Access%20Report%2004%2025%2013-Final.pdf\">Kristen Kelly</a> (2013); <a href=\"http://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/2016_03_10_OpenCollections_Public.pdf\">Effie Kapsalis</a> (2016); <a href=\"https://displayatyourownrisk.org/\">Andrea Wallace and Ronan Deazley</a> (2016).</p>\r\n"

Who’s on board?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CMA has invested in developing partnerships with allied institutions and organisations, such as Europeana, to spread the access and the impact of the Open Access initiative to relevant communities of practice. These partnerships include art-world, academic, commercial, community, and technology partners. A full list of partnerships is on the CMA’s <a href=\"http://clevelandart.org/open-access\">Open Access home page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The cognitive search tool created by our partners at Microsoft is so powerful that we applied it to our newly redesigned collections search. This tool has allowed our partners to access our collection and create something meaningful for our launch. Here are a few examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Wikimedia has all of the CMA’s Open Access images and they feature in the <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings\">Sum of All Paintings</a> project</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Internet Archive is uploading the museum’s public domain artworks to its website</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Artstor is expanding the CMA images available through the Artstor Digital Library, which includes millions of high-quality images for education and research across disciplines from a wide variety of contributors around the world</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Artsy is integrating the museum’s artworks into the augmented-reality feature on the Artsy iPhone app, allowing users to virtually 'hang'&nbsp;two-dimensional artworks to any vertical surface</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Hyland Software, headquartered in Cleveland, is using a Microsoft HoloLens to allow users to place holographic images of two-dimensional artworks in the space around them</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">American Greetings is using CMA Open Access images as part of a collage workshop during an all-associates event in February to reimagine images from the collection, designed to inspire and cultivate creative community in the building and within Cleveland</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Partnerships are important because they build community, provide demonstrable examples of the benefits of open access, and magnify impact and reach beyond the museum’s own website and subdomains. Partnerships place our content directly in the hands of users who can create, remix, and share their engagement with the museum’s collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep your eyes on the CMA’s <a href=\"http://clevelandart.org/open-access\">Open Access homepage</a> for updates on our activities and follow the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23CMAOpenAccess&amp;src=typd\">#CMAOpenAccess</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Read about the launch of Women’s Season in collaboration with Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, a leading campaigner for women in the digital sector. The Season is part of Commissioner Gabriel’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/women-ict\">strategy</a> to empower women and increase their participation in the digital economy. Women’s Season will culminate in March 2019 (with International Women’s Day celebrations on 8 March) and will highlight the achievements of both modern and historical women. Find out more, and how you can participate.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The aim of Women’s Season is to spotlight women throughout history, highlight their contributions, and discuss some historical and current challenges that women still face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a celebration of innovation and progress, as well as a moment to discuss future aims for the sector and provide a call to action for all in the sector to advocate for gender parity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The season is one of collaboration - so we will be providing information on key moments for activism and involvement. Be it through Twitter chats, viral social media campaigns, petitioning, or any number of initiatives that we will share, promote and take part in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Season Activities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana Collections</a>, we’ll highlight the lives and achievements of historical European women in a series of editorial features (blogs, galleries, and an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/exhibitions/pioneers\">exhibition</a>), including guest contributions from Europeana’s network of cultural heritage partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Pro</a>, we are running a \_series of profiles and interviews with leading women in the digital and GLAM sectors, highlighting their work and achievements. The series is entitled <em>Women in Culture and Technology</em>\_and will feature interviews with women from across sectors and across the world - including, tech expert and founder of DigiPippi (an organisation which bridges the gender gap in technology) Eva Fog and renowned multi-disciplinary artist Nora Al-Badri.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A series of inspiration, innovation, and insight</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By going behind-the-scenes and showing women in action - be it as a work-from-home digital writer and activist, a politician, artist, or a tech entrepreneur - professional women will be given a platform to share their experiences, insights, challenges and hopes for the future of technology and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst bridging gender gaps may not seem as momentous as the challenges faced by our professional foremothers (see our digital exhibition <em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a>\_</em>for a deeper look at this topic), the recent European Commission study \_<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/increase-gender-gap-digital-sector-study-women-digital-age\">‘Women in the Digital Age’</a> reported a growing gap in gender parity in digital sectors of education, career and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study highlights the continued need to publicise the contribution of women - and particularly those who inhabit spaces that are historically male-dominated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner Gabriel said: ‘How much better would Europe be if girls and women felt empowered to dream big and aim high across professional fields from art to science? Having role models will help them build these dreams. The online exhibition I launch today in cooperation with Europeana is about pioneering women from our history whose stories are vastly different, but have one thing in common: these fearless women changed the world with their passion and hard work. Today we need to empower and inspire girls and women everywhere in Europe to innovate, discover and create especially in the digital sector. And all of us, we have a role to play.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Lily Knibbeler, Director General of the National Library of the Netherlands said: ‘Culture is all about diversity, which means that the full richness of our culture can only be embodied by full diversity in our workforce.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Jill Cousins, Director and CEO Hunt Museum said: ‘Women are often not invited to the table - \_I don’t think it is deliberate – but in the same way that humans tend to flock to their own tribe, if there are no women at the original table they are less likely to get invited to the future one. It will require a deliberate action to change this.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get involved!</h2>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>Send Europeana Women viral on International Women's Day by posting - post #IWD2019 and tag @europeanaeu\_to show your support\_(8 March).</li>\r\n    <li>Join a Twitter chat. We will be discussing key topics from the Pro series. <b id=\"docs-internal-guid-437288f5-7fff-f2d8-e8db-7a7178e856e1\">@Europeanaeu Twitter chat: follow the #womeninculturechat 15.00 CET 29 March</b>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The digital exhibition <em>Pioneers </em>will publish one chapter per week starting today until International Women’s Day, 8 March. <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Visit the exhibition</a>.

From 21 to 27 January 2019, the 36 Council representatives elected six of the nominees to form the new Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Role of the Management Board</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Management Board leads the development of the ENA’s strategic vision. Board members also act as legal representatives and decision-making executives, representing the ENA on Europeana Foundation’s Governing Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The six Board members act as key ambassadors of Europeana and the ENA and offer guidance to its members. The Board oversees the ENA governance, sets its procedures and annual policy, and is responsible for the budget and delivery of formal reports. It also accepts new members, and provides guidance to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association Communities</a> (and their task forces and working groups) and formally approves and evaluates the work progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Board is headed by the Chair, who acts as the voice of the ENA and chairs all the Management Board and Members Council meetings together with the General Assembly; the Vice-Chair who carries out these responsibilities in the Chair's absence; and the Treasurer who is responsible for the budget and financial resources. They are accountable in their roles to the Members Council. These three roles will be decided upon during the first Board meeting on 20 February 2019.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'We asked educators how they want to use digital cultural data and this is what they told us'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We believe that a stronger link between the cultural and education sectors is both vital and mutually beneficial. That’s why, over the last year or so, we (the Europeana Foundation’s Reuse team) have been asking questions to our educational audiences and listening carefully to their answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The information we have gleaned will help data providers to better understand and cater to the needs of teachers and students by providing high-quality cultural data in relevant formats and on relevant topics. This will translate into more happy educators and more inspiring examples of reuse of their collections in educational settings of all types.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h1>Who did we talk to and how?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>In\_2018, we interviewed around 500 educators from across Europe in over 15 surveys following workshops, webinars and presentations. The aim was to understand their preferences for using digital cultural data in education and to find out how likely they were to recommend the use of Europeana resources to their peers, to their students, and whether they would really use Europeana material in their classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We got qualitative and quantitative data from our DSI-3 project partners’ reports. These included qualitative feedback from the educators in the Europeana Teacher Developer Group (n18) and User Group (n60) as well as from the 15 French teachers selected by the Ministry of Education, France, all of whom have created and implemented learning scenarios with Europeana content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two massive questionnaires, the Europeana MOOC’s pre-survey in April 2018 with a total of 719 respondents, and the survey to French national portal Eduthèque’s users that ran between January and March 2018 with a total of 1,581 respondents gave us more quantitative data to analyse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally<b>, </b>we collected information on the usage, drivers and barriers to integrating our content in education in direct conversations with teachers and educational stakeholders during the events we have organised or attended. Since September 2017, these amount for 18 events in nine European countries, from smaller teacher workshops to international and renowned educational conferences, such as BETT and Open Education Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What did we find out?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>After careful analysis of the data, we are happy to share our main findings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Educator profile</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The average educator interested in Europeana resources is a professional in secondary education, with more than ten years of experience, teaching history, languages and science-related subjects, and eager to bring innovation into their practice. About 30% of teachers we spoke to work in primary education, which is a promising niche to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enthusiastic teachers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the educators weren’t aware of Europeana and its resources for education at the outset. But their first encounter with our collections sparked enthusiasm and very positive feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We consistently measured teachers’ willingness to recommend Europeana resources to their peers and students using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter\">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS) scale (-100 to +100) and the likelihood of using Europeana material in their classroom on a scale from 1 to 10. The respective scores are 63 NPS for peers, 56 NPS for students and 8 for usage in schools which paint a bright future for culture and education.<b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Content preferences</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers are mostly interested in Europeana’s thematic collections and the general search functionality. Less popular resources are the exhibitions, galleries and the ready-to-use material (e.g. apps, e-books or learning platforms). \_<b>\_\_\_</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Educators have a clear preference for audiovisual items, particularly images and videos, and they would like to find more 3D content to create engaging learning experiences (see example below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hd5a-LK85vI\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Topics </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art and history are the most popular school subjects that teachers are searching for on Europeana Collections, but there is an increasing interest for more science-related content, like physics, mathematics and technology. Our surveys provided a long list of keywords and topic suggestions which will inform future content curation on Europeana Collections, with the first example being the forthcoming Science Collection in spring 2019. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Usage patterns and preferences</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Educators like to browse by topic/subject (e.g WWI, Ancient Egypt, the relativity of time) or object type (e.g manuscript, map, artwork). They also appreciate having extra information on the item page - topic/subject-related items (similar items) and/or education-specific (e.g. a learning activity or a resource). What’s more, they are very interested in creating and sharing their own collections and learning scenarios on Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers also manifested their interest in having more language options, either in the website’s functionalities or in the availability of translated learning material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also valuable to know that teachers consider Europeana Collections a safe environment for their students and that our resources facilitate project-based assignments, fostering the collaboration, critical thinking and communication skills necessary for the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Trends</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other relevant feedback gathered at events and in informal conversations showed a strong interest for virtual reality and mixed reality educational applications and a demand for more STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and CLIL (content-language integrated learning) pedagogical material. Both are pedagogical approaches for which Europeana Collections can play a role as a multilingual and cross-subject platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Students feedback</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the teachers from the Europeana Developer Group also gathered their students’ impressions when using Europeana resources. The most relevant takeaways are that using primary sources and historical documents is especially engaging for students and that accessing complementary content from other countries via Europeana Collections helps them to enrich their assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-ab9a5292-7fff-c240-5ae9-62c721f674c0\">Conclusion - we’re on the right track</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The summary field data and the findings gave us even more confidence in the strategic match between culture and education. They are already being used to guide the relevant Europeana operations and providing insights that Europeana Network Association can use to support digital transformation through culture in education on a larger scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We aim to continue collecting data and publish updated findings on an annual basis. Stay tuned!</p>\r\n"

The release of 160 high-quality openly licensed works of art was applauded throughout the cultural heritage sector. Building on this, SMK forged partnerships and collaborations to encourage engagement with their open images, laying the foundations for SMK Open - a four-year programme making SMK’s collections freely available to everyone  for any purpose from the serious to the sublime.</p>\r\n"

Make mistakes!’</em> – Angela Spinazze, <a href=\"https://www.smk.dk/en/article/this-belongs-to-you/\">member of the SMK digital advisory board</a>, 2009</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundations for SMK Open were laid in a seminal programme, SMK Digital, &nbsp;a five year project to develop digital museum practice with a goal to be ‘<a href=\"https://www.smk.dk/en/article/this-belongs-to-you/\">a catalyst for users’ creativity</a>’. During this programme, creative uses of SMK works - enabled by both open artworks and the collaborative approach to stimulate community engagement - led to popular uses such as ‘<a href=\"https://www.m.dk/#!/om+metroen/metrobyggeriet/byens+hegn/hegnspaelen+2013/smk+paa+byens+hegn\">Byens Hegn</a>’. &nbsp;A collaboration between the volunteer Art Pilots of ULK (Young People’s Art Lab) and SMK, a 79-metre fence containing all 160 open images was wrapped around the walls of construction sites for the renovations of Copenhagen's metro. Contributing to a more positive local environment, architects and residents agreed that the community benefited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>”<em>...you establish a sense of community around the hoardings…</em>” - Tina Saaby, City architect and neighbour,<a href=\"https://intl.m.dk/#!/about+the+metro/metro+expansion/cool+construction\"> København K</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The positive effects of providing free access to high-quality digital works of art continued to grow in the years that followed <a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/creative-re-use-of-smks-collections-cb0fd8907711\">the first release of open images</a>. &nbsp;Within the museum, the SMK Open API powers a new mobile application built to enable visitors to<a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/instant-smk-art-info-theres-an-app-for-that-81a836e17eed\"> instantly discover art</a>, as well as an application to explore works virtually<a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/new-app-lets-you-explore-every-tiny-detail-c252733ba2f3\"> in incredible detail</a>. &nbsp;Monthly WikiLabs initiated by SMK bring together museum professionals with cultural heritage enthusiasts to learn about editing and refining Wikipedia entries, contributing to a wider strategy to forge a strong partnership with Wikipedia that has lead to incredible increases in the visibility of SMK’s collection: demonstrated by the increase in page views of SMK works in 2015 of 770,000, to 20 million in 2015 and 33 million in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\"What we’re learning from becoming an OpenGLAM museum is that it’s not enough to just provide access to the images; in a sector that has long taught audiences that they can’t use artworks without permission, we have to teach them that it’s their cultural heritage, that it belongs to them, and that they should feel free to use it.\" </em>- <a href=\"https://artstor.blog/2016/05/23/sharing-is-caring-an-interview-with-smks-merete-sanderhoff/\">Merete </a><a href=\"https://medium.com/smk-open/the-only-way-is-open-840b38fb8e2\">Sanderhoff</a>, Statens Museum for Kunst</p>\r\n"

That way, you can bring something old with you into the new.’</em> - Anonymous participant in ‘Making the Invisible Visible Workshop’, 2018</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ULK developed a workshop in which young people create visual expressions of the difficult emotions to do with mental and physical health, social challenges and stigmas, &nbsp;by discussing, clipping and remixing digitised artworks from the SMK public domain collection. Preliminary impact research indicates that creative work supported by open art enables young people who are struggling in life or who are trying to understand how others feel to express their own feelings in different ways, and to find ways to cope with and digest their impressions.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The Taboo Workshop Make the Invisible Visible used freely reusable public domain artworks as a conversation-starter among young people taking part in the Young People's Meeting in Copenhagen 6-8 September 2018. The Young People's Meeting attracts more than 30,000 youngsters every year. In a collaboration with six NGO's, the workshop invited participants to create visual expressions of the difficult emotions that are shared across mental and physical disorders, by discussing, clipping, and remixing artworks from the SMK collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop was co-organised between SMK Open, SMK's creative community Young People's Art Labs (ULK), and six NGO's working with young people who struggle with mental or physical disorders that are tabooed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the impact assessment looking to show, to who and why?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At workshop level, we were curious to see if the creative act of clipping and remixing artworks could enable fruitful discussions and foster greater understanding of difficult topics and life situations among young people. On a more general level, we were looking to explore how it influences and possibly changes young people's relation to art, museums, and cultural heritage when they get free and open access to digitized artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact assessment is a first attempt at collecting qualitative data about the possible impact an open and freely usable digitized cultural heritage can have in young people's everyday lives, and on their perception of art, museums, and cultural heritage in society.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What data is collected, from who and what methods are used</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An independent anthropologist and expert in user studies prepared and conducted a series of interviews with workshop participants immediately after the workshop. 5 groups of high school kids (16-19 years old), 4 teachers, 3 representatives from the NGO's, and 2 representatives from ULK were interviewed (questions in Appendix). Observations were also made of the overall quantitative reach of ULK and SMK Open being present at the Young People's Meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over 100 youngsters joined the various activities offered throughout the event 6-8 September, with more than 70 taking part in the Taboo Workshop. What are the highlights of the impact assessment Rich information was found in the statements of young people having participated in the Taboo Workshop, and key stakeholders around them. Together, they identify ways in which open access to cultural heritage can be a catalyst for playful learning, personal development, active engagement in important issues, and development towards greater human understanding</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is learned from this, and what’s next?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We were able to increase our understanding of how playful participation and engaging creative practices can help bring art and museums at eye level with young people, making them feel empowered to explore and learn about different cultures and ways of life, and about themselves by engaging with cultural heritage as a tool box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study demonstrates that working creatively with art entails two primary outcomes when it comes to tackling difficult emotions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong>Expression</strong> – users say that the creative process is an icebreaker that enables them to put into words and/or images the difficult emotions they feel or are confronted with in others, helping them grow and show empathy</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Impression</strong> – users say that working creatively and intuitively with their hands provides a breathing hole, an open space, a chance forget oneself and to reflect on their own emotions on a deeper level This is a pilot study which will be an important basis of a two-year research project by four Danish art museums, focussing on longer term outcomes of letting young, socially fragile people meet and engage with art on a regular basis.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>This week will see the final round of negotiations about the EU copyright reform that has been in the making since 2016. During a series of meetings in Strasbourg the negotiators from the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission will try to find compromises on the last controversial elements of the Copyright in the Digital Single Market directive. If they manage to do this, the compromise will go to a final vote by the European Parliament later this spring. If they do not, the efforts to modernise the EU copyright rules will likely be set back by a number of years.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>A lot is at stake for cultural heritage institutions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage compromises have been found for most provisions in the proposed directive. The remaining controversies centre on&nbsp;those parts of the directive that are intended to change the balance between the creative sector on the one hand and online intermediaries on the other:&nbsp;Article 13 (which&nbsp;would change&nbsp;the rules for online platforms that provide access to user-uploaded content) and Article 11 (which&nbsp;would change the rules for search engines and news aggregators that link to news articles). Over the past few days a number of important stakeholders from the publishing, music and film industries, who had so far been supportive of Article 13, have come out against Article 13&nbsp;and have called for the entire directive to be scrapped. <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2019/02/08/time-stop-hijacking-copyright-bolster-economic-interests-specific-sectors/\">This has increased the chances that this week's final negotiations will not result in a compromise and that the EU copyright rules will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this situation, there is a lot at stake for Europe's cultural heritage institutions. Among the many uncontroversial provisions of the proposed directive are a number of measures that, if adopted, would benefit cultural heritage institutions and the millions of citizens, researchers and educators who make use of their services. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Articles 3 and 3a</strong> which for the first time reflect the data economy we live in, introducing copyright exceptions for text and data mining which forms the basis of Artificial Intelligence.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Article 5 </strong>which allows digital preservation of in-copyright works including the use of digital preservation networks within a Member State, but also across borders.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Article 5a </strong>which would ensure that digital reproductions of public domain artworks will remain for the public to use and re-use, and</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Articles 7-9 </strong>which create mechanisms that would enable cultural heritage institutions to make available online or out-of-commerce but in-copyright works from their collections.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together, these articles represent a massive step forward towards a copyright framework that promotes access to culture, research and education and should not be jeopardised by political disagreements over other elements of the proposal. Europe's cultural heritage institutions have been asking for legal solutions to mass-digitisation that will help us to close <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">the 20th century black hole</a> for more than a decade. The parts of the proposal that have already been agreed by the co-legislators would go a long way towards achieving this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrespective of what happens to Articles 11 and 13 in Trilogue, policy makers must not ignore the important progress that has been made elsewhere in the Directive to ensure that copyright law in 2019 is fit for purpose and supports access to culture, research and education. In the case that no agreement can be reached on these controversial articles, we urge the Council, Parliament and the European Commission to let the rest of the Directive progress to adoption unhindered.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>ICOM - the International Council of Museums - is looking for proposals for a new definition of 'museum'.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This month on Europeana Pro, we've got growth mindsets on our minds. That is, a focus on how we learn, how we improve, how we use change to progress for the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that's something that chimes with a recent call from ICOM - the International Council of Museums - who have recognised that the world is changing, that museums are changing, and that to go with that, how we describe them should change too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is a 'museum'?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ICOM's current definition of a 'museum' is 'a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Time to think again</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The organisation is now asking its members, committees, partners and other interested stakeholders to participate in developing a new definition, saying that, 'The current definition, which has only seen minor adjustments over the past few decades, does not reflect and express adequately the complexities of the 21stcentury and the current responsibilities and commitments of museums, nor their challenges and visions for the future.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new\_museum definition will be discussed at the 25th\_ICOM General Conference, which will take place in Kyoto, 1-7 September 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A global response</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, 56 proposals have been made. You can view them all on <a href=\"https://icom.museum/en/news/the-museum-definition-the-backbone-of-icom/\">ICOM's website</a>. The responses are truly global with many from Europe, but also the United States, Canada, Uganda, China, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, New Zealand, Ecuador, Mozambique, the Philippines, Yemen and Iran.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How much is digital?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, when we talk about Europeana, we're talking about digital, and a lot of the time, we're talking about museums. So, does Europeana Collections fit any of the proposed new definitions of a museum? Of the 56 proposals to date,\_only three include the word 'digital', while only six reference 'technology' or 'technologies'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much of your institution's identity is created in the digital realm? And should a new definition of museum be able to represent an online-only experience, or must it always relate to bricks and mortar (or steel and concrete)?\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See the proposals so far and submit your own on <a href=\"https://icom.museum/en/news/the-museum-definition-the-backbone-of-icom/\">ICOM's website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

It is an initiative for girls aged seven through 13 years&nbsp;that teaches girls technology on their terms, using female tech role models. Basically, we don’t teach technology. We help the girls enhance their existing interests with appropriate technology in an all-female environment, and it works wonders!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also a self-taught tech geek with a little too much creative thinking and a desire to change the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<div><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"365\" margin:0=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kme8xM-OndQ\" width=\"870\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment I am balancing three crucial topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Helping girls attain technological interest by using their own interests and volunteer female role models. This is a task performed in the DigiPippi organisation, with the help of a board and 60+ female volunteers and we’re preparing to start up clubs for the first time! Very exciting.</li>\r\n    <li>Advocating and educating about female equality and importance in tech by giving talks, acting as a consultant and writing about it. I’m writing a small book about how gender equality as we are seeing today came to be historically and, how we can make changes. It’s based on the work I’ve done over the past nine&nbsp;years to help bridge the gender gap, and I’m looking forward to sharing it in 2019.</li>\r\n    <li>&nbsp;Educating children in general, as well as their parents, teachers and business leaders how to live their best life with technology. I call it digital upbringing.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All these tasks are in my educated opinion part of the whole, that will help us reach a better future. I work towards awareness and creation as opposed to oblivion and consumerism.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to say circumstances but I’m not sure that describes it. I was introduced to computers in 1990 and it was love at first sight. I had an uncle that worked in tech and he kept providing my mother, brother and I with computers, and I looked up to him. The only problem was that no-one saw me and my interest, so nobody guided me in a technical direction. I did it all on my own, being ‘the girl’ with the males until I was in my mid-20s. I tried to get a tech education but failed to find a residency, so I just lost hope and left, continuing to be the ‘tech girl’ and feeling so alone in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I met other women who understood me, it was such a relief, and for once I wasn’t the odd duck. I was just me. After an accident, I was helped by the government to pay for an education and became the least tech thing possible - a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_of_the_Waldorf_schools\">Waldorf/Steiner pedagogue</a>. To me, the mix made perfect sense, and in the period from 2009 to 2015 I worked my mix of tech and Waldorf in public schools. It was here I found that nothing had changed in 20 years. Girls still weren’t perceived as tech-savvy and there were no female role models for them. So then I got stubborn and worked to change that. After initial tests between 2013 and 2015, I founded DigiPippi with the help of the incubator program through <a href=\"http://denmark.reachforchange.org/da/\">Reach for Change</a>&nbsp;Denmark. I thought I was just going to make workshops for girls but ended up starting a system change. And that’s the change I’m advocating worldwide, leading by example instead of just talk. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the challenges for women in the workforce today (in general or in your sector)? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The perception of women and tech is that they are not a match. The unconscious biases we encounter from society, media and our own upbringing have taught us that tech is for males. Specifically, an unwashed, cola and chips-consuming male, sitting alone in a dark room with a computer. The lack of visible female role models is staggering, and the cultures in both the educational system and businesses help to keep the biases alive. We have been taught technology for the sake of technology, being fascinated by the thing rather than the reasons for its creation - the tasks it can perform to make life better. Too many products are designed to fit men but then exclude women. Too few women apply for education or jobs because they doubt themselves and their abilities, even though females are very capable and continue to be better educated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solutions are not easy and it will take a long time to really make a difference. It is, however, possible, and that’s where the work we do at DigiPippi really matters. Role models are key. Especially same-gender role models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the young girls, it’s all about showing them - not telling them - that they are good enough and that they can change their world as well as help others using technology. Also giving them access to heroes, that show them these exact things in the media and in schools.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>For the young women, it’s about cultivating the reasons why they should have an interest in technology and making sure, that the educational system is ready to let them learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Female professors and gender diverse classes really help, as well as making real-life applications instead of theoretic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For the women, they need to know that they are role models for the younger generation and they need to meet female mentors/role models that can help them. Companies need to have inclusive work environments and in many cases encourage women to apply for better positions in the workplace. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, if females are supported in not being perfect, not being ‘nice’ and are provided with an environment to belong to and thrive in, we are doing the best we can at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately not. The statistics I keep reading are very clear: women seldom advance above middle management and getting them there is in itself not easy. It seems that a mix of women not putting themselves forward, men hiring other men, females abilities being undermined and downplayed, too few female leaders and unfavourable work environments for women who have families are some of the main problem areas. Having talked with women in upper-level management, the stories they tell me support this. We have a work culture that still favours men with late night meetings, golf meetings and so forth. It’s natural to like the company of people similar to yourself, but it works against diversity and progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, some women who have reached upper-level management hold on to their positions for dear life, as they are now ‘the woman’ (the only woman) with not much possibility of other women advancing without costing ‘the woman’ her job.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Believe in your own skills and strengths. Accept that you are flawed because that is the human way. And just do stuff! Yes, it will most likely freak you out to cross your comfort zone but fear shouldn’t stop you. Fear doesn't go away, so it's important to make it a driving force and not a hindrance. I’m scared every time I do something new. I doubt myself way too much. I also keep going despite - or maybe because - of this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find others to lean on and don’t fear the sisterhood that clubs and organisations can provide. Find and embrace them.<br />\r\nIt’s never about pushing aside men or taking over. It’s about gaining equality, and that requires a level playing field, which we still haven’t achieved. But we can each contribute to the change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each person is a potential role model for someone else, so if you don’t do it for yourself, do it for others. But just do stuff.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am fortunate enough to have created my own network inside of DigiPippi, where I find my daily strength and support. I’m a part of Women in Tech, both locally and internationally, as well as being part of a group of tech women that all work for the same cause as I. Also, I've just been accepted into an exclusive network called BRIDGIT formed by the global Reach for Change organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right now my role models are Michelle Obama, Anja Monrad of DELL EMC and Melinda Gates. These women are what I aspire to be in kindness, power and generosity, and I hope someday to get to meet them all and tell them about my work. I’m fortunate enough to know Anja already.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Otherwise, my continued inspiration is the girls. I don’t think I have the words to describe what it feels like to see a girl come out of her shell, eyes glimmering, and see her embrace her own power. It happens at every workshop we’ve ever had, and that’s what keeps me going. Changing just one girl's self-esteem - that’s enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a>&nbsp;</em>which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

        title: '3 ways to be an activist on International Women''s Day'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Want to get involved and show your support for gender parity this International Women’s Day? We’ve listed three\_key ways to get involved. So whether you are a woman in the sector or an ally - find out how you and/or your organisation can advocate for women in culture and technology (all year round, but especially this March).</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>As a pan-European initiative, it has been really interesting gathering the insights and perspectives of professional women across the European culture and technology sectors. Some have felt a little discomfort speaking about advocacy for women because of the strong rights and opportunities for women in their country - while others have expressed frustration at the ongoing gender inequality they experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While these perspectives are diverse - statistically speaking - gender parity in the EU is still a work in progress.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, according to the various reports, certain areas are actually moving backwards.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society - a long-time advocate for gender parity in tech and leadership position - reports that that the gender gap in the digital sector is growing. According to the 2018 study on <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/increase-gender-gap-digital-sector-study-women-digital-age\">Women in the Digital Age</a>, men in digital jobs outnumber women one to four, with a 'decrease in women taking up ICT related to higher education when compared to 2011'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commissioner Gabriel will explore these issues in her feature profile for the<em> </em><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/tags/women\"><em>Women in culture and tech</em></a> series Monday 11 March.\_</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the\_<a href=\"https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/950dce57-6222-11e8-ab9c-01aa75ed71a1\">2018 Report on equality between women and men in the EU</a>\_reports the\_prominent decrease of European women in leadership positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, Vĕra Jourová says, “In some countries, the political and economic participation of women is moving backwards. An abundance of data and statistics show that women, who make up half of our population, are under-represented in decision-making positions in politics and in business and still earn on average 16% less than men across the European Union.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, with this in mind, we have compiled a list of ways you can get involved and advocate for gender parity in your country, in your sector, and in Europe today.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1.

        title: 'Europe is one step closer to better copyright rules for cultural heritage institutions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On Wednesday, negotiators from the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20190212IPR26152/agreement-reached-on-digital-copyright-rules\">reached an agreement</a> on a final compromise text for the European Union’s Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The final text for the proposed directive that has been under discussion for almost 30 months includes a number of significant improvements for cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with our partners from the Europeana Network Association and library and research organisations, we have managed to achieve many of the goals that had been included in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">Europeana's advocacy mandate, adopted in December 2016</a>. The final compromise text adopted by the negotiators on Wednesday improves upon the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52016PC0593\">Commission's original proposal</a> in a number of areas. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Articles 3 and 3a introduce copyright exceptions for text and data mining. As a result of our efforts, cultural heritage institutions have been included as beneficiaries of Article 3, thereby ensuring that researchers, cultural heritage institutions and their users can gain new insights into their collections through text and data mining.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Article 5 introduces a Europe-wide exception that will allow digital preservation of in-copyright works.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Articles 7-9 create mechanisms that allow cultural heritage institutions to make out-of-commerce works contained in their collections available online. As a result of our efforts, these articles have been strengthened by adding a fall-back exception for situations in which there are no collective management organisations that are able to issue licences.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>A new Article 9a grants individual Member States the ability to introduce domestic Extended Collective Licensing schemes to further facilitate mass-digitisation by cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>A new Article 10b ensures that digital reproductions of public domain artworks will be available for the public to use and reuse. This article will translate one of the core elements of our 2010 <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter</a> into EU law.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>Taken together, these articles represent a massive step forward towards a European copyright framework that promotes access to culture, research and education. They will help cultural heritage institutions across the EU to improve access to works in their collections and work towards closing\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-missing-decades-the-20th-century-black-hole-in-europeana\">the 20th-century black hole</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The final hurdles</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Wednesday's compromise will now need to be formally approved by the EU Member States and the European Parliament. Adoption by the Member States is expected to take place within the next three weeks. The European Parliament is expected to vote on the final text between late March and mid-April. This last vote is considered to be crucial since there is considerable opposition to other parts of the directive among Members of Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the run-up to the vote, we urge all MEPs to acknowledge the massive improvements Articles 3, 5, 7-9 deliver in enabling Europe’s cultural heritage institutions to digitise and share their collections online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note: On behalf of the Europeana Network Association, the Europeana Foundation represents the view of cultural heritage institutions in the debates around the EU copyright reform. Read the full <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">consensus-driven mandate</a>. The mandate was approved with a clear majority of the Europeana Network Association Members Council, with a small number of organisations recording their dissent (which are clearly recorded in the mandate).</em></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>From Siobhan...&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m a New Zealander and a digital volunteer for a variety of museums, libraries, humanity and citizen science projects. I am also an active Wikimedian, writing articles and editing English Wikipedia, contributing to Wikimedia Commons and curating data in Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m currently working on a variety of projects. I’m volunteering for the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) researching and linking data on women scientific illustrators whose work is found in BHL. I’ve been submitting suggestions to the BHL social media manager for her to highlight during the celebrations for International Women’s Day. I’ve also been ensuring the women have at least a Wikidata item and have been adding metadata about them to Wikidata. I’ve been tagging their illustrations in Flickr and adding or linking the same in Wikimedia Commons. This is all in anticipation of a Wikipedia article being created or expanded for these illustrators bringing them to the attention of a wider public. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve also been continuing with my project to ensure all New Zealand endemic moths have a Wikipedia article. This is a large project as there are over 1800 moths endemic moths and I keep getting distracted by their host plants, localities, collectors and describers. So much information to add to Wikipedia, Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons and so little time! While working on this project I’ve been linking to citizen science observations such as those in iNaturalist as well as specimens held in Museum collections. If the observer or Museum has used an open creative commons license for their images I’ll also add the images to Wikimedia Commons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m also busy participating in various Wikiblitzs and Wiki meetups attempting to encourage others to get involved in whatever Wikimedia project suits their interest. I’m keen to help others get as much enjoyment as I do in doing this work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you get into this field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started by volunteering with the Smithsonian Transcription Center transcribing handwritten field books and diaries into machine-readable and searchable text. The project manager of the Transcription Center encouraged me to get involved in editing Wikipedia and I haven’t looked back since. The Smithsonian Institute is also a founding member of the Biodiversity Heritage Library and it was while transcribing for the Transcription Center that I learned of BHL’s existence and the ways in which I could contribute.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the challenges for women in the workforce (or in general) today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think that one of the challenges I particularly notice is a historic or implicit bias that, although not immediately obvious, can affect current attitudes towards women. The Wikimedia Foundation is putting a lot of effort into attempting to both mitigate the historic bias of its content and to improve the numbers of women editors. &nbsp;By encouraging editors such as myself to pay more attention to the accomplishments of women I hope that any bias within Wikipedia articles will gradually be reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In some areas yes, in other areas no. For example in New Zealand, we have the top three positions in a government filled by women. However, I do believe there are still significant improvements that need to be made to ensure women feel and are able to be present in leadership positions.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my experience, I’ve found that if I’m in doubt whether I should take up a challenge I should ignore any 'imposter syndrome' response I might feel and just say yes. Every time I’ve done this I’ve come away thrilled with the result and have been so pleased to have stepped outside my 'comfort zone'. I would also recommend taking the opportunity to reach out and make personal contact with folk you think are kindred spirits. Enthusiasm is contagious and I get so inspired when I meet people with similar interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Twitter. I love Twitter as I find it exposes me to interesting institutions, articles, science, and people I would normally never meet. I find it far more generous, accepting and encouraging than many other social media platforms I’ve been on. However, I put effort into making it my happy place. I use the block and mute function and I regularly curate the list of folk I follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m inspired by my sister Victoria who is the rights manager at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa. She was the one who originally recommended I try volunteering for the Smithsonian Transcription Center and started me on this journey. Without her and her support, I doubt I would have developed this all-consuming passion for digital volunteering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;exhibition<em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a></em>&nbsp;which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

        title: 'Children’s migration stories: How a school brought Europeana Migration alive in the classroom.'
        posttype: Publication
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>During the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, Europeana worked with cultural heritage institutions and citizens across Europe to share migration stories and objects on Europeana Migration. These stories are part of Europe’s rich and shared history of migration, and help to tell the story of Europe and the people who live here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the project, we worked with a leading international school, <a href=\"https://www.britishschool.nl/\">The British School in The Netherlands</a>. Using one of the central themes, 'every object tells a story', as a unit of work in the Autumn term of 2018, more than 50 year 4 students worked with their families and teachers to choose an object to signify their (or their families’) migration stories. They each then wrote their story and digitised their object which was then uploaded to Europeana to sit alongside the stories shared with the migration campaign, as well as some 50 million digital cultural heritage objects. Their stories and personal objects are now part of Europe’s cultural heritage and available for reference and use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case study we hear from Kimberley Harris, a teacher at The British School in The Netherlands about the steps they took, and the things they learned and achieved helping to contribute to the Europeana Migration campaign and its objectives.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><em><strong>Why did you undertake this project?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to pursue this project for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was a very exciting opportunity for the children to have their work published online on a website which was not linked to the BSN. Usually, the children write in their English books and this can then be shared within and across our school, but it can be challenging to find opportunities to share writing beyond our school context. This can make it difficult for the children to imagine an audience or to truly understand the purpose of writing, or, indeed, to relate the writing they are doing to the ways that we use writing every day in our jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, as an international school, we are fortunate to have students from a vast range of countries on roll, and each child’s story is unique and fascinating. For example, it is not uncommon for children in our context to have a nationality without ever having lived in that country. Sharing and celebrating these differences - and also noting the similarities - is key to developing the idea that we are all ‘global citizens’ and, as such, have a responsibility to all others, regardless of their country of origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, we felt it would provide us with an excellent opportunity to learn a little more about our students, their heritage and even their own perceptions of their identities. These conversations are key, and yet school days are often so busy, it can be difficult to make time for them! This is important for a variety of reasons, including building self-esteem and forming strong relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>How did you approach the project?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to complete this project at the start of the school year, to use it as an opportunity to baseline asses the writing of our students to inform our planning, and to get to know them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We began the project on our ‘transition morning’, before the summer break, when the children visit their new class teachers. We teachers had each written our very own migration story linked to an object, which we shared with the children. We set a ‘summer holiday homework’ to discuss with their families their migration stories, and to choose an object that links to their migration. They would be required to bring this object (or a photo of it, if it was valuable, fragile or a living thing!) into school in the first week of term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In September, when the children arrived, we shared their objects and completed a few short writing tasks linked to those objects. This meant we could assess the children’s writing in terms of description, editing and redrafting. Finally, the children wrote their own stories linked to their objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The children then typed up these stories using word processing (which also gave us the opportunity to run through how and where to save their work, creating new documents, typing and basic word processing skills).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, we shared information about the project with parents at our parent open evening and via our digital ‘weekly bulletins’. Consent forms were sent home to parents following this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the children’s stories, photos of the objects and completed consent forms were shared with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What did the children gain from thinking about and writing about their migration stories?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The children enjoyed the opportunity to share their own personal objects and to talk about their ‘home’ countries. Some of the children had not previously considered themselves as migrants (especially those who were born here) and many of them had not previously known why they had moved here or, in some cases, when they moved here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also very exciting for them to see their writing on a website. They were eager to share this with their friends and family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What did the teachers / school gain from this project?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was useful to gain an insight into some of the family stories our children shared, and formed a lovely basis for beginning to bond with our classes at the start of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the project as an assessment tool helped to inform our planning. For example, we noted that few children were writing in paragraphs and identified this as an early teaching point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What worked and why?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning writing tasks around the objects really motivated the children - they like writing about themselves! They were engaged and excited by the project. The parents were also very supportive. They were also pleased to see their children’s writing on an external website, and enjoyed the opportunity to discuss their family’s roots and heritage in more detail with their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What lessons would you share with other teachers?</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there were many advantages to completing this at the start of the school year, such as the early assessment of writing and creating early bonds with the children, there were also some disadvantages. Mostly, this impacted the quality of their writing. Many children do not write over the summer break, and we usually expect to see a slight dip in attainment at the start of a new academic year. If this project had been undertaken later in the year, the quantity and quality of the writing would have been greater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, some of the children and their parents misinterpreted the project, and so some children simply brought in objects they had bought on holidays rather than objects that related to their migration. We perhaps should have been more explicit in our explanations, and, when dealing with children so young, perhaps the parents would have benefitted from seeing our modelled examples too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Recommendations for the future</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project would work especially well for any topics which are linked to identities. It could be used as a springboard into wider discussions about migration across all areas of the curriculum: PSHE, global citizenship, sociology, politics, philosophy. It could also be used in geography projects - any map work, identifying countries/continents, looking at human geography, trade etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could also be a great project for children in leadership roles, such as school councillors or international ambassadors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are incredibly fortunate to have such a rich and varied student experience, and it is both important and rewarding to have a context to share and celebrate this in schools. It helps to foster empathy to others by indicating similarities between the children and their peers which may not have been evident before and gave them a fantastic opportunity to learn more about migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“<em>It is wonderful for our young writers to have an opportunity to write for a genuine purpose, and to see their work published. \_The topic of migration is threaded through much of our curriculum work here at The BSN, and this project has enabled the children to consider migration from a very personal perspective.</em>” Chris Bailey, Deputy Headteacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the stories contributed by the children of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=proxy_dcterms_isPartOf%3A%22The%20British%20School%20in%20The%20Netherlands%2C%202018-09-01%E2%80%932018-09-30%22&amp;view=grid\">The British School of The Netherlands</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If are interested in running a similar module of work, we hope to publish a learning scenario in Spring 2019, or <a href=\"mailto:isabel.crespo@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit the collection and share your story at <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">Europeana Migration</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I started creating Wikipedia articles in 2007, the first being, <em>Book League of America</em>, a defunct US publisher whose books I collect; I’m a bibliophile. In the following years, I was quite eclectic in terms of topic areas, writing articles&nbsp;ranging<span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:#222222\">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>from anthroponomy to geographical features and historical buildings. Since 2014, my focus has shifted to women’s biographies, primarily women writers and their works. In that year, I created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_writers\">WikiProject Women Writers</a>, which focuses on women writers’ biographies, works written by women, and the organisations they have founded, such as newspapers, and so forth. We now have approximately 38,000 articles within our scope. I not only write the articles but support this editing community with business strategies regarding branding, categories, and so forth. Since 2017, I have been the Visiting Scholar at Northeastern University’s Women Writers Project. In this role, I have created 311 new Wikipedia articles (women writer biographies or articles about their works) and have improved an additional 129 articles. I’ve added 785,000 words to these articles through 10,400 edits, which have been viewed 1,030,000 times. In addition, I’ve uploaded 1,705 images to WikiCommons, the Wikimedia Foundation’s online repository of free-use images, sounds, and other media files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m also working on the challenge of categorising the images which Women in Red participants have uploaded since our project was established in 2015. While we know which images were added to WikiCommons, until February 2019, they were not categorised or branded as being associated with Women in Red. Developing the branding strategy, structuring the online categories, and then ultimately tagging every image our folks have uploaded is time-consuming, but I’ve always taken the long-view with all things Wiki-related, and I can see the value of doing this now versus in 50 years time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My team and I at WikiProject Women in Red rely on structured data and AI in areas ranging from lists of missing notable women to editor recruitment, and article assessment. Between July 2015, when Women in Red was founded, and December 2018, 92,000 new women’s biographies have been created on English Wikipedia by editors from around the world. Our editing community is online and gender-neutral; everyone is welcome. In addition to English Wikipedia, our community extends to 20 other language versions. As a community organiser, I focus on national and international strategies within the Wikimedia movement. For example, in 2017, I interviewed 65 gender diversity leaders for the Gender Diversity Mapping initiative, the first-ever coordinated by the Wikimedia Foundation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I speak about Wikipedia, Wikidata, and WikiCommons at large and small events, as my sons have told me, ‘You can’t write all the articles yourself, Mom; you have to inspire others.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nf2DLsJkrWo\" width=\"870\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>In my undergraduate years, I wanted to be a Cultural Anthropologist but my father thought that wasn’t practical. He thought I would get married and raise children and that I might want to work part-time, so a more practical education in accounting or pharmacy would better suit me. After getting a Bachelor’s in management and an MBA, I worked in the healthcare industry for three decades. But that didn’t dampen my desire to do research about societies and cultures different from my own. Through Wikipedia, I could be that cultural anthropologist. Wikipedia’s main page has a section called ‘Did You Know?’ which features newly-written articles. Three months after I started writing Wikipedia articles, I got a notice that the article I created regarding the Kallawaya people of the Andes had been included in the ‘Did You Know’ section. I was so flattered and felt so honoured that something I wrote was noticed and included on English Wikipedia’s main page. It is, after all, the fifth most viewed website according to Alexa. This spurred me on to write more articles. When the 1,000 articles that I had worked on was added to the ‘Did You Know’ section, I wrote this comment to accompany it:&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<address>Some of you know that I am a cultural anthropologist at heart. I wanted to follow in the footsteps of Margaret Mead and study cultural anthropology at Barnard (my mom's alma mater) as Margaret did. I wanted to travel to Papua New Guinea and do research on its people as Margaret did. But my dad said 'no' to majoring in anthropology - he wanted something more practical for my university studies. So now, years later, I get to live the life of an armchair cultural anthropologist, writing articles about Goaribari Island and its cannibals. To all the girls out there with impractical dreams, this article is dedicated to you.</address>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the challenges for women in the workforce today (in general or in your sector)?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Wikimedia Foundation’s 2018 editor survey, only 9% of Wikipedia’s editors are women. Collier and Bear (2012) described various factors for this, including&nbsp;high levels of conflict in discussions, dislike of critical environments, and the lack of confidence in editing other contributors' work. Adrianne Wadewitz (2013) dispelled various assumptions facing women editors such as it’s the responsibility of women to fix sexism on Wikipedia, saying that Wikipedia’s systemic sexism lessens its legitimacy as a producer and organiser of knowledge; therefore, it is the responsibility of every Wikipedian to combat that sexism. The 2017&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2018/09/21/advancing-gender-equity-conversations-with-movement-leaders/\" target=\"_blank\">Gender Diversity Mapping project</a>&nbsp;led to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gender_equity_report_2018\" target=\"_blank\">2018 Gender Equity Report</a>. It indicates that the top three challenges to improve the representation and contribution of women on Wikipedia are (a) systemic bias in policies (Notability, Reliable Sources, Categories), (b) lack of awareness (such as an implicit bias in which a patriarchal perspective is unconsciously privileged as normal while alternative perspectives are misinterpreted, dismissed, minimised or even outright denied), and ( c) poor community health (harassment, lack of support, lack of diversity).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Several practices have been identified to improve the matter of representation (‘content gender gap’) and participation (‘editor gender gap’) on Wikipedia. These include host off-Wiki events; focus on content creation and intersectional knowledge; track progress but not only in terms of ‘metrics’ (number of articles created, number of editors) but also in terms of being transformative; recruit new participants, and cultivate partnerships. At Women in Red, we rely on social media to engage with the public. We not only tweet about the articles that have been written, but we inform about the percentage of women’s biographies versus. men’s (17.78% as of February 11, 2019). We also tweet about the challenges we face such as Donna Strickland’s Wikipedia article initially being deleted and only restored only after she won the Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No, most women do not feel either empowered enough or present in leadership positions. Of course, there are exceptions. For several years, I was involved in talent acquisition (recruitment) For example, studies show that men are more likely to apply for promotions when they only meet some of the requirements, but this is not so true for women.&nbsp;In the international Wikimedia movement, almost all countries represented have a majority-male board of directors. There are 301 languages Wikipedias, and those that have Administrators, have a male majority. I think ‘imposter syndrome’ is more common than we know among potential women leaders, and with this in mind, our strategies for recruiting women leaders within the Wikimedia movement should be different than how we encourage or empower men.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be bold and align yourself with a mentor.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been lucky in my academic and professional life to have had strong women leaders help me along the way. Seek them out if they aren’t readily available, and be honest with your aspirations. Know thyself, and don’t be afraid to pivot if you are curious to learn about or move in a different direction. Hopefully, it's a long life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mostly, I belong to small, digital communities, where each of us feels free to speak without censoring ourselves. It’s all about trust. I live in a small, rural town in northern California’s Sierra Nevada foothills, a half mile down a gravel road. While I have a supportive family and good friends, being a member of these digital communities supports my wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am so inspired by women suffragists and other women of that day or were able to develop platforms, coordinate international conferences, and ‘make things happen’ in a pre-digital world. I know how hard it is to be a force for change today, for example in women’s marches, so I am voracious in wanting to learn more about who these women were and how they accomplished what they did. In 2015, I wrote the Wikipedia article about the ‘Pan-American Conference of Women’ and I still think about one of its organisers, Bertha Lutz, a Brazilian zoologist, politician, and diplomat, who was a leading figure in feminist and human rights movements. More recently, in January 2019, I wrote the article about Katherine Stewart MacPhail of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service, a volunteer doctor in war-torn Serbia, where she founded the first children's hospital. Last, but not least, I am inspired by my maternal grandmother, Paulina Lebl-Albala, who was a co-founder and the first president of the Yugoslav Association of University Women. Though she is long-dead, sometimes I think she’s the only person who could truly understand why I do what I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a>&nbsp;</em>which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

        title: 'Introducing Europeana Network Association’s 2019-2021 Management Board'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>It is with great pride and immense pleasure that we can present to you the new Management Board of the Europeana Network Association (alphabetically): <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-georgia-angelaki\" target=\"_blank\">Georgia Angelaki</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/stephan-bartholmei\" target=\"_blank\">Stephan Bartholmei</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-sara-di-giorgio\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Di Giorgio</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-marco-de-niet\" target=\"_blank\">Marco de Niet</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-members-council-fred-truyen\" target=\"_blank\">Frederik Truyen</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/erwin-verbruggen\" target=\"_blank\">Erwin Verbruggen</a>. As the new Chair, Marco will explain how the \_Management Board will operate and also highlight the Board’s aspirations and vision for the Europeana Network Association in the next two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>First, let me thank all who voted on behalf of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\" target=\"_blank\">six new Board Members</a> for the trust placed in us to manage and lead the Europeana Network Association (ENA) over the next two years. We value the opportunity to be elected on this Board and we are proud to represent over 2300 members and their interests. On 20 February 2019, we met in Leiden for the first time as the new Board. During this meeting, I was appointed as Chair, and as such I will manage the Board, channel all the voices that can be heard in the ENA, and Chair the meetings of the Board, Members Council, and the General Assembly. Georgia will be an invaluable sparring partner for me, as she was appointed as Vice-Chair, and she will replace me where needed. At the same meeting, Fred was appointed as Treasurer to oversee the ENA budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All six of us have been years-long enthusiastic ambassadors of Europeana and the ENA, and we are highly motivated to lead the development of its strategic vision, while also representing it on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/our-mission/foundation-governing-board\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Foundation Governing Board</a>. We work together to oversee the ENA governance, to set the procedures, annual policy, budget and delivery of formal reports. We accept new members to the ENA and provide guidance to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">ENA Communities</a>, their Task Forces and Working Groups, and formally approve and evaluate their work progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Our aspirations and approach</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We see Europeana and ENA as a wonderful vehicle to put our professional values and beliefs into practice. We aim to engage our members in a positive-minded community and make them feel proud of being a part of ENA - an influential community and ever-increasing movement of thousands of people in Europe and beyond to promote digital culture and digital cultural heritage as powerful agents in an ever-changing world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our first meeting, we already briefly discussed the strategic direction for ENA over the next two years. The ENA has shown great potential in its European-level cross-domain composition, thought-leadership and innovation capacity particularly in the case of EuropeanaTech, Copyright and Impact community activities. We are also enthusiastic and foresee a lot of opportunities in the field of research, education, and communications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to build on these strengths and increase inclusiveness and engagement of our members, strengthen the communities, and embed more projects in the ENA. Together with the Europeana Foundation and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/breathing-new-life-into-the-europeana-aggregators-forum\" target=\"_blank\">Aggregator Forum</a>, we will work towards the \_overall strengthening of the Europeana initiative. At the upcoming Members Council meeting from 5-6 March in The Hague (the first of 2019), where we will welcome 19 new Councillors, we will discuss the best ways to do so and also what our concrete next steps should be to achieve these goals. You will hear more about this in upcoming posts here on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/blog\" target=\"_blank\">Pro News</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thanking our predecessors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, I would like to thank <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/merete-sanderhoff\" target=\"_blank\">Merete Sanderhoff</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/max-kaiser\" target=\"_blank\">Max Kaiser</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/joke-van-der-leeuw-roord\" target=\"_blank\">Joke van der Leeuw-Roord</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/paul-keller\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Keller</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/johan-oomen\" target=\"_blank\">Johan Oomen</a>, and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/uldis-zarins\" target=\"_blank\">Uldis Zariņš</a> as our former Board members, who joined us in the meeting in Leiden to share their impressions, lessons learned and advice based on four years of experience on the Board. They did an outstanding job and made an extraordinary effort to kickstart the ENA and manage its growth to where we are today. They also laid the foundations for the six ENA communities and it is because of their commitment and hard work that \_we can now focus on the further development of these communities, which are at the heart of ENA. As they will remain involved with Europeana in one way or the other, we are all able to keep on benefiting from their expertise. We very much look forward to that!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Can you tell me about Wiki Loves Women?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isla and Florence: </strong>On the surface, Wiki Loves Women is a content creation and aggregation project that is and has been operating in six countries in East and West Africa (and beyond). At its heart, the project is a way of developing the skills and capacity of the local volunteer groups whilst working on several acknowledged gaps in both content and participation: subjects relating to and relevant for women from Africa; and contribution from Wikipedians across Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From a content point of view, only 0.318% of all biographical entries on Wikidata (the data repository for the Wikimedia projects) are about African women. On Wikipedia, of all biographies about African people, only 17.9% are about women. With regards to contributions&nbsp;- less than 20% of (all) Wikipedia contributors are female (the global community has long-acknowledged the gender gap as a problem). But in sub-Saharan Africa, when combined with the contributor gap - ‘only 25% of edits to subjects about the Sub-Saharan region come from within the region’. This lack of information about women online across the continent is also reflected in the mainstream media. Wiki Loves Women works to draw attention to this societal imbalance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Wiki Loves Women project encourages the contribution of content (articles, images, data) that celebrates women of excellence, highlights issues, and reflects the daily realities faced by women and girls across Africa. The teams of Wikipedians in the six countries (Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda) work with civil society and gender equality organisations to contribute freely-licensed information, texts, images and media to Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did you get into your current field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florence:</strong> 20 years ago, I loved playing a video game called Alpha Centauri. And I was sometimes going online to read game tips on discussion forums (they were not so numerous online back in 2000ies). Whilst chatting with another English-speaking Canadian player, he introduced me to the very newborn Wikipedia,(less than a year old back then) and obviously totally unknown. It took me over a month to dare do my first edit. Then I fell into it and never got out. Initially, &nbsp;completely volunteer-based and anonymous, I soon joined or launched non-profits related to that field, and I later came to see it as my main professional activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Isla: </strong>My academic training was in the fine arts, but since University (too many years ago to still seem relevant) the core of my work has been finding ways to use communication, the arts and written content to shift the negative perceptions of Africa globally, as well as challenging our self-defeating perceptions from within the continent. Being introduced to WikiAfrica in 2011 by Iolanda Pensa seemed to be a culmination of all the work I had been doing previously. I love the work we do. It is important and has become a guiding element in a definite shift in perception both on the continent and globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isla: </strong>My experience is based on the African continent and varies from country to country and industry to industry. In my experience, although an amazing amount of progress has been made with regards to equal opportunities for women in the workforce across Africa, and despite the not-perfect positive discrimination efforts in southern Africa, there remains a definite paternalistic, male-oriented focus across all industries. It is a mindset that is very insidious and difficult to shake.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florence:</strong> Very vast topic. I believe that the first challenge women meet is the amount of free labour they provide, most often in the area of care (of the child, of the sick, of the one with disabilities, of the elder, of the poor…). They develop unrecognised, non-compensated expertise that has huge value for the wider society, yet goes under the radar, not counted as work (or tagged ‘volunteer work’). In such cases, the women are not considered part of the workforce (even though the volunteer hours are sometimes counted as ‘in kind’ by organisations), not covered by laws meant to protect 'official' workers, and they do not get the usual benefits associated with a job position that would help them on the path of empowerment and self-sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"videoHolder\">\r\n<div class=\"play-btn-large\" style=\"left: 50%; top: 50%; margin-left: -35px; margin-top: -27.5px;\" title=\"Play clip\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures\">link</a> exemplifies this point. For example, it states that: ‘Women bear disproportionate responsibility for unpaid care and domestic work with women spending around 2.5 times more time on unpaid care and domestic work than men. And it is estimated that if women’s unpaid work were assigned a monetary value, it would constitute between 10 per cent and 39 per cent of GDP.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isla:</strong> In some ways, this pervasive maleness has fed into the mindsets kinds of people who are interested in working within the tech/content volunteer sector. It takes a special mix of people to work as volunteers within the Wikimedia movement. Initially, volunteer groups have been fairly male-dominated and led, but with the development and progress of Wiki Loves Women within the six countries we have seen a definite change in the gender balance and the notable empowerment of women within the groups as their confidence and skills grew. For example, the project within three of the first four countries was initially led by men, because there was a scarcity of women within their groups who had the skills and confidence to run such a demanding project. Now the groups are vastly different. Wiki Loves Women has been enormously positive in this aspect within the groups - shining a light on the issue, and providing the means and opportunities to empower women and gender-sensitised men within the groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florence: </strong>Unfortunately not, at least in my country (France). But there are huge variations depending on the activity sector. The Wikimedia community suffers from a gender gap not only in terms of content but also in terms of contributors since we estimate that less than 20% of participants to Wikipedia are women. There are several reasons given, some being external (women would have less free time to volunteer), some being internal to our movement (editing community considered by some to be overly sexist).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, in many countries, some of the participants created groups, incorporated or not, to support our movement, and we observe that many leaders of those organizations (volunteer Chairs or paid Executive Directors) are women. When it comes to the Wikimedia Foundation, the host organization of Wikipedia, women are clearly in leadership positions. There have been several women in the Chair of the Board position (I was myself the second Wikimedia Foundation Chair immediately after Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia) and except for a brief interim male director when the WMF was fairly young, all of the Executive Directors (three since the WMF creation in 2003) have been women. What’s the secret formula? I do not know.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isla and Florence</strong>: Successful women in Africa are often reticent about putting themselves forward; celebrating their achievements, or claiming their share of the spotlight. Further, they are neither supported by the media. There are many reasons for this, but they should remember that being in the spotlight helps to inspire the next generation of women across Africa … they are role models. And this is a responsibility that they should not ignore.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florence:</strong> I would love to belong to more networks than I currently do. My main current networks are Wikimedia networks, to a lesser extent social entrepreneurs networks, and open source local networks (for example, in Marseille AoïLibre bring together all regional open source organisations and movement) that foster a powerful and positive mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Isla: </strong>My networks are rather biased -&nbsp;Wikimedians and Creative Commoners across Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Florence: </strong>In 2018 I joined an existing French-speaking initiative, les sans pagEs, and created a sub-group in my region, called <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projet:Les_sans_pagEs/M%C3%A9diterran%C3%A9e\">les sans pagEs Méditerranée</a>, which aims to reduce the gender gap in the Mediterranean area. What I like about its approach is first that it tries to be very pragmatic and focus on production of content and second that it places gender diversity as a central element of its activities rather than ‘“women”’, and this allows a more nuanced approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Isla:</strong> I am particularly inspired by intrepid teachers, educators and gender activists across Africa, especially people like Nigeria’s Betty Abah (CC-Hope) and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1252342177&amp;ref=br_rs\">Runcie Chidebe</a> (Project Pink and Blue). I have also been working with Wendy Abrahams at the Sozo Foundation in Vrygrond, an after-school&nbsp;project with underprivileged children in Cape Town. These are the true heroes!</p>\r\n\r\n<section>\r\n<article>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a>&nbsp;</em>which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

        body: "<p>For International Women’s Day and throughout the month of March, Europeana Foundation is working with cultural heritage institutions and professionals across Europe to spotlight current and historical female innovators and leaders across the arts, sciences and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation commits to a number of initiatives in March 2019 - from an online exhibition to Twitter take-overs and a commitment to gender-balanced panels - to promote a broader, ongoing discussion on the representation and role of women in the digital and cultural sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said: ‘The stories of brilliant, determined and talented women must serve to inspire young girls and women all over Europe. Let the experiences of these female role models encourage the generations of women to come to continue to innovate, explore, create, push all the boundaries they might encounter, and finally, make their own contributions to a competitive, dynamic and inclusive digital Europe.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director General of Deutsche Nationalbibliothek and Chair of the Europeana Foundation Elisabeth Niggemann said: ‘Women have long been central to the important contribution that culture and technology make to our society, opening up access to knowledge, supporting research and promoting innovation and creativity.

        title: 'Women in culture and tech: Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>On 18 January, Europeana, in collaboration with <strong>Mariya Gabriel</strong>, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, opened the digital exhibition <em><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a> </em>in order to highlight the lives and achievements of historical European women. Now that Women’s History Month is coming to a close, we’re excited to hear from Commissioner Gabriel once more, as she shares her vision for women in today’s digital world.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>On women in digital...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our economy and society as a whole are impacted in depth by the digital transformation. Our mission, as policymakers, is to accompany this transition, so that it benefits all citizens, men and women alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women are underrepresented in the European digital sector. In fact, only 17% of the labour force in the digital and tech sectors is female.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a challenge to tackle, not only because women are not benefiting from the opportunities brought by the digitisation of our economy and society, but also because the ICT sector is deprived of their talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this sense, it is for me crucial that we take action to reverse the negative trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, as I see it, we must aim to construct an inclusive digital Europe; it is a matter of principles and values. As you know, the European Union has been built on a solid foundation of values and principles that we hold very much dear. One of those values is equality between men and women. Thus, as Europeans, we must make sure that the digital Europe we are constructing respects and defends our values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>This is what I call\_the human-centric approach to the digital transformation that puts citizens at the centre of our policies, our measures and our actions.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, in order to see results, I firmly believe that we need to engage and mobilise at all levels: European level, Member States, the private sector, universities, schools, parents, women and men. We need to engage in partnerships and permanent dialogue that will produce best-practices for sharing and efficient measures to overcome the digital divide between men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, we must equally create an impact in the short, medium and long term. I have applied this to the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/women-ict\"><em>Women in Digital strategy</em></a> launched in 2018. In it, you will see that we have tried to make a difference now, as much as to pave the way for future actions and future challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, since increasing the number of women in the digital and tech sectors also increases the promotion of role models and the visibility of female experts and their contributions, I launched the <em><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commissioners-support-no-women-no-panel-campaign\">No Women No Panel</a></em> European Campaign. Through it, I have committed to only attend public events where women are fairly and equally represented. Interestingly, when we explain to the organisers why I decline the invitation, only a few hours later, we receive a new programme with many more women experts. This immediate action means that female experts become visible, their points of view are heard and they become references in their field. Further, they become examples of the possible career paths for new generations to come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the more medium and long-term horizons, I have engaged in open, transparent and pragmatic dialogues with national Ministers and CEOs from the largest tech, digital, telecom and audiovisual companies. For example, through our recent Digital4Her initiative, tech CEOs have committed to improving the situations of their female employees, and also women in the sector in general. They have affirmed this commitment by signing the Digital4Her Declaration, which promotes innovation by creating an inclusive business ecosystem. (You can sign the declaration <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/gender-balance/commited-organisations\">here</a>). A similar declaration will be signed by the Member States at the Digital Day 3 on 9 April 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As you see, what we need to improve women’s participation and representation in the digital sector is the courage of our conviction and determination.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On female leadership...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Diversity in leadership positions should reflect the diversity of our societies. It is not only out of equality concerns, but also (and more importantly) with a view to delivering the best choices for their respective organisations that leaders ought to be diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the case of digital, studies have shown that tech companies built or run by women are more capital efficient, with higher revenues, and more likely to survive. So it seems that there is a clear case for women in digital! The industry needs their talent, and our economy needs their innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, still today we are confronted with the gap between men and women accessing management and senior management positions. Indeed, when talking about female digital leadership, we realise that the inequality is almost twice that found in the general labour force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2019 report on equality between women and men in the European Union shows that the percentage of women on European boards has risen from 11.9% in 2010 to 26.7% in 2018. There is progress, but it is too slow. This is even more relevant to the digital sector. Indeed, the IT sector shows the third-highest increase in female board members, 102% in 2018 but it is also the sector with the highest percentage of all-male boards, 18.2%. Also, the Telecommunications Services sector shows the highest percentage of women on boards,\_27.1%, which represents a 46% increase between 2011 and 2018. This is also the only sector where all companies have at least one woman on their boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, what data trends suggest is that inequality between men and women in leadership positions in the digital sphere is essentially a result of the persistence of strong unconscious biases about what is appropriate and the potential and contribution of women. Therefore, to address this situation, cultural change and initiatives at micro and macro levels can help develop female digital entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On the <em>Women in Digital</em> strategy…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The key features of the <em>Women in Digital</em> strategy concentrate\_on three objectives. First, to put women’s talents and contributions in the digital sector at the top of the European and national political agendas. Second, to promote digital skills and competencies among girls and women. And third, to encourage and support girls and women in their pursuit of digital careers and entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, in order to improve the situation of women in the digital sector, the first imperative is to fight stereotypes, something we can only do through the visibility of women in the digital sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indeed, I firmly believe in the approach ‘if you can see it, you can be it’. We need to promote role models and pioneer women. We need to show our girls that women before them have paved the way for them to thrive.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier I explained the <em>No women No Panel</em> campaign, but there are many other initiatives that contribute to this objective. For example, the online exhibition I launched with Europeana on <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneering</a> women in the arts and sciences. I have also supported the Women4Cyber programme as a patron. The programme aims to promote women experts and support them in their careers in the cyber security sector. Further, I have engaged with the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services (ERGA) and asked them to produce a report on the sexist stereotypes and images existing in the European audiovisual sector. In the coming weeks, I will be taking stock of the report’s findings and analysing the best practices applied in each Member State in order to make recommendations of solutions that bring change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have also gathered data through the Women in Digital Scoreboard that will be published together with the Digital Economy and Society Index in June 2019. With this data, Member States will be able to track progress and see where the problems remain in order to facilitate political and legislative actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerning the second objective of the <em>Women in Digital</em> strategy, we have a number of initiatives in place to stimulate girls and women to take up STEM and digital studies and careers. Initiatives include EUCode week, Digital Opportunity scheme, Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, to name some prominent examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a few months left in the present mandate and I am more motivated than ever to move forward quickly. However, I know I will not make it alone. That is why teaming up with partners, both public and private, is a sine qua non condition for success. I earlier mentioned the 26 signatory CEOs of the Digital4Her Declaration and of the actions with national ministers. However, we need to go further. We need to engage with the European Parliament and National Parliaments to raise awareness and call for action. We need to bring on board universities and educational institutions to analyse the best ways in which to take our education systems into the 21st century and ensure they promote digital skills among girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe in dialogue and pragmatism and we are certain that in order to create a truly inclusive Digital Europe, all stakeholders need to actively participate in bringing more equality to the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We must work in education, career choices and company policies to support women’s work life and the promotion of female digital leadership.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A message to European women…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, our modern societies face challenges, and we need empowered citizens to overcome them more than ever. Women shall step in to embrace the new roles, where they can add value, make a positive difference, and help the society move forward. The cultural, tech, digital and audiovisual sectors hold a special responsibility. Audiovisual professionals are developing stories that create dreams, aspirations, and shape our societies beyond national borders. Likewise, the cultural sector is the barometer for our common values; it tells us about societies and how they are formed. Culture and digital have the power to shed light on role models, whether real or even fictional, likely to inspire our fellow citizens and more specifically women, to embrace new roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In this same sense, we need to be clear on one thing, which is probably my main message to European women: digital is not a sector. Digital is not a thing. Digital is everything.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that in our minds, we need women to integrate digital and be the change and progress forces. Women need to engage in being the actors and makers of the inclusive Digital Europe we dream of constructing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Yes, I believe in women’s talent and leadership. Together, we can achieve a European digital future where women and men can equally thrive.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Did this interview profile inspire you? Leave you with something to say?

        title: 'Women in culture and tech: Nora Al-Badri, media artist and activist'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Today we hear from renowned media artist <strong>Nora Al-Badri</strong> on the emancipatory powers of technology. Further, she discusses the importance of intersectional feminism and the\_challenges of producing art in a global society that values culture - but where this doesn't necessarily translate financially to the artists (especially women).\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Very different things! Right now, I am in the early research phase for a new project which I will do at a technical research institution in Switzerland. It\_will apply machine intelligence in the context of heritage and memory for the people in Iraq. A country which is more than a 'death-world' and where hope and love are fragile plants that need to be groomed and protected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a media artist but believe it or not in the past two years I have never taken the time to build a portfolio website, which I have finally completed. Through this\_process, I learned that being bad at self-marketing is a trait many other women tend to have, while almost all men I knew have super shiny websites and are constantly filling their feeds with their successes. So now I also have my website, but I gotta say that to me, it is not a given to always or in any channel do that kind of noisy neoliberal self-promotion just because that is what one needs to do these days. I think our society can learn from women here: modesty and being strong and self-confident do get along very well and are just another way - a more sincere one, I believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\_How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s a long story, but to make it shorter, I am an autodidact in the field of media art. I studied political sciences because to study art seemed out of reach to someone who has to earn a living. Yet I sometimes meet other artists who are autodidacts and some of them are among the greatest we can see today. As for tech - I was lucky that my parents gave me access to computers early on and that I never felt that this was something odd to do for girls. Even today, I am fascinated by the means of technology and its emancipatory and decolonial potential, but I am completely aware that most technologies are inherently biased in man ways (forwards example, towards gender or race). This is what actively needs to be challenged and resisted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One challenge is the question of motherhood, parenting and care work in general which is not yet solved sufficiently on a policy level. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adding to the gender layer in the arts, there is a huge class divide. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a higher proportion of privileged women who enter the field and study art (to become artists) or art history (to become curators) than in other fields. So these women can also afford to have kids while working in underpaid jobs... But that’s not what we should aim for and that’s why I totally sympathise with the concept of a basic income (<em>Grundeinkommen</em>) to end that precarity. There was a study last year\_by the Professional Association of Visual Artists Berlin (bbk berlin) on visual artists in Berlin and the results were shocking for an outsider - neither not to me nor to my colleagues. There was a gender pay gap of 28%! And an average income per year of 11.600 EUR for men and 8.300 EUR for women. I don’t think that is acceptable if we live in a society which genuinely values art and culture (link to an <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/459020/rising-costs-and-an-inflated-gender-pay-gap-for-berlin-artists/\">article</a>\_and\_the full <a href=\"http://www.ifse.de/en/articles-and-studies/singleview/article/studio-berlin-iii-1.html\">study</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Not at all. In the media arts, just like in the whole tech sector, there are so many more men in leadership/decision-maker positions and that sucks and won’t change without an effort. But I know some amazing female tech leaders like Paula Peters from\_<a href=\"https://www.change.org/\" target=\"_blank\">change.org</a>\_or Laura Sophie Dornheim from\_<a href=\"https://eyeo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">eyeo</a>\_who actively advocate for more women in the broader tech field or in the media arts strong female curators like Kathy Rae Huffman.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Find other women who are on the same path, share experiences and be strong and loud together!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are quite a few online networks only for women in tech and art (so very specific). All of them will check who the person is who wants to join the community, so it is a safe space and very rewarding. Sometimes we also meet offline and hang out at openings or festivals. I think my favourite one is the\_<a href=\"https://www.faces-l.net/\">faces mailing list</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone who is politically engaged these days. People who do things and are actively trying to contribute positive impulses to our society and pursue our capacity of truth-making. \_For example, people I met from Sea-Watch who are rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean Sea and are promoting #safepassage. Or researchers and activists in the cultural field from the Global North and South who join forces and are fighting for justice in the field of restitution and who are speaking out against institutional racism in museums. Or artists and activists who are dealing with neo-Nazi movements such as the theatrical NSU monologues or the collective from Goldsmith College 'Forensic Architecture'. I could go on and on here…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But maybe one other remark at the end: I was lucky to be part in the early days of forming a new German party 'Demokratie in Bewegung' for the last elections and we made it to the lists. Now,\_this party is running for the European elections together with DiEM25 and Yannis Varoufakis, which is a blast! So yes, I think no matter what we do in tech and culture, there are many things to be done in the bigger (European) picture and women are already taking over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Want more?

        posttype: News

        intro: "<p>The Europeana Data Exchange Agreement (DEA) is the legal agreement that structures\_the relationship between Europeana and its data partners. In this post, we announce the publication of an updated version.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The first version of the DEA was introduced in 2011 as a central pillar of the Licensing Framework. Since then, we have concluded the\_agreement with hundreds of data partners, enabling the publication of over 58 million\_digital objects from over 3,500 cultural heritage institutions.\_Following wide consultation with data partners throughout the course of 2018,\_we have published\_an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/the-data-exchange-agreement\">updated version of the DEA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why did we update it?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This update was necessary because of the new funding model for Europeana that came into place in the summer of 2018. As part of the transition to procurement-based funding,\_the European Commission requested that Europeana ensures that the rights Europeana Foundation receives under the DEA are transferable in the case the Europeana service gets awarded to another operator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took this opportunity to review the entire DEA with the aim of ensuring that it\_reflects the current operational needs of Europeana. We did so in close collaboration with data partners through consultation with the Aggregator Forum, and the\_Copyright Community.\_The input and feedback received through this consultation were\_constructive, and we were very happy to report that it was integral to helping ensure that the DEA and the proposed changes were in line with the needs and expectations of our partners. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The relationship between Europeana and data partners remains unchanged</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This process has resulted in a small number of changes to the DEA that do not substantially change the nature of the agreement. The core elements of the DEA remain unchanged:\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>It is up to data partners to decide how much data they provide to\_Europeana as along they meet the minimum requirements of the Europeana Data Model and the Europeana Publishing Framework.</li>\r\n    <li>Data partners grant permission that all descriptive metadata that is provided to Europeana will be made available under the terms of the CC0 Public Domain dedication so that it can be reused without restrictions.</li>\r\n    <li>Data partners also grant Europeana permission to store and make available thumbnail images to illustrate search results.</li>\r\n    <li>As part of the metadata, data partners need to provide one of 14 standardised rights statements that indicate the copyright status and reuse conditions about the digital object referenced by the metadata.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>So what has changed in the new version of the DEA?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The updates that we have made to the DEA fall in three broad classes.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>We have made changes that ensure that the DEA better reflects the operational reality of Europeana with regards to how we display digital objects on Europeana. (Changes to article 1 and article 5).\_</li>\r\n    <li>Secondly,\_at the request of the European Commission, we have included an explicit assignment clause (article 8) that enables the transfer of rights obtained by Europeana under the DEA to a possible new operator of the Europeana service.\_</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, we have also used the opportunity to adopt the language in line with current practice within in the Europeana network and to remove or adopt references to external parties and processes that no longer exist (articles 1, 2 and 9).</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/documentation-of-updates-to-the-data-exchange-agreement\">Read more about the changes, in detail.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does this mean for data partners?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Existing data partners can continue contributing to Europeana as they have already signed the DEA\_(or an equivalent agreement with their aggregators).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of now, new data partners are invited to sign the 'updated' agreement,\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/the-data-exchange-agreement\">available on our website.</a></p>\r\n"

Since childhood I had been exposed to arts, aesthetics - learning how to sing, dance etc. and growing up, I found ample opportunities to merge my skills with what I was passionate about. My school always stressed the importance of developing skills and interests and allowed us to learn about different countries - languages, literature, etc. Later, as a student of literature, I developed a deeper understanding of movements that have shaped us. As the leader of a youth theatre group, I learnt to express my views about issues that I felt strongly for - and somehow, all these experiences came together to chart out my career as well. I’m a keen learner and I love to read, engage with people and ‘take action’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also double up as a youth educator/mentor undertaking history/heritage learning projects in school - and that’s my most favourite role.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am working on multiple projects right now; but for March, the focus is definitely on Wikipedia’s Art+Feminism campaign and one we started of our own for Women’s History Month, called ‘#TheseMughalWomen’. It sheds light on the women of the Mughal court; their contribution to the Empire; myth-busting and more than anything, making content about them, accessible online. The campaign involves museums and individuals. An interesting campaign that has started in India is #ChaloMuseum, pushed by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, and we’re trying to make visiting museums a ‘cool’ thing to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I got into the culture and arts space back in 2008 during a college internship. It was a regular communications /marketing intern profile at UNESCO Delhi and it opened up a whole new world for me. I learnt about the different folk/craft traditions of the country, and it helped me startup <a href=\"http://happyhands.in/\">Happy Hands Foundation</a> after college. Then while working on artisan-education and helping them innovate on product design, I started visiting museums a lot, and well - that got me into the ‘history of art’ part of it! Since I’ve always loved engaging people with the arts, I think it was natural then to move towards a digital-driven platform for a new project, <a href=\"http://www.theheritagelab.in/\">The Heritage Lab</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working in the crafts sector, I realised that a huge hurdle to women joining the workforce is mobility. We struggled so much in building India’s first group of all-women puppeteers: there was family opposition, there was travel-constraint (should they have to go out of the city, etc) and there was a huge bias in terms of women ‘performing on stage’ even from behind the curtain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I moved from the capital city to a smaller city, I had the opportunity to engage with students who had moved from Tier-3 cities to study/gain a degree. &nbsp;I realised however, there is no career-guidance targeted at adolescent girls which will help them choose a career that aligns with their interests or skills; rather, it is about getting a degree that will help them find a better groom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Interestingly, in the arts-management space: whether it was crafts or museums, I have definitely encountered more women than men at the work level. Maybe because the ‘arts’ are still not part of the mainstream here in India - and I see that as a blessing in disguise. I firmly believe that Culture and Arts are soft-power, and investing in cultural diplomacy can take India far ahead; so perhaps when the time comes, women already in the sector would be able to lead the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’d also add that museums/cultural institutions have to work very closely with government bodies, and that’s where the struggle is highlighted. In some cities (like mine for instance or mostly in Tier 2 or Tier 3 cities), it can be challenging. Women’s roles at cultural institutions aren’t free from bias either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What can be done: Within the workforce, I think there have to be adequate upskilling opportunities focused on women; there has to be a safe space for them to voice concerns/engage in dialogue etc - and institutions really need to focus on women-friendly sanitation facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ll speak specifically for museums - you definitely see so many women making a difference at important positions - whether as historians or art critics, as curators, researchers, archaeologists - women are leading different spaces. Most museums in India supported by the Ministry of Culture which is led by men. However, some of the most important museum roles - education, curatorial, conservation - have some fabulous women. In India, you have museums such as the Partition Museum, Kerala Museum, Maharaja Sawai ManSingh II Museum Jaipur, Piramal Museum, Kiran Nadar Museum, Sarmaya, and many others - all which have women in senior management/leadership roles. Unfortunately, however, these women have to be celebrated outside of the sector too - so that younger people can see them as role models.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An underlying stereotype within our sector is that women and tech don’t go together. I’d say, that we need to get out of our comfort zones to learn new things, share what we know and basically seek each other - chances are, someone might be able to support you when you least expect it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, celebrate yourself! Campaigns such as #showyourwork are so important and women from the field must participate. But for that, I think we’d have to get a lot of museums and museum people on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For one, I really love the team at # ArtAndFeminism: so supportive and encouraging - at any time of the day, and from anywhere. I was once part of a US State Department program - and we have an alumni network in every city - my city network on Whatsapp is one of the most active, and supportive groups ever - we’re slowly building up a community of ‘Enthusiastic Museum People’ (owing to India’s experience of Ask-A-Curator day) so then again: we’re always learning from each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apart from that - I absolutely love my museum-gang on Twitter! It is so rewarding to see chats like #MuseumHour (though at very unearthly hours for India, and I often catch up later).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I feel my digital museum friends are very inspiring, and I’ve learnt so much from them. For example, Hannah Hethmon who runs the Museums in Strange Places podcast; Mar who is ever-ready to help and has made CultureThemes so huge that Museums look forward to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I also have to say, I am absolutely taken by the open-source movement within museums in the West. India is slowly working on it, but it’ll be heartening to see how people engage with content once it’s accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit our&nbsp;exhibition<em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a></em>&nbsp;which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

        title: 'Three horizons of innovation in ‘Europeana Foundation Business Plan 2019: Our common culture’'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The Europeana Foundation’s Business Plan for 2019 is now available for download. Discover our ‘three horizons of innovation’, all of which have human interaction at their heart. What role will you play?</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>The Europeana Foundation is an independently governed organisation with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’. The Europeana Core Service is governed by the European Commission and the Member States and funded under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) of the European Union. We work very closely with the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and the Europeana Network Association to develop a strong public service that supports cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation. \_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Foundation Business Plan 2019, subtitled ‘Our common culture’, demonstrates how our combined contribution to that mission this year will be to improve the quality of the Europeana Core Service, to find ways to extend that service and to innovate for the sector at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Concentrating on the Core Service</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We will further improve Europeana Collections and the APIs to allow Europe’s cultural heritage to reach even more teachers, researchers and cultural enthusiasts. Our aim? 500,000 visits to Europeana Collections each month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will further develop the back-end service infrastructure (Metis) to allow us to work better with the national and domain aggregators who make the cultural heritage objects available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will support cultural heritage institutions to share higher quality content and metadata, and work with them to develop shared standards and practices through workshops, conferences and our professional information site, Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Look out for</strong>: Three new thematic collections, two Europeana reuse challenges and one new-look, more accessible Europeana Pro!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Extending the Core Service</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With a consolidated Core Service, we can look to strategically extend our offering in exciting and innovative directions - from improving the aggregation landscape to finding new ways of presenting and working with cultural heritage material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new project - Europeana Common Culture - will see 24 partners come together to improve the functioning of the network of Europeana’s national aggregators by harmonising policies, experimenting with novel technologies and supporting emerging national aggregators in their development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two participatory projects (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/enrich-europeana\">EnrichEuropeana</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/crowd-heritage\">CrowdHeritage</a>) will provide the public with opportunities to get hands-on by transcribing and annotating cultural heritage material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Look out for</strong>: Increased support for a range of media - a new Europeana media player will be integrated into Europeana Collections and a Task Force will provide guidance on publishing 3D objects online.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Innovating for the sector</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To support innovation in the cultural heritage sector, the Europeana Foundation, with partner Sound and Vision, has developed an <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-innovation-agenda\">innovation agenda</a>. This agenda will guide our decisions on participating in new projects, pilots or other activities outside of the Core Services, with all work supporting the sector’s digital transformation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://timemachine.eu/\">Time Machine</a>, a large-scale research infrastructure now beginning its preparatory phase, will aim to use artificial intelligence for the mass digitisation and interpretation of collections and to create completely new ways to interact with that data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://v4design.eu/\">V4Design</a> will bring digitised cultural heritage assets directly into the tools used by architects and video game designers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And <a href=\"https://gift.itu.dk/\">GIFT</a> will explore how artists, designers, museum professionals and computer scientists can help museums create personal encounters with cultural heritage, both in physical and digital realms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Look out for</strong>: Three workshops on the potential impact of Time Machine on areas such as education, scholarship and urban planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s more…</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>None of this happens without investing in our people and partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a programme of meetings for the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and the Europeana Network Association’s Members Council, as well as a two-day conference for the Network at large. And we continue our EU Member States engagement with stakeholder meetings under the Romanian and Finnish presidencies of the council of the European Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the office, we want to invest in staff development, reduce the burden of reporting, and encourage our employees to go greener.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Look out for</strong>: More women on conference panels as the Europeana Foundation supports the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/commissioners-support-no-women-no-panel-campaign\">No Women No Panel Campaign</a> initiated by Commissioner Mariya Gabriel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Download the 'Europeana Foundation Business Plan 2019: Our common culture' now!

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "In early March, the Europeana Foundation had the great pleasure of welcoming the representatives of the newly elected Europeana Network Association (ENA) Members Council for their first meeting. With a great vibe and team spirit, we spent two days discussing the vision and strategy for the ENA and its role in shaping the Europeana ecosystem, thinking through work plans for ENA communities, and addressing some important Association business.  \r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first 2019 meeting of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> took place on 5-6 March 2019 in The Hague, Netherlands. For 16 of the 30 present Councillors, it was their very first meeting of this kind. One of them, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/ina-bluemel\">Ina Bluemel</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inablu/status/1103965899978145794\">found the meeting</a> inspiring and thought-provoking, with a \_‘colourful mix of liberal-minded, nice people with different skills and backgrounds’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying priorities \_</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Council discussed strategic direction and the activities it foresaw up to the end of 2020. With their diverse professional backgrounds, Councillors identified and addressed some of the key upcoming priorities and the opportunities and challenges they bring: strengthening the relation between the ENA and the Europeana Foundation; utilising resources from Europeana Collections in cross-domain curation at European level; or looking for new ways of reaching out to ENA’s audiences within the six communities and beyond. The Council also discussed the ENA’s input into the Europeana Initiative Strategy 2021-2025 and reflected on the implications of last year’s public consultation and the resulting <em><a href=\"https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/58538a59-b4aa-11e8-99ee-01aa75ed71a1/language-en\">Evaluation of Europeana</a></em>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Activating the communities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2018, the ENA laid foundations for the establishment of a new community structure and launched <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">six communities</a>. Now, the major focus of the Council is to activate these communities and make them productive by offering the community members clear membership benefits. These benefits include getting to know like-minded professionals worldwide and getting involved in projects and Task Forces on specific topics of common interest. International collaboration, exchanging highly relevant information and advice, and a community vibe is what the Council is aiming for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Councillors worked on practical community development by finalising work plans for 2019 for the six communities. Each of these work plans entails lots of concrete interesting activities that you will be invited to join - keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\" target=\"_blank\">community pages</a> as the work plans and activities will be published in due course.</p>\r\n"

Even though the agenda contained some introductory topics, we managed as a group to make good progress in setting up the work plans and governance of the six communities. We very much enjoyed the ideas and conversations about strengthening the ENA as a group of digital culture professionals from across Europe and look forward to seeing the results coming out of the communities.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Coming up next</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All &nbsp;the presentations from the meeting can be found on <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/tag/mc-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Slideshare</a>, and you can find some nice pictures on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/albums/72157679194022508\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s Flickr</a>. The meeting minutes will be published shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next Members Council meeting will take place in conjunction with the 2019 AGM and Europeana event in late autumn.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />From Scann...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m Evelin Heidel, but people know me more as Scann. I’m from Argentina, I studied literature and I have been working in the intersection of digital cultural heritage and copyright law for the last ten years, contributing with several projects and organisations, including Creative Commons (CC) and the DIY Book Scanner project. I was a fellow at the Harvard Library Innovation in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’m finishing some details to publish the report over the consultation process on the specialisation for GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) for the <a href=\"https://certificates.creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons Certificates</a>. This is a major effort to offer sustained training on openness and CC licensing. We want to help GLAM institutions improve their open licensing practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are also starting some conversations around how can we better communicate copyright status over public domain works. Determining whether, when and where work is in the public domain is still a difficult process, given the lack of reliable and consistent information about authors and works. While digital content is being shared globally, public domain rules and assessments are always jurisdictions-based and create uncertainty over reuse of works. The fear of legal risk leads&nbsp;GLAM institutions to be overly conservative in marking works as public domain. All these create a chilling effect to share and reuse public domain works, resulting in an overall loss for culture and democracy. As more tools are appearing to make copyright clearance easier, such as Wikidata, we need to ask ourselves the question of how can we integrate existing solutions, including CC tools, to create a commons-based infrastructure for clearing and communicating public domain status over works. We’ll be exploring some of that in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WT7dPAg9vPTlbKl4moiJOF4lnFytmmrfZ9eb-cgzihc/edit\">workshop</a> that will take place at the <a href=\"https://summit.creativecommons.org/\">CC Summit in Lisbon</a> in May, where I’m leading the GLAM track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the OpenGLAM initiative, we are doing housekeeping with the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/openglam\">@openglam</a> Twitter account, finishing analysing the results of the <a href=\"https://openglam.org/principles/\">OpenGLAM Principles</a> survey and working on revamping the <a href=\"https://openglam.org/\">openglam.org</a> website. We’ll also be presenting some of this work at the CC Summit, with folks from the Open Knowledge Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That being said, I’m personally still in an 'in-between' situation job wise - I'm finishing my degree and I’m looking for opportunities to work or study abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I came across copyright law early when I was studying. Some of that story can be found in the Argentina chapter of the book <em><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shadow-libraries\">Shadow Libraries: Access to knowledge in higher education</a></em>. Then I ended up being an active contributor for several organisations working in all the things 'open', including Creative Commons and the DIY Book Scanner project.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think there are at least four different challenges in the intersection of open, GLAM and women, referred to four different areas of work inside GLAM institutions: technology, partnerships, institutional missions and copyright policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, the need to incorporate digital technologies to the workflow of GLAM institutions is generating or increasing the pay gap between men and women inside different areas of GLAM institutions. This happens in part because GLAM careers were traditionally followed by mostly white women, while technology has been stereotyped as a male career. Sometimes the technology work gets outsourced, which probably makes things worse in terms of the pay gap. How does the gender division of labour between technology and librarianship services affect institutions, and how can it be addressed and solved? How is this having an impact on the recognition of women’s labour that happens behind 'all things digital', from digitisation to metadata?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The open movement has its root in the toxic masculinity culture of the free/open source software movement, that most of the time is oblivious to white privilege and the gendered division of labour, as Coraline Ada Ehmke has <a href=\"https://where.coraline.codes/blog/meritocracy/\">already pointed out</a>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How does is this expressed in the sort of participation models that the open movements have in their partnerships with GLAM projects or institutions? How does it orient&nbsp;or favours a certain type of collaboration? What are the biases in those interactions and how can we change them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GLAM institutions work with organising and categorising knowledge and art, historically tailored to fit the white, Western and male perspective over the world. Several GLAM institutions and professionals challenge this legacy. How can lessons of feminism and decolonisation movements help us reshape our views over knowledge and heritage in the digital environment? There are many leaders asking questions of this nature, such as Sarah Bond on how <a href=\"https://sarahemilybond.com/2018/06/18/digitization-%E2%89%A0-repatriation-when-digital-humanities-provides-access-but-not-restitution/\">digital access doesn’t count as repatriation</a>, Tara Robertson on <a href=\"http://tararobertson.ca/2016/lita-keynote/\">ethical concerns about what to digitise and share</a> and Jane Anderson on <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/2019/01/30/jane-anderson/\">how to work with indigenous communities inside GLAM projects</a>. We need more organisations asking the questions that <a href=\"https://whoseknowledge.org/\">WhoseKnowledge?</a> is asking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does open access mean to the intersection of feminism and decolonisation? How can we better work with marginalised and oppressed communities to share and understand their perspectives of the world through digital content? How can this help to improve democratic dialogue?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lastly, scholars such as Ann Bartow, Debora Halbert, Kevin Greene and Carys Craig, to name a few, have already pointed out to the sexist and racist nature of copyright law; how the relationship between copyright law and gender affects the work of GLAM professionals and the impact copyright protection terms have on digitising and sharing the work of women and black artists. Collecting societies and copyright interest groups are dominated by white men, while the groups that grant rights such as access to knowledge in a copyright restrictive environment are largely dominated by women, including GLAM professionals but also teachers and educators. What role do gender bias and gender gaps have in shaping copyright law and policy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I don’t have a definite answer for most of these questions. I only think they need to be explored in the aftermath of institutions adopting open licensing, especially if we want to build a more equitable and fair digital environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No. Women in leadership positions still have to work double and harder than their male peers. And even more,&nbsp;if they happen to be black, come from a working-class background and/or a marginalised community and/or were born in an underdeveloped country. That’s also why we need more feminist women leaders and feminist leaders in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And leadership means nothing if it is not matched with economic rights. Equal pay for equal work, equal distribution of childcare leaves and care work responsibilities, and recognition of non-paid labour. Any person, man or woman, in a leadership position inside an organisation that is working with a feminist perspective should work to make this a reality. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Women have received way too many messages about what we should be and how we should behave. I think we don’t need any more messages. I do have a message for white cis males reading this interview: question your privileges. Again. And again. And always. Preferably, until you lose them. There are a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/10/how-men-can-become-better-allies-to-women\">lot of things</a> you can do to be an ally. Do them</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I like being a member of Creative Commons. I think they are aligned with a lot of these concerns. There’s always room for improvement, but at the very least they’re paying attention. The work with the Open GLAM network is particularly interesting because it is an effort to better align communities of practice working in the intersection of digital heritage and openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who (or what) inspires you at the moment?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think that this is a good space for other people to look at the work of truly amazing women. If you feel the urgent need to put together an all-white-western-cis-male-panel, all the ladies and black folks mentioned in this interview rock in their fields. Call them. Cite them. Avoid yourself some embarrassment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also use this short list:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kelsey Merkley and her <a href=\"http://uncommonwomen.org/\">UnCommon Women</a> work; Andrea Wallace, for the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WPS-KJptUJ-o8SXtg00llcxq0IKJu8eO6Ege_GrLaNc\">OpenGLAM survey</a> and her <a href=\"https://displayatyourownrisk.org/about-dayor/\">research</a> work more in general; Mariana Fossatti, for her work at <a href=\"https://whoseknowledge.org/initiatives/visiblewikiwomen/\">#VisibleWikiWomen</a> and her leadership inside <a href=\"http://www.creativecommons.uy/\">CC Uruguay</a> (which is full of amazing women that you should know, such as Patricia Díaz Charquero, Carina Patrón, Paula Domínguez Font and Ileana Silva); Irene Soria Guzmán, from CC Mexico; Loren Fantin and her super-duper work at <a href=\"https://ourdigitalworld.net/\">Our Digital World</a>, which I’m a very big fan of. Mariana Valente, another OpenGLAM advocate, who is working to address <a href=\"http://www.internetlab.org.br/en/\">digital rights from a feminist perspective</a>; Paula Félix-Didier, the director of the <a href=\"https://museodelcineba.org/\">Cinema Museum in Argentina</a>, who works all the time against the tide to preserve the film heritage in Argentina. Carys Craig for her amazing <a href=\"https://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/faculty-and-staff/craig-carys-j/\">feminist critiques of copyright law</a>. Jennryn Wetzler and Maran Wolston are the <a href=\"https://certificates.creativecommons.org/\">CC Certificates</a> superheroines. And the conversation about the public domain statements that I mentioned at the beginning of this interview is mainly being commanded by Diane Peters; they have been key to bringing the legal tools of CC to their current shape - and those tools are a fundamental part of openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Also, my <a href=\"http://cosecharoja.org/aborto-y-teologia-no-hay-ningun-mandamiento-que-diga-no-abortaras/\">mom rocks</a>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Want more?&nbsp;Visit the full list of profiles for the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/tags/women\">Women in Culture and Tech</a></em> series.

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">From Sandra...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I'm Sandra Fauconnier, born in 1973, an art historian who loves the internet, and a Belgian citizen who has settled in the Netherlands. Throughout my career, I have worked on online projects in the cultural sector - from small and very specialised archives of new media art to large general collaboration platforms like Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>I've seen many passing trends and short-lived projects in this field, and have witnessed many digital resources disappear forever; today, this makes me quite passionate about longer-term thinking, online collaboration, and commons-based resources in the digital heritage field.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At this moment I work (remotely) for the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation that supports Wikipedia and its other Wikimedia sister projects, as Program Officer in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) team. I work on <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data\">Structured Data on Commons</a>, a project that turns Wikipedia's free media repository, Wikimedia Commons, into a true Linked Open Data platform by integrating <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org\">Wikidata</a> into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Can you tell me about women on Wikimedia projects?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia, the volunteer-driven free encyclopedia, has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia\">well-documented</a> gender gap. A minority of Wikipedia editors publicly identify as female, and content about women (from biographies to women's history) is underrepresented too. The Wikimedia community is quite aware of this, and over the last&nbsp;decade, many activist initiatives have emerged to address this issue. Examples include the yearly <em><a href=\"http://www.artandfeminism.org/\">Art+Feminism</a></em> campaign (<em>note: earlier mentioned in last week's interview with <a href=\"/post/women-in-culture-and-tech-medhavi-gandhi\">Medhavi</a></em>)&nbsp;in which many new Wikipedia articles about women artists are created and the long-term project <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red\">Women in Red</a></em> on English Wikipedia where Wikipedians consistently work to increase and improve coverage of women. Personally, I am a member of the <a href=\"https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikiproject/Gendergap\">gender gap taskforce</a> on the Dutch-language Wikipedia. Our group gathers at least monthly - hosted in Amsterdam at <a href=\"https://atria.nl/agenda/schrijf-mee-voor-wikipedia/\">Atria Institute</a> on gender equality and women's history - and we improve and create hundreds of new Wikipedia articles each year. Cultural institutions actually play a large role in helping to make women more visible on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects: Wikimedians often discover notable women via GLAM collections, and we can illustrate their Wikipedia articles with freely licensed images that are made available by cultural institutions.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I studied art history in the mid-1990s. During my studies, I became fascinated by the internet and the world wide web and learned to create websites with endearingly hand-crafted HTML. I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.spinster.be/probably-the-worlds-first-thesis-about-internet-art/\">Master's thesis</a> about internet-based art (probably the first one ever!), which around 2000 led me to the job of archivist for <a href=\"http://v2.nl/\">V2_ Institute for the Unstable Media</a> - a pioneering organisation in new media arts in Rotterdam - and in 2007 as collections officer for the former <a href=\"http://www.nimk.nl/\">Netherlands Media Art Institute</a> (currently known as <a href=\"http://li-ma.nl/lima/\">LIMA</a>), a distributor of video and new media art&nbsp;(I still have a strong passion for net art and new media art, which I think are scandalously underrepresented in contemporary art collections around the world!). In later jobs - as project lead for <a href=\"https://www.arttube.nl/\">ARTtube</a>, a video platform for Dutch museums, and in various positions for the Wikimedia movement - I have been able to work on other passions of mine: online representation of cultural heritage, and connecting heritage across collection silos.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the challenges are well-known - work-life balance and equal appreciation and pay. I do think we are going in the right direction; today, these topics are definitely publicly discussed much more than when I entered the workforce in the late 1990s, and we should keep discussing them and fighting for them. I have always appreciated how, in my own networks in the Netherlands, part-time work is considered normal. In some of my previous jobs, even senior managers and directors have worked part-time, which goes a long way in giving people - both men and women - space and assurance to dedicate time to care for self and others, to their families and social lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I prefer to talk about empowerment, growth and appreciation. Do we reward every (female) professional enough, so that they can grow and sustain themselves financially and autonomously? Personally, I like to work in situations where there is not a lot of hierarchy and where people can grow and are appreciated in positions that suit their interests and skills. Sometimes that involves leadership in the narrow sense, sometimes people management, sometimes mentorship, sometimes deep engagement with content and technology, sometimes bridge-building, or other skills. Leadership by itself feels like a very 'masculine' concept to me and I think that many positions that are about care, maintenance and connection are equally valuable. In that regard: yes, I do think we should continuously work to make our organisations more rewarding environments, with room for growth beyond leadership for people with diverse skill-sets. That said, I simply also want to see more women in formal leadership positions indeed - many of the best leaders I know are women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What message would you share with women in the sector today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Celebrate each others' successes. Mentor younger people. Embrace all the diverse and unique ways in which we build lives and careers that are rewarding to us - especially if people make different choices than you would. On the individual level, I can recommend one attitude that still takes me some effort to master, but it continues to help me tremendously: <strong>don't take things personally</strong>. It is so liberating!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely the Wikimedia community! I'm very happy to call many Wikimedians my friends. Volunteers of Wikimedia projects are often very bright people; sophisticated and passionate about knowledge, and surprisingly good at exuberant dance parties, beer tasting, and karaoke. I mostly interact with volunteers active on <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM\">GLAM-Wiki projects</a> (collaborations between cultural institutions and Wikimedians), where I have met many fascinating, dedicated 'laypeople' who display the deepest online cultural participation I've ever seen. Where else would you find volunteers who <a href=\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_sum_of_all_paintings\">describe hundreds of thousands of artworks</a> on Wikidata in their free time, who organize major worldwide heritage <a href=\"https://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/\">photo competitions</a>, or scour online collections of <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SiobhanLeachman/status/1095030184162586625\">digitised books</a> for underrepresented female artists who deserve Wikipedia articles?</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Women in culture and tech: Petra Kammerevert, Member of European Parliament'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Today we speak with <strong>Petra Kammerevert</strong> - Member of the European Parliament and Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education\_(CULT). In her rousing interview, she discusses the barriers entrepreneurial women face and just why 'women should be more demanding, more explicit, more self-assured than ever'.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>How did you enter into politics?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I joined the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), at the age of 18. My motivation was influenced by developments in both Germany and Europe, namely the anti-nuclear movement and the NATO double-track decision. I wanted to proactively contribute to these debates with the aim of making our continent a safer place. The SPD, as the party of peace, social justice, freedom and solidarity was, and still is, the right place to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can you discuss your views on entrepreneurship? Do you think that more needs to be done to support female entrepreneurship?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Female entrepreneurs are key to accelerating economic growth and social innovation.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the acknowledgement of their positive contribution to society and economy is far from sufficient. In this regard, cultural and societal norms - we can also call them prejudice - constitute the greatest obstacle. They decrease the legitimacy of women being good entrepreneurs and their opportunities to become them. This is why entrepreneurship is still a men’s arena, despite women already exceeding the formal education levels of men. What a waste of talent and potential of a large part of our population - which in turn negatively affects all citizens!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you see as the key challenge for professional women today? What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to overcome the false narrative that only men can be successful entrepreneurs, I believe that education is key. Quality education is the best way to fight outdated gender roles and norms and help future generations in being more gender-sensitive. Furthermore, schools are the right place to proactively address entrepreneurial skills and promote entrepreneurship equally amongst boys and girls. However, there is not only a need for changing the public perception of female entrepreneurship but also other barriers occurring over the life story of most women, especially of working mothers. We need to urgently adopt measures that facilitate and improve a work-life balance such as the right to free childcare and increased parental leave shared between the parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly not! A quick glance at the composition of most governments, parliaments or boards of directors of large enterprises in the world is enough to see that women’s participation in leadership positions is far from sufficient. However, we should not generalise this lack of gender parity and fair representation too much. My party, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), for example, respects the principle of alternation - a man follows a woman - on our electoral lists, also for the European Parliament elections in May. We clearly want to empower women in politics!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What message would you share with women in culture today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My message does not only concern women in culture, but women in general. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, a famous American historian of early America and the history of women, once said: 'Well-behaved women seldom make history'. As we can observe a backlash in women’s rights in several countries, also in Europe, it definitely is time to renew Mrs Ulrich’s call for women to push boundaries, to challenge power relationships and to fundamentally change the world to the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Women should be more demanding, more explicit, more self-assured than ever.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What initiatives do you think are effective in advocating for women across professional spheres?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First, we need to promote an open and unprejudiced dialogue. Our society must finally regard gender-equality more as a chance than a burden. Second, we have to remove structural barriers. In the political sphere, we need to promote gender parity through quotas and electoral lists following the principle of alternation, as they have proved to be the most effective tools. In the economic sphere, we finally have to approve the 'Women on Boards' directive that the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are advocating for. Third, besides from regulatory intervention, we should highlight more female role models and foster women’s networking and mentoring opportunities. Men are known for helping men. Women should do the same!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who (or what) inspires you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, all the shortcomings regarding gender-equality in politics, society and economy are already more than enough inspiration to keep pushing for equal rights for women. Finally, I would say that all people fighting for gender equality or - more generally - <strong>a better world inspires me.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Want more?\_Visit our\_exhibition<em>\_<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers</a></em>\_which highlights the lives and achievements of historical European women.

                body: "<h3>From Silvia…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hi there! My name is Silvia Gutiérrez and I am the digital humanities librarian at the Daniel Cosío Villegas Library at El Colegio de México. Not to brag, but this library is one of the richest libraries in social sciences and humanities in Latin America and has the first innovation centre in an academic library in Mexico (this, of course, is thanks to the visionary leadership of a visionary librarian: <a href=\"http://udgtv.com/noticias/jalisco/entregan-premio-fil-al-bibliotecario-2017-micaela-chavez-la-primera-mujer-dirigir-la-biblioteca-del-colegio-mexico/\">Micaela Chávez</a> and a dope team!). My slogan: 'sharing is the new having'.<meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are you working on right now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So *right now* we just launched the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKNPdZjJL0s\">Data Science and Digital Humanities Initiative</a>. This initiative is meant to bring together the work of the coordination of digital education initiatives, the IT team, the library, and the social&nbsp;sciences and humanities departments at El Colegio de México (the university I work for). The aim of this endeavour is to promote research in this area but also to train teachers and students with these new techniques in an ethical, and critical perspective. Our workshops are open for anyone who wants to take a look in <a href=\"https://github.com/ColmexBDCV/talleres\">our Github</a>. Also, we’re wrapping up our <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/ColMex/First_Wikipedian_in_(Academic)_Residence_in_Latin_America/Timeline\">&nbsp;Wikipedia-Academic Library liaison project</a>, which was funded by the Wikimedia Foundation. This adventure led us to create more than 100 articles and improve more than 600 using our library’s collections and databases. It has been quite a ride, and we’re hoping to make it work as a model for other libraries, especially in Latin America, so we have created a bunch of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wiki-BDCV\">materials in Spanish</a> that others can re-use and adapt, and we’ll publish a booklet with all the tips/best practices we have gathered in a year.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>How did you get into your field?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It all started when at the age of thirteen my aunt Adalia gave me my first computer as an early quinceañera’s present. I spent many hours surfing the Internet and tinkering hypertexts with all the interesting things I found. My model was the highly linked protestant Bibles I grew up with, which were enriched with maps, etymologies, genealogies and so on. My naive teenage self thought: 'I have to share this with the world, they need to know'. Can you imagine?, I thought I was going to invent the digital humanities! Fortunately, because of the <a href=\"https://sinlugar2010.wordpress.com/2010/10/16/el-archipielago-de-las-humanidades-digitales-glen-worthey-en-la-unam/\">great work of Isabel Galina and Ernesto Priani</a> promoting the field in Mexico, I found out there was no need to reinvent the wheel, and that I could actually stand on the shoulders of giants. So I looked for <a href=\"https://silviaegt.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/where-can-study-master-digital-humanities-map/\">universities</a> where I could learn digital humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Two things were important for me: it had to be a public university, and it had to have an inclination for free, libre and open software (FLOS). And I found it! I did my MA at the University of Würzburg in Germany and it felt like when your ears pop. I learnt Python and R, and other tools I knew I could use back home in our public institutions in Mexico. During my Erasmus semester at King’s College London, I took a class on digital assets media management, and back in Würzburg another on digital libraries. These experiences together with my <a href=\"http://sgutierrez.seewes.de\">master thesis</a> (which took much of its data from the <a href=\"http://www.elem.mx/obra/datos/174460\">book-database</a> of librarian Alicia Perales Ojeda) made my path clear: I wanted to be part of the <a href=\"https://acrl.ala.org/dh/\">DH+Lib</a> movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meeting the team lead by my personal-hero <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asantimartinez\">Alberto Martínez</a> just made my decision easier. Alberto is a historian and librarian devoted to projects that leverage the power of libraries for social good, and he and my wonderful colleagues (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nataliembaur\">Natalie Baur</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RodCuellarH\">Rodrigo Cuéllar</a>) have made never regret joining this wonderful ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the challenges for women in the workforce today? &nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To answer this question, I have to make clear two things. One is to state that I am a privileged woman: I had scholarships to study abroad, and never left school to work. The other is that I’ve had these opportunities because my mother -&nbsp;another woman from the cultural sector - who has worked twice as hard as any man would, even in unrelated jobs to her profession, so that her children could go to English classes, visit museums, or enjoy Bach in a Mexican Baroque Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The point I want to make is that if the cultural sector was fair for all, my mom, a pianist with a Master's degree from Boston, who implemented the first Piano Lab in Veracruz, should not be employed with short-term contracts and precarious labour benefits.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What can be done to improve matters?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What should be done is something I have no authority to answer, but reading about the gender pay gap, the 'motherhood penalty', and how nearly half of US female scientists leave full-time science after their first child&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00611-1\">link</a>), has made me think that one way to address the issue is to understand the 'economics of care' and promote public policies that strengthen social responsibility of care provision (I highly recommend reading Nancy Folbre’s books on this, especially <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=The+Invisible+Heart+nancy+folbre&amp;dblist=638&amp;fq=ap%3A%22folbre+nancy%22&amp;qt=facet_ap%3A\">The Invisible Heart</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Do you feel that women are sufficiently empowered and present in leadership positions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I feel a minor discomfort with this question because, as I understand it, it makes a sort of pairing between 'leadership' and 'empowerment'. There are, no doubt, benefits when women take leadership positions as we understand leadership today (directors, presidents, CEOs and so on); and I agree fully with the idea that we should fight to ensure that those places are open for any girl or any other minority that dreams about making a difference in those platforms. However, I also feel there is a lot of work to be done to value - both socially and economically- already empowered women who are making a change from other non-traditional leadership roles: mothers, domestic workers, traditional healers. They all shape the world we live in, they transform lives, and their job is not a minor one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What digital communities or networks do you find rewarding?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I fear lists because I always leave out relevant information, but please bear in mind this is not an exhaustive one. That said, one of my all-time favourite communities are the crazy peeps that volunteer for the Wikimedia Foundation, particularly the group in Mexico led by Carmen Alcázar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Carmen came up with the idea of creating a group where women could gather far from the male gaze and learn together how to edit Wikipedia with a gender perspective framework: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/editatona\"><strong>editatona</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And the work they’re doing with indigenous languages, especially <a href=\"https://www.mexico.com/tecnologia/asi-se-construye-la-version-de-wikipedia-en-maya-y-en-otras-lenguas-indigenas/\">Maya</a>, is also very inspiring. On that same line, <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAMTLV2018/Welcome\">GLAM-Wiki Tel Aviv conference</a> gave me the unique opportunity to meet the extraordinary <a href=\"https://casperlibero.edu.br/graduacao/jornalismo/docentes-de-jornalismo/joao-alexandre-peschanski/\">João Alexandre Peschanski</a>. João is a professor at the Faculdade Cásper Líbero in São Paulo and uses his extense group of students as an army of good. There is no way to start or finish with the extensive work he has led. But I’ll mention two projects that were particularly special for me. One has to do with the mobilisation he coordinated after the catastrophic fire at the National Museum of Brazil, minutes after this terrible news, João and his team launched a campaign to gather images of the building and collection. Looking at the <a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sala_Kumbukumbu\">Kumbukumbu Room</a> reconstructed in Wikipedia by the donors’ images gave me a bittersweet feeling: I was sad because of our common loss, but I couldn’t help smiling while looking at how fast people reacted to fight against oblivion. I was already in this conflicted mood when João shared with us news about the '<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Projetos/Wikip%C3%A9dia_Falada?fbclid=IwAR1NWT4DaQ5ZlWNHJVLb1x_pwdOFCj7h86nMYvDuqJzFzs0dnMqrgx68tFQ\">Wikipédia Falada</a> (Spoken Wikipedia) Project' which makes cultural objects accessible for those who can not see. In one phase of this project trained students described the paintings at the Museu Paulista and they are now used by blind students in art history classes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another network I find rewarding is the <a href=\"https://programminghistorian.org/es/equipo-de-proyecto\">Programming Historian (PH) team</a> in Spanish led among others by Víctor Gayol, <a href=\"http://jenniferisasi.com/\">Jennifer Isasi</a>, Adam Crymble, José Antonio Motilla and <a href=\"http://mariajoseafanador.com/\">María José Afanador</a>. With these last three, I am especially grateful for organising the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PHBogota?src=hash\">first PH writing meetup in Latin America</a>. Everyone was so inspiring: Natalia Jaramillo with her drones over the Antarctic; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mdcs87\">Miguel Cuadros</a> who is part of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BibliotecaNalCo/videos/facebooklive-mapeando-con-miguel-cuadros/10156228433473580/\">Mapping Colombia</a> Project; &nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbutel\">Matías Butelman</a> and his work with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bibliohack\">Bibliohack</a> making DIY scanners; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juanpanagarita\">Juan Pablo Angarita</a> creating a <a href=\"http://coleccionbogota.biblored.gov.co/\">Digital Library</a> that serves a huge community; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga\">Riva Quiroga</a> who incarnates the meaning of teamwork and is the founder of both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesSantiago\">RLadies Santiago</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesValpo\">Valparaíso</a>, and chair of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf\">LatinR Conference</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'European Parliament adopts the copyright directive: A boost for Europe''s cultural heritage institutions'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Today the European Parliament passed the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20190321IPR32110/european-parliament-approves-new-copyright-rules-for-the-internet\">final compromise text of the Copyright in the Digital Market Directive</a>. This brings an almost five-year-long process to modernise the EU copyright framework to a close. Together with other organisations representing cultural heritage, educational and research organisations, Europeana - <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-latest-on-copyright-reform-europeana-s-updated-mandate\">on behalf of our Network members</a> - has fought over the past five years to ensure that the package approved today includes measures that meaningfully address the challenges copyright poses for Europe's cultural heritage institutions.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>We are happy to report that the text adopted today (with a majority of 348 in favour and 274 against) does indeed contain significant improvements for cultural heritage institutions that will facilitate the (mass) digitisation of out of commerce works, enable institutions to text and data mine works in their collections and ensure that digital copies of public domain works will remain in the public domain. However, we also note that many organisations in our Network\_<a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/2019/03/26/european-parliament-limits-internet-freedom-in-controversial-copyright-vote/\">are concerned about other measures</a> in the adopted text that will introduce an additional right for press publishers and put new obligations on online platforms that may limit the way users can communicate via these platforms.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What does this mean for cultural heritage institutions?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The EU Member States will now have two years to implement the measures adopted today into national law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will result in the following changes for cultural heritage institutions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>In those Member States where this is not the case yet, <strong>cultural heritage institutions will be allowed to make digital reproductions of all works in their collections for preservation purposes</strong> (note that this does not mean that these works can also be made available online) - Article 6 of the directive.</li>\r\n    <li>In all Member States, <strong>cultural heritage institutions (as well as research organisations) will benefit from a text and data mining exception</strong> that will allow them to employ computational analysis techniques on works in their collections for the purpose of scientific research - Article 3 of the directive.</li>\r\n    <li>In all Member States,\_<strong>cultural heritage institutions will be allowed to digitise and make available online in-copyright but out-of-commerce works</strong>. Depending on the types of collections in question they will be able to do so on the basis of licenses issued by collective management organisations or where such organisations do not exist or are not sufficiently representative under a new exception to copyright - Articles 8-11 of the directive.</li>\r\n    <li>Member States will also have the ability to introduce extended collective licensing systems that go beyond the narrow category of out of commerce works. In some Member States, this may result in systems that allow institutions to digitise and make available all of their collections via a single license. For now, such licenses will will be limited to individual member states and not allow cross border access to the digitised works - Article 12 of the directive.</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, those Member States in which it is currently possible to claim new rights over reproductions of public domain works will need to change their laws to stop such practices.<strong> This means that 10 years after we have issued <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">our Public Domain Charter</a> the principle that what is in the public domain in analogue form stays in the public domain in digital has become enshrined in law</strong> - Article 14 of the directive.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h3>What is next for Europeana?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our advocacy efforts have been based on an advocacy mandate that the Europeana adopted in 2014 and updated in 2016. With the end of the legislative process on the European level, we will explore what role Europeana should take during the national implementation phase.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will also continue in our efforts to represent the needs of the Europeana Network in the development of measures aimed at improving access to out of commerce works. Internally we will also need to review how we can help our data partners to bring the rights statements for collections in line with the new legal reality created by Article 14 of the the directive. We will share more about these follow up steps her in due time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we want to use this opportunity to thank everybody who contributed to this much needed update of the copyright rules for cultural heritage institutions. A huge thank you to all our network members and partners involved in this effort but also to all the members of Parliament (and their staff) and the Commission and Member State officials officials who supported us in our fight.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>This year we’ve worked on improving systems and infrastructure behind the scenes, making it easier and more rewarding for our data partners to share collections with us. And we’ve improved how those collections are displayed and linked online, making finding and working with them a much more inviting and productive endeavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From creating educational resources to entertaining GIFs, and from sharing personal migration stories to developing professional expertise at EuropeanaTech, it is always a thrill to see how Europe’s digital cultural heritage is increasingly being integrated into and transforming lives on a day-to-day basis. Here are ten\_highlights from this significant year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18\">FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship</a> are intended to improve the infrastructure for and services around scholarly data. These principles, as presented on the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">GO FAIR website that hosts them</a>, are intended as ‘guidelines to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse of digital assets’. They now guide the design and implementation of major initiatives such as the European Open Science Cloud (<a href=\"https://www.eosc-portal.eu/\">EOSC</a>) as illustrated by the recently launched <a href=\"https://www.fairsfair.eu\">FAIRsFAIR</a> project. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana Collections</a> and its APIs make digitised cultural heritage from over 3,700 providers (galleries, libraries, museums and archives) available in all European languages. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/academic-research\">Europeana Research</a> wants more people to make use of this material in academic research, especially in the humanities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are exploring possibilities to liaise with the EOSC, which also caters to research needs in the &nbsp;social sciences and humanities. In this context, how do Europeana services comply with the FAIR principles and how can we play a role in the wider adoption of these principles in the cultural heritage sector? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How do the FAIR principles align with Europeana's?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much resonance between the FAIR principles and Europeana's values and objectives, as embodied in its <a href=\"http://strategy2020.europeana.eu/\">strategy</a>. Our principles ‘Usable, Mutual, Reliable’ and the way we have implemented them in the past ten years align with FAIR's own 'Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable’ principles. We have been involved in the development of technology that has great potential for enhancing the FAIRness of data, such as open web APIs, Linked Data and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF), implementing it for ourselves as well as encouraging everyone in our sector to adopt it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and its wide <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\">network</a> of partners have developed a Licensing <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/europeana-licensing-framework\">Framework</a> enabling fully open metadata and the mandatory labelling of content with standardised and interoperable <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/available-rights-statements\">rights statements</a> which make the reuse possibilities for each item clear. We have also been advocating for the adoption of better <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-reform-passed-by-european-parliament\">copyright policies</a> that make it easier to openly share cultural data across the board. &nbsp;Finally, the large network of Europeana’s data partners has worked on improving the quality of the data provided in an effort to make our vastly diverse data more usable across domains and languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"[Ontwerp:] S[ocié]té A[nony]me de l'Exposition universelle et internationale de Gand 1913.

                body: "<h2>How do Europeana's data and services meet the FAIR requirements?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana aggregates metadata records about cultural heritage objects. These records provide links to digitised content that is accessible on the websites of Europeana's partners and fuels a search service that facilitates the discovery of cultural material for a wide variety of audiences. Both data and services are presented via a web platform and a series of APIs. There are, therefore, several levels to consider when assessing the FAIRness of Europeana's offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>F- To be Findable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The digitised content that Europeana provides access to is described by metadata, the aggregation of which constitutes the backbone of Europeana's services. The scale and diversity of Europeana's metadata sets imply that their richness<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/antoineisaac/data-scale-and-diversity-issues-at-europeana\"> varies greatly</a>. But Europeana has equipped itself with a data model (see below) that follows the linked data principles which give, besides flexibility, the possibility for our partners - or Europeana itself - to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-semantic-enrichment\">enrich metadata</a> with links to (multilingual) semantic resources that also describe the ’context’ of cultural objects, making them easier to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned&nbsp;earlier, we index the Europeana dataset and make it searchable online ourselves. In addition, the dataset is findable through the European research infrastructures <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu/\">CLARIN</a> and <a href=\"https://eudat.eu/\">EUDAT</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana and our partners promote the persistent identification of both cultural heritage objects’ metadata and digital versions. Europeana assigns identifiers to every aggregated record, and has procedures in place to support the persistence of its identifiers whenever possible. Europeana identifiers are URIs and are included in the data records in all formats in which the dataset is available. In a context of aggregation where data is passed and processed across different partners, we cannot (and for provenance concerns do not want to) enforce global uniqueness, i.e. there can be several identifiers for several versions of a resource. But we do try to maintain links across all these versions so that consumers of our services can always find what they search for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A - To be Accessible</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana identifiers are resolvable (HTTP) URIs, which orient users and data-consuming services towards pages on our website or data from our APIs. Europeana also tries to resolve URIs that are obsolete and have been updated for technical reasons, by using HTTP redirection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana’s dataset is accessible through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">Web APIs</a> that implement open, standard protocols, such as the Linked Data protocols and practices (including <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/\">SPARQL</a>), <a href=\"https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch/blob/master/opensearch-1-1-draft-6.md\">OpenSearch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/\">OAI-PMH</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Access to the dataset’s records via their URIs is free and no authentication is required. Some APIs (such as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/annotations\">Annotations API</a>) and parts of our platform (such as <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I/contribute#action=contributor\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>) require authentication, as they allow the modification of our data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>I - To be Interoperable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana uses the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model</a> (EDM) for data exchange with data providers, for its internal information system, and also for third-party use. EDM is a collaborative, community-based model, developed in consultation with representatives from all the domains represented in Europeana. It is under continuous improvement. EDM is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which allows us to create a model for our metadata that mostly reuses existing (Linked Data) standard vocabularies, such as Dublin Core, SKOS, and FOAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana supports its data partners to use vocabularies for referring to concepts, places, persons and organisations. The most prominent vocabularies in use within the dataset are <a href=\"http://dbpedia.org\">DBpedia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.geonames.org/\">Geonames</a>. Our use of external vocabularies for enrichment always follows the standard practices of Linked Open Data <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/Enrichment_Evaluation/EvaluationEnrichment_SelectingDatasets_102015.pdf\">and concerns such as quality and access</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that in a couple of cases that are crucial for Europeana, we have embarked on making our own vocabularies, such as the one at<a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org/en/\"> RightsStatements.org</a> (see below) to complement existing standards. Again, this is community-driven and follows existing best practices (such as providing URIs).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>R - To be Reusable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Facilitating the reuse of cultural heritage data is a key Europeana objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any metadata provided to Europeana needs to be licensed under CC0, and Europeana makes the complete aggregated metadata set (including the outcomes of its own data improvements) openly available under CC0 as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rights for using the content are stated in every record, using rights statements from either <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons</a> or <a href=\"https://rightsstatements.org\">RightsStatements.org</a>, the latter being a vocabulary developed as a community initiative to improve the communication of the copyright and reuse status of digital objects by cultural heritage institutions, making it easier for users to ‘see if and how online cultural heritage works can be reused’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provenance of the data is always stated, acknowledging the original data provider (e.g. a museum or library) and all intermediaries in the aggregation workflow in the metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, our metadata is made available with the use of data standards commonly used in the cultural heritage, education and research domains, such as <a href=\"https://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a>, <a href=\"http://dublincore.org/\">Dublin Core</a>, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/\">SKOS</a> and others (thanks partly to EDM following best practices for data modelling and being already based on these standards).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><br />\r\nWhat will Europeana do in the near future?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To further encourage partners to provide richer data that makes digital cultural heritage more findable and more reusable, Europeana has ongoing <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">data quality efforts</a> to share best practices and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">report on the quality of content and metadata</a> in a way that is helpful and motivating both for providers and users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have recently defined measures for metadata quality, identifying key data elements and values that enable rich user interfaces and better user experience. In the coming months, we are going to make these measurements accessible to our data reusers so that they can identify the material that is most useful to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With respect to accessibility of digitised content, Europeana is a founding member of the new International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). IIIF is a set of open APIs designed to help people publish digital content on the web in a way that is more interoperable, allows richer interaction with content across any repositories and keeps better track of provenance of content. Europeana recognises and exploits IIIF content that is provided to us and works hard on encouraging our data partners to adopt it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other developments that are relevant to FAIR metrics include the upcoming implementation of a ’single sign-on’ authorisation mechanism across all our products, and the continuous effort to adapt our data model to new application and data-sharing needs, in a community-driven way (a recent example being an extension to represent and publish the full-text content of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/newspapers\">newspapers</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stay informed and join us</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To stay informed about developments like those outlined in this post, join the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/research-community\">Europeana Research</a> and/or the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> communities of the Europeana Network Association, and follow us on Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurresearch\">@eurresearch</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanatech\">@europeanatech</a>)</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Books, manuscripts, historical newspapers and many other kinds of textual cultural heritage objects (CHOs) provide valuable input for a broad range of research topics. The mission of <a href=\"https://www.clarin.eu\">CLARIN</a> is to makes digital language resources available to scholars, researchers, students and citizen-scientists from all disciplines. As partners in the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI), Europeana and CLARIN have worked together to embed cultural heritage material into CLARIN’s infrastructure. Based on the experience gained during the pilot, and building on improved dissemination services and metadata quality offered by Europeana, CLARIN recently carried out a new evaluation of the available datasets and made a new selection. The selection process focused on full text content such as digitised books, periodicals and newspapers with textual content obtained through optical character recognition (OCR). Other types of objects that were also considered are high resolution scans of manuscripts and speech audio. In order to qualify, resources had to be directly available in their raw form and have no legal restrictions for reuse. Currently, 22 collections containing about 135,000 cultural heritage objects have been identified as meeting these criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Connected tools for seamless processing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After finalising the selection, CLARIN set up a mechanism for regular retrieval of metadata for the selected collections. Once retrieved, the metadata is ingested into CLARIN’s language resource catalogue, the <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu\">Virtual Language Observatory</a> (VLO).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Straightaway, we can see that the newly introduced resources provide a substantial contribution to the number of relevant search results for certain queries. For example, searching for <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/?fqType=languageCode:or&amp;fq=languageCode:code:slv&amp;fqType=resourceClass:or&amp;fq=resourceClass:text\">Slovenian text resources</a>, almost all of the 73,000+ results originate from a Europeana data provider - in this case the Digital Library of Slovenia. Similarly, the availability of <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/search?fqType=languageCode:or&amp;fq=languageCode:code:hun&amp;fqType=resourceClass:or&amp;fq=resourceClass:text\">Hungarian</a> and <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/search?q=-German+-English&amp;fqType=languageCode:or&amp;fq=languageCode:code:pol&amp;fqType=resourceClass:or&amp;fq=resourceClass:text\">Polish</a> text resources have been greatly enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as offering researchers a familiar way of discovering cultural heritage objects relevant to their research, the VLO also provides a direct path to analysis of discovered resources. For example, this <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/15416/Data_Library3_Library3_DCT098003_pdf.html\">18th century pamphlet</a>, offered as a PDF with embedded full text content by the Irish Manuscripts Commission and the Oireachtas Library, <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/record?docId=europeana_58_item_47_15416_47_Data_Library3_Library3_DCT098003_pdf\">can now be found via the VLO</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By going to the Resources view and selecting the <a href=\"https://switchboard.clarin.eu/#/vlo/http%3A%2F%2Fopac.oireachtas.ie%2FData%2FLibrary3%2FLibrary3%2FDCT098003.pdf/application%2Fpdf/eng\">Process with the Language Resource Switchboard</a> option, you see a list of invokable tools - nine at the time of writing. Among the options are grammatical analysis through the Weblicht Dependency Parsing chain and the Voyant suite for computer-assisted text analysis. Note that, although the LRS can be invoked for any resource, it does not have linked tools for all language or resource types, and that a file size limitation applies in the current version. An upcoming version will see this limitation lifted.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>About Henk…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After studying physical geography, I worked in IT and IT-management until mid-2016, but I have always been very interested in history and archaeology (especially landscape archaeology). In 2007 I joined the Dutch National Heritage Agency as an IT-manager and had the opportunity to be involved in Europeana projects like <a href=\"/project/carare\">CARARE </a>and <a href=\"/project/locloud\">LoCloud</a>. Working on cultural heritage with kindred spirits from all over Europe really sparked my passion and when the chance came to become more involved in heritage itself, I changed jobs to become a senior specialist in (pre-)historical landscapes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am working on a politically really hot issue in the Netherlands: soil subsidence and GHG-emissions, their impact on cultural heritage, possible countermeasures and their impact on cultural heritage. Since the beginning of 2019, I have been involved in the use of satellite data (Copernicus Programme) for the exploration, monitoring and management of cultural heritage. A significant part of my work is programs and projects concerning cultural heritage data management, connecting data (using controlled vocabularies) and publishing data, f.i. in Network Digital Heritage (in the Netherlands) and Europeana. Apart from that, I work part of my time as an enterprise architect, aligning business goals, processes and IT and as a Financial Director of CARARE CLG. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think one of the most challenging aspects is that the value of non-movable cultural heritage cannot simply be measured in euro’s and that means it’s always an uphill struggle with competing for economically motivated land use. Therefore it is vitally important that not only specialists, but also the general public can enjoy and appreciate cultural heritage, so decision makers will take the value of cultural heritage into proper account. Apart from being challenges, this is also what I enjoy most in working on with you all!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it of vital importance that Europeana is able to reach the interested general public, showing and connecting especially trans-boundary phenomena (like archaeology) and also using 3D, AR, VR and&nbsp;(as much as possible)&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;storytelling to give people a more real-life cultural heritage experience. I really want to work towards that goal together with my colleagues in the Members Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I will do whatever I can to help make Europeana the place to be for cultural heritage, not only for professionals and researchers but also for the interested general public and schools. &nbsp;And of course, I will be actively involved in communities and the working of the MC itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in finding out about a career in digital cultural heritage?

        title: 'Why we’re now using Instagram to interact with new audiences'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>With over one billion monthly active users, Instagram is fast becoming the place to see and be seen. You can now follow Europeana on Instagram. Find out why we made the leap and how we squared it with our strict sharing policies.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Instagram has been around since 2010, so why hasn’t Europeana embraced it before now? Because our policy was (and still is) to only share openly licensed content and credit it by linking back to its source, usually on Europeana Collections. And Instagram doesn’t let you link to external websites from an individual post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Instagram is becoming too big of an opportunity to pass by so we needed to find a way of being part of that phenomenon without compromising our belief in credit where credit is due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana on Instagram\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-04/screenshot-www.instagram.com-2019.04.03-13-21-09.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\">Europeana on Instagram</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Squaring our sharing policy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We came up with two ways of ensuring that attribution to the source material is always included.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol><li>\r\n    <p>The bio section of an Instagram account does accept external links. So we can use the text ‘Link in bio’ in an image description and put a link to the source material in the main page bio.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>We tag the source institution in the post, so the reader can click through to see where we got an image from.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol><p>As a result, our policy for posting on Instagram is:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We only post public domain or CC0 content that ideally comes from an institution already on Instagram. The only exception to this is if we have express permission for promoting a copyrighted item, for example, one that’s part of a Europeana exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A different audience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram has an audience of (youngish) people who are looking for the visual. They want to see nice images. That’s pretty much it. So every post we make has to have a great picture, and include interesting information in the description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s different to Twitter, which we use to talk to our professional audience, and to Facebook where our followers are looking to be informed - they want to read and click-through. On Instagram, we’re catering to people looking for more artsy, visual inspiration. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we have noticed that lots of institutions who don’t use Twitter as organisations, do use Instagram. They tend to post about their offline activity - the things that people in their museums are doing. When we team up, we present material from their collections and we tag them. It’s a way of connecting our online collections with their offline activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A good start</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Europeana on Instagram\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-04/IMG_20190308_104510_066.jpg\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Europeana's Women's History Month pledge on Instagram</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though we only started posting on Instagram in February, and we have 750 followers, in comparison to the 112,000 followers on Facebook, we are seeing more engagement - comments, likes - on Instagram on a per post basis than on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aleks Strzelichowska, Senior Online Marketing Specialist at the Europeana Foundation (aka our social media guru) says, ‘Instagram followers curate their feed using hashtags and so you often find Instagram posts littered with hashtags. Far more than you’d see on a tweet or Facebook post. If you tag your post with precise hashtags, you can reach specific audiences who just want to discover interesting content and who don’t really care where it comes from. So by using hashtags cleverly, we can reach people who don’t normally come across Europeana.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, we’ve used Instagram to support the Europeana Women’s Season. We promoted the Pioneers exhibition and took over WomenInTheArts for a day, posting artworks from our collections by five women artists from five different countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re testing how frequently we should post and scoping out possible partnerships. We’ve started small but we’re planning to scale up and use ad campaigns to promote posts and grow our following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of our activity on Twitter and Facebook is to generate traffic to Europeana Collections. Instagram really does have the focus on the ‘social’ so we aim to use that for interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/europeana_eu/\"><strong>Follow us on Instagram!</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if your organisation is on Instagram, get in touch - we want to feature your artworks on our feed!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2>Artistic vision and artificial intelligence</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In my five and a half years in the cultural heritage R&amp;D sector and electronic music world at Sound and Vision, I’ve had the privilege of living a dual life. With feet on both sides of the river, I work to bridge the heritage and academic sectors via Europe’s overwhelmingly thriving electronic music community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RE:VIVE is an initiative that facilitates the reuse of heritage material by the electronic music community. EuropeanaTech is Europeana’s R&amp;D community, a long-running and active community that fuels technical experiments, development and the international interoperability of standards and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To some, these two worlds may seem like an odd couple but in reality, both need one another if we hope to really push the limits of technology, creativity, access and story-telling. That’s why I was inspired to organise the Instrumental Shifts Symposium at Rewire Festival. To be a matchmaker and open the doors for both parties. It’s an opportunity to show off research and tools related to AI and music juxtaposed with artists putting some of this research into practice with the adage ‘let’s work together’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The added value you see through academic and creative collaboration is that artists can valorise, disseminate and humanise the computationally intensive and meticulous R&amp;D work being done by universities or other knowledge institutes. That’s not to say artists can’t do heavy computing or that universities can’t be artistic but when one hand washes the other we can generate a stream of specialised knowledge transfer and experiential expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the genesis of what we now call electronic music, those forging new paths were half-artist, half-engineering masters based in institutes of technology or higher learning. From Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française, where Pierre Schaeffer was working, to Daphne Oram at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, these R&amp;D departments were hubs of musical innovation and creativity. But as computing and instruments became more compact, affordable and useable, creativity moved towards the home or personal studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But now, as music begins to explore new frontiers of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing and future technologies, where copious amounts of data, processing power and budget are necessities, the conditions for adequate experimentation are changing. That’s why, I hope to encourage a return to the fold with the Instrumental Shifts Symposium where the academic R&amp;D world and practising musicians can work more collaboratively and expressively.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2>Inspiration from the Instrumental Shifts Symposium</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Instrumental Shifts Symposium at Rewire Festival was a brilliant example of the crossovers already happening between these worlds. The day began with Dr Thor Magnusson presenting his book Sonic Writing, which explores how contemporary music technologies trace their ancestry to previous forms of instruments and media. While the role of music in society may never change, the way we consume and produce it will, just like it always has. For heritage institutes, music can teach us a lot about society. Machine listening can lead us to discover more about music, giving us a new, deeper understanding of European cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research being done by Professor Anja Volk at Utrecht University, Professor Peter Bloem at VU Amsterdam, &nbsp;Hibiki Mukai from The Hague and Enrique Manjavacas as well suggests how cultural heritage materials can lead to projects that progress our understanding of music and society as well as creating new ways for artists to generate music. Examples range from real-time chord identification, generative music based on analysing archival films, text generation based on the study of Shakespeare and new algorithms for generating traditional Japanese music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For RE:VIVE, the essential remit is seeing how cultural heritage and electronic music can merge to offer new artistic perceptions of the past. At the Instrumental Shifts Symposium, this came to fruition through a collaboration between Dr Bob Sturm and Hague-based saxophonist and producer, Laura Agnusdei. Sturm, project leader for FolkRNN, a platform known for its massive corpus of generative Swedish and Irish folk music, presented how they continue to consult with the folk community to not only test the technical aspects of the outputs but also the social ones, e.g. how is this music, that’s so deeply beloved by many, perceived when it’s made by an algorithm. We invited Agnusdei to collaborate with FolkRNN and turn the generated compositions into a new contemporary piece. She teamed up with violist and composer Lauge Dideriksen and the new piece perfectly merged the worlds of experimental composition and traditional music.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wherever we’re going, let’s go together</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A partnership like the one between Agnusdei and Sturm is what I wanted to inspire with the Instrumental Shifts Symposium. As R&amp;D departments in cultural and academic institutes begin to explore new frontiers of creative computing and artificial intelligence, in the end it will be the artistic impression that allows the audience to truly connect with it. Technical knowledge led to sheet music and the construction of instruments but it’s the artists that breathe life into it. And as we learned from Professor Mick Grierson and Roisin Loughran, for the time being, that job will remain with humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/contribute-to-europeanatech\">EuropeanaTech</a> and learn more about <a href=\"http://www.revivethis.org\">RE:VIVE</a></strong></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Last month, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-11-generous-interfaces\">EuropeanaTech published a new edition of EuropeanaTech Insight on Generous Interfaces</a>, The term, coined by Mitchell Whitelaw refers to interfaces that, ‘offer rich, browsable views; provide evocative samples of primary content; and support an understanding of context and relationships’. As members of the EuropeanaTech community, we at the Swedish National Heritage Board have contributed an article to that issue about an evaluation of generous interfaces that we’ve recently concluded. As part of the evaluation, we developed a\_<a href=\"https://riksantikvarieambetet.github.io/Generous-Interface-Fashion/\">prototype generous interface application of our own</a>. Its source code is open and in terms of content selection, it acts as a client of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis\">Europeana API</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Publishing our prototype as <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion\">open source</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion/wiki/Setup-our-Generous-Interface-for-your-own-Images#changing-the-logo\">with no logo</a>, and basing it on content drawn from Europeana Collections has two purposes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>\r\n    <p>Make it simple (also: quick and cheap) to quickly set up a generous interface prototype, populate it with a selection of content, and start testing it with users.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>Make it interesting to\_many cultural heritage institutions with as much content from Europeana Collections as possible.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://riksantikvarieambetet.github.io/Generous-Interface-Fashion/\"><img alt=\"Generous interface prototype\" src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-04/GI.PNG\" style=\"width: 800px\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Swedish National Heritage Board's prototype generous interface</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choosing your content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The generous interface application is designed to work best with colourful images from a selection of a few thousand items. Users are able to browse and filter the selected images based on colours and tags extracted using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vision/\">Google Vision</a>. The interaction is, by design, intended to support exploratory discovery where finding inspiration and facilitating a sense of serendipity is more important than efficient ‘known item or entity search’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that you should take care in your selection of Europeana images to include. Ideally, they\_should be colourful, somehow thematically related, and it must be possible to express the selection\_with a Europeana API query.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to start with a suggestion from the team behind the prototype application, why not choose <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BIMAGE_COLOUR%5D%5B%5D=true&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=open&amp;f%5BTYPE%5D%5B%5D=IMAGE&amp;per_page=48&amp;q=%22art+nouveau%22&amp;qf%5B%5D=what%3A+%28poster+OR+jewellery+OR+ceramics+OR+glass+OR+furniture+OR+textile%29&amp;view=grid&amp;f%5BREUSABILITY%5D%5B%5D=restricted\">a selection of Art Nouveau images</a>? Or start even simpler with a<a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion/wiki/Setup-our-Generous-Interface-for-your-own-Images#using-your-own-data\"> sub-selection of Art Nouveau posters</a>\_and then increase the amount of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Instructions and support</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re a software or web developer you should be able to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion/wiki/Setup-our-Generous-Interface-for-your-own-Images\">instructions laid out in the GitHub repo</a> and set up your own instance of the application. Familiarity with the Europeana and Google Vision APIs will make things quicker, but if you’re new to them, creating an instance of this application is also a good way to get started with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you run into trouble setting up an instance following the <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion/wiki/Setup-our-Generous-Interface-for-your-own-Images\">instructions,</a> you’re very welcome to <a href=\"https://github.com/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion/issues\">create an issue in our Github</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>From creating educational resources to entertaining GIFs, and from sharing personal migration stories to developing professional expertise at EuropeanaTech, discover ten highlights from 2018 in the Europeana Foundation's Annual Report.\_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>2018 - a big year for us here at the Europeana Foundation. We celebrated ten years since the first Europeana website went live. We said goodbye to our founding executive director, Jill Cousins. We renewed our relationship with the European Commission and the Member States. And we made strides in improving our processes and products. To me, it feels a little like Europeana has come of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve been supported in my new role as executive director by an ever-dedicated and committed team at the Europeana Foundation - and I must here welcome our new technical director, Andy Neale - as well as a Governing Board that has incredible vision, drive and expertise, an innovative Aggregators’ Forum and a Network Association that never stops moving forward. My heartfelt thanks goes to each and every person whose hard work and commitment has played its part in our achievements this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2018 was, of course, the European Year of Cultural Heritage, a year-long operation by the European Commission to get more people interested in and involved with cultural heritage. We happily joined them in this mission, running an ambitious campaign on the theme of cultural heritage and migration. The Bulgarian and Austrian presidencies of the Council of the EU gave us opportunities to support EYCH and to have an input into its legacy, whilst positioning Europeana at the centre of digital cultural heritage for the next decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under our new service contract with the European Commission, the Europeana Foundation leads a consortium to operate the Europeana Core Service Platform. Following the direction outlined in the Evaluation of Europeana, we are shifting our focus to\_supporting cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation. This year we’ve worked on improving systems and infrastructure behind the scenes, making it easier and more rewarding for our data partners to share collections with us. And we’ve improved how those collections are displayed and linked online, making finding and working with them a much more inviting and productive endeavour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From creating educational resources to entertaining GIFs, and from sharing personal migration stories to developing professional expertise at EuropeanaTech, it is always a thrill to see how Europe’s digital cultural heritage is increasingly being integrated into and transforming lives on a day-to-day basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Discover ten of my <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/annual-report-2018\">highlights from this significant year</a>, or <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Europeana%20Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202018.pdf\">download the full report and accounts</a>.</strong></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Speaking at Digital Day 2019 on 9 April, Harry Verwayen, Europeana Foundation Executive Director, said that the Digitising Cultural Heritage declaration was a 'sign of confidence' that\_the European Union sees the cultural heritage sector as of great social and economic relevance to Europe.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Digital Day 2019, the third of its kind, was an opportunity for the EU and Member States to pool resources to accelerate digital developments to bring tangible benefits to our economies and societies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CskgpgcVdg\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Digitising Cultural Heritage declaration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the day, EU Member States signed a\_declaration on digitising cultural heritage. Building on the momentum of the\_<a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/european-year-cultural-heritage_en\">European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018</a>, the declaration aims to advance digitisation of heritage artefacts, monuments and sites, as well as foster citizen engagement and cross-border cooperation.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's what Europeana Foundation Executive Director, Harry Verwayen, had to say at the event:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Without a doubt this declaration is a very important initiative. Here are three elements that I believe are particularly relevant to our sector that I would like to highlight:</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>1. Ten\_years ago, the European Union took a bold and enlightened decision; it decided that our cultural heritage was too important to be left to market forces alone to decide if and how our heritage was made available to its citizens. We decided to take the future in our own hands. From that big idea, Europeana was born.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Ten years later, Europe has a platform where close to 4,000 libraries, museums and archives have made over 50 million items from their collections available, in formats that allow use and reuse by researchers, creatives and interested citizens.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Europe did not invest in the next Google. I think it invested in something more important than that; it invested in interoperability. \_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Europeana model, which leaves sovereignty in the hands of the institutions but is based on cooperation and shared standards, has become an export product that is being copied across the world, from the US to India, and from Mexico to Japan.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Interoperability is Europe’s business model and this declaration strengthens that notion. \_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>2. Secondly, I read this declaration as a sign of confidence of the European Union that this sector is indeed a contributor of great social and economic relevance to Europe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>As the New Agenda for Culture has highlighted, Museums, libraries and archives are an integral part of a cultural and creative industry that contributes over 4.2% to the GDP of Europe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Clearly marking the shift from the 20th to the 21st century, it employs more people than the automotive and the manufacturing industries.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We have also learned that this sector grew much faster than average during a period of economic crisis and that it employs more young professionals than any other sector.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This declaration emphasises that the cultural heritage sector should be seen as an R&amp;D lab, an investment with a high return. \_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>3. In order to stay competitive in an age of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we will need to step up our game. So most importantly, this declaration highlights the political will at the European level to make a significant change in the role we see for cultural heritage in the future. \_</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Investments in 3D will lead to applications that change the way we teach, that will help to regenerate our cities, and that\_can contribute to social cohesion.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>As part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018, Europeana in partnership with museums, galleries, libraries and archives across Europe, held 18 collection days in 12 countries on the theme of migration.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>People, young and old, shared <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002%2A&amp;view=grid\">their migration stories</a>, with material such as pictures, diaries, videos and letters. More than 600 stories were shared - both at the events and online -\_with just under 1,000 objects digitised. In total, more than 3,000 people attended events which included collection days, exhibitions, debates and lectures.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the campaign, we surveyed those taking part - whether they were organising events, sharing their stories or reading our editorial. We’re happy to now share a short summary of what we found out. \_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRjXIM8tuPs\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>European Year of Cultural Heritage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>2018 was the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/cultural-heritage/european-year-cultural-heritage_en\">European Year of Cultural Heritage</a>. Europeana Migration was our major contribution to the year. Our partners told us that being part of the Europeana Foundation’s contribution to the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 was an important motivation for them.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tibor Navracsics, European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-19-2069_en.htm\">said</a>, ‘The Europeana migration campaign – helping people to re-discover their roots and make them aware of the value of diversity – is just one example of how Europeana has been helping to make heritage resources more accessible, engaging citizens with digitised heritage and promoting the use and re-use of digital content for educational purposes.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a truly collaborative campaign with more than 40 partners.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partners, when surveyed, told us that the project led them to establish new relationships with other organisations, as well as helping them attract new audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mervyn Greene, of <a href=\"https://www.epicchq.com/\">EPIC The Irish Emigration Museum</a>, says, ‘Europeana Migration has transformed how we engage with the public. It has provided us with the impetus and the platform to engage with new Irish communities allowing us to build connections, not just collections.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to cultural heritage organisations, we brought the campaign to education settings too. We worked with the British School in the Netherlands to embed the campaign into their education modules. More than 50 schoolchildren, along with their families and teachers, chose and wrote about an object to signify their (or their families’) migration stories. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/children-s-migration-stories-how-a-school-brought-europeana-migration-alive-in-the-classroom\">Read a case study about this</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br><strong>The value of participation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surveying those who shared a story, we saw that everyone who replied found it a positive experience. After sharing their story, a majority of respondents reported a more positive view of their identity, higher levels of self-esteem and self-confidence.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One participant said, ‘I decided to share my story because… it is one that I am proud of. I learned that it has defined me as a person and this is important… [and] I have achieved more in life than I thought.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participants said it was important to record and preserve their own, their family’s and their community’s stories and histories relating to migration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One participant said, ‘Knowing history is the best way to learn about who we are why we do what we do and to avoid to repeat mistakes. I wanted to share my story to contribute to the collective knowledge of history.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Read more</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've expanded on the findings above and described the campaign and its results, to add more context, in this presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQkd2lUJ5m5veimqbshVMMukm6lr0Koi0nAq9EaK58PBvhjExiDFMjMp1GbDWzagsbKw9CtoQaJm9SD/embed?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://migration.europeana.eu\">migration thematic collection</a> continues to be a part of Europeana Collections, and we have developed a <a href=\"http://contribute.europeana.eu/migration\">participation platform to share and publish user-generated migration stories</a>. You can download more <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration\">information and templates for organising events here</a>. If you have any questions, or are interested in sharing stories from your family, community or project, or holding an event of your own, please contact <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/adrian-murphy\">Adrian Murphy</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Migration would not have been possible without the cooperation of many people and organisations across Europe. We thank the organisations and Europeana Network members who hosted and organised events, those who spread the news about the campaign, and, most of all, people across Europe who shared their personal stories with us. They made this campaign.\_<br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n"

                templates: body
                body: "<h2><a href=\"/project/3d-content-in-europeana\">3D content in Europeana</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A ENA Task Force has been set up with the aim of increasing the inclusion of 3D cultural heritage in Europeana Collections and to make it available for use in education, research and in the creative industries. The expected outcomes are 1. Development of guidance and FAQs for 3D creators and cultural heritage institutions on publishing 3D media online in the context of Europeana and its users. 2. Identify viewers and 3D media formats recommended for support in Europeana Collections, and means of linking and embedding 3D content for Europeana and Europeana aggregators. 3. Development of the Europeana Publishing Framework to provide guidelines for 3D objects at each tier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Artificial Intelligence in the Europeana context</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective of this activity is to do a horizon-scanning exercise and to start investigating the expected role and impact of AI in the digital cultural heritage domain. The expected outcomes of this activity will be an Initiation Document (position paper/white paper) that will collect use cases and set the pointers for future work, e.g. dedicated TF proposal, pilots, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><a href=\"/project/interoperability-of-annotations-and-user-sets\">Interoperability of annotations and user sets</a></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A ENA Task Force has been set up with the aim of fostering interoperability across the applications and projects in the Europeana context that produce, publish and/or consume annotations and user sets, by maturing the specifications that are used in the process, notably in terms of data models and APIs. The expected outcomes are: 1. Identify relevant cases for annotations and user sets coming from different projects. Identify different categories of annotations in scope, what types of requirements these annotations need to answer. 2. Formalise best practices and specifications to make the data interoperable, focusing on existing EDM profiles for annotations and user sets and APIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Implementation of EPF 2.0</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data quality remains a central issue for Europeana. Identification of tools, examples, etc, is needed to help data providers better understand how to implement the <a href=\"/post/the-europeana-publishing-framework-the-more-you-give-the-more-you-get\">EPF guidelines</a>. The expected outcome of this activity is a position paper to create deeper understanding of the options and workflow parameters for the implementation of the metadata quality requirements of the EPF 2.0. Once this is better understood, awareness-raising activities could be developed for data providers and aggregators. This can be done in partnership with relevant experts from the Europeana Aggregators' Forum, the Data Quality Committee, Europeana Common Culture and other Generic Services projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of these activities will investigate potential for synergies and collaborations for planning, running and delivering other projects and programmes within (and when relevant, outside) the Europeana context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EuropeanaTech steering group will also try to keep an overview of different (research)projects, programmes and more specialised communities and encourage them to share knowledge and results within the community.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Reducing costs and increasing development productivity through CMS outsourcing'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Europeana Collections is in an exciting new phase of development. In this article, we’ll cover how we’re using new technologies to make better use of our resources and time.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/\">Europeana Collections</a> has been developed to support a growing need for better access to cultural heritage content in multiple formats. Our audiences want a range of ways to search and discover content within our ever-growing corpus, from searching and browsing to discovery through editorially curated material. As with any project of this kind, as functionality and systems are added, technical debt - the time spent on maintenance - increases. Europeana Collections is currently powered by three content management systems (CMS), with two front-end applications. It has made us ask the question: How can we refocus our efforts and spend less time on administration and maintenance, and more time on building a great front-end experience?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past three months, our development team of three has focussed on the goal of simplifying our technical stack, in order to reduce and automate where necessary to allow us to focus our time into providing a great user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Going headless</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>CMSs have evolved from being tightly coupled and highly controlling over the front-end output, to being disconnected and accessible via APIs which allows the client to display the content as they wish. For the updated Europeana Collections website, we’re moving to a headless CMS - a CMS which has no direct coupling with the front-end and makes the content available via an <a href=\"/resources/apis/intro\">API</a>. We carried out a lot of research to decide on a system both suitable for our rich editorial content and able to work with the APIs that surface cultural heritage objects from our collection. We chose <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/\">Contentful</a>\_to deliver this experience. As a headless CMS, Contentful will store all of our editorial content including blogs, exhibitions and galleries. Flexible content modelling allows us to output the content exactly as we wish, not just as the CMS dictates. Quite crucially for us, with a corpus upwards of 50 million items, it allows us to dynamically pull content into the CMS so that we can build curated and automated pages exactly as we wish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Flexible modelling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Contentful works on very flexible content modelling, not restricting us to ‘Page’ or ‘Post’ as per traditional CMS, but allowing us to decide what we want to model. Where we currently have a different CMS to support blog posts, exhibitions and galleries, we can treat all of these formats as different content models in Contentful. These are then available for us to retrieve from the Contentful API and display on the front-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major benefit for us is that we go from maintaining three CMS to maintaining no CMS, instead focussing on a front-end and back-end application that renders this data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we’ve saved and gained</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the usage of the Contentful headless CMS, we’ve saved months in development time and trying to adapt a CMS which solves our problems. We’ve been able to flexibly model the content without having to do any coding whatsoever. It’s meant that in mere weeks we’ve been able to create a nearly complete website and CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve already begun training staff internally on how to curate pages with the CMS, which has been picked up with ease. Not needing to focus on building a great experience for staff and editors has meant we’ve been able to dedicate all of our focus on building a great user-facing portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming months, you’ll be able to see the results of our effort as we begin to release improvements to our existing products.</p>\r\n"

Whilst the early stages of tech influence in the cultural sector saw cultural heritage institutions digitising their objects and making them available online (or incorporating other forms of technology into their work practices) this has progressed far beyond practical digitisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society recently argued that the term ‘digital’ was becoming increasingly defunct in a digital world, stating ‘...digital is not a sector. Digital is not a thing. Digital is everything’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If digital is everything, the challenge now facing European leaders is to secure that progression and to manage the outcomes - societal and technical - and the next stages of technological advancement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today, Europe is competitive and world-leading in its infrastructures supporting digital cultural heritage - the result of significant investment from the EU and Members States. New technologies such as 3D, bring new challenges and the advent of game-changers, such as AI, signals the need to revisit and recommit to our approach. &nbsp;So what should be the next steps in Europe’s cultural innovation leadership?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Europeana Foundation Executive Director Harry Verwayen, ‘We need to think about infrastructure in a wider sense - taking into account the role that communities play and develop shared policies and frameworks that make things fluid throughout the Digital Single Market. Now &nbsp;is the time to make sure that the platforms and infrastructures supporting and driving digital transformation in the cultural heritage sector are strong and resilient.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n"

Data at the European Commission said, ‘Millions of content items on Europeana would have not been possible without national support, national infrastructures and over 3,700 institutions themselves opening up their collections online and contributing to this EU initiative’.</p>\r\n"

And <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kl.nl/publicaties/research-paper-the-accuracy-rights-statements-on-europeana-eu/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1556916259580000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExEv0-a6yLZ5PC2Iitnej3YV6qyA\">research published by Kennisland in 2018</a>&nbsp;showed that 62% of objects were labelled by data partners with an accurate rights statement. &nbsp;So some significant progress was made, but <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/62-of-rights-statements-are-accurate-together-we-can-improve-on-that\">our gut feeling was that there was much more that could be done</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.kl.nl/publicaties/research-paper-a-look-at-the-accuracy-of-edmrights-in-the-europeana-database/\">a third research report by Kennisland assessed the accuracy of rights information in the highest quality images shared through Europeana</a> - those qualifying for Tier’s 3 &amp; 4 of the Publishing Framework. &nbsp;It showed a very different picture: &nbsp;just 38% of labels were accurate. &nbsp;The remainder a combination of mixed, inaccurate or unable to determine. &nbsp; &nbsp;The main causes centred around probable misuse of <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/\">Creative Commons tools and licences</a> in the form of two main scenarios; either it’s unlikely the rights holder gave permission for a particular licence, or no copyright subsists in the work so a licence cannot be applied. &nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>A&nbsp;legacy of the 2013 rights labelling campaign, starting in the same year,&nbsp;was the embedding&nbsp;in the data ingestion process of&nbsp;checks and balances to detect and address the most significant issues raised&nbsp;in the 2012 research. &nbsp;Issues such as claiming copyright on a public domain work - going against the principles embedded in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">the Europeana Public Domain Charter</a>&nbsp;that digitisation should not create any new rights.&nbsp; But the recent research has shone a light of a different set of issues, the misuse - a harsh but accurate term - of Creative Commons tools and licences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we have seen first hand over these years&nbsp;that cultural heritage institutions struggle with applying accurate rights statements to their digital objects. &nbsp;And that this challenge does not seem to be going anywhere soon. &nbsp;At this week’s <a href=\"https://ccglobalsummit2019lisbonportugal.sched.com/\">Creative Commons Summit</a>, Lisette Kalshoven - who in previous roles at Kennisland co-authored all of the research into accuracy of rights in Europeana data - will be addressing this very issue - <a href=\"https://ccglobalsummit2019lisbonportugal.sched.com/event/MhLD/how-do-we-get-more-accurate-rights-statements-out-of-glams\">How do we get more accurate rights statements from GLAMs?</a>&nbsp; (Take a look - the Summit is jam packed full of <a href=\"https://summit.creativecommons.org/program/\">great sessions</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can also see that it’s a conversation that is wider than Europeana, our data partners and Network Association members. &nbsp;For us it’s a familiar conversation, but perhaps it’s new to you; so let’s take a look back on what we have learned in seven years, how we bring that experience forward throughout 2019 and perhaps give you an insight into <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/rights-labelling-campaign-reaches-its-final-phase\">why we took 18 months to finish that very first rights campaign</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1 Consistency is our best friend</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My colleagues in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/our-mission/office-employees#data-partner-services\">Data Partner Services Team</a> are responsible for working with you, our data partners, to review, refine and publish their data. It’s also their role to raise issues of accuracy. &nbsp;Over the years, the amount of data they handle and the number of data partners have increased significantly, and the people in the team have changed, but the criteria for achieving accurate rights information has always been consistent. &nbsp;Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Publishing Guide</a> - first developed in 2014 - aligns our working practices with the standards, such as the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/europeana-licensing-framework\">Licensing</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Publishing</a> Frameworks, that we use, establishing the acceptance criteria for data. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019 we continue our conversations around rights but with a new focus on the accuracy of how Creative Commons tools and licences are used, to address the inaccuracies that stem from their misuse. &nbsp;To support the Data Partner Services Team, who received copyright training by Kennisland earlier this year, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">the Publishing Guide</a> will be updated to more clearly define how we approach improving accuracy with Creative Commons tools and licences.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2 Our priorities are not (often) your priorities, we must&nbsp;narrow that&nbsp;gap</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think we can agree, no-one actually wants rights information for their digital objects &amp; collections to be inaccurate. &nbsp;However our ambitions over the years to address this haven’t always aligned with the priorities of our data partners. &nbsp;Challenged by a lack of resources, time and often lack of access to expertise, we have learned to anticipate that our data partners will need (a lot of) time to respond to rights queries. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What we think is a simple query to solve, often takes months to work its way through organisational processes. &nbsp;But it’s important to get it right, so in 2019, we’re going to explore ways to better match our ambition addressing inaccuracies in rights information with your priorities, such as aligning them with updates to your datasets. &nbsp;We also have some incentives for partners wanting to improve their rights information, as accuracy of the rights statement becomes a factor in determining where and how we can share your high quality data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It’s a difficult subject to master in depth, but 99% of you that I meet, underestimate how much you know and understand. &nbsp;And whilst talking about copyright sometimes elicits groans from the people around us, I’m always really impressed with how open and eager you are to learn more about this complex topic (and actually, how many of you want to do this).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright#copyright-reform\">advocates of better copyright rules for cultural heritage institutions</a>, we have the privilege of working with experts in the field of copyright. &nbsp;In 2019, we’ll continue to work with experts in the field, but I also want to hear more from you. &nbsp;I’ve read and heard lots of great examples of copyright and rights statement workflows, about challenges you’ve overcome, and workshops and courses you’ve run. &nbsp;Through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">the copyright community</a>, you have the opportunity to share this with a captive audience, and to learn from each other. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#4 Being transparent is really hard, we must do better</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We really want to tell you how you are doing. &nbsp;In previous years we’ve experimented with dashboards to give context to your collections amongst the wider dataset available through Europeana Collections. &nbsp;But automating the assessment of rights information is a long long way off. For one thing, we don’t have the&nbsp;data that we need - such as consistent date information for each digital object -&nbsp;to use to make automated calculations. If you take <a href=\"http://outofcopyright.eu/\">the public domain calculator</a> - a decison making process so complex that printed out in very small print&nbsp;it fills a wall from floor to ceiling - you'll see how critical this information is, and how useful it would be to have&nbsp;(you can download the flowchart&nbsp;at the end of this article).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as we make progress in the coming year towards improving the accuracy of rights information, we will experiment with different ways of showing overall progress - so how far we’ve come with improving the accuracy of rights statements from that original 38% accuracy of the highest quality data. &nbsp;And we want to share more examples of the route our partners have taken to improving the accuracy of their statements, so that you can learn from us, and from each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>We're\_delighted to announce more details about our 2019 Europeana conference/Network Association AGM, at the National Library of Portugal, Lisbon on 27-29 November 2019. \_</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Europeana 2019</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A big thank you to everyone who submitted an idea for the name of our event, we loved reading your suggestions. In the end we decided to go for an event series name that’s really simple and can be used with any future theme: Europeana 2019. As for our theme this year, we were inspired by many of your suggestions (our favourite from Barbara Lovrinić - congratulations Barbara, we’ll be in touch about your free ticket), and settled on Connect Communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Connect Communities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no one-size-fits-all cultural heritage professional - your roles, your institutions, your passions and your skills are incredibly wide-ranging. Europeana 2019 makes the connection between you all. At this unique interdisciplinary event 250 professionals with interests in tech, copyright, education, research, impact and communications will come together to explore where those communities meet and how each specialist group can support the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get up, get involved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This three-day conference at the National Library of Portugal, Lisbon, isn’t simply three days listening to others talk. It’s a real hands-on affair with workshops, discussions, panels, interaction and networking. Attend, contribute and transform the world with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No hierarchies here</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our prestigious keynote speakers are not off limits. You can talk to them, take part in a panel discussion with them, drink tea with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bring home new skills</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it’s tips on how to run a workshop, insights into the best approach to opening up content, new ideas for digital storytelling, or new people to follow up on Twitter, you can go back to your day job with tangible new skills, experiences and contacts to help you make a difference to your organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join Europeana and our friends at Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana 2019 is being held at the historic National Library of Portugal, Lisbon, whose vast and diversified heritage covers almost ten centuries of Portuguese history and culture.\_Free tours of the library will be offered to attendees, giving a unique insight into this prestigious institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main conference will start at 17:00 on Wednesday 27 November. We will hold free pre-conference workshops during the day on Wednesday 27 and advise participants to consider arriving on the evening of 26 November or early on 27 November to make the most of these.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dinner on Thursday 28 November will kindly be provided by the National Library of Portugal, and we are also planning something to celebrate the opening evening of Europeana 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More details about the programme will be announced shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Early-bird tickets now available</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a limited number (90) of early-bird tickets available and we expect these to sell out quickly. Early-bird tickets are €175 and are on sale until 23:59 July 31 2019 (or until they sell out).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular tickets will cost €225.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect tickets to sell quickly, so to ensure your attendance <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/europeana-2019-tickets-61030544000\">secure your ticket today</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Network Association members will be eligible for reimbursement up to a maximum €400 for your stay (travel and accommodation costs) if you book your tickets before 15 September 2019. Please check our Europeana 2019\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/rules-for-reimbursement-europeana-2019\">reimbursement rules</a> on Europeana Pro.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>What is going on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The European Commission is investing one million euros in the preparatory phase of a new project called <a href=\"https://timemachine.eu/\">Time Machine</a>. It is one of the most ambitious research projects in the field of cultural heritage and emerging technology, and brings together over 280 institutions from 33 European countries, and counting. We consider it very complementary to the Europeana ambitions and you’ll be hearing a lot more about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Time Machine all about?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s the pitch: ‘Time Machine aims to develop the Big Data of the Past, a huge distributed digital information system mapping the European social, cultural and geographical evolution across times. This large-scale digitisation and computing infrastructure will enable Europe to turn its long history, as well as its multilingualism and multiculturalism, into a living social and economic resource.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlvTARiC5fM\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In practice, the project is comprised of three interrelated components:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly it aims to accelerate the digitisation of cultural heritage using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to, for example, make handwritten texts machine readable. The result of this will be that ‘Big Data from the Past’ that the pitch above hints at. Note that currently only about 22% of our &nbsp;cultural heritage has been digitised (<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/ENUMERATE/deliverables/DSI-2_Deliverable%20D4.4_Europeana_Report%20on%20ENUMERATE%20Core%20Survey%204.pdf\">Report on ENUMERATE Core Survey 4 Report</a>, 2017, p.6). The more cultural heritage data we can digitise, and the more of that data that is open, public and free, the closer we can get to making our Time Machine.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Secondly, the project aims to create a (distributed) infrastructure through which that data can be accessed. But data alone is not enough. It will be combined with tools that allow you to interpret and visualise that data in interesting new ways.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Thirdly, the project wants to make that infrastructure available to anyone who has a need for it. Think about the trend analyses a digital humanities scholar can perform with all this data, how teachers can make history classes more interesting, how much more insight and depth visitors to our cities can experience.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sounds familiar? <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />These are some of the challenges that we have been working on at Europeana and which Time Machine can build on. But Time Machine pursues a unique central vision - putting time and space centre stage. This will eventually allow us to create spaces in which you can interpret an environment, over a period of time. Think of a publicly-owned version of Google Earth in which you can slide back in time and explore what your street looked like 10, 20, 100 years before. Think of that wearing augmented reality glasses that allow you to virtually explore the space around you, and you are pretty close to what the project has in mind. That is <a href=\"http://timemachine.eu/time-machines\">why cities</a> like Amsterdam, Venice, Budapest and Utrecht are driving forces in the initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A good read into what such a future could look like is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/mirrorworld-ar-next-big-tech-platform/\">this article from Kevin Kelly</a> in Wired Magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">So, what does the Europeana Foundation have to do with Time Machine?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With a pretty big ambition of its own - to transform the world with culture - the Europeana Foundation is a driver of the open culture movement in Europe, operating with a strong ethic of innovation and collaboration. In our role as operator of the Europeana Initiative, we have worked with the European Commission, the Member States, the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum and the Europeana Network Association to develop building blocks (think data model standards, rights statements frameworks, ways to think about impact and ethics, etc.) that enable Time Machine to become a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vice versa, we are hoping that we and our network will benefit from the research and innovation that will come out of Time Machine. We are always looking at what’s on the horizon - the potential uses and challenges of emerging technologies such as 3D, big data, artificial intelligence. What do they mean for digital culture right now and how do we harness their transformative potential for the future? Time Machine offers us the opportunity to explore these questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Harry Verwayen, Europeana Foundation Executive Director, who last night participated in a panel discussion entitled ‘Virtual travels through space and time: the Time Machine project’, says: ‘Europeana exists because the European Union made a bold decision - that the digital future of Europe’s cultural heritage was too important to leave to market forces (and commercial enterprises) alone. Empowering our cultural institutions to develop capacity in the fields of AI and machine learning is critical for the future of the public space.’</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Follow the Time Machine project</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep up to date with Time Machine at <a href=\"https://timemachine.eu/\">timemachine.eu</a>, on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/timemachineeu/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0MCkgpe_RCjUs1B0n7XbEQ\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TimeMachineEU\">Twitter</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The <a href=\"https://abcd.tdwg.org/3.0/\">Access to Biological Collections Data</a> (ABCD) Schema is a long-standing, evolving and comprehensive standard for the access to and exchange of data about specimens from natural history collections and field observations also known as primary biodiversity data. It is compatible with several existing data standards. The potential for the application of ABCD extends to internal networks, or in-house legacy data access. ABCD is also one of the several models that can be transformed and mapped to EDM by the <a href=\"http://www.open-up.eu/en\">OpenUp!</a> aggregator. <a href=\"http://www.foss-rec.net/21/47/2018/fr-21-47-2018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Content providers deliver their data in the ABCD(EFG) schema</a> to OpenUp! using the BioCASe technology, making their content freely available on Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABCD is already foreseen to be the main standard for natural history collections used in both current and upcoming projects and research infrastructure initiatives in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s new?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So what has been improved with ABCD 3.0? Lots. A new XML Schema was developed and modifications were made regarding element reuse (simplification, more consistent naming, etc.). Requests from the community were also fulfilled and necessary harmonisation with the ABCD 3.0 ontology was achieved. Excitingly, it’s the first time that ABCD is described as XML and ontology. This increases the application and usage of the standard through semantic queries and serves as a basis for future developments of software and services in the semantic web environment. Additionally, different application schemata can be created that integrate elements from the ABCD ontology and more. This helps users to determine the most appropriate elements for the publication of their data.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/Europeana_Professional/Blog/mareike2.png\" /></p>\r\n<em>Image: Miltitzia lutea (Hook. &amp; Arn.) A. DC., Royal Botanic Garden Kew. Provider: OpenUp! License: <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</a></em></center>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first use case, an <a href=\"https://abcd.tdwg.org/xml/documentation/ABCD_3.0_zoology/\" target=\"_blank\">Application Schema for Zoological Collection Data</a> was developed. This XML schema is a subset of ABCD 3.0 and only contains elements important for the publication and exchange of information describing zoological collection objects. Beside elements of general importance (e.g. contact person, holding institution), more specific elements like scientific name, preparation of the specimen or its developmental stage are also included. More Application Schemata are planned including ones for geoscientific collection objects including minerals/rocks, fossils and meteorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These changes and updates allowed ABCD to keep up with dynamic changes in the technological ecosystem. 20 years ago, ABCD was developed solely as a XML standard that was hierarchically structured with about 1,500 single elements. It was perfect for that time since XML is both human and machine readable. However, now there are new possibilities - single elements are addressable and concepts can be linked to other standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Community needs and feedback</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the time (2015-2019) ABCD 3.0 was developed, the team from the Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin and Museum für Naturkunde Berlin presented their plan at various conferences and organised workshops with different scientific communities. They were able to collect requirements for an appropriate data standard. The findings from these workshops were also used to revise single elements and create the Application Schemata. And, after the funding phase, both institutions will maintain the standard and work on new developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As not much time has passed since its release, ABCD 3.0 hasn’t received much feedback from the community yet. However, the responses regarding the new possibilities that it allows have been positive. The former version, ABCD 2.06, is a ratified <a href=\"https://www.tdwg.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TDWG</a> standard (Biodiversity Information Standards). A ratification of ABCD 3.0 is planned for this year. In addition to an expert review, TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards) runs a community review, through which everybody is invited to give feedback and ideas for improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The future is bright for ABCD 3.0 and its role as the main standard for projects and research infrastructure initiatives in Europe. The team behind ABCD 3.0 hopes to work more closely with experts on other domain standards on particular topics such as earth science specimens and to have the ability to cite each others' elements correctly before creating new ones which is a big step towards more interoperable and interlinked natural history data, following the Linked Open Data principles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about ABCD 3.0 you can find the Schema at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://abcd.tdwg.org/\">abcd.tdwg.org/</a> and on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/tdwg/abcd\">GitHub</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re interested in learning more about taxonomies for biodiversity data you can read <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/post/taxonomies-for-natural-history-collections\">Jörg Holetschek's post</a>.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Professionals in Focus: Flavia Bruni, librarian at ICCU, Italy'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Are you interested in the interesting and complex jobs in digital cultural heritage? So are we. So each month we are going to take a deep dive into the work of professionals in the sector. This time, we speak with newly elected Members Councillor<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/flavia-bruni\"> Flavia Bruni</a> on 16th-century books and national cataloguing.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>About Flavia…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Immediately after my graduation in History of the Age of the Reformation and Counter-reformation, I joined a research project on 16th-century book inventories. This prompted my need for expertise on early printed books, and especially how to describe them, which turned into a passion that led me to further specialisation. This is how I have become a book historian, a bibliographer and, after working for many years as a cataloguer and as a research fellow, a librarian at the Central Institute for the Unique Catalogue of Italian Libraries and Bibliographic Information (ICCU), where I work for the department responsible for cataloguing standards, guidelines and tutorials, and for that for the bibliography, cataloguing and survey of early printed books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am currently busy with my colleagues on the development of a new website that will allow people to search through all the online catalogues managed by our Institute in one go, providing access to several types of media including books, postcards, music, manuscripts and digital resources, to mention just a few. This also involves a complete technical renovation of <a href=\"http://edit16.iccu.sbn.it/web_iccu/ihome.htm\">EDIT16</a>, our database comprising the Italian national bibliography for the 16th century - my main expertise. Needless to say, such an ambitious project needs considerable effort, but we welcome this sort of professional challenge with a great deal of enthusiasm!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Weirdly enough, I am a librarian who does not work in a library. The Institute I work for manages SBN, the union catalogue of Italian libraries. This is a delicate role, especially challenging as our decisions impact heavily on the national cataloguing policy. In order to make it work, we need to be in constant touch with hundreds of librarians and cataloguers working in more than 6,400 libraries all around Italy. Thanks to my role I meet many colleagues who are very passionate about their job. The exchange with them is one of my favourite sides of my work, together with travelling to visit their libraries!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a librarian with an academic background. I worked as a post-doctoral research fellow for several institutions in Italy and abroad. I am still an Honorary Research Fellow in Book History at the School of History of the University of St Andrews and struggle to combine my daily work as a specialised librarian with academic research. I teach courses in book history and material bibliography to graduate students and professional librarians as well as to a wider audience. This means I know very well the challenges scholars have in finding the resources they need for their research. Being a Members Councillor is a substantial opportunity to transform this awareness into useful expertise to contribute to the design of new features and ways to make Europeana match users’ needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a strong interest and experience in the digital humanities, especially in the digitisation of manuscripts and early printed books, text encoding, semantic web and digital preservation. As a longstanding user of Europeana Collections, I would be keen to contribute to making the digital content available on Europeana of higher quality, more easily accessible and open for reuse, especially in academic research and teaching. This matches the core mission of my Institute, as the national institution responsible for harmonising digitisation practices and for the enrichment of digital cultural heritage in Italy, and the new Implementation Roadmap for the European Open Science Cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in finding out about a career in digital cultural heritage?

                body: "<p>Since we launched the Impact Playbook in 2017, I’ve heard a range of examples about where and how it has been used. It has opened up conversations about metrics and measurements, about quantifying the greater good component of working with and for cultural heritage. And I’ve heard that you want to have more opportunities to talk more with each other, and learn from each other. We’re working on all of these things and I can’t wait to share more with you in the coming months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I’m pleased to share with you an important step forward made in these past few months: the Impact Community has been adopted by the Europeana Network Association (ENA), to help provide the support and drive it needs to blossom. This moves it from a loosely designed community run by the Europeana Foundation, to a community with ambitions led by a small Steering Group, committed to creating the conditions members need to share and learn together around the topics of impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Impact Community will continue to operate as a global community, welcoming members from around the world keen to learn and explore the topic of impact in the sector. And whilst ENA provides the governance structure to help steer the community, ENA membership is not a requirement to join the impact community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Meet the Europeana Impact Community steering group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Steering Group is made up of five members: two Councillors - elected officials of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana Network Association</a>, two members of the community and the community manager (that’s me). To make a start, I’ve worked with the Association, and a group of Councillors interested in impact to elect Playbook practitioners <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/maria-drabczyk\" target=\"_blank\">Maja Drabczyk</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/dafydd-tudur\" target=\"_blank\">Dafydd Tudur</a> to the roles of Chair and Vice Chair respectively. Together we have developed a provisional plan for 2019, to describe the areas we think most important to the community to discuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\"We want to keep the momentum going and to create an environment in which we can all discuss the impact of our daily work, long-term strategies, ambitions. We want to share lessons learned so far and discuss challenges ahead of us. All this, with the needs of our audiences and other stakeholders in the heart of our actions.\" - Maja Drabczyk, Chair of the Europeana Impact Community</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Maja and Dafydd were early adopters of the Playbook, having had a preview at an event run by Europeana under the Estonian EU presidency in 2017. They’re also involved in the ongoing development of the next version of the Playbook. From that early introduction, Dafydd took the exercises and ran through them with his colleagues at The National Library of Wales, which led them to apply these methods <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/exploring-our-impact-at-the-national-library-of-wales\" target=\"_blank\">to measure the impact of their Wiki projects</a>. Maja worked with her colleagues at the National Film Archive-Audiovisual Institute Poland to first translate the Playbook into Polish, and then used it in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/running-workshops-and-translating-impact-in-poland-a-user-perspective\" target=\"_blank\">seminars with GLAM institutions to structure conversations around future challenges and ambitions</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In 2019 the Impact Community will organise around three core areas</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past two Members Council meetings, the remit for the Impact Community has been developed by a group of impact-enthusiasts and practitioners: Marco De Niet, Merete Sanderhoff, Antje Schmidt, Karin Glasmann, Barbara Fischer, Rob Davis, James Morley, Michal Čudrnák, Hans van der Linden, Maja Drabczyk and Dafydd Tudur. Together we identified the hot topics within impact right now, topics that we want to be talking more about, and areas where we help support the work of the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>These form the basis of the 2019 agenda for the Impact Community, which has a role in: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong>Supporting the development of the impact toolkit</strong>, most notably in reviewing and testing phases 2-4 of the Impact Playbook, and helping to increase usage of the Playbook by encouraging and supporting its translation into a range of European languages.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Communicating to audiences beyond the Europeana Impact Community the importance and value of impact assessment, and the Framework as a methodology</strong>, supporting the communication of impact work such as presentations and workshops, including it on the agenda of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-our-2019-event-europeana-2019\" target=\"_blank\">main Europeana event in 2019</a>, and by acting as ambassadors.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Supporting Europeana Impact Community members to become practitioners within their own organisations, domains and/or countries/regions, transferring knowledge, skills, tools and resources relating to impact assessment, and the Europeana Impact Framework.</strong> Creating case studies and examples, developing a crash course and adding to the repository of information shared through the impact toolkit.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step forward and join the steering group</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we move on, we need your help. We’re looking for two members of this community to join us on the Steering Group, and help nurture discussion around impact throughout the sector. We want this role to complement your interest in impact, so we hope that you will want to be visible and an anchor around one of the core topics on our agenda in 2019, and join us for quarterly calls to discuss progress and share ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you think this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you. Submit your entry before 29 May 2019.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Got a digital idea that bridges cultural and audiovisual content? Apply for Creative Europe funding by 20 June'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Do you have an idea that uses innovative technology to bring together different cultural and creative sectors, including the audiovisual sector?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have an idea for new approaches and tools for the access to, distribution, promotion or monetisation of culture and creativity, including cultural heritage?</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Yes? Then apply for a minimum 150,000 euros from the Creative Europe programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deadline? Noon on 20 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s this all about?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovative technologies can build bridges among different cultural and creative sectors. The role of digital technologies for the cultural and creative sector is at the heart of the European Commission’s #Digital4Culture strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital revolution enables the creation of new and innovative artistic creations, but also innovative ways of presenting cultural heritage. In the digital environment, convergence of media – in particular audiovisual – and content is profoundly affecting production and distribution models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By using digital tools (including data and algorithms), the production of culture and creative goods can find new forms of expression, enhance cultural experiences (e.g. in museums and art galleries) and bring about new forms of cooperation among artists and other actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In turn, culture and the arts can bring in their creative potential to enhance the innovative capacity of Europe, both for society and industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in this context that Creative Europe is offering support to innovative projects at the crossroads between different cultural and creative sectors (including audiovisual).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Is my project eligible?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Proposals must be submitted by a consortium of at least three legal entities from three different countries that are participating in the Creative Europe Programme (which includes all EU Member States).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Projects should include an audiovisual/new digital technology aspect to be implemented in at least one of the following areas: museums, live performance and/or cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure your proposal shows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>\r\n    <p>A problem-solving approach to addressing challenges for the cultural and creative sectors.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How you will use audiences and the user experience in scoping the problem.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>That technology is an enabler in addressing key problems, rather than an objective on its own.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <p>How your project supports innovation as regards the creation, distribution and promotion of creative content, addressing cross-sectoral collaboration as well as the use of enabling technologies.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/creative-europe/funding/bridging-culture-and-audiovisual-content-through-digital_en\">call</a> for full eligibility criteria and to apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Creative Europe has a total fund of 1.75m euros and expects to fund six to ten projects. The minimum funding for each project will be 150,000 euro. The funding cannot exceed 60% of the total eligible costs of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the undertaken actions should be shared with stakeholders and policymakers through the organisation of a public workshop and assessment of the impact of the action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/creative-europe/funding/bridging-culture-and-audiovisual-content-through-digital_en\">Read the full call from Creative Europe</a></p>\r\n"

For individual activities, we then split into sub-groups according to our own interests, experience and capacity. That way, we try to spread the workload so that, over time, it will be&nbsp;carried equally by all steering group members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what motivated our steering group members to put themselves forward? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marianna Marcucci joins us as a Communication (Digital) Strategist in&nbsp;marketing and innovation for the travel and culture industries in Italy. 'I&nbsp;joined the steering group because I found there the same drivers of my motivation: Diversity. Change. Innovation. Added-value creation. Future. What inspires me to work every day to build the future, believing, as I do that through culture and communication it is possible to make society and the world better.&nbsp;Empowerment through collaboration, in business and in life, is the key to success. I’m excited to start working with this incredible group of professionals!'</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vaya Papadopoulou, a history teacher in Greece, says, 'Europe’s cultural heritage is crucial to be taught at schools. And teachers have a key role to play in that: to encourage children to experience our shared cultural heritage, inside and outside the class. Through this focus and as a newly elected member of Europeana’s Communicators steering group, my ambition is to promote digital cultural heritage among teachers in order to enable their students to realise that, within our European identity, diversity - not only cultural - is our richness and strength. That could inspire their young learners and citizens to become the ‘guardians’ of our European cultural heritage in the future.'</p>\r\n"

Subscriber numbers have&nbsp;doubled to over 100 since we became an official ENA community. The newsletter contains information about Europeana campaigns, as well as comms/marketing news from the cultural heritage sector and social media tips.</li>\r\n    <li>Setting&nbsp;up a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-communicators-group#communicators-around-the-world-map\">members' map</a> and creating&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/53f3a0479f8d41358d74a7bf6063b640\">how-to video</a> so other communities can do the same. We hope that such maps will help community members find others close to them so they can meet up, exchange ideas and be productive together!</li>\r\n    <li>Producing&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=42c56072c8\">hashtag infographic</a> to help communicators contribute to International Women's Day and Women's History Month in March.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>Running&nbsp;a successful election campaign for the steering group and making a great start as an&nbsp;enthusiastic and dedicated team.</li>\r\n    <li>Running a survey to find out more about who our members are, what they do and what they want.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What tools do we use?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a community, we want&nbsp;to explore new tools for communications, and so we're getting hands-on with that by testing out Zoom for our monthly video calls and Taskade for organising our activities. We use MailChimp for our monthly newsletters, and have&nbsp;tested out Loom for the how-to video, Canva for the infographic, SurveyMonkey for the election and member survey and Google My Maps for the members' map. We&nbsp;also have a LinkedIn group all members are encouraged to join.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What have we learned?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've learned that when action planning, bold ideas are great, but it's a good idea to include small, specific actions that members can act on straightaway and that require little effort or time.&nbsp;And for bigger ideas, remember that things often take longer than you anticipate and your members are all contributing on a voluntary basis whilst also performing their day job(s). Give yourselves plenty of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0bf7b38-7fff-297d-5ae7-d5c776e291f5\">Can you tell us a bit about yourself?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&nbsp;am a History teacher from Sydney, Australia and have been teaching in secondary schools since 2012. I am currently teaching at the International School of Paris while also completing a Masters in ‘History Today’ through the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I am presently a History Teacher in Residence at <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/\">EUROCLIO</a> where my responsibilities have been focused on the development of the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> platform, including: offering teacher training workshops, creating new source collections and building eLearning activities to accompany these.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-b0bf7b38-7fff-297d-5ae7-d5c776e291f5\">What is the impact of your work using digital cultural heritage in learning materials?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that it is through the <a href=\"https://euroclio.eu/2019/04/workshop-using-photographic-sources-and-online-tools-to-promote-historical-thinking/\">teacher training workshops</a> that I have best been able to see the valuable impacts of my work as this is when I have received direct feedback from my teaching colleagues. The responses of teachers in workshops and webinars have been very positive, particularly about the usefulness of the resources discussed. I believe that teachers are very keen to engage with digital cultural heritage but often don’t know where to find relevant, quality resources. Providing teachers with information about <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana Collections</a>, Historiana and examples of <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/teaching-learning\">eLearning Activities</a> that they can use in their classrooms seems to be of great value to them. In particular, teachers often comment about the quality of the Historiana source collections which are designed with the needs of educators in mind. I also find the eLearning Activities to be valuable as ready-to-use but also adaptable activities designed to promote the development of students’ historical thinking skills while engaging with a variety of digital cultural heritage sources.</p>\r\n"

There is such an abundance of material available through Europeana Collections, which is a wonderful thing, but it can be very time-consuming to find the best and most appropriate items which are also available for reuse. This work also takes a great deal of background research to determine effective search terms for each topic or theme and to identify strategies to include transnational and multi-perspective sources. This is one reason I believe the source collections are so valuable: we have done the work that educators often don’t have the time to do in order to present them with a suite of relevant materials ready for them to use and adapt in their own classroom contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my view, the source collections are the most challenging component of the development of our learning content. Once a quality and purposeful collection is created, it is easy to construct learning activities that make use of it and subsequently offer teachers training in how to make the most of these resources.</p>\r\n"

We are continuing to expand our source collections in line with priority areas identified in a survey of European educators and are creating corresponding eLearning Activities for these. We hope to work more closely with individual cultural heritage institutions to make the most of their collections in this process. We are also planning to offer more regular webinars and are assembling a core team of teacher trainers who will deliver training workshops across Europe to support history educators in developing meaningful learning activities using digital cultural heritage resources and online learning tools.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Together with the National Library of Lithuania, Jurga Gradauskaitė and Juozas Markauskas have developed an innovative project that uses teamwork, workshops, and a smartphone app to engage arts and music students to learn about applying rights statements to Lithuanian heritage. We first heard about this at the Europeana Network Association AGM 2018 where they presented it as their ‘wow’ moment. \_Now, as the team contributes to a Lithuanian translation of <a href=\"http://rightsstatements.org\">rightsstatements.org</a>, it’s a good moment to look back at this innovative approach to teaching copyright and to see what else has been going on.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Our aim was to prepare an exhaustive methodology drafted specifically for librarians, museum workers and archivists, on how to label cultural heritage content when it is digitised and made available online. We wanted to create a step-by-step ‘beginners’ guide on how to first of all define if the content is ‘legally available’ for digitising/uploading online and it it’s not, how to try to make it available. Then, to help people choose the right label for online content (either a Europeana rights statement or a Creative Commons licence).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taking our guide to the people</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We hosted a series of seminars across the country travelling to different regions and presenting our methodology, and solving ‘cases’. We tasked people with making their own evaluations and choosing appropriate labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An evolving process</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With time, we realised we needed a more simple solution - something quicker and more attractive. We also decided to involve additional audiences - not only GLAM workers, but also arts students who are potential users of digitised content (musicians, designers, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We transformed our methodology from a written document to an online tool, with yes/no questions. The result? A tool that provides them with an answer as to whether the content can be published online, and if so, under which licence. Here it is: <a href=\"http://cc.lnb.lt/\">http://cc.lnb.lt/</a> (but it is only in Lithuanian, sorry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn’t our only language problem. When we were testing the tool with students, we had to try to use language that was understandable to the layperson and to not use purely legal terms, at the same time as making it understandable for GLAM professionals without using their jargon.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nMaking labelling content into a fun topic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When it was finished, to spread the word, we gave music and arts students a challenge - to create something new and then to upload their creation, having first used our tool to check whether it was legally appropriate and to find the right rights label.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We chose to perform and record an African drums jam session. As it was live music, created on site, it was easy to figure out who to credit as author, co-author etc, and to decide on the rights of reuse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples of things they came up with…&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjaktxFXD6A\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What we’re doing next</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all a lot of fun (and hard work, but more fun), and I hope to proceed with similar projects in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are currently in the progress of making two explanatory videos about the benefits of rights labelling. One is specifically designed for GLAM &nbsp;professionals and another is for an audience of creators.</p>\r\n"

As with all of the EU directives, the provisions contained in the directive will not apply directly, but will need to be implemented by each EU Member State in its national laws. The Member States now have until the 7 June 2021 for the implementation of the new rules into national law. Only after a Member State has completed the implementation process will cultural heritage institutions in that Member State be able take advantage of these new rules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it will still take some time before the new rules will have an effect, this is a good moment to take a closer look at the changes introduced by the DSM directive as it affects cultural heritage institutions. This is not only important in order to be prepared to make use of the new rules once they are in effect but also to help Member States' governments understand the needs of cultural heritage institutions so that they can take this into account when implementing the directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this report we will take a look at the provisions of the DSM directive that are most relevant for cultural heritage institutions. We will start by analysing the new rules dealing with access to Out of Commerce works (Articles 8-11) and the optional provision providing a legal basis for Extended Collective licensing (Article 12). We will then take a look at Article 14 that deals with reproductions of Public Domain works. Finally we will discuss the new exceptions for making preservation copies (Article 6) and for <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Text and Data Mining (Articles 3 and 4).</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>From the perspective of cultural heritage institutions the provisions aimed at enabling institutions to make available Out of Commerce Works (OOCWs) contained in their collection are the most important change introduced by the DSM directive. Contained in Articles 8 - 11 of the directive (with corresponding recitals 29 - 43) these provisions are also one of the most complex parts of the new directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective of the new rules is to enable cultural heritage institutions to make Out of Commerce Works that they have in their collections available online without having to clear the rights on a work by work basis. The directive attempts to achieve this objective by introducing two mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>As the primary mechanism it introduces the ability for representative collective management organisations to issue licenses for the use of OOCWs by cultural heritage institutions \"irrespective of whether all rights holders covered by such a licences have mandated the collective management organisation\" (in <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#008.001\">Article 8(1)</a>).&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li>In situations where there are no representative collective management organisations that could issue licences for&nbsp;certain type of works cultural heritage institutions can rely on the secondary mechanism: a copyright exception that allows them to make Out of Commerce Works in their collection available online <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#008.002\">(Article 8(2)</a>).&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In both cases rights holders must have the ability to opt-out (prevent the cultural heritage institutions from making their works available). In order to give them the ability to do so cultural heritage institutions and collective management organisations (CMOs) must publish information about the Out of Commerce Works in a \"public single online portal\" to be run by the EUIPO six months before they make the works available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This six month period is intended to give rights holders a real possibility to opt-out before their works are made available online <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#010.001\">(Article 10(1)</a>). After the six month period has passed, the works can be made available on the website of the cultural heritage institutions for non-commercial purposes either under the terms of the licence granted agreed between the institution and a CMO or relying upon the exception. In either case, the cultural heritage institution does not carry the risk to be held liable for copyright infringement.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>There are two obvious weak links in this process. First it may turn out too complicated for cultural heritage institutions to the identify substantial amounts of works as being Out of Commerce. According to the directive Works are Out of Commerces Works \"when it can be presumed in good faith that the whole work [...] is not available to the public through customary channels of commerce, after a reasonable effort has been made to determine [this] <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#008.005\">(Article 8(5)</a>). While this definition makes a lot of sense for published works such as books and journals it will be much harder to operationalise for other types of works such as artworks, audiovisual works or photos (although recital 30 further clarifies that works were \"never intended for commercial use or that they have never been exploited commercially\" are included in the definition).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second weak point is the fact that while the directive requires Member States to ensure that representative CMOs can issue licenses for collections of Out of Commerce Works that include works by non-members, it does not require them to do so. This means that CMOs can simply refuse to issue licenses for example because they are not commercially interesting for them. In situations where a representative CMO exists but does not (want to) issue a license the cultural heritage institution cannot proceed with making the the works available as the fallback exception only applies in situations where a representative CMO does not exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dialogue with rights holders will be essential</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately both of these weak points can still be addressed in a meaningful way during the national implementations of the directive. <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#011\">Article 11</a> requires Member States to \"consult rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions in each sector\" before establishing specific requirements for the determination of Out of Commerce status of works. Member States shall further \"encourage regular dialogue between representative users' and rightholders' organisations, including collective management organisations, and any other relevant stakeholder organisations, on a sector-specific basis\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that the question of how useful the directive will be in practice will depend a lot on a good collaboration between cultural heritage institutions and collective management organisation on the Member State level. At this national level these dialogues provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to agree on workable rules for determining the Out of Commerce status of collections, to make clear determinations for which types of works the fallback exception does not apply and to establish trust between cultural heritage institutions and CMOs that can facilitate the conclusion of licensing agreements once the directive has been implemented.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The crucial role of the public single online portal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to good collaboration on the national level it will also be essential that the \"public single online portal\" that will be developed by the EUIPO be designed in such a way that it facilitates the process of making Out of Commerce Works available online. By designing the portal as a service aimed at facilitating the mass digitisation of OOCWs the portal could significantly boost the impact of the directive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that in addition to the minimal requirements identified in the directive the portal should also serve as an information hub for CHIs wanting to digitise collections of OOCWs and&nbsp;as a persistent resource for information about OOCWs and opt-outs registered by right-holders. It needs to allow batch uploads via a web interface and APIs and support commonly used metadata formats used within the cultural heritage sector. To be meaningful for visual works the portal further needs to allow the publication of reduced size thumbnails as part of the required identifying information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this requires that the EUIPO closely involves all relevant stakeholders (cultural heritage institutions, collective management organisations and other rightholders) in the design process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A unique opportunity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their apparent complexity the new rules for Out of Commerce works have the potential to break open the gridlock that many cultural heritage institutions face when digitising their collections. <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Embedded in the implementation process is an opportunity for cultural heritage institutions to make their voice heard within their Member States. This means working with the relevant government officials to allow them to understand the needs and realities of the cultural heritage sector. Equally important this also means engaging in a dialogue with CMOs and rights holders to identify practical arrangements that work for both sides.</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Collective Licensing'

                body: "<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#012\">Article 12</a> of the directive allows (but not requires) Member States to introduce extended collective licensing (ECL) schemes that go beyond the relatively narrow case of Out of Commerce works discussed in the previous chapter. It provides a legal basis for extended collective licensing (i.e licenses issued by collective management organisation that also apply to works by rights holders not represented by them) in \"well-defined areas of use, where obtaining authorisations from rights holders on an individual basis is typically onerous and impractical\". While not limited to cultural heritage institutions as beneficiaries (ECL is widely used to enable educational uses of copyrighted materials in some EU Member States) this provision may also be of interest for cultural heritage institutions as could enable the digitisation of entire collections regardless of their copyright status (i.e. Out of Commerce and in commerce works together) under a single licensing agreement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the provisions on the use of Out of Commerce works, an important drawback of licenses enabled by this provision is that they only apply domestically. This means that the licensed works can only be made available to users in the Member States where the license has been concluded. This means that cultural heritage institutions would need to geo-block access to collections that they make available online by relaying on a ECL license. As long as this is the case (the article includes a clause that asks the European Commission to review the restriction on cross border use within the next 2 years), Article 12 will remain problematic from the perspective of cultural heritage institutions interested in the the widest possible access to their digitised collections.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                anchortitle: 'Public Domain'

                body: "<p><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#014\">Article 14</a> of the directive clarifies a fundamental principle of EU copyright law. The article makes it clear that \"when the term of protection of a work of visual art has expired, any material resulting from an act of reproduction of that work is not subject to copyright or related rights, unless the material resulting from that act of reproduction is original\". In other words, the directive establishes that museums and other cultural heritage institutions can no longer claim copyright over (digital) reproductions of public domain works in their collections. In doing so the article settles an issue that has sparked quite some controversy in the cultural heritage sector in the past few year and aligns the EU copyright rules with the principles expressed in <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\" target=\"_blank\">Europeana’s Public Domain Charter</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice this means that those in which non-original reproductions enjoy protection via neighbouring rights (such as it is the case in Spain or in Germany) will now have to modify their laws so that such rights can no longer be claimed in the case of reproductions of visual art works that are in the public domain. It is important to note here that the wording of the new article 14 does not only cover photographic reproductions of two-dimensional artworks (such as paintings) but also covers 3 dimensional reproductions of 3 dimensional works (such as 3D scans of sculptural works).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this provision will require cultural heritage institutions who have so far claimed rights over&nbsp;the reproductions of&nbsp;public domain works to make some adjustments to their practices (i.e they can't rely on copyright to impose restrictions on the re-use of digital reproductions that they make available to the public) it is also important to understand that this does not mean that they have to give them away for free. Institutions remain free to sell reproductions for example in the form of postcards or posters as noted in recital 53 of the directive.</p>\r\n"

It requires Member States to implement an exception in their national laws that allows cultural heritage institutions \"to make copies of any works [...] that are permanently in their collections, in any format or medium, for purposes of preservation of such works\". While a number of Member States already have similar exceptions in their copyright laws, this new exception ensures that cultural heritage institutions in all EU Member States can make preservation copies of the works that they have in their collections. Recital 28 further clarifies that Cultural Heritage Institutions can \"rely on third parties acting on their behalf and under their responsibility, including those that are based in other Member States, for the making of copies\". This last addition is an important clarification as it provides room for the sharing of digitisation equipment via (cross border) digitisation networks, and allows the use of external contractors when creating preservation copies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The first exception <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#003\">(Article 3)</a> allows \"research organisations and cultural heritage institutions\" to make extractions and reproductions of copyright protected works to which they have lawful access \"in order to carry out, for the purposes of scientific research, Text and Data Mining\". Under this exception cultural heritage institutions can text and data mine all works that the have in their collections (or to which they have lawful access via other means) as long as this happens for the purpose of scientific research.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second exception <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#004\">(Article 4)</a> is not limited to Text and Data Mining for the purpose of scientific research. Instead it allows anyone (including cultural heritage institutions) to make reproductions or extractions of works to which they have lawful access for Text and Data Mining regardless of the underlying purpose. Rightholders can exclude their works from the scope of the exception by expressly reserving their rights \"in an appropriate manner, such as machine-readable means in the case of content made publicly available online\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken together these two exceptions provide cultural heritage institutions with ample room for Text and Data Mining. In cases where rightholders have reserved their rights and they cannot rely on the general exception introduced in Article 4, they can fall back on the scientific research specific exception in Article 3. It is important to understand that the scientific research specific exception does not only apply in situation where the cultural heritage institution is carrying out the research but also in situations where it enables external researchers&nbsp;to&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Text and Data Mine works in its collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The directive leaves some room for stakeholders to define some of the modalities of Text and Data Mining such as the standards for storing copies made in the process <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#003.002\">(Article 3(2)</a>) and the measures that rightholders may implement \"to ensure the security and integrity of the[ir] networks and databases\" <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0790#003.003\">(Article 3(3)</a>). It will be important that cultural heritage institutions contribute to these discussions while coordinating their input with the organisations representing the interests of researchers and research organisations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>Taken together the provisions discussed above have the potential to significantly improve&nbsp;the position of cultural heritage institutions in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of these provisions leave relatively little room during the implementation there is a significant opportunity&nbsp;for cultural heritage institutions to engage with national policy makers and make their preferences and potential concerns heard.

                body: "<h3><strong>Can you tell us a bit about yourself?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a geologist working as a Science and Maths teacher in a junior high school in Italy. I am also the Italian ambassador for Europeana. The Europeana Teacher Ambassador network is coordinated by Europeana Schoolnet and consists of 12 Europeana ambassadors from 12 different countries and one Ambassador for the European Schools, working with supporting education ministries. Our main goal is the promotion and adoption of Europeana resources for education at national levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the last two years, I have been using Europeana resources in my teaching activities, in particular related to STEM. I am strongly convinced that digital cultural heritage is very important because it provides the opportunity for students to learn about their European cultural background and became a future European citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is the most valuable aspect&nbsp;of your work as a Europeana Teacher Ambassador?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most valuable aspect is the collaboration with other European teachers (the other 12 Ambassadors) with very different backgrounds and with the Italian teacher user group (10 teachers creating and testing learning material using digital cultural heritage content). I learn about teaching other subjects and about teaching students from different grades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collaboration with the teacher from the Italian user group was valuable, we had time to discuss teaching activities designed using Europeana resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This project gave me time to talk to other teachers about how to realise teaching activities with Europeana resources. This is very important in a teacher’s professional development but not always possible in our time at school, because we are required to prioritise other aspects of teaching. Collaborating with people with different cultural backgrounds and professional experience is fundamental to being able to take full advantage of the great number of resources available on Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see the results of our work in the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching With Europeana</a> blog. The amazing ideas gathered from the ambassadors and user group were generated in a powerful year-long brainstorm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, it was great to see Europeana included in <a href=\"https://www.pearson.it/opera/edizioni_scolastiche_bruno_mondadori/0-6756-in_prima_fila?fbclid=IwAR0tja0evJrYS8R-HNLa7mubGYyRycE_NZJEFZagu2oHcOWF47u7O2vyZaQ\">In Prima Fila</a>, an Italian textbook about implementing practical activities about music.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What are the challenges in making digital culture widely used in education in your experience?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we need a change of mentality in teaching. We have to take into account that digital is becoming more important in our society every day and this is true also with culture. Digitalisation gives us new ways to enjoy cultural heritage, and it is important to underline this aspect of teaching activity. Digital culture opens up new ways to enrich lessons and possibilities for our students in terms of their background and future job opportunities. &nbsp;Europeana is an important tool for convincing teachers that they can use digital culture in teaching activity. When you explain the aims of the project they easily recognise the relevance of the platform in education. The Europeana Collections website is very easy to navigate, so even my not-so-digital colleagues could get involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to help my colleagues to learn about digital culture, I have been sharing my experience in using Europeana in teacher training and conferences. Last September I presented a <a href=\"http://www.sgicatania2018.it/index.php/abstracts/elenco-abstracts\">science teaching activity </a>built with Europeana resources at the national congress of Italian Geological Society, in the session dedicated to teaching geoscience at school. I also presented Europeana in <a href=\"https://tedicaserta.wordpress.com/programma/le-attivita/seminari-per-i-docenti/\">teacher training</a> in my city and in an <a href=\"https://www.egu.eu/education/gift/workshops/27/egu-general-assembly-2019-gift-workshop/\">international teacher workshop</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, I am going to present Europeana at a <a href=\"https://www.salernoletteratura.com/it/axPrograms.php?programDate=2019-06-19%2000:00:00&amp;editionId=11&amp;lng=I\">literary festival</a> in Salerno, I think this will be an amazing experience because I am going to talk with teachers and science education university students, so I will have the opportunity to present to two different generations of teachers!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to Europeana, I had the pleasure to talk about activities I’d created with my students in a conference about digital cultural heritage organised by the DiCulther network held at the Italian Ministry of Education. This was an amazing experience because me and my colleague Fulvia Piccolo were the only two teachers talking to policymakers and researchers about our experience in the classroom. I am very proud to have had the opportunity to explain my teacher’s point of view to other figures involved in education. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n<strong>What are the next steps for the Ambassadors and your involvement with the Europeana Education project?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next year, in coordination with European Schoolnet, we plan to go on with our Ambassador activities, doing more webinars, spreading the word in Italy and creating more material to use in class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally would love to engage as many teachers as possible in using Europeana, in particular STEM teachers who, due to their background, do not find it so easy to incorporate digital cultural heritage into their teaching activity. And I would also love to engage students in visiting Europeana Collections, because digital cultural heritage gives them the opportunity to learn about our past in order to build the future Europe.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4af1f871-7fff-a07a-afcd-0eb2669771f2\">Can you tell us a bit about yourself?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I&nbsp;am a maths and ICT teacher in Primary School no 74 in Szczecin, Poland. I also work as a STEM learning adviser in the STEM Centre in Szczecin. This place was created to implement the educational policy to support the development of sciences. Thanks to the Centre’s activities, we have learned that not only is a wide knowledge of their subject important for teachers, but that we must constantly pursue the modern trends and innovations in the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my position as a teacher trainer, I respond to the needs of headteachers in my area and consult on applying improvement programmes for their schools. I also provide feedback on lesson plans, present on good practices and make proposals about workshops and the professional development of educators. This is why I took part in the Europeana project as a User Group Teacher, one of the 131 teachers from Croatia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey and the European Schools. The main task of the User Group is to create learning scenarios using Europeana &nbsp;resources, implement them in the classroom and write about the experience in the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-4af1f871-7fff-a07a-afcd-0eb2669771f2\">What is the most valuable aspect of your work as part of the Europeana User Group?</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Introducing Europeana to students and teachers from my country. It would not be possible if it were not providing free online access to over 53 million digitised items drawn from Europe’s museums, archives, libraries and galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a practical example on how to use Europeana in education, you can see and try my &nbsp;learning scenario: <a href=\"http://fcl.eun.org/directory/details?contentId=1119\">When in history did wallets weigh the most? </a>This Future Classroom &nbsp;Scenario has been developed as part of the Europeana project. The main objective is to show students what density is and how to calculate weight if the volume and density are known. During the lesson students will solve a problem related to specific coins and will give the answer to the question: How much did wallets weigh in the history of mankind? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second example is the other learning scenario I’ve produced and will be published soon: How did people learn to measure time? The aim of the lesson is to make students realise what time is and what consequences it brings into people’s lives. Other important objectives are to encourage students to use their creativity, browse on Europeana Collections and other websites for suitable materials, and to develop students’ digital and social skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final result is an exhibition where students can find out about the history of clocks and measuring time.</p>\r\n"

The learning scenario used for this implementation gives your students an opportunity to find out what life would be like without electricity. It combines technology and social science and makes use of stereoscopic images from Europeana Collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-eea7f6a8-7fff-571e-4c78-5a86125c0b0b\">What are the challenges you have faced creating and implementing learning scenarios with digital culture? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana</a>, created as part of the Europeana Education project, is a blog space where we teachers are encouraged to share our experience in incorporating Europeana resources to our classrooms. &nbsp;It is very easy to use. For instance, you can find on the blog a catalogue of learning scenarios that include Europeana resources. In addition, the blog provides stories of implementation on how resources are being implemented in classes by teachers using their own scenarios or those of other colleagues in their class. Teaching with Europeana is an ideal platform for teachers to discover new learning scenarios, share their experience and get feedback about their learning material. Ultimately, Teaching with Europeana is a meeting point for the European teacher community searching for resources and advice. So the only real challenge to using this content, is your own imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2aeBJaBVx0\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n"

I’d say, that we need to get out of our comfort zones to learn new things, share what we know and basically seek each other - the chances are, someone might be able to support you when you least expect it. And this is the main goal of the User Group in my opinion.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'European Commission report confirms continued Member State support for Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>You probably know what your institution is doing for digitisation. You might even know a bit about national policy in your country. But do you know what the picture is across the EU? The new European Commission report on <em>Cultural Heritage: Digitisation, Online Accessibility and Digital Preservation\_</em>confirms continued Member State support for Europeana and for common efforts on digital preservation.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>This new report from the European Commission monitors progress across the whole digital lifecycle of cultural heritage items - from planning, monitoring and funding digitisation, to facilitating online access and reuse, and to digital preservation, in all Member States.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report looks at progress in areas of work that\_Member States are involved with in the digitisation of European cultural heritage. Across the Member States, progress is naturally varied, and challenges are identified that need further effort,\_but the direction of travel is positive.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Foreword to the 70-page report, Mariya Gabriel, European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, says, 'I am happy to see that this report confirms the continued Member States support for Europeana and for our common efforts favouring the democratisation of the\_cross-border online access to authentic and trusted cultural heritage content as well as our aims to help cultural institutions adapt to the very rapidly changing digital\_environment.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Seven\_things Member States are doing\_for Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>They encourage cultural heritage institutions, as well as other publishers and rights holders, to make digitised material accessible through Europeana.\_</li>\r\n    <li>They make public funding available for digitisation projects - and increasingly, they do this on the condition that the material must be accessible through Europeana.</li>\r\n    <li>They are working towards making all public domain masterpieces available through Europeana and on encouraging these (and other) works to be available in\_high-quality.</li>\r\n    <li>They support both national and cross-border aggregators to make the most of economies of scale.</li>\r\n    <li>They encourage common standards so that digitised material is interoperable and uses permanent identifiers.\_</li>\r\n    <li>They encourage metadata to be made available for reuse in innovation applications.</li>\r\n    <li>They raise awareness of Europeana among the general public and in schools.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<h3>Main highlights of the report</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one-third of Member States are funding programmes to digitise 'immovable cultural heritage' such as monuments, buildings and archaeological sites, and they're increasingly using 3D technologies in this digitisation work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than two-thirds of Member States promote preserving an object's public domain status after it has been digitised.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Member States remain supportive of the development of Europeana. The quantitative targets for content being made available have largely been achieved and a focus on quality is emerging with reference made to the importance of the Europeana Publishing Framework. More than one-third of Member States encourage their cultural heritage institutions to submit high-quality content and metadata to Europeana. And more than two-thirds now have a national aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Look out over the summer as we delve deeper into what the issues covered in this report mean\_for Europeana and the cultural heritage sector.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-commission-report-cultural-heritage-digitisation-online-accessibility-and-digital\"><strong>Read the report</strong></a></p>\r\n"

The course started in February 2019 and lasted for 6.5 weeks. The course had a huge number of registrants (3,011 people) from 55 countries and had an engagement rate of 56% (1,696 participants) and a completion rate of 37% (627 participants). The post-course survey results show that 98% rated the overall value of the course as ‘Good’ or ‘Very good’. 95% would recommend the course to a colleague or a friend and &nbsp;93% agreed that they now know how copyright works and how to use digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Facebook group of the course had more than 1,000 members who were very actively involved during the course and their messages showed a high level of satisfaction with the course. After the course ended, teachers sent me lots of messages and photos from their classrooms showing how they are implementing the learning scenarios created during the MOOC.</p>\r\n"

They had &nbsp;practical questions and problems because they had never participated in such a course before and it was a bit challenging at times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many teachers said that before this MOOC they never thought about copyright issues at all and although everything was nicely explained they still wanted to use items from Europeana Collections that are not free to use. For a future edition, I would suggest a whole webinar dedicated to copyright issues to be included in the MOOC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the teachers started working on their learning scenarios, some maths teachers complained that they couldn’t find appropriate resources. After an open discussion, some other maths teachers offered great ideas and suggestions and helped their colleagues through the exchange of ideas and possibilities. In the end, we got some very interesting learning scenarios by maths teachers. It would be good to include these in future MOOCs&nbsp; because it was obvious that maths teachers needed some incentive and more practical examples on how to use Europeana in their area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3></h3>\r\n"

There are so many great teachers with great ideas but it is hard for them to create a learning scenario in English. For instance, during my Europeana webinar for Croatian teachers, all they asked for was a MOOC in their mother tongue. So, it is clear that it would be great to have the MOOC translated in some other European languages as well, other than Spanish and Portuguese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My involvement with the Europeana Education project has been a challenging and rewarding one and I hope it stays that way next year. I will continue my work with the Croatian user group as Europeana Teacher Ambassador for Croatia. I hope that my group stays as hard-working and creative as they have been this year and I look forward to new, innovative learning scenarios and implementation stories. Also, together with one of the MOOC participants, I will be presenting Europeana to Croatian teachers at a national conference (applying ICT in education) that will be held in November.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Steam engine video project wins the Europeana #STEM Challenge!'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>The latest Europeana STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) Challenge invited educational vloggers, teachers and educational startups to submit video project ideas that show how you can bring cultural heritage to life in classrooms and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with a range of strong video proposals with enthusiastic individuals/teams behind them, we decided to award with 8,000 EUR the best idea that uses cultural heritage data and demonstrates excellent potential for engaging secondary education students with STEM subjects.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><strong>Meet our winner</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teddy Tablante is an American Mechanical and Electrical Engineer with nine years of experience in the semiconductor industry. To inspire students to pursue STEM careers, he decided to create the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdp4_l1vPmpN-gDbUwhaRUQ/featured\">Branch Education YouTube Channel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in May 2018, the channel is dedicated to teaching engineering, science and technology topics, making them accessible and understandable at a high school level (ages 14-18). Currently, Branch Education has more than 50,000 followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>'I left my engineering job about a year ago to start Branch Education and to build engaging and immersive videos with the hopes of inspiring secondary school students to pursue STEM careers. \_Winning this challenge helps to validate and support Branch Education's style of immersive 'how it works' based content. Winning this also brings Branch Educations goal of building a full curriculum of 'How Technology Works' for secondary school one giant step further. \_My hope is that one day, in addition to dissecting a frog in school, students will also be dissecting smartphones.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ - Teddy Tablante, winner of Europeana STEM Challenge 2019</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The winning project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Branch Education will create two episodes using Europeana Collections resources named ‘Igniting an Industrial Revolution through Steam and Physics.’ \_Without the invention and evolution of the steam engine in the 1800s, the world we know today would be unrecognisable, as almost all of our modern-day technology has roots that trace back to the steam engine. \_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first episode will explore technology’s roots to the Newcomen steam engine, and then go into the detailed physics behind how this steam engine worked. \_Additionally, viewers will be guided through an experiment that demonstrates the vacuum-based principles behind the Newcomen steam engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second episode will further extend the viewers' understanding of steam engines by exploring in detail traction engines, locomotive engines and Rankine cycles. \_This episode will connect to secondary school classroom lessons regarding pressure, volume and temperature, and it will show how the principles that drive the steam engine also enable many current day conveniences such as refrigerators and automobiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The videos will be available at the beginning of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did we decide?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The online competition closed on 15 May with 24 applications from 17 countries from across the world. The Europeana reuse team evaluated each of them against the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNjO-537RSdNLQIk_y1A7E96SbrmLauI4R5RxgnGXcU/edit?usp=sharing\">assessment criteria</a> and shortlisted eight video project proposals. From there, an external <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-stem-challenge-jury\">jury panel</a> of educational experts conducted personal interviews with the candidates to discuss their video proposals and engagement and relevance for students and teachers in greater detail, as well as cost estimates and their delivery timeframe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stay tuned</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europeanalabs\">Twitter</a> and sign up to our <a href=\"https://europeana.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ad318b7566f97eccc895e014e&amp;id=a76d355759\">Labs Newsletter</a> to keep up-to-date with what’s next for Teddy and Branch Education!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Professionals in Focus: Michal Čudrnák, Head of Digital Collections and Services at the Slovak National Gallery'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Are you interested in the interesting and complex jobs in digital cultural heritage? So are we. So each month we dive into the work of professionals in the sector. This time, we speak with Members Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/michal-cudrnak\">Michal Čudrnák</a> on the Velvet Revolution and his passion for meeting and working with inspiring and diverse people.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<h3>About Michal...</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked with several cultural organisations/NGOs dealing with new media, art and technology while studying Library and Information Science at the Comenius University in Bratislava. This mix\_stayed with me\_when I\_started to work at the Slovak National Gallery. For a short period, I\_worked in\_the marketing department and soon after that, I\_grabbed the chance to join the Information and Documentation department, which was about to start to work on a new collection management system and digitisation project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are you currently working on?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the projects we are working on in our department is dealing with the Velvet Revolution. The 30th anniversary of the 1989 events which led to the fall of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia will be commemorated by many events, publications and projects. Ours will be digital (spilling into non-digital), telling the events and stories of 1989 through visual culture, photography, audio and video from archives and museums. Július Koller, one of the pioneers of conceptual art in Czechoslovakia captured the events of that year in his 'ČAS-OPIS'\_(TIME-TRANSCRIPT), mostly factual day-by-day description of information from the media, or his own observation. It’s almost like a Twitter feed of both historically significant and mundane statuses. We will be transcribing this handwritten document using a crowd-sourcing tool and the resulting text will be reused as raw data, to be enhanced and expanded further with stories and content. I’m curious to see where this will lead us – it’s an open format so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping track of what is going on in the institution and other departments and translating\_that into our work - this is both a challenge and something I enjoy. Whether we work with curators to develop apps for exhibitions, or with registrars who want to capture the procedures like loans out in digital. Working with a diverse group of people, getting to know their work and working on common projects. Recently our scope has broadened to include work for other institutions - museums and galleries from Czech and Slovak republic, which boosts this element even more!</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I've been a member of the Europeana Network Association for quite some time, ever since the Slovak National Gallery\_started to provide records to Europeana. I got to know many inspiring people from Europeana and ENA and some of them asked me whether I wanted\_to come forward in the Member Council elections. Joining the Members Council is a good way to get to know how a fairly big and ambitious digital platform and network operates, while being able to influence its direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I joined the Impact Community and currently my aim is to introduce the Impact Playbook and concept to the local community of GLAM practitioners in Slovak and Czech Republic, but also to contribute to its development. I am also hoping to contribute to the EuropeanaTech Community, which has been quite prolific recently, not least with the great EuropeanaTech Conference in Rotterdam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you interested in finding out about a career in digital cultural heritage? Read about the interesting roles of our\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=members+council\">Members Councillors</a>, or visit the Europeana\_<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/jobs\">jobs</a>\_page for any new opportunities.</strong></p>\r\n"

The result of a post-course survey showed that 95% of the participants would recommend this course to their colleagues, and 95% now feel more confident in using digital cultural heritage in their classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By following the Europeana MOOC, teachers learned about the importance of integrating European cultural heritage into education. They also developed and improved competences such as knowing how to navigate through Europeana Collections, and how to explore different Europeana tools, apps and resources. And, finally, how to build learning activities using Europeana Collections resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving positive feedback, in March 2019 the MOOC has been translated into<a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/europeana-es\"> Spanish</a> and<a href=\"https://www.europeanschoolnetacademy.eu/web/europeana-pt\"> Portuguese</a>, and will be rerun next year in two additional languages as well as&nbsp; English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more than 44,000 students already reached, the Europeana Education Community will continue to work on reaching out to more and more classrooms in the 2019-2020 academic year!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See what students say about Europeana:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjkoPiJJG8k\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the history of the Europeana Impact Playbook?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia: When we designed the impact playbook in 2017, we wanted it to be like a cookbook. To introduce a common language around impact, and to generate conversations around the topic. Something you could dip into, to use when you needed guidance, workshop formats and inspiration. 18 months and 2,000 downloads later, and we’re observing it being used in all of these ways, and even in some we had not imagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the Europeana Impact Playbook fit with the ILUCIDARE project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maja: The ILUCIDARE project is about building international connections aimed at making heritage-led innovation and diplomacy in Europe an example for sustainable development and international cooperation. The ambition is to establish an international network promoting heritage as a resource for innovation and in international cooperation through a diversity of collaborative activities. As one of the project’s tasks we will build a set of interactive resources, including guidelines and practical hints, maybe even a toolbox of our own. Being a user of the Europeana Impact Playbook, it seemed like a natural fit to inspire my colleagues in the project, and set the background for the project meeting. We used the playbook’s empathy map to structure discussions in our co-creation atelier focusing on the stakeholders’ needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What did you get out of being part of the EU ILUCIDARE project meeting?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maja: It was inspirational for the people present in the room to get acquainted with the Impact Playbook - innovative both in its format and the way it interacts with its users. It showed a potential direction for the tools we want to create within the project. On top of that we used exercises from the playbook itself to facilitate our own discussions. This way we showed how flexible the playbook is and that it can be used in various contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia: Taking the time to reflect on what we had produced with the playbook was a really insightful experience. As we are putting the finishing touches to the next phase of the playbook - which deals with data collection and assessment - we’re looking at how we design the delivery of that phase, as well as what we need to do to support how it’s used by practitioners. This has been a really long process though, that has played out over the past few years, so I used a scrum-style retrospective to keep my reflections focused on the most significant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This process highlighted that our strengths were in using and adapting existing methodologies - not reinventing the wheel - testing every element throughly on ourselves, and ensuring the language we used was simple but thorough. And that we can improve by developing different types of resources to raise awareness and support usage of the playbook- such as webinars walking through specific tools such as the empathy map. Taking these insights forward into the next phases of the playbook means the beta will trial a more accessible format, as well as benefiting from <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-impact-community-seeks-enthusiastic-members-to-join-new-steering-group\" target=\"_blank\">a stronger connection with the emerging impact community</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>So, what’s next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maja: For ILUCIDARE? One of the project’s ambitions is the development of the so called CH-led innovation handbook and diplomacy toolbox that will support the work of practitioners in both fields. There are two co-creation ateliers planned within the project’s duration - the one we participated in in Cracow and one in Leuven (still to come) that aim to support the delivery of the final product so that it truly answers to the needs of its future users. Our discussions in Cracow were crucial for identifying our next steps in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia: I’m incredibly proud of the playbook and what we have achieved since its launch in 2017. I hear a lot about how inspiring it is, and how much it enables conversations, creative brainstorming and the pushing of boundaries when we think about which metrics we collect. That in itself, feels enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>… But it’s not. Because we know there is more we want to add to the conversation. We have Phase 2 of the playbook to share with you in Beta format over the summer, followed shortly by Phase 3 looking at how to narrate the data collected. And there’s a new energy being injected into the community of professionals across the cultural heritage sector that are interested in developing their practice of impact. So there is a lot on the horizon to be looking forward to!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Wish you were there?</strong></em> You can browse through <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbITbKlZ-TmbDzSa9epdB8VPeX8pU1EZIr6NQAPr7Ic/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Julia’s presentation</a> and read the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@juliafallon/a-retrospective-designing-the-impact-playbook-a9f2800d41f4\" target=\"_blank\">write up of this retro</a> on our <a href=\"https://medium.com/impkt/a-retrospective-designing-the-impact-playbook-a9f2800d41f4\" target=\"_blank\">impact publication on Medium</a>.</p>\r\n"

These collections, which are published on the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana platform</a>, provide educators with ready-made thematic compilations of sources that educators can easily adapt to their own needs, and use to develop learning activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In essence, multiperspectivity means that history should be studied and understood through different points of view. Although history teachers are widely supportive of the idea, implementation in practice often proves to be difficult.

                body: "<p>The source collection<a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/medicine-and-anatomy\"> Medicine and Anatomy</a> deals with the concepts of change and continuity in the development of medicine during the Renaissance. It challenges the commonly held concept that scientific methods completely wiped out the more supernatural beliefs around health and disease and gives a comprehensive overview of the main developments in the field.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this particular topic, some leading cultural heritage institutions, in this case the Wellcome Collections, host such a wide array of relevant sources that we can almost build a whole source collection just by using items from a single institution. There are only a few cultural heritage organisations with such an international scope, and they tend to focus on one particular aspect of history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In most cases, therefore, we have to combine sources from different cultural heritage providers. For example, in the source collection<a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/precursors-of-the-renaissance\"> Precursors of the Renaissance</a> we used sources from the Institut National d’Histoire de l’Art, the National Library of Denmark, and the National Library of the Czech Republic, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <em>Precursors of the Renaissance </em>source collection presents a critical view on established conceptions around the Renaissance. Common ideas on when the Renaissance started, the degree to which it was a revolutionary break with the past, who the main figures were, and the preponderance of Northern Italy as an epicentre of the Renaissance are all challenged in this source collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This eLearning Activity about <a href=\"https://hi.st/F-\">Continuity and Change in Renaissance Medicine</a>, is an example of how we use the source collections to create ready-to-use activities that promote historical thinking. Registered users can copy these eLearning Activities and adjust them to their needs. A full overview of the Source Collections and the eLearning Activities that EUROCLIO developed so far is available in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teacher-training-guide\">updated teacher training guide</a>.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-35e0dc46-7fff-44a2-36bb-9c3b710b74af\">Share your expertise and collections with us at Europeana 2019</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Without Europeana, it would be much harder to develop a collection that makes use of sources from different cultural heritage institutions. The development of these collections clearly shows the added value of Europeana. Finding and matching these sources, however, requires considerable time, knowledge and effort. This is best done if we join forces with the cultural heritage institutions themselves. We therefore invite people who are working in these institutions to share their knowledge of history and of the items in their collections and contribute to the development of the historical source collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will organise a face-to-face session during the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/introducing-our-2019-event-europeana-2019\">Europeana 2019</a> conference in Lisbon for cultural heritage institutions interested in cooperating in the development of these collections. Here we also demonstrate how we use sources from Europeana for the creation of eLearning Activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-35e0dc46-7fff-44a2-36bb-9c3b710b74af\">Get in touch!</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are already willing to bring the content of your institution to history educators across Europe or are interested in learning how to create eLearning Activities with your collections, contact me now!<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I can best be reached at steven@euroclio.eu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-35e0dc46-7fff-44a2-36bb-9c3b710b74af\">&nbsp;</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>As our upcoming Lisbon event Europeana 2019 draws closer, we are excited to announce the first of our pre-conference activities.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>On Wednesday 27 November from 10:00 to 15:00 you can hear the latest news from the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/\">GIFT project</a> and test out some of their engaging tools firsthand in the National Library of Portugal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What is GIFT?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GIFT is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between museums, artists and researchers to develop designs that enhance visitor experiences. Working closely with museums and their public, GIFT has been creating tools that facilitate interactive experiences in the museum. By merging the digital and the physical, these hybrid museum experiences provide innovative ways for you to engage the public with your collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At GIFT @ Europeana 2019 you will have the opportunity to be among the first lucky few to test out the tools that have been designed. The technology is open source, therefore free to use and adapt to your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attend GIFT @ Europeana 2019 and find out how you can give your visitors the tools to engage more, make it personal, create shared experiences through play, tell their own stories and turn their experiences into digital gifts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Who is involved in\_GIFT?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>GIFT project partners include Universities at the cutting edge of research and some creative companies at the forefront of innovation. The project partners include the MAD Art and Design Research Group at IT University of Copenhagen, the Mixed Reality Labratory at University of Nottingham, The Department of Informatics and Media at Uppsala University and Blast Theory, NextGame and Culture24. GIFT has also worked with some leading\_museums in Europe and the US to ground new technology-mediated experiences in real museum contexts, adapting to the needs of museums and visitors.

                body: "<h2>Hi Clemens! Can you tell us about&nbsp;your day job and&nbsp;your role in Europeana Newspapers?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Clemens: I work at the <a href=\"https://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de\">Berlin State Library</a> (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz), where I advise the Directorate on research strategy and also participate in several research projects, mainly in the areas of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Machine Learning and the Digital Humanities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have been involved with Europeana Newspapers from the start. When the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers project</a> received funding in 2012, I worked at the National Library of the Netherlands, and led the OCR processing of 10 million newspaper pages&nbsp;for the project. In the summer of 2014, I moved to the Berlin State Library to coordinate the overall project, until its end in 2015. Since then I have been working with Europeana to make the project outputs available as a thematic collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What and who&nbsp;is Europeana Newspapers for?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Newspapers capture the details of daily life in the past - a lot of what does not make it into history textbooks can be discovered in historic newspapers. There is great potential in having a common point of access for newspapers from different European countries, for example, for comparison and the study of how media in the past reflected public perceptions of major events such as the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wwi-in-historic-newspapers-the-assassination-of-franz-ferdinand/\">murder of Franz Ferdinand</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wwi-in-historic-newspapers-october-revolution/\">1917 Revolution</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are already a number of research projects that work with the Europeana Newspapers collection data in various ways, from text analysis to image-based methods or the study of historical stock market indices. But newspapers are also a very interesting source for <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/coding-da-vinci-berlin-2017-gathering-german-hackers-designers-and-cultural-heritage-providers\">creative coders</a>, citizen scientists or genealogists or just anybody interested in the many details of life in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Newspapers began life as a project of its own and now it's a thematic collection. Can you tell us a bit about its development?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we began with the Europeana Newspapers project, Europeana couldn't&nbsp;provide full-text search in addition to metadata about cultural heritage objects. So a prototype portal was developed and served by The European Library (TEL). Unfortunately, CENL, the organisation that funded TEL decided to <a href=\"http://www.cenl.org/wp-content/uploads/20161213-TEL-closure-press-release-final.pdf\">close</a> the service&nbsp;by the end of 2016. Since then, we have been working with Europeana to save the newspaper data and access features by migrating to the main Europeana Collections platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, TEL and Europeana use different technology to serve data, so most of the development had to start from scratch. Since the newspapers require specific functionality not present before in Europeana, and since the data is of immense volume, this proved to be quite difficult and time-consuming. Furthermore, the newspaper collection needed&nbsp;to blend in with the overall presentation of cultural heritage objects on Europeana Collections, which brought&nbsp;about additional challenges for design and development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Let's talk about the content - have you found anything that excites you?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The content that newspapers cover is so broad, it is really exciting to discover the variety. You can find, for example, famous novels that first appeared in a series in a daily newspaper. But what has so far captured me most are the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2019/07/vintage-food-advertising-a-culinary-tour-through-european-newspapers/\">historic adverts</a>. They are interesting from so many angles - typesetters were really creative with the techniques that were available to them. The products themselves and in particular how they were advertised is often quite funny and very revealing about the trends and mindsets of the societies back then.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What’s next for you and Europeana Newspapers?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The momentum for digitised historical newspapers is enormous and still growing. While there are a number of international, collaborative research projects like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://oceanicexchanges.org/\">Oceanic Exchanges</a>, <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/\">impresso</a> or <a href=\"https://www.newseye.eu/\">NewsEYE</a>, there are also for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dh2019.adho.org/panels/\">three panels</a> on using digitised historical newspapers in research at this year’s international <a href=\"https://dh2019.adho.org/\">Digital Humanities conference</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here in Germany, we have just started a <a href=\"https://pro.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/ddb-zeitungsportal\">project</a> to establish a common portal for all digitised German newspapers within the context of the German Digital Library. And&nbsp;at the same time, many more millions of pages will be digitised in the coming years thanks to funding made available by the <a href=\"https://www.dfg.de/\">German Research Foundation</a> (DFG). The German newspaper portal will benefit greatly from the standards and best practices developed within Europeana Newspapers. Other countries like Switzerland and&nbsp;Luxembourg have since adopted similar standards and launched impressive new <a href=\"https://www.e-newspaperarchives.ch/?l=en\">newspaper portals</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do, of course, hope that in the future we will be able to include more of these dispersed newspaper collections in Europeana Newspapers while at the same time working to improve and extend the functionality available for newspapers within the Europeana Collections platform.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h2><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Hi Matteo!&nbsp;Can you tell us&nbsp;about the impresso project?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Matteo: Impresso (literally ‘what has been printed’) is a collaborative and interdisciplinary research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation under the Sinergia funding scheme. The project’s aim is to create a technological framework to extract, process, link, and explore data from print media archives on a large scale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project involves computational linguists, digital humanists, designers, historians, librarians and archivists, who are tackling the challenge of how to enrich, represent, visualise and analyse a large corpus of historical digitised newspapers for research purposes. Partners in this project are <a href=\"https://dhlab.epfl.ch/\">EPFL’s DHLAB</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/\">Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital History (C2DH)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cl.uzh.ch/\">Institute of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich</a>. The interdisciplinary nature of impresso is reflected also in the principle of co-design that we apply throughout the project. What it means in practice is that the data we create and the tools for working with digitised newspapers that we are developing are shaped by a constant dialogue between historians, designers, computational linguists and digital humanists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As to the conception of and motivation for impresso, prior to it, the DHLAB had been involved in a research project involving the Swiss newspaper <em>Le Temps</em>, aimed at providing access to two digitised newspapers - <em>Journal de Geneve</em> and <em>Gazette de Lausanne</em> (which merged&nbsp;in 1998 to become <em>Le Temps</em>). The outcomes of this project, as well as the challenges that had emerged, laid the ground for impresso. The idea of creating an archive of digitised newspapers lent itself well to be scaled up to include more sources as well as to look beyond national borders. A series of encounters at conferences and workshops between <a href=\"https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=256249&amp;op=bio&amp;lang=en&amp;cvlang=en\">Maud Ehrmann (DHLAB)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/lars-wieneke\">Lars Wieneke (C2DH)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/marten-during\">Marten Düring (C2DH)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/siclemat.html\">Simon Clematide (UZH)</a> helped to strengthen and articulate this idea into what became a successful funding proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How did you get involved with the project?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My colleague and project coordinator Maud Ehrmann asked me to join the project in the summer of 2017, when an unexpected change in the project team opened up the possibility of having another post-doc researcher to support her in the tasks that the DHLAB was leading. At that time, I was working on <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/developing-the-venice-scholar-matteo-romanello-europeana-research-grant-winner\">Linked Books</a>, another SNF-funded project on citation mining of scholarly literature about the history of Venice. The work on named entity processing and disambiguation that we are carrying out in impresso is at the core of my research interests. There is also a continuity with Linked Books and my previous research on information extraction from large-scale digital archives in the Humanities, with citations (and more generally named entities) being one of my main areas of interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the importance of newspaper datasets for historical research?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical newspapers are invaluable primary sources for humanities scholars at large, not only historians. In fact, they contain and preserve a kind of fossilised trace&nbsp;of our current and past societies. They record all kinds of events, from war declarations to Saturday evening dancing balls in the countryside, and they document many aspects of day-to-day life and culture. They contain extremely rich and dense information, which is also continuous as in many cases these newspapers have been running for a long time&nbsp;and published on a very regular basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A crucial challenge that we are addressing in impresso is how to devise a tool that supports researchers to work with large archives of digitised newspapers. The tool integrates natural language processing technologies (e.g. named entity processing or topic modelling) to capture the semantics of newspaper contents, in order to make these (enhanced) sources usable for research. An important principle we are following in its design is transparency, meaning we strive to make explicit and visible to users all aspects of the data - or of the processing we perform on the data - that often risk remaining hidden in search interfaces. Information aspects we want to make more transparent include, for example, OCR quality, as well as holes in the data due to damaged digital archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How are impresso tools being used?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the fact that the impresso project is still in the making, its corpus and tools are actively being used both for research and teaching.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the research side, <a href=\"https://www.c2dh.uni.lu/people/estelle-bunout\">Dr. Estelle Bunout (C2DH)</a> - one of the (digital) historians in our project - is working on a case study entitled ‘Resistance to Europe’ which&nbsp; involves the analysis of debates on the European idea in digitised newspapers from Luxembourg, Switzerland and beyond, with the aim of identifying tensions around the European idea from the late 19th century to 1945. And researchers from our associated partners, the <a href=\"https://www.infoclio.ch/\">Infoclio</a> association and the <a href=\"http://www.unil.ch/hist/home.html\">University of Lausanne’s History Department</a>, are contributing to the reflection on how to apply impresso tools to historical research questions in the context of concrete use cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we issued a <a href=\"https://impresso-project.ch/news/2018/04/16/call-for-associated-researchers.html\">Call for Associated researchers</a> during the first year of the project in order to extend the circle of historians affiliated to the project. As a result, about 20 historians mainly from Benelux, France, Germany and&nbsp; Switzerland expressed their interest in both the tools and the collections brought together by impresso and have got involved in the project. Their association entails not only the use of the project’s output but a regular dialogue with the impresso team, via workshops and a final conference aiming at collecting feedback on their use of impresso tools and their research, and at discussing epistemological issues raised by digitised newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diversity of topics and methods of the associated researchers reflects the Swiss and Luxembourgish (digitised) newspapers’ allure as historical sources. They include prosopographical research on experts and female war correspondents, as well as on ‘history of thoughts’ such as the rise of liberal internationalism at the end of the 19th century, or banking history. Each of these research topics requires a particular use of the newspapers, a particular way to query them that contributes to fuel the conception of the interaction with the impresso collection. The diverse uses are however made available for all the researchers in the same interface, in an effort to offer a diversification of these interactions and enrich every type of research practice, including also teaching practices, in the spirit of the generous interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the teaching side, Martin Grandjean and Sandra Bott have been using part of the impresso corpus in teaching a Digital Humanities/Digital History course, part of the EPFL’s Social and Human Sciences programme. The course focuses on how the big events of the 20th century were covered in the press; digital archives of newspapers provide the students with a rich source of materials on which a range of digital methods and tools can be tested. The same course is planned for next year and it will be based on the impresso interface and tools, thus allowing us to test the strength and weaknesses of these tools specifically in a teaching (rather than research) context.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the frame of <a href=\"https://ranke2.uni.lu/\">Ranke2</a>, the platform prepared at the C2DH offering teaching materials on how to practice digital source criticism,&nbsp;the impresso project contributes with the preparation of a module dedicated to the use of digitised newspapers. This module harvests the lessons learned with preparing a transparent interface, adapted to bachelor level and secondary school teaching, bringing the latest trends of research practices to the classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

For now it’s a private release, mostly aimed at getting feedback on the interface design and functionalities from our associated historians. In terms of data, the interface gives access to 22 Swiss newspapers for a total of almost 3.2 million pages, 360,000 newspaper issues, and over 26 million content items (e.g. articles, advertisements, etc.), mostly in French and German.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the interface functionalities, the beta release contains all the basic features you expect from a newspaper interface: search, search facets and a viewer which lets you read and explore newspaper articles. Additionally, it provides some more advanced features, like the ability to search for named entities, to use topic models as filters to narrow down search results, and the possibility for the user to create and save collections of items. New functionalities that were added in the latest release include the first version of visual search (ability to filter all available images, by date and newspaper) and the bulk download of metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What will happen next? In the month of July we will release the public version of the interface, with new functionalities as well as new newspaper sources (most notably the digitised materials of the Luxembourg National Library). The best way to follow the project as it continues to develop is to join the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/1059270fc024/impresso-project\">impresso mailing list</a>&nbsp; - and our associated historians’ group - or follow us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImpressoProject\">Twitter</a>, as there will be a few exciting new developments in the coming months!</p>\r\n"

And it highlights the role that digital technology can play in helping the cultural heritage sector meet restoration challenges in the 21st century - including Notre-Dame.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Pantheon in Greece to the Stari Most in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and from fire and flood, to war and the human footprint, the exhibition traces the troubled history of some of Europe’s most iconic heritage sites. Its unique content also demonstrates that the cultural heritage sector already holds some of the answers to the challenge of preserving and restoring endangered sites.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>The importance of digital technology</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation of cultural heritage can be a crucial tool in today’s efforts towards the conservation, renovation, study and promotion of European cultural resources. At the European Union level, new actions are being taken in this area: just a few days before the Notre-Dame fire, the European Commission’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-member-states-sign-cooperate-digitising-cultural-heritage\">Declaration of cooperation</a> on heritage digitisation saw 25 European countries commit to take action in several areas, including a pan-European initiative for 3D digitisation of cultural heritage artefacts, monuments and sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>Commenting at the launch of the exhibition, European Commissioner for&nbsp;Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel re-states her support for the sector in this area:</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<div>‘The fire of Notre-Dame highlighted once more the need to preserve, record and protect our European cultural heritage. Reactions all over Europe show how important it is for our citizens and society. More than ever, we are making progress in harnessing the power of digital for our cultural heritage, but we must keep working together to support the sector in this endeavour.’</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Foundation Executive Director, Harry Verwayen, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Our museums, archives and libraries contain invaluable, often unique, records of heritage sites throughout their history - architectural drawings, photographs, paintings and written descriptions. Cultural heritage organisations are joining forces and adopting new technologies to preserve and share information about our heritage. By digitising their valuable collections and making the data available to experts, they help to safeguard our heritage sites. In the face of today’s complex challenges, the task seems more urgent than ever.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition’s final chapter focuses on Notre-Dame de Paris, and highlights how digital technology is a key part of the conversation around its latest restoration - with technologies such as 3D scanning and modelling, virtual and augmented reality, promising new ways to help the sector in preserving and showcasing cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Explore and get involved!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Please explore and enjoy this important exhibition, then help us promote it&nbsp;by sharing it with your networks.

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">In this interview series, we get a glimpse into the researchers’ academic lives, their goals, and the influence of digital cultural heritage on their work. The first grant winner in this series is Dr Saverio Vita, research fellow at the University of Bologna in Italy. His project supported by Europeana resulted in the ‘Upgrading History. Diaries from the War Front’ platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is your current academic position and what is your research focus?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-07/Saverio Vita.png\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\" />\r\n<p>I am a research fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/it\">Department of Classic Philology and Italian Studies</a>, University of Bologna. <a href=\"https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/saverio.vita2/publications\">My research</a> mainly focuses on autobiographical writings in war and post-war times. To begin with, I wanted to investigate how emotions like guilt and shame could influence authors who explore the interaction and contradictions between reality and fiction. In order to achieve this goal, I analysed texts such as novels, short stories, diaries, graphic novels and essays written by prisoners of war. Then, I focused mainly on the state of the author between the 19th and 20th centuries. I had the chance to work on a huge digital private collection of letters sent to Olindo Guerrini, the author most representative of the practise of heteronomy in Italy, and I published a <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/37534742/Poeti_senza_museruola._Storia_del_Giobbe_di_Marco_Balossardi\">monograph</a> on this subject. Currently, I am a member of <a href=\"https://centri.unibo.it/laboratorio-guerrini\">Centro Studi Laboratorio Guerrini</a>, and the project supported by a Europeana grant was hosted by <a href=\"https://centri.unibo.it/dharc/en\">/DH.ARC</a> (Digital Humanities Advanced Research Centre).</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has Europeana helped you to achieve your research goal?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receiving the Europeana Research Grant gave me&nbsp;a great chance to build a platform on which any user can access real war diaries, with comments and introductions. Because these deal&nbsp;with memory and since we are living in times in which historical memory is being lost, building such an interface has both an academic and social utility. The Europeana Foundation and its research coordinator really understood this perspective. Additionally, when I had technical and bureaucratic issues during the development of the project, they were constantly available to help me. So, on top of the €8,000 grant, I felt constantly supported by people who really understand what it means to provide a service to the community and to develop a research project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you discover the Europeana Research Grants Programme and why did you decide to apply for it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My department was awarded for its <a href=\"https://www.miur.gov.it/dipartimenti-di-eccellenza\">excellence in Digital Humanities</a> by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research. During my research activity there, I met Francesca Magrefi, who was responsible for exploring European calls for projects. When I asked if there were opportunities for European funding for my research interests, she immediately sent me the Europeana call. The grant that I won really helped, and gave me the chance to link <a href=\"https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/saverio.vita2/research\">my past research interests</a> with my various skills towards a single objective. I’ve always thought that one must try to take advantage of past experiences, in order to discover new perspectives. My strong interest in ethical issues about war and my experience in working on digital documents were the perfect background for developing <a href=\"http://projects.dharc.unibo.it/uhdw/\">Upgrading History. Diaries from the War Front</a>. I discovered how deep and rich Europeana Collections was, and realised it would be possible to do research on something that could combine my interests with social usefulness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Researchers who do not take advantage of digital resources&nbsp;nowadays are missing out on a great opportunity. Even when I work on private correspondence, I always check online to see if a digital archive might preserve any documents that could enrich my research, or fill the gap between what I know and what I need to know. In my experience, this was often the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I was working on Olindo Guerrini’s correspondence, I found two letters by Emile Zola and Raniero Paulucci di Calboli. In these letters there were brief allusions to&nbsp; Affaire Dreyfus and Affaire Zola, and in some parts they were written in code. Fortunately, <a href=\"http://gallica.bnf.fr/\">Gallica</a> preserved a huge collection of newspapers, which helped me in retracing the events in order to publish <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/33657989/Nell_archivio_delle_lettere_ricevute_Olindo_Guerrini_e_l_affaire_Zola\">the results</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think that everyone who works in a research context should know and use the available digital collections. Europeana Collections is a great platform because it not only preserves UGC (user-generated content), but it also works as an aggregator of resources coming from other libraries and institutions, thanks to its CC0 metadata. Europeana Collections is therefore a great platform, for both the general public and academic users.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Frédéric Kaplan conducts research projects combining archive digitisation, information modelling and museographic design. He directs the Venice Time Machine, an international project in collaboration with the Ca’Foscari University in Venice and the Venice State Archives, aiming to model the evolution and history of Venice over a 1,000 year period. This project led to <a href=\"https://timemachine.eu/\">The Time Machine</a>, which brings together over 400 institutions from 33 European countries, including Europeana. Revolutionising the way we experience European history and culture, the project is an international collaboration to build a map of European history that spans thousands of years and turns it into a living social and economic resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using artificial intelligence (AI), new tools to interpret and visualise big data, and crucially making that infrastructure available to anyone who needs it, the project is a perfect fit for Europeana and the challenges we are working on collectively. <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/joining-forces-to-build-a-time-machine-europeana-foundation-and-the-time-machine-project\">Read more about Europeana and The Time Machine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frédéric is also well known for founding OZWE, one of the world’s leading studios in immersive gaming, has presented at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ev4rU27HY\">TED Talks</a> and TEDx Talks, provided Europeana with his <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/ten-perspectives-on-the-future-of-digital-culture-frederic-kaplan\">perspective on the future of digital cultural heritage</a> as part of our 10th anniversary and participated in exhibitions at several leading museums including the Venice Biennale of Architecture, the Grand Palais and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof Kaplan currently holds the Digital Humanities Chair at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), directs the EPFL Digital Humanities Laboratory, and has published more than a hundred scientific papers, eight books and 10 patents.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frédéric’s keynote will invite you to take a journey through time with him by learning what the Time Machine project is about, how it relates to the Europeana Initiative and how you can benefit from it.

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\">In this interview series, we get a glimpse into the researchers’ academic lives, their goals, and the influence of digital cultural heritage on their work. The second grant winner in this series is Dr Elizabeth Benjamin, Lecturer in French at Coventry University in the UK. Her project supported by Europeana resulted in an interactive map entitled&nbsp; ‘Return to Sender: Mapping Memory Journeys in the Europeana 1914-1918 Postcard Archive’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is your current academic position and what is your research focus?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"/files/Images/Blog_images/2019-07/Elizabeth Benjamin Photo.jpg\" style=\"max-width:300px;float:left;margin-right:30px;\" />\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently working as a Lecturer in French at <a href=\"https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elizabeth-benjamin\">Coventry University</a>, UK, where I am a member of the Centre for Research in Arts, Memory and Community (CAMC). My research intersects comparative aesthetics, memory studies and digital humanities, with particular focus on the 20th century. I have built on my expertise in the relationship between the arts and philosophy to explore the role of memorialisation in the formation of national identity, analysed through socio-cultural expression. My next major research project will assess the evolution of the role and depiction of trauma in French culture and society from the 19th century to the present day. My Europeana project, Return to Sender, is an interactive map of the postcards within the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918 Collection</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How has Europeana helped you to achieve your research goal?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Europeana Collections provides a huge wealth of accessible visual resources, allowing insight into critical periods of history from all around the world, without requiring physical mobility. The grant has allowed me to produce a resource that processes WWI postcards in a form that maps their movements in time, while retaining a presence on the map itself. The proposal was developed with a co-investigator, <a href=\"https://digitalcultu.re\">Garfield Benjamin</a>, who specialises in Digital Media at <a href=\"https://www.solent.ac.uk/\">Solent University</a>. He&nbsp;translated the research aims into the technical specifications for the map, and applied the final aesthetic to the website as a whole. The funding provided the opportunity to hire a web developer, Niall O’Leary, to convert into code the visualisation goals of the project, as well as working with a student researcher, Stefan Bernhardt-Radu, who created the dictionary of locations to get the archives on the map. The grant programme has helped me achieve my research goals through giving me the opportunity to pursue a more practical digital humanities project, as well as extending the archival aspects of my current work.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

                body: "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The above GIF shows a sample of filtered&nbsp;results on the interactive map ‘Return to Sender: Mapping Memory Journeys in the Europeana 1914-1918 Postcard Archive’. CC BY-SA</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did you discover the Europeana Grants Programme and why did you decide to apply for it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I was previously aware of Europeana Collections as an essential digital platform for the exploration of artefacts across cultural heritage institutions, having used it for both teaching and research in the past. I also follow Europeana Research’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EurResearch\">Twitter account</a>, which is how I came across the call for projects for the Europeana Research Grants Programme. The theme this year being WWI immediately piqued my interest, as my PhD thesis — then published in the form of a <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137563675\">book</a> — focused on Dada and Existentialism, a transnational art movement contemporaneous to the war, and a post-WWII philosophical movement, respectively. I was also involved at the time in conferences surrounding the centenary of WWI. As part of my role at Coventry I teach modules in French history, and this involves visual imagery from the early 20th century, so I imagined the project would feed directly back into my teaching as a pedagogical tool, as well as its goal as a tool for research. I decided to apply to the programme for these reasons, but also because I have a particular interest in postcards and what they have to reveal about socio-cultural and political developments of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How does access to digital cultural heritage influence your research?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The First World War’s global nature significantly complicates its study because of the dispersal of its remaining artefacts. Often it is simply impractical to access physical archives; it can also be the case that&nbsp;original pieces belong to family collections or have simply been lost. Moreover, in a museum setting, resources are curated, imposing a specific ‘memoryscape’ or politics of memory of a particular period. Digital cultural heritage allows a contemporary researcher to overcome issues of physical accessibility, as well as occasionally offering a substitute or ‘copy’ of artefacts that would otherwise be unuseable. Through their browsable resources, platforms such as Europeana Collections, confront the issue of data bias inherent to curation by putting more power in the hands of the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital cultural heritage will be particularly important as we move temporally further away from periods such as WWI, after centenary commemorations have finished. Additionally, shifting patterns of international relations, environmentalism and digital fluency will give increasing space to digital communities. I am interested in the ways in which these developments impact memorialisation, a key aspect of my ongoing research.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Heritage at Risk - honours Europe’s iconic sites and highlights role of digital in heritage restoration'
        posttype: Pressrelease
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Marking three months since the fire that engulfed Notre-Dame de Paris, Europeana - the European Union’s digital platform for cultural heritage - launches the online exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">Heritage at Risk.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Heritage at Risk uses unique digital content to explore the threats - natural and man-made - facing heritage sites from ancient times until today. And it highlights the role that digital technology can play in helping the cultural heritage sector meet restoration challenges in the 21st century - including Notre-Dame.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Mariya Gabriel says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘The fire of Notre-Dame highlighted once more the need to preserve, record and protect our European cultural heritage. Reactions all over Europe show how important it is for our citizens and society. More than ever, we are making progress in harnessing the power of digital for our cultural heritage, but we must keep working together to support the sector in this endeavour.</em>’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Pantheon in Greece to the Stari Most in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and from fire and flood, to war and the human footprint, the exhibition traces the troubled history of some of Europe’s most iconic heritage sites. Its unique content also demonstrates that the cultural heritage sector already holds some of the answers to the challenge of preserving and restoring endangered sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Verwayen, Executive Director of Europeana, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>‘Our museums, archives and libraries contain invaluable, often unique, records of heritage sites throughout their history - architectural drawings, photographs, paintings and written descriptions. Cultural heritage organisations are joining forces and adopting new technologies to preserve and share information about our heritage. By digitising their valuable collections and making the data available to experts, they help to safeguard our heritage sites. In the face of today’s complex challenges, the task seems more urgent than ever.’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition’s final chapter focuses on Notre-Dame de Paris, and highlights how digital technology is a key part of the conversation around its latest restoration - with technologies such as 3D scanning and modelling, and virtual and augmented reality, promising new ways to help the sector in preserving and showcasing cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The public is invited to visit <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">Heritage at Risk</a>, available online in seven languages, from 15 July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nENDS</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Media contact</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eleanor Kenny - Europeana Foundation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E: <a href=\"mailto:eleanor.kenny@europeana.eu\">eleanor.kenny@europeana.eu</a>\_\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Notes for Editors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heritage at Risk exhibition is available online in seven languages - English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish and Romanian - at: <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images from the exhibition for use by the media can be found at: <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/heritage-at-risk\">https://pro.europeana.eu/page/heritage-at-risk</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Europeana</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is Europe’s platform for digital cultural heritage with a mission to ‘transform the world with culture’. <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> is Europe’s digital library, museum, gallery and archive.

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Doing digital is hard</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">'Why do we fail digitally?'&nbsp;This was the title of a recent seminar for Norwegian museums at the Munch Museum in Oslo. But let’s be honest: a seminar with this title could have been held anywhere in Europe. Doing digital is hard, for museums as for other sectors of society. The GIFT project is a Horizon 2020 research project aimed&nbsp;at&nbsp;helping museums overcome some of the challenges involved in using digital technology to facilitate meaningful and engaging visitor experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We take an experience design perspective: instead of putting the technology first, we start with the needs of the museum and their visitors. We are developing an open-source <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/\">experience design framework</a> stemming from an ongoing, cross-disciplinary research project involving artists, designers, curators, museum educators, computer scientists and 18 museums in Europe and the U.S. The framework is currently available as an ‘open beta’, and is intended to be useable by a single museum professional with few resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The framework aims to facilitate in-house, practitioner-led design of hybrid and interpersonal experiences, in which mixed-reality technologies are used to augment or expand the experience of a visitor in the museum, and in which visitors use these technologies to share their experience with their ‘strong-tie’ connections (family and loved ones). As such, the framework facilitates sharing in a much more intimate sense than the larger-scale sharing that is typically facilitated through regular social media such as Facebook or Instagram.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Practical approach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The GIFT Framework is based on extensive collaboration in a number of smaller sub-projects between <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/the-gift-project/\">university researchers, artists, designers and museum professionals</a>. The participation and generous sharing of time, effort and insights throughout the project from our friends in museums has been invaluable. The project has engaged with museums in three different ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">A few museums have been hosts for pilot cases, such as the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/emotion-mapper-and-the-munch-museum/\">Munch Museum</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gifting.digital/brighton-museum-and-art-gallery/\">Brighton Museum</a> and the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/monuments-for-a-departed-future/\">Museum of Yugoslavia</a>, providing real-life laboratories for design work led by artists and designers in the project.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">A group of ten museums in Europe and the U.S. have engaged in <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/about-the-gift-action-research/\">a structured action research process</a> aimed at building their capacity for facilitating hybrid experiences - as well as informing the design and development of the GIFT framework.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, a number of external museum partners - such as <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/factory-the-seen-and-the-unseen/\">Tate Modern</a> and <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/uon-museum-of-archaeology/\">University of Nottingham Museum of Archaeology</a> - have taken the tools developed by GIFT and applied them in their local context, offering test cases and insights about how the tools work when applied outside the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In a series of upcoming news posts from the GIFT project on Europeana Pro, we will present some of these sub-projects. In this post, we will focus primarily on the GIFT framework.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The GIFT Framework</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The GIFT Framework offers a collection of tools, design guidelines and best practice recommendations extracted from our practical and theoretical research. We offer a collection of ‘experience prototyping tools’ that support prototyping of user experiences without requiring deep technical knowledge. These tools include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://gifting.digital/?page_id=5\">Gift exchange app</a>: Based on a pilot project about digital gifting, we have created a generalised tool that allows any museum to experiment with digital gift experiences. This is a web app that works for both iOS and Android devices, with open-source code that can be downloaded and adapted to the museum’s needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://gifting.digital/?page_id=41\">Artcodes</a>: Artcodes is a system for creating visual scannable markers (similar in functionality to QR codes) that can be directly designed and even hand-drawn by users by following a set of drawing rules, so that they can take on bespoke and aesthetic forms, e.g. in order to fit the aesthetic of a museum exhibition. The markers can be connected to digital assets, wrapped up as an experience and shared with others. Users can open up others’ experiences and appropriate them by mapping them to their own weblinks, before resharing. Artcodes runs on both iOS and Android.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://gifting.digital/scannerbox/\">Scannerbox</a>: Can museum visitors contribute to a museum collection, with their own personal objects? Scannerbox is a do-it-yourself (DIY) toolkit that makes it easy for museums to set up public scanning booths where visitors can bring along and digitise their own artefacts alongside capturing stories about their personal meaning. Visitors can then donate their scanned objects and stories to the museum, allowing the 3D models to be published and shared online, and reused in virtual and augmented reality experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://gifting.digital/the-one-minute-experience/\">The One Minute Experience</a>: Object recognition technology has made it possible to offer visitor&nbsp;experiences described as 'Shazam for art': the phone's camera recognises the objects in the museum and offers information about them. However, an easily overlooked challenge is the design of the information that is offered. The One Minute Experience offers an authoring tool that helps museum communicators write short, engaging texts suited for smartphone screens, which have a greater chance of being read and understood by museum visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://gifting.digital/visitorbox-design-cards/\">Museum ideation cards</a>: This tool supports ideation — the early stages of generating and developing designs. These ideation cards encapsulate the design and technical knowledge from the project and encourage museum designers to consider intended audiences, institutional goals and constraints. Furthermore, we are developing a generalised ideation capture tool that will capture the results of ideation and design sessions using the ideation cards, and so allow participants to reflect on the variety of theories, concepts and technologies that they have engaged with and compare their designs with those of others.</p>\r\n"

It is the most visited museum in Serbia with 100,000 visitors yearly. The museum’s main collection contains a wide range of artefacts and stories connected with Josip Broz Tito's life and work. The museum is located on the grounds of the former communist leader’s palace, and houses his tomb as well as his wife’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">People who grew up in the region of former Yugoslavia occasionally come to the museum to pay their respects to Tito. However, the museum aims to present a broad view of the history of the Yugoslav republics. They wish to encourage critical thinking and dialogue.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Monuments for a departed future</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During two days in the spring of 2017, we offered visitors an alternative museum experience, inviting them to a form of ‘effective critical play’ within the museum’s premises. The objective was to make an intimate and poetic experience, which could lead visitors to engage both critically and emotionally with the violent history of the former republic. It was called ‘Monuments for a departed future’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The theme of the experience was based on the abstract anti-fascist WWII monuments built between 1960 and 1990 – internationally known as the ‘<a href=\"http://www.spomenikdatabase.org/\">Spomeniks</a>’. During the socialist era, they were popular sites of tourism, as well as school excursions. This shifted radically during the 1990s when the turn to nationalism brought a change in the perception of the monuments, which were now seen as symbols of an ideologically undesired past. This often led to their destruction or abandonment. Precisely because of their conflicted history, the monuments offer rich possibilities for different interpretations and discussions about the history of Yugoslavia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the Museum of Yugoslavia hosted a touring exhibition about the Spomeniks in 2016, they are not represented in the permanent exhibition at the museum. We used image recognition technology called <a href=\"https://www.artcodes.co.uk/\">Artcodes</a> to give them a physical presence in the museum today. Visual markers representing the monuments were placed inside the exhibition. These could be scanned with a smartphone, triggering a digital interaction using the Artcodes app.</p>\r\n"

The purpose was to introduce a playful activity of searching for the markers inside the museum, but also to let the placement of the markers mirror the fact that many of the monuments are in remote locations, and hidden from public consciousness. Each marker served as an entry point to one of the monuments as well as to a specific theme, for example ‘History and the generational gap’ or ‘Monuments and meaning’.</p>\r\n"

The provocations were presented as playful challenges. They would prompt participants to put themselves in a specific state of mind, using their imagination and their bodies to interact with the museum environment. These challenges ranged from the light-hearted to the more emotionally demanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, for each theme the participants were presented with a question to answer. The purpose was to provoke reflections on the different topics addressed, and to link the experience at the museum with personal life outside of it. After submitting an answer, it was possible to view answers from other participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n</div>\r\n"

                body: "<p>The students who tested ‘Monuments for a departed future’ saw it as a very personal experience. They interpreted the challenges and questions as a way to make a personal and emotional connection with the historical content. One of the students described the experience as an ‘historical/emotional roller-coaster’. In this way, the experience became ‘bigger’– not just about learning history, but to some degree also about connecting with challenging aspects of life such as death, conflict and forgiveness. Using play and imagination was also seen as a way to ‘communicate with the space’ and put participants in an ‘active role’, as well as to challenge them to think for themselves. They saw the questions in the app both as ways to reflect and contribute, but also as concrete reminders that people have very diverse perspectives on things.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Artcodes allow you to create digital narratives using beautiful, machine readable markers. They work in a very similar way to QR codes: they can be scanned by a smartphone to access additional exhibition content, play games, and offer a participatory, interactive experience. Because they are customisable, Artcodes can blend in and match the aesthetics of your exhibition, meaning that visitors can experience a digital narrative without the use of obstructive markers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike QR codes, Artcodes are handcrafted visual markers that can be designed, drawn and rendered. These markers are easy to draw, and can even be created by the visitors themselves to contribute their own reflections to the exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ArtCodes have been used to tell stories about musical instruments, unlock the hidden history of a railway line, transform the visitor into a factory production line worker and evoke poetic, playful experiences. To find out more about them and download the app, visit the <a href=\"https://gifting.digital/augmented-reality-artcodes/\">GIFT project website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you’d like to know more about GIFT you can hear the latest news from the project and test some of its tools at <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explore-hybrid-museum-experiences-at-europeana-2019\">Europeana 2019</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>Early-career scholars harness digital cultural heritage in First World War research projects, thanks to the Europeana Research Grants Programme.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing Europe’s galleries, libraries, museums and archives within digital reach allows researchers to access a much wider scope of sources. Now in its fourth year, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-research-event-grants-the-2019-call-is-out\">Europeana Research Grants Programme</a> awards funding for events that bring together cultural heritage professionals and researchers. The theme for the 2019 grants is digital cultural heritage for open science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the third Europeana Research Grants Programme, early-career scholars were invited to submit proposals for projects connected to the theme of the First World War and making use of sources from the Europeana 1914-1918 collection, as well as digital tools. High-quality responses came in from all over Europe. Professor Lorna Hughes, Chair of the Europeana Research Advisory Board, presented the recipients of the 2018 Europeana Research Grants with their awards at the House of European History in Brussels in November 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/meet-the-winners-of-the-europeana-research-grants-programme-2018\">three winning projects</a>, which are running throughout 2019, map soldiers’ itineraries using their personal diaries, create a dynamic visualisation of wartime postcards, and research the use of wartime content in professional storytelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 2019, after a thorough content evaluation, CLARIN integrated 135,000 Europeana records into their <a href=\"https://vlo.clarin.eu/;jsessionid=362F4B3B3C994A132EEE09E576067D48?0\">Virtual Langauge Observatory (VLO) portal</a>. This content evaluation is a valuable best practice reference showing how Europeana sources can be integrated into platforms for research purposes. The evaluation clearly shows that the quality of the content and metadata made available to Europeana by cultural heritage institutions is crucial to its ability to be used in research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2019, Europeana Research set up its first strategic plan to maximise the impact of digital cultural collections in research. It illustrates the critical shift of focus from data to community-driven impact. Strengthening the links between the cultural heritage and research sectors/networks, the plan looks at how to better understand researchers’ needs and habits and then translate them into improvements in digital collections and tools.\_</p>\r\n"

There is a continued high interest in the service Europeana provides to educators and in the use of the educational material developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First run in 2018, the Europeana Education Massive Open Online Course, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/first-europeana-education-mooc-giving-teachers-confidence-to-use-digital-cultural-heritage\">‘Europeana in your classroom</a>’, created with <a href=\"http://www.eun.org/home\">European Schoolnet</a> (a network of 34 European Ministries of Education) was updated. The Europeana MOOCs (in English, Spanish and Portuguese) were well-received with a total of 2,000 participants from 45 countries and 700 certificates (which corresponds to an average completion rate of 30%, and far exceeds the 10% average of other <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.19173/irrodl.v15i1.1651\">MOOCs</a>). MOOC participants’ testimonials confirmed the positive impact of this learning resource with regard to pedagogical innovation and capacity building. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-mooc-now-available-in-five-languages\">MOOCs will run again</a> in 2020 in the original three languages, plus Italian and French.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In collaboration with European Schoolnet , the Europeana Teacher Ambassador network was established and the\_ Europeana Teacher User Group expanded. In the last year, The Europeana Teacher Ambassadors reached over 509 teachers and about 13,000 students with their 24 webinars. The Europeana Teacher User Group created 213 new learning scenarios\_ with Europeana data as well as 85 stories of their implementation by teachers in the classroom. These resources are featured on the <a href=\"https://teachwitheuropeana.eun.org/\">Teaching with Europeana blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.euroclio.eu\">Euroclio</a>, the European Association of History Educators, published 12 new source collections and 12 new eLearning activities using Europeana data on <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana</a> for history educators across Europe. They cover a wide range of themes, including Napoleon, medicine and anatomy, Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution and more. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/teacher-training-guide\">teacher training guide</a> on how to use online tools and cultural heritage data to promote historical thinking was also updated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our efforts towards education, the Portuguese Direção-Geral da Educação (DGE) integrated in their portal a <a href=\"http://erte.dge.mec.pt/europeana-pesquisar\">search bar</a> which allows their national community of educators to retrieve relevant Europeana content via the Europeana API. In addition, the Finnish educational publisher Itslearning now offers more resources with Europeana content to their users by complementing the existing Europeana API with 12 Historiana resources (six of which with Europeana content) in their virtual library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.diculther.it/hackcultura2019-lhackathon-degli-studenti-per-la-titolarita-culturale/\">HackCultura 2019</a> campaign was a joint initiative of\_ several Italian educational partners and Europeana Foundation, with <a href=\"https://www.diculther.it/\">DiCultHer</a> in the lead, which ran between October 2018 and April 2019. The campaign invited Italian students to create multimedia projects with cultural\_ content. It was officially closed with an <a href=\"https://www.diculther.it/matera-11-e-12-aprile-2019-programma/\">award event</a> within the Fourth Week of Digital Cultures in April in Matera, Italy. The #ImparaconEuropeana challenge within this competition awarded certificates to six projects involving 94 students from Calabria, Puglia, Emilia Romagna and Molise. These projects were published on the <a href=\"https://movio.beniculturali.it/iccu/daunoggettoraccontalatuascuola/it/46/prodotti-realizzati-con-l-ausilio-di-europeana\">ICCU platform</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developers and enthusiasts with imagination, skill and a desire to be playful have this year produced some incredible applications and projects using digital cultural content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/gif-it-up-2018-your-favourite-gif-making-competition-is-back-for-its-fifth-year\">GIF IT UP 2018 competition</a> - inviting people to create GIFs using openly licensed objects from Europeana Collections, DPLA, Trove and DigitalNZ - included a special prize for GIFs made using World War One material. This year a record 250 entries demonstrated a growing appetite for this kind of cultural challenge. In the last year, GIFs created with Europeana content on GIPHY reached around 87 million impressions.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captivated by his own family history during WW1, developer Yoan Fanis of <a href=\"http://www.digixart.com/\">DigixArt</a> worked with <a href=\"https://www.aardman.com/\">Aardman</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/11-11-memories-retold\">BandaiNamco</a> on ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/data/11-11-memories-retold\">11-11: Memories Retold</a>’ - a unique video game that uses objects and stories from the Europeana 1914-1918 collection and tells a touching story about the relationship between two men on different sides of the war. This excellent collaboration brought digital cultural heritage to the general public in the form of an immersive storytelling experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 25 March, the Europeana STEM Challenge was launched, offering 20,000 euro\_to the best educational videos using Europeana openly licensed content to teach STEM (science/technology/engineering/math) topics. A total of 24 applications from 17 countries were submitted. The winning <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/steam-engine-video-project-wins-the-europeana-stem-challenge\">video project</a> ‘Igniting an Industrial Revolution through Steam and Physics’ by the American mechanical engineer Teddy Tablante was awarded 8,000 euro\_and will be available to teachers and students in October 2019.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with 13 other partners for THE ARTS+ Innovation Summit, the Europeana Foundation contributed to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/european-manifesto-on-supporting-innovation-for-cultural-creative-sectors\">European Manifesto on Supporting Innovation in the Cultural and Creative Sectors</a> at European, national and regional levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Making it easier to provide collections to Europeana'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>A new bespoke system for processing collections and an accreditation scheme to support aggregators are making it easier and more rewarding to provide digital culture to Europeana.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana Collections displays cultural heritage material from around 3,700 different institutions. A network of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">aggregators </a>collects the data from, for example, a specific country, or a type of institution like museums, or on a particular topic, like natural history, and from there, sends it on to Europeana.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/search?q=aggregators-forum\">Europeana Aggregators’ Forum</a> brings together the various national, domain and thematic aggregators, so they can share expertise and knowledge. A new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/breathing-new-life-into-the-europeana-aggregators-forum\">accreditation scheme</a> empowers them to support their contributing institutions and to give those institutions greater assurances in the skills and knowledge of their aggregators, with the goal of working towards improving the quality of data in Europeana Collections.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past year, over 130 cultural heritage institutions from 34 countries received individual support, guidance and advice from the aggregators on how to prepare their material for inclusion in Europeana. This eventually affected more than 10 million records.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new bespoke system for managing new and updated material, Metis, is now used by the team at Europeana, and with its automated procedures, is already reducing the time it takes for a collection to be processed and published. This means that updates to collections are available online much sooner than they were before. The processes that Metis facilitates, such as being able to check for broken links, support efforts to improve data quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality standard, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, has this year been revised to include quality standards for metadata in addition to the existing standards for content. In the last year, the number of non-compliant records was reduced by 3\_million. Europeana continues to encourage aggregators and institutions to refer to this Framework and to create better content and metadata. In line with the Framework, Metis calculates and ‘tags’ each record in Europeana Collections with the tier it corresponds to for both content and metadata. This means it’s easier to identify collections that require improvement as well as those that are of a high standard and so can be promoted and used in more ways.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An extensive series of events, including national workshops in Slovenia and Austria, brought cultural heritage institutions, aggregating partners and the Europeana Foundation together to address the challenges and benefits of publishing cultural heritage online, using the Europeana Publishing Framework to demonstrate how collection quality influences potential uses.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Making Europeana Collections multilingual'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>It’s easy to search for something on Europeana Collections and see results in your own language. Ongoing developments are helping to make those results richer by including results from other languages too.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana Collections contains material from galleries, libraries, archives and museums in all 28 EU member countries - and more. The website can be navigated in 27 languages, and it’s easy to search for items described in your own language. Ongoing developments will help people to find what they’re looking for - even if it’s described in another language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In total, 37 languages are used to describe the collections. However, more than half of all the material (57%) uses one of just five languages - English, German, Dutch, Norwegian or French.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When there is appropriate information available, established vocabularies (other sets of data) are used to link in extra information to a collection item, such as multilingual labels, or different variants of names for people and places. This makes it easier for people to search for and find items on Europeana Collections. Some examples of these vocabularies are the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (Getty Research Institute), DBpedia and Wikidata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality standard, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publishing-framework\">Europeana Publishing Framework</a>, has recently been revised to encourage the people who work on metadata to include elements like titles translated into multiple languages, and context like place names (which are themselves multilingual), as well as important language tags to show which language is being used. With these tags present, more automatic linking and translation processes can be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana’s partners are working to translate significant documents such as the Europeana Publishing Framework and Europeana’s rights statements into more languages so that the professionals using them have a better understanding of them.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making Europeana more multilingual is a priority. In the past year, we carried out a pilot project with the eTranslation team - another European Union-funded DSI project. We're now building on that pilot with further experimentation activities with a view to taking\_advantage of the project’s automatic translation potential for Europeana. \_<br>\r\nA two-day event this October under Finland’s presidency of the Council of the EU will see the Europeana Foundation and the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture focussing on needs, expectations and ways forward for multilingualism in digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>More curated and high-quality content, together with public campaigns such as Europeana Migration and transcribathons, make Europeana Collections relevant and interesting to today’s audiences.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>In the last year, two new thematic collections were introduced. Europeana Newspapers gathers over 4 million newspaper pages, spanning four centuries and 20 countries from across Europe. More than 800,000 newspaper issues are available in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) full-text, meaning they are fully searchable and readable in text format. While Europeana Archaeology gathers over 2 million items (images, texts, 3D objects, videos) of archaeological heritage from palaeolithic to contemporary times including movable and immovable heritage, archaeological landscapes and archaeological archives.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 2019, the Europeana Women’s season promoted stories and editorials including 12 blogs, four galleries and one exhibition about women’s history on social media each day of the month. These stories used cultural heritage content from 80 institutions from over 20 countries around the world. On International Women’s Day (8 March) the final chapter of exhibition <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/pioneers\">Pioneers: Trailblazing women in the arts, sciences and society</a> was published. The exhibition performed extremely well with about 35,000 visitors so far and excellent audience reviews.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two more exhibitions were also added.\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/heritage-at-risk\">Heritage at Risk</a>\_(available in seven languages)\_explores the natural and man-made threats to cultural heritage, from ancient times until\_today. And\_<a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/rise-of-literacy-in-europe\">The Rise of Literacy in Europe</a>\_shows how a passion for the written word moved out of the Church and into society at large over the last four centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over several years of collecting personal stories for Europeana 1914-1918, it has become clear that encouraging citizens to think about their heritage in the past and present can be transformational, instilling pride and opening up new perspectives on personal identities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Europeana Migration campaign, young and old joined in online - contributing to a <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/migration\">migration thematic collection </a>on Europeana Collections - and in person, sharing their personal migration stories, with accompanying pictures, diaries, videos and letters. Since last year, 21 collection day events, and associated exhibitions, lectures, panel discussions and social events, have taken place in 12 countries, working with more than 30 partner organisations. Over 3,000 people attended, sharing more than <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?q=europeana_collectionName%3A2084002*&amp;view=grid\">692 stories</a> and more than 1,200 personal objects.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Highlighting the work of <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/world-war-I\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-14-18-centenary-tour\">Centenary Tour</a> included an online exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/visions-of-war\">Visions of War</a>, and monthly focusses on different parts of the Europeana 1914-1918 collection. Four transcribathon events (Greece, Germany, Italy, Belgium) and one collection day event (Hungary) engaged citizens directly. During the final event, <a href=\"https://transcribathon.com/en/runs/brussels/\">17 previous transcribathon winners</a> from around Europe participated in a European transcribathon championship. The talented and multilingual participants transcribed over 313,000 characters and 298 documents.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, associated European-funded projects <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/migration-in-the-arts-and-science\">Migration in the Arts and Sciences</a>, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/rise-of-literacy\">Rise of Literacy</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/byzantine-art-and-archaeology\">Byzantine Art and Archaeology</a> were able to improve existing digitised content and add it to Europeana Collections along with thousands of newly digitised good-quality items. These projects also contributed with editorial content for Europeana Collections in the form of blogs, galleries and an <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/exhibitions/rise-of-literacy-in-europe\">exhibition</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Making it easier to search and browse collections online'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Discovering inspiring content in Europeana Collections with or without a specific search should be quick and easy. A range of developments over the last year is helping to deliver a better online experience.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Two-thirds of traffic to Europeana Collections comes from Google. Improvements were made this year on search engine optimisation and a new site map to make more pages discoverable by a Google search, so that more people find Europeana Collections material when they’re searching for culture online.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to find a single interesting item on Europeana Collections is good, but being able to see a range of items and related information on one screen is even better. Europeana Collections’ ‘<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/improving-discoverability-with-new-entities-in-europeana-collections\">Entity</a>’ pages provide this function. They are landing pages or entry points to content by a specific person, or on a certain topic, like <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/people/146951-wolfgang-amadeus-mozart.html\">Mozart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/48-photograph.html\">photographs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/explore/topics/95-art-deco.html\">Art Deco</a>. They provide context by combining information from Wikipedia with results relating to a person or topic. Items connected to an entity have the added benefit of taking the multilingual search terms associated with that entity, so they will turn up in searches performed in different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The detail or ‘item’ page on Europeana Collections has been redesigned to make sharing, downloading and crediting an item simpler, and now includes ‘next’ and ‘previous’ options to make moving through search results easier. The page also shows where the item has been used before - if it’s in a blog post, gallery, exhibition or entity - so it’s easy to find more context and related items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some types of material require special functionality. In 2018-9, <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/newspapers\">Europeana Newspapers</a> was released as a thematic collection gathering over 4 million newspapers from 23 countries. More than 800,000 of those newspaper issues are available in OCR’ed full-text, meaning they are fully searchable and readable in text format. Developing this new functionality meant facing a lot of data, technical and coordination challenges, but the developments and changes to the infrastructure, APIs, on-screen display and filters benefit not just the Newspapers collection, but the entire platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, these developments take us closer to our goal of increasing visitor numbers, repeat visits and session length through more engaging experiences and in-depth browsing.</p>\r\n"

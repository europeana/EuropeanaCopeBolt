You can navigate the website in 27 languages, and it’s easy to search for items described in your own language. But things get more complicated when you want to see items that match your search but are described in a different language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In total, 37 languages are used to describe the collections. However, more than half of all the material (57%) uses one of just five languages - English, German, Dutch, Norwegian or French.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Making an item described in one language turn up in the results or related material when searched for in another language is not easy. And we know we have a long way to go but making positive changes in this area is one of our priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-re-working-to-make-sure-culture-is-for-everyone-in-any-language\">Read more about our approach to multilingualism</a></p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What did we talk about?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event was a mixture of speeches, case study presentations, workshop sessions and a panel discussion. Finland’s Ministry of Culture and Education State Secretary Tuomo Puumala emphasised the role of culture and heritage in creating a democratic and inclusive Europe. Keynote speaker, Anne Bajart, Deputy Head of Unit at the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology at the European Commission made a call to cultural heritage institutions and Europeana content providers to ‘help and support the development of the eTranslation project by providing the curated translations they have’. Other speakers then covered a broad range of topics, including multilingual policy, user experience design, learnings from automatic translation projects, multilingual metadata, linked vocabularies, automatic subject indexing services, and measuring success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Working in groups, participants were then invited to share their experiences of opportunities and challenges related to multilingualism.&nbsp;They identified benefits of multilingualism and discussed what solutions or changes are needed to address the challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Benefits of multilingualism</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the speeches and workshop exercises, the following benefits of multilingualism emerged:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Access to more sources of information, and to the knowledge and history of other cultures and less common language groups</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Promotion of socially inclusive societies and mutual understanding of diverse cultures</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Increased usability of digital cultural heritage in education and research</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Outreach to more diverse audiences, attraction of more visitors and increased exposure of collections</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Contribution to a stronger European identity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Challenges facing the advancement of multilingualism</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To realise the identified opportunities, a number of challenges need to be addressed. The issues the sector faces in relation to multilingualism were identified as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lack of understanding of the benefits&nbsp;of multilingual digital cultural heritage and the opportunities it brings to the sector and to&nbsp; society, causing a lack of unified multilingual/translation policy&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lack of awareness and failure to share, disseminate and promote competences and knowledge in the sector, leading to a shortage of expert resources and training</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lack of tools, technologies and digital resources that are readily adapted to digital cultural heritage and able to tackle the intricate nature and constant evolution of linguistic concepts related to our domain</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lack of critical mass for applying machine learning to less common languages</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Wider issues in cultural heritage that also have an impact on handling multilingual issues: lack of quality (translations of) metadata/content, lack of interoperability/ standardisation, institutions not aware of or not making use of existing tools, lack of R&amp;D in future technologies e.g. AI.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Potential solutions to advance multilingualism</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It became clear that addressing these issues is a shared responsibility of the Member States’ ministries of culture and cultural heritage institutions, aggregators and data providers, Europeana and the European Commission. Digital innovation hubs, the Europeana Network Association and the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, the EuropeanaTech Community, domain representatives, associations, ontology providers, developers and the DCHE, can all positively contribute to such advancement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solutions and actions identified include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Co-operation at European, national and local level among all parties involved, including content providers and collection managers</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Making more funding available to institutions for investment in the improvement of multilingualism</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Providing standards/frameworks for multilingual data cataloguing practices, crowdsourcing, curated translation, and mass translation for the cultural domain</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Supporting the development of more expertise in the sector</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Raising awareness and facilitating the transfer of existing tools, standards and frameworks, and R&amp;D by Europeana and/or the language technology industry</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Raising awareness about the benefits of good quality content and metadata</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Improved ingestion of metadata from aggregators to Europeana, supported by relevant services such as automated data cleansing tools</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the next steps to progress multilingual reach in Europeana and in the sector at large, Europeana is developing a recommended multilingual strategy and roadmap paper that builds on the output from the workshop and the expert presentations at this event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For more information on the event, read the <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/Europeana/tag/finnish-presidency\">presentations</a> and see the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/europeanaimages2/albums/72157711667364238\">images</a> and the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/372582901/dd1e668bc0\">video</a> from the meeting.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>About James</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I started off as a botanist, but by the mid 1990s I was creating web pages and putting together thematic online directories of links to useful sites. These were the pre-Google days and it was all hand-crafted html, but if there's one thread that runs through all my work it has been helping people to find stuff and do interesting things on the internet! I ended up running the <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/\">Kew Gardens website</a> and working on some of their earliest digitisation projects. This also gave me my first taste of Europeana through the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BDATA_PROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Royal+Botanic+Gardens%2C+Kew&amp;f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=OpenUp%21&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\">Open Up! project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Meanwhile I had, through necessity, taught myself a bit of coding and started experimenting, developing projects based on openly licensed cultural heritage content on platforms such as Flickr Commons and then Europeana. This led me to a two-year job managing Europeana Labs and outreach to creative industries and developers, cementing my passion for doing novel, impactful things with open content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are&nbsp;you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am currently doing some freelance work and have a part-time role back at Kew Gardens enriching, structuring and analysing archival data in the research project <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/projects/mobile-museum-economic-botany-in-circulation\">Mobile Museum</a>,&nbsp; which explores the historic movement of museum objects since the mid 19th century. This working arrangement does not please the bank manager, but it does give me the freedom to devote time to experimentation and creation, something I'd encourage everyone to do!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My biggest recent achievement was building the site <a href=\"https://astreetnearyou.org/\">A Street Near You</a>, an online project exploring the local legacy of the First World War. It was born out of a frustration that no-one seemed to be truly capitalising on the data (much of it crowdsourced, but with some amazing institutional collections) that had been gathered during the centenary of the First World War. Intended purely as a quick demonstration of what I thought was possible, it's fair to say it <a href=\"http://www.catchingtherain.com/2018/12/my-viral-moment-a-street-near-you-the-power-of-linking-first-world-war-data-sources/\">went 'viral'</a> - 240,000 people visited the site in the first three days after it launched in November 2018. The reactions, especially on social media, were truly humbling. The project still consumes far more of my time than I care to mention, as I feel there is so much more to do!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My instinctive answer to both questions is messy data! I'd also say that as I’ve got older, my tolerance for institutional inertia has decreased, but with that has come the fun of being something more of an adventurer and experimenter. I don't seem to have got into any real trouble, yet!&nbsp; My next big challenge is finding a new job after my contract ends in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was only once I had worked at Europeana that I became aware of the fundamental role it has in the cultural heritage sector. It's easy to see it as just an aggregator and access point for content - a kind of specialised search engine - but actually it's the work it does in building networks and communities, setting best practice, and advocating change that gives it a unique place globally. Being in the Members Council feels like a way to support that and contribute to its ongoing success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I'd love to share my experiences and act as an advocate, trying in some small way to contribute to the ongoing success of the work that Europeana does.&nbsp; Specifically, I've joined the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-impact-community\">Impact Community</a> and have very recently looked at applying the principles in the Impact Playbook to some of my own projects, which has proved a fascinating way to understand and communicate more about their achievements.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>With partners of the Europeana Creative project (2013-2015), we identified a problem - a real need for more consistent and better quality material in Europeana Collections. We had an idea. We talked to our partners. We looked into how data specialists work. And into what users want. Four years ago, we came up with a quality standard for digital content - the Europeana Publishing Framework. Then we kept working and in 2019 added the complementary missing part - a quality standard for metadata. Today, it’s possible to measure the quality of any record in Europeana Collections. Here’s an insight into just some of the activities that have helped us to reach this point.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A team effort</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana Foundation worked with aggregators and the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee\">Data Quality Committee</a> (a Europeana Network Association and EuropeanaTech Working Group) to develop the ideas behind the metadata component of the Framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Implementing the Framework meant even more teamwork - various teams from the Europeana Foundation were involved in changing the Europeana Data Model so that the various ‘tiers’ could be represented in the data, in making sure that our in-house data processing system, Metis, could process and calculate the new tiers and lastly in making sure our API could publish the tiers data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Defining metadata quality</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying what metadata quality meant in the context of Europeana was an exercise of great significance for us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we wanted to know what difference better metadata makes to the people who use Europeana Collections. This resulted in a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/data-quality-committee#discovery-user-scenarios\">series of usage scenarios</a> that showed us a range of ways people search for and retrieve information. These scenarios were based on ‘<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_DSI/Deliverables/europeana-dsi-d6.2-requirementsforeuropeana.pdf\">personas</a>’ (example people with specific needs and backgrounds) that had been developed by the Europeana Foundation to help guide the design process for Europeana’s products. These personas and scenarios provide us with information about who uses Europeana Collections, why and how, so that we (with the Data Quality Committee) could develop a Framework that connected metadata quality with a better user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we needed to look at how to define our quality requirements in a clear way so that institutions sharing collections with Europeana could provide the appropriate metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of discussions took place around making more metadata elements mandatory for all records. The conclusion was that mandatoriness does not always entail good data quality: the required elements are not necessarily in the source metadata, and so incorrect or duplicate information may be added with a view to fulfilling the criteria rather than with a view to enhancing experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, the DQC agreed on two new ways of categorising the current metadata elements: mandatory elements and enabling elements. Mandatory elements are required as a fundamental minimum for all metadata descriptions. Enabling elements are desirable but optional - including them supports functionalities for a specific set of usage scenarios. The enabling elements are now a key component of the metadata tiers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Metadata Quality Tiers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The metadata tiers components are based on three criteria: language, enabling elements and contextual classes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage the use of language tags to show which language is being used, which means that more automatic linking and translation processes can be implemented to develop multilingual services. We also recommend the use of ‘enabling elements’ in the metadata to allow for greater information retrieval and service improvement. And finally, we encourage the inclusion of a range of contextual information such as place names, dates and subjects either as metadata elements or as links to contextual vocabularies that will also improve the findability and accuracy of objects in Europeana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more language information, enabling elements and context is provided, the higher up the tiers you go. Higher tiers provide more benefits and more potential for your collections to be found, promoted and reused.</p>\r\n"

I enjoyed working together with my colleagues here at Europeana to make this happen. I’m excited to have made a real, positive difference by contributing to the enhancement and the increased exposure of this fascinating content from all over Europe.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Now it’s over to you</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, creating a standard isn’t enough. It has to be used to have any real value. So, what can you do?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you work with metadata…&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Publishing Framework to improve the quality of the content and metadata you deliver to Europeana.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Practical information on how to achieve this can be found in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/publication-policy\">Europeana Publishing Guide</a>, which outlines the submission criteria for content and metadata, and offers detailed information about the tiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Embrace the Publishing Framework as a tool that can help you to better understand how your metadata supports users’ digital needs and to design new curation strategies according to it. The Europeana Publishing Framework defines what good quality is in the context of Europeana but we also hope it can inspire you to design better standards for your own services and your own audiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you don’t work with metadata...</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Share the Publishing Framework with the leadership of your institution, and with the data specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support the ongoing implementation of the Europeana Publishing Framework by translating it into your own language.

                body: "<h3><strong>Four newly accredited aggregators</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are delighted to announce that four aggregators have recently completed their accreditations. This brings the total number of accredited aggregators to 37.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Congratulations to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/latvian-national-e-content-aggregator\">Latvian National E-content Aggregator</a> which brings together Latvian cultural heritage content with historical value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/czech-digital-library-ceska-digitalni-knihovna\">Czech Digital Library </a>which aggregates Czech literature from the 19th century to the modern day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/digital-repository-of-ireland\">Digital Repository of Ireland </a>which brings together Irish contemporary and historical cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/organisation/formula-aggregation-service-of-the-national-library-of-finland\">Formula Aggregation Service of the National Library of Finland </a>which is a national aggregator collecting cultural heritage objects from Finnish institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Henning Scholz, Partner and Operations Manager for the Europeana Foundation says, ‘We’re really pleased to add these four aggregators to our accredited partners. The scheme has been a very positive step for the aggregation ecosystem - we list accredited partners on Europeana Pro so it’s easy to see who has reached our aggregator standards. Cultural heritage institutions can see who these trusted partners are and work with them, getting help, advice and support for their digital transformations.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">See full list of accredited aggregators</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Getting accredited</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Any aggregator, whether large or small, national, domain or thematic, is eligible to apply for Europeana aggregator accreditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To become an accredited aggregator, partners need to commit to fulfilling <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOfjChpu6fZUpigH0RRfx8Vl9gpagQ9HpogMLI82qXU/edit#\">a range of responsibilities</a>, including providing appropriate information to us about who they collect data from, committing to helping those institutions to improve their data and actively participating in the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aggregators wishing to be accredited must apply to the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, agreeing with and committing to the required responsibilities. Then they submit a test dataset and ultimately sign the Data Exchange Agreement or make sure that each of its data providers do so. Accreditation status is reviewed by the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum at least once a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Benefits of accreditation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accredited Europeana aggregators enjoy the following benefits (in addition to the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/reasons-to-share-your-data-on-europeana-collections\">general benefits</a> of working with Europeana):&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Membership of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum (EAF), including travel reimbursement for attending EAF meetings</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">One vote in decisions taken by the EAF</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Greater visibility of aggregator - profile published on a dedicated page on Europeana Pro</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Accredited aggregators act as representatives of the Europeana initiative when working with cultural heritage institutions</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">Use of EAF logo to identify accredited aggregators as trusted partners</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being an accredited aggregator for Europeana could also be of benefit in grant applications, advocacy, and recognition by cultural ministries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marco Rendina, Chair of the Europeana Aggregators’ Forum, says,</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">‘The EAF accreditation scheme finally gives aggregators a formal recognition of their capacity and reliability, acknowledging their crucial role in the Europeana ecosystem. At the same time, it gives cultural heritage institutions the ability to identify trusted partners that can support them in contributing to the Europeana initiative and in their digital transformation.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Are you interested in becoming an accredited aggregator for Europeana?

                body: "<p><a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/industrial-heritage\">Europe at Work</a>, Europeana's season for autumn 2019, brings stories of personal working lives together with archive material on industrial and labour-related heritage. For cultural heritage institutions, the season provides an opportunity to engage audiences by inviting people to share a story about their work alongside pictures, diaries, videos and letters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some institutions are recording these stories through <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work#hosting-a-collection-day\">collection days</a>, but social media also offers a fantastic opportunity for galleries, libraries and museums to encourage people to participate in the season and showcase their own collections - as the Swedish National Heritage Board’s (Riksantikvarieämbetet) campaign demonstrates!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>A social media campaign to encourage engagement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.raa.se/\">Swedish National Heritage Board</a> planned a social media campaign around Europe at Work to draw attention to the season and encourage Swedes to share stories of their working lives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since September, their social media channels have had a weekly focus on a different sector, object, or profession to encourage people to engage with Europe at Work; for example, the Instagram post below invites anyone who has been employed as a seasonal worker to share their experience with Europeana. They also wrote a <a href=\"https://www.raa.se/2019/09/europeatwork/\">post in Swedish</a> to explain to people in their own language how they could contribute to Europe at Work.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B3J7TtJiM__/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

På @europeana_eu s webbsida kan du ladda upp din egna eller din släkts historier och foton av objekt eller upplevelser.

Engaging with Swedish cultural heritage institutions was an especially important part of their strategy, as many smaller data partners deliver data to the Swedish national aggregator for Europeana (<a href=\"https://www.raa.se/in-english/digital-services/about-soch/\">SOCH</a>). By encouraging these partners to engage with the campaign, the Swedish National Heritage Board created an opportunity to show them how their material is being used through Europeana Collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach has allowed the Swedish National Heritage Board to highlight and share their data partners'&nbsp;collections and give audiences examples of the diversity of material that makes up Europe’s industrial heritage - hopefully inspiring more people to make contributions!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Get involved</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re inspired by the Swedish National Heritage Board’s example, there are lots of ways to get involved with Europe at Work on social media:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Sources in ‘Women Working’</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Historiana source collection<a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/historical-content/source-collections/women-working\"> Women Working</a> brings together digitised material from <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana Collections</a> which shows women from around the world throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The collection gives an overview of some of the work carried out by women over the past two hundred years. The majority of the sources show them doing either agricultural labour, manufacturing work or washing clothes. The exceptions are a photo of Marie Curie at work as a scientist and two cartoons from Punch Magazine which ridicule women in medical professions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The large number of sources in the collection encourages students to look for differences and similarities across times and cultures. The sources generally suggest that in the past, women did mostly manual labour. The few examples of women doing professional work are represented in a way that signals scepticism from either the maker of the source or from the intended public at the time. The sources selected aim to encourage students to consider how the availability of source material from a certain period influences and shapes our perspective of that time - in this case, how we perceive the role of women in the economy of the 19th and 20th centuries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you teach Women Working? </strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Historiana’s <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/student/view/eeeb1d95-9b25-419e-a16f-45754ede52c0/text/bb_0\">e-learning activity on Women Working</a>, which complements the source collection, uses digitised heritage material to encourage students to explore the topic:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">The first part of the activity asks students to analyse two cartoons from Punch (a satirical magazine from the 19th and early 20th century), paying attention to&nbsp;the way women and men are portrayed. They can annotate the sources using the e-learning analysing tool, and comment on the implications of these cartoons and the extent to which they fit any preconceptions students have about women working in the 19th and 20th centuries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">The second part of the activity asks students to divide sources based on the parts of the world they come from. Even when sorted, these sources&nbsp;imply that in the past two centuries, women from all around the world mainly did agricultural work and simple&nbsp;manufacturing.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\">The final part of the activity asks students to reflect on how our perception of the past is shaped by sources and how this perception might influence our thoughts on women working in the present. The abundance of source material showing women doing manual work, combined with the sources that ridicule women doing professional work, suggests that women had a lower socio-economic status in the 19th and well into the 20th century. This activity could be used as a lead-in to a class discussion on the construction of our views of the past and how sources are likely only to show or tell only part of what actually happened. Teachers could challenge their students to be critical towards what sources present as ‘fact’.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Explore <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/industrial-heritage\">industrial heritage on Europeana Collections</a> and find more teaching resources including units, source collections and eLearning activities on the <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/#/\">Historiana</a>&nbsp;website.

                body: "<h3><strong>What inspired you to participate in Europeana STEM Challenge?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While looking through Europeana Collections, I found amazing images of locomotives and steam engines which inspired me to make a set of videos.&nbsp; The most mind-blowing image for me was <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200579/cgadyhve.html?q=steam+carriage#dcId=1572517736115&amp;p=1\">a picture of the steam carriage patent from 1828</a>.&nbsp; The idea that this image from almost 200 years ago evolved into&nbsp;the modern-day car really cemented my realisation that engineering and history are intertwined and I wanted to share this idea with other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you choose steam engines topic for your application?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Steam engines are fascinating because they are a technology that has come and gone, yet they have&nbsp;dozens of descendant technologies that we use on a daily basis.&nbsp;I chose to do the first episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMgP-4O99qU\">‘The Engine that Ignited a Revolution’</a> on the Newcomen Engine (the world’s first steam engine) because in addition to exploring the concept of vaporisation, it provided an insight into what makes a technology revolutionary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I decided to do the second episode <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnClSss50pI\">‘How can steam drive this MASSIVE locomotive?’</a> on the traction engine (a self-propelled steam engine) because I wanted to provide students and viewers with an animated view of gas laws at work.&nbsp; Gas laws are critical to engineering, but many students mix up how pressure, temperature, volume and number of molecules interact with one another. I wanted to provide an example of the laws in action in order to cement students’ understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What were the most challenging aspects behind the creation of the video series?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hardest aspects were finding accurate reference images so that I could properly model the different engines.&nbsp; Specifically, the inside of the traction engine's cylinder and its slide valve were very hard to find, and&nbsp;even more difficult to model properly.&nbsp; This is because images from the 1800s are very scarce, so it speaks to the breadth of Europeana’s resources that they had these available. Another challenge was learning to adapt my style in order to smoothly combine a history lesson with a science and engineering lesson.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do these videos support students’ learning?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is difficult for students to learn and internalise concepts that they cannot visualise. I was always bad at remembering formulas and equations, but once I had an image in my mind for what was physically happening, I could derive the equation.&nbsp; These videos help by providing visuals for concepts taught in school, especially concepts that are too small to see and nearly impossible to draw on a whiteboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How did winning the Europeana STEM Challenge contribute to your Youtube channel’s development?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Winning the Europeana STEM challenge has expanded the scope of the videos I make.&nbsp;Before the challenge, I focused on videos detailing the inner workings of smartphones to advance students’ understanding of speakers and sound.&nbsp; Winning this challenge inspired me to study steam engines, and after a few more videos on smartphones, I plan to produce more videos on steam and the physics related to temperature and gases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Winning the Europeana STEM challenge has also helped me to broaden my European audience. Until now, my audience on YouTube has predominantly been from India and the US.&nbsp; However, as these two videos explore aspects of European history, European viewers will have a vested interest in watching them to learn about their own history and engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Do you have future plans for Branch Education and video development?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, there are a lot of videos in the pipeline.&nbsp; The next episodes focus on printed circuit boards and quantum computers.&nbsp; Following those, I'll get back to doing videos on temperature - including a short video on my favourite method for cooling down my morning tea, and why it is effective.&nbsp; There is also a plan to work with some local science teachers to&nbsp;develop an activity on dissecting smartphones.&nbsp; In addition to dissecting frogs or mice in biology, I hope that one day all students will also dissect smartphones to learn about engineering.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>Tekniska museet has been providing their data to Europeana Collections via <a href=\"https://www.raa.se/in-english/digital-services/about-soch/\">SOCH</a> (the Swedish National Aggregator) since 2009. Why is it important for you to continue sharing your collections on a European platform?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our experience has been very positive. When we migrated to another database system and created new principles for our data in 2016, our colleagues at Europeana were very helpful in changing our data sets, and this year, we decided to make even more of our material digitally available. Above all, we recognise that through Europeana, our images have a wider reach across Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tekniska museet has contributed the largest collection of objects to Europeana’s <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/collections/industrial-heritage\">Industrial Heritage collection</a>, and been involved in their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work season</a>. What was the importance of this for your institution?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our mission is that the collections and cultural heritage material that we manage reach as many people as possible. As ‘Europe at Work’ and the thematic collection help people to find relevant data, it is positive for us that our collections have been so prominent in these initiatives. Tekniska museet is also active in the <a href=\"http://www.sim.se/\">Swedish Industrial Heritage Association</a> and ArbetSam, and we see possibilities for so many other museums of work and industrial heritage in Sweden.&nbsp;As the Swedish central museum for technical and industrial history, we engage with the sector to preserve cultural heritage and make it accessible. We encourage smaller working life museums to use resources such as Europeana to find images, objects and information.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3>All of your objects are openly licensed - 60% as public domain and 40% as CC BY. Why has Tekniska museet decided to use open rights statements?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We agreed in our digitisation plan in 2016 that we should make our data licensing as open as possible. As the copyright has expired on many of our images, we decided to publish them as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/\">public domain</a>. The museum’s own images taken by staff members or our photographers after 1969 are marked as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/\">CC BY</a>. The museum’s main purpose is to collect and communicate our knowledge – we have to show our collections in all possible ways. Digital technology gives us a wider reach, so we want our objects to be openly licensed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the biggest challenges that the Tekniska museet experiences when sharing data?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the challenges lie in database structures. Swedish is not a widely-used language and most of our information is in Swedish only. If our database allowed for language tagging, our collections could become relevant, and our images and objects more accessible at a European level. Aggregation of data from our database to SOCH and then to Europeana presents some other challenges due to limitations and backlog. However, we are also working towards creating standards for our metadata and are active in Swedish initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.digisam.se/om-digisam/\">Digisam</a>.&nbsp;Tekniska museet takes part in various working groups started by Digisam because we want to be part of discussions on topics such as shared metadata standards or principles for digitisation and long-term storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

However, we appreciate that all of those air miles have an impact on our planet. Therefore we’ve worked with <a href=\"https://treesforall.nl/en/\">Trees for All</a> to plant 216 trees in the Netherlands to help offset our collective carbon footprint from the conference. The organisation plants dozens of acres of forest every year, both in the Netherlands and abroad, and protects existing forests and woodland to contribute to improving the standard of living of people in developing countries. Trees for All work heart and soul for a green and healthy planet, and we are very happy to work with them to reduce the environmental impact of Europeana 2019.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference is also the first time we’ve introduced <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/livestreaming-europeana-2019\">livestreaming</a> at a Europeana event. Now anyone can watch the plenary sessions from the comfort of their home or office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Making Europeana 2019 paperless</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another first for a Europeana event - this year we will not be producing a paper programme. Instead, we’ve invested in <a href=\"https://europeana2019.sched.com/\">Sched</a>, an online programme and digital event tool that allows you to create, save, and share a schedule for the conference. You can also link Sched up with your social media profiles to see what your colleagues are getting up to, and view who is attending sessions so that you can network ahead of meetings. It’s free to register and you can keep your profile private if you do not want to take advantage of the networking elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-44adaa55-7fff-16f5-e4e6-6e5c22f89657\">Reducing single-use plastics</b></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We won’t be offering single use plastic bottles during the conference. Instead, we’ve teamed up with EPAL, Lisbon’s water suppliers, to provide sustainable <a href=\"https://www.epal.pt/EPAL/en/menu/products-and-services/fill-forever\">Fill Forever</a> bottles for every attendee of Europeana 2019. Fill Forever bottles are reusable and recyclable and ultra-light to carry about with you at all times. They can be refilled using the water coolers available throughout the National Library, and we will also serve coffee, tea and water at breaks throughout the conference. We encourage all attendees to bring their reusable coffee cups!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reducing our meat intake</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the kind support of our partners, The National Library of Portugal, we have committed to making 70% of the conference meals vegetarian. Ingredients used for meals at Europeana 2019 have been sourced from local markets.</p>\r\n"

For example, we found out recently that the digital services we maintain have a carbon footprint equivalent to the travel undertaken by staff at the Europeana Foundation. So where possible, we now use trains instead of planes and offset our carbon footprint for the flights we do take. But we are also working on reducing redundant software and aim to work with tech providers who use renewable energy only (check out the work of the <a href=\"https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/\">Green Web Foundation</a>). Reduce where you can, offset where you can't - an approach we are taking to Europeana 2019.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Instead we have chosen to use Sched as our <a href=\"https://europeana2019.sched.com/\">digital programme and event planner</a>. Sched allows you to create, save and share a schedule for the conference. You can also link it with your social media profiles to see what your colleagues are getting up to, and view who is attending sessions so that you can network ahead of meetings. It’s free to register and you can keep your profile private if you do not want to take advantage of the networking elements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We’ll be managing room capacity through Sched, so please sign up to guarantee your spot in the sessions you want to take part in. All attendees should have been sent an email inviting them to join, but if you can’t find it please <a href=\"mailto:events@europeana.eu\">contact us</a> and we will provide you with a link.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Have you selected a pre-conference workshop yet?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are five pre-conference activities you can sign up to on Wednesday 27 November:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">With GIFT, you can learn about and test tools to help you design, plan and implement richer digital experiences for visitors to cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">At the Historiana workshop, you can explore different ways to use digitised sources in history education at cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) workshop will address the challenges and opportunities that the establishment of EOSC is posing for cultural heritage institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Attendees of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) workshop will learn about the purpose and benefits of IIIF for web-based image delivery and see demonstrations of the optimised functionality that IIIF provides.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Europeana 3D Task Force Seminar will provide an opportunity to share results, exchange knowledge about state-of-the-art opportunities for collaboration and discuss the next steps for using 3D more effectively in the digital cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you haven’t already chosen your pre-conference workshop, you can book your place using <a href=\"https://europeana2019.sched.com/\">Sched</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana Europe at Work collection day - bring an object and your story</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of Europeana’s current season <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europe-at-work\">Europe at Work</a>, we would love to hear your story about your work, or that of a family member. We’re aiming to tell the story of Europe through our working lives, both past and present, and we need your help.&nbsp;Come along to our Europe at Work pop-up collection day (in Sala Multimedia) and tell us about your work through objects like pictures, letters, work documents or memorabilia. We will record your story for the future, and make it freely available for anyone to discover and use for education, research, inspiration and pleasure. If you don’t have an object - don’t worry, we’d still love to hear your story. And if you don’t have a story or object to share about your working life, we will also gladly welcome stories on our previous themes: migration, 1989 and World War One.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana 2019: Connect Communities - small ads&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you arrive at Europeana 2019, pick up a ‘small ad’ card and start getting connected with other participants. Small ads are an opportunity for you to leave information about services you are offering or looking for, or to ask a question you'd like answered. The ads will be hung in a prominent place during the conference and other attendees will be able to read your ad and get in touch with you. This is a great opportunity to make the most of the other innovators and change-makers at the conference!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Submit a topic for the Tech Unconference</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do you want to talk all things tech? Have you got a burning question you’d like members of the EuropeanaTech community to respond to? Then <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1e1F_7Ql3CgvQ3K4DgcJvCwVidSjkySR9FktdjWKH28o/viewform?edit_requested=true\">submit your topic</a> to be discussed during the EuropeanaTech Unconference hosted at Europeana 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this EuropeanaTech Unconference, we’re opening the floor to the community. Share your questions, concerns, problems and goals in a moderated setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Think about the planet - don’t print your tickets</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Registration is open all day on Wednesday and on Thursday morning. Don’t forget to bring your ticket; without it you won’t be able to get in. Our scanners will scan printed and digital tickets, but to help save the planet we encourage you to download the Eventbrite app and bring them on your phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Join us for the opening night drinks reception</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At our drinks reception on Wednesday 27 November&nbsp;guests will be able to network with fellow conference attendees. Mezze buffet food will be provided by Pão a Pão, a non-profit enterprise run by refugees.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conference hashtags</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Follow #Europeana2019 to keep up with all of the latest news from Europeana 2019 and make sure you use it when tweeting about the conference. Also keep an eye out for #EuropeanaCommunities, which is a great way to connect with other professionals in the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Why not start tweeting and networking right now? Tell us what you’re looking forward to and who you want to meet or catch up with!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Example tweet:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Looking forward to meeting up with 300+ culture and tech innovators from #EuropeanaCommunities in Lisbon at #Europeana2019!

It allows people to transcribe and annotate cultural heritage material from Europeana Collections and national aggregator portals. Annotations made to content through this portal (also known as semantic enrichments) will be added to content in Europeana Collections and in aggregators’ or content providers’ portals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform harnesses the power of the crowd to enhance digital cultural heritage and make it more accessible and searchable. Each transcribed word enables the more effective reuse of historical materials in research and education, and contributes towards preserving Europe’s cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Launching the new tool</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The renewed platform was inaugurated on the 24th September 2019 through a special mini-transcribathon event at the Austrian National Library, with teams competing to transcribe documents from the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/search?f%5BPROVIDER%5D%5B%5D=Europeana+1989&amp;per_page=96&amp;q=&amp;view=grid\">Europeana 1989 Collection</a>. The event was open to the public and we were delighted to welcome over 50 participants, as well as our introductory speakers Max Kaiser (Head of Research &amp; Development, Austrian National Library), Harry Verwayen (Executive Director, Europeana Foundation) and Professor Wolfgang Mueller of the University of Vienna, who discussed the Fall of the Iron Curtain and the importance of crowdsourced material for the education and research sector.</p>\r\n"

Participants had a unique opportunity to work with original documents from the time of the Fall of the Iron Curtain and become an integral part in the digitisation process of these historic materials. Documents in German, English, Romanian, French, Latvian and Lithuanian were up for transcription. The winners were those who transcribed the most characters and contributed the most tags for people and locations within the time limit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After the fast-paced competition, Mircea Diaconu and Vlad Vasiliu - two participants in the Romanian Revolution 1989 - spoke to the teams, sharing their own experiences of the period and even showcasing original documents. Our last guest was the Transcribathon Champion from Europeana 1914-1918, Eva Anna Welles, who discussed the importance of participating in crowdsourcing initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During this launch event, participants transcribed over 60,000 characters from 105 documents hosted on Europeana, a wonderful achievement!&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Many of you will have already come across chatbots on social media, commercial websites, or via instant messaging. For the Cultural Chatbot project, we have explored how chatbots can be used by cultural heritage institutions to engage visitors with their collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Exploring different chatbots</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have investigated three different types of chatbots which could be useful to cultural heritage institutions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Free-text search chatbot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The free-text search chatbot expects the input of questions or keywords (for example: ‘I am looking for paintings by Rembrandt’) and then returns results based on content types (e.g. books, paintings) and named entities (creators and places) in a digital collection.</p>\r\n"

Design sprints are intensive one or two week sessions in which we brainstorm ideas and make quick decisions to assess what kind of a chatbot would be a good match for a museum or aggregator. If your institution holds a collection of cultural heritage items, wants to engage online visitors with its content and is eager to experiment with different approaches to online engagement, get in contact!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Surveying our Community</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Copyright Community of the Europeana Network Association is composed of over 300 professionals in the cultural heritage sector. Ahead of 2020, its Steering Group is developing a work plan that will define how the community intends to contribute to the needs of the sector. We want this work plan to be meaningful and impactful, so we have surveyed professionals on the key challenges they face around copyright. Over 100 practitioners from libraries, museums and archives to aggregators, NGOs, government agencies, educational and research institutions and the publishing sector answered the survey&nbsp;and below you can see some of the main take-aways that will feed our work plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Challenges for the Sector</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of shared issues for the sector emerged from our survey:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Understanding Copyright</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The biggest challenge our community perceives is the lack of copyright knowledge among cultural heritage professionals and an absence of training opportunities.&nbsp;For many respondents, there is a lack of institutional support towards the development of well-informed, organisation-wide copyright strategies, policies and copyright literacy in general. Others referred to the lack of confidence of cultural heritage professionals; they perceive copyright as something that only lawyers can understand or deal with. There is also some aversion towards taking risks in the area of copyright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While generally respondents understand the&nbsp;significant impact that the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explainer-what-will-the-new-eu-copyright-rules-change-for-europe-s-cultural-heritage-institutions\">2019 Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</a> will have on the sector, some do not feel familiar enough with its content. Cross-border collaboration is also an important issue. The difficulty of assessing the different laws of different countries before a project can move forward can be a huge barrier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, this challenge goes beyond the cultural heritage institution itself. Those in the education sector suggested that it’s not easy to understand what material can be reused and how. They also referenced difficulties in making students realise copyright law does not permit the free reuse of all works, even where the purpose is purely educational. Some emphasised the difficulties teachers encounter in finding suitable material, particularly audiovisual and music, and some pointed at the paradoxical situation of not being able to use material that is in the public domain because a restrictive licence has been applied or protection is claimed over the digital reproduction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Rights Clearance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second most popular challenge was felt to be the difficulty of identifying the copyright status of collection items. Many pointed out that identifying the right(s) holder(s) and clearing rights is extremely time consuming, that there is very limited or incomplete information available on some works, that there can be multiple rights holders, and complex laws and unclear contracts need to be interpreted as part of the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many also referred to the difficulties in dealing with orphan works (works whose author or rightholder cannot be identified or located) and particularly to the diligent search requirement established by the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32012L0028\">Orphan Works Directive</a>. Rights clearance is a particular challenge for audiovisual works, where for any single work there can be a wide range of rights and many different rights holders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, the lack of institutional support is a challenge. Often, clearing copyright is not seen as part of the overall process of creating and curating the collections, which means the necessary resources are not invested.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Other Challenges and Areas of Interest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other copyright-related challenges that respondents raised were in the areas of text and data mining, especially of cultural heritage; licensing and contracts; moral rights and risk management. Many participants also expressed insecurity about how to use and interpret Creative Commons licences as well as Rights Statements. There was also an interest in the relationship between traditional cultural expression and copyright, where works from certain cultural groups may be considered to be in the public domain, but their re-use could still harm or offend the communities from which they originate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond copyright, there were many questions around data protection, image and personality rights and the right to be forgotten. Additional elements such as neighbouring rights or protecting digital reproductions of works were also mentioned, as well as contractual barriers or other barriers imposed by third parties (not necessarily the rights holders) making the reuse of the work difficult.&nbsp;Some participants also underlined a lack of coordination by libraries, archives and museums at the national level regarding these matters as a challenges in their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Suggestions from our Community&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to identifying our members’ concerns, our survey also asked respondents to suggest how the Copyright Community, or even Europeana, could be helpful to them, and we came away with a wealth of suggestions:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Developing training resources to address a lack of copyright knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Ensuring the Copyright Community serves as a platform to exchange good practices and examples, and connects local reference points such as institutions or government bodies and expert networks.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Providing case studies and examples to address the challenges around rights clearance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Advocating for clear national and institutional policies that make sure that digital reproductions of works in the public domain remain in the public domain.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Providing more content translated into various national languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Encouraging the use of rights standardisation systems in open licenses and rights statements.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Providing detailed guidelines and procedures to help organisations through the process of using rights statements correctly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Taking actions to demonstrate and raise awareness of the negative impact of inaccurate rights statements.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Offering clearer descriptions for the rights statements that also take into account the role of exceptions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Creating an open GLAM coalition with Creative Commons, Wikimedia, and others working in the open space</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">As far as possible, using non-technical language that is accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our next steps are to sit down in December and go through these contributions to build a meaningful work plan for 2020. To stay up-to-date with the work plan and become part of a global copyright discussion <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">join the Europeana Network Association Copyright Community</a>, or don’t hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:ariadna.matas@europeana.eu\">get in touch</a> if you have further thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About Maria</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I entered my profession via&nbsp;a long and winding road, I would say. I originally studied English, Comparative Literature, film, media and philosophy while also working as a computer teacher. Eventually, my studies led me to doctoral studies in English where I focused on then-emerging experimental digital literature, and then on to a career within the university as a teacher and&nbsp;researcher. I now also have&nbsp;leadership duties. The impact of computers on literature, in all forms of media and communication, intrigued me at the beginning of my studies and still does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At present, apart from administrative duties in my department, my main role is leading and conducting research within a newly formed research program called Data Society at Malmö University. It is an interdisciplinary program that gathers researchers from social sciences, humanities and technology, as well as the arts and design, who focus on addressing the various societal challenges that arise as digitalisation and datafication processes permeate our society.&nbsp; I have been working specifically with projects that explore how cultural organisations deal with the challenges and opportunities of digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Obviously one of the challenges&nbsp;is to figure out how to create a rich, inspiring and internationally leading research environment. Luckily, I work at an institution where I have great support and a group of wonderful colleagues to help me.&nbsp;I would say that my colleagues at Malmö University and elsewhere are a key foundation for the kind of interdisciplinary work that we are engaged in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I wanted to know more about, and indeed be able to influence, European efforts to make cultural heritage more accessible through digital technologies. Now that many cultural heritage institutions have large digital collections, a key challenge for them, and for us as researchers interested in digital transformation, is to explore new and emerging ways of sharing, exhibiting and making&nbsp;available these rich assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would like to work to create inclusive and co-creative meeting points between researchers, cultural heritage professionals and the general public. I am also very interested in Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies, and their rich potential for digital cultural heritage so I hope to participate in some of the ongoing efforts within Europeana around 3D content. Finally, I plan&nbsp;to work toward making Europeana’s amazing resources and communities more known within my world of university research. To this end, I am Co-Chair of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/research-community\">Europeana Research Community Steering Group</a>, which is currently focusing on exploring the needs of researchers in different disciplinary contexts and institutions and how best we can serve as ambassadors and contact points for Europeana in these communities.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>Knowing what you don’t know</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana website currently offers you the ability to search by keyword. This serves much of our audience nicely, but what about the people who don’t know what they’re searching for? Our blogs, galleries and exhibitions highlight the high-quality material available through Europeana, but with millions of items in our collection, we couldn’t write about all of them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is where our new browsing options come in. The demo website is better at guiding you through collections without a specific search thanks to the development of the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/improving-discoverability-with-new-entities-in-europeana-collections\">’entities’ we introduced a couple of years ago</a>. These are also known as ‘people’ or ‘topics’ on the current website. We’ve taken this basic feature and improved it to offer an interconnected way to browse collections. This means that rather than these collections being manually curated, they will now grow organically as we add and enrich new items. With this change comes the ability to traverse between related collections as well. There is more work to do on the algorithm we use to generate these relationships, but it’s a good demonstration of our direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improving universal accessibility</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past, we built our website and then added accessibility compliance in retrospect, rather than building it into our work from the beginning. We’ve now reversed the process. If our code doesn’t validate the stringent requirements of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2AA</a>, our processes will not allow us to make the changes to the website public. This saves us time, and gives us a compliant website from day one. We’re doing our best to include better labelling on pictorial elements to ensure that content can be interpreted by screen readers and other tools. We’ve still got a little way to go, and we’re seeking help from specialist organisations on how we can improve our accessibility. Once we’ve established what we understand to be a quality experience, we will reach out to the appropriate end-users to help us understand whether we are taking the right approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More than just a facelift</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This redevelopment of the Europeana website is more than just a splash of plaster and paint on our current foundation. We have replaced our entire technology stack with a speedy front-end application, using technologies which offer you the speed and quality you would expect on modern social networks and websites. We’ve also outsourced our content management system, which <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/reducing-costs-and-increasing-development-productivity-through-cms-outsourcing\">you can read more about here</a>. You can expect to hear more about our technical changes in the future, including the issues we’ve faced and what we’ve done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What can you expect from us in the coming months?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The demo website is going to advance significantly over the coming weeks and months. We’re going to be making changes, some obvious and some less so. To give you an idea of what’s on the way, you can expect:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Exhibitions, blogs, and galleries will be added and brought into the style of the demo website</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We’ll be adding new, more powerful filtering options</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Newspaper features will be reintroduced, including date search, IIIF viewer, and full-text search</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The Fashion Collection will have its special vocabulary filters added</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Social media sharing from Collection and Item pages will be added</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">We will increase the number of supported media players</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can you help us?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quite simply, use and enjoy the demo website. And tell us about it. Every page on the website has a new feedback button which allows you to annotate exactly what you like or dislike about a page. We need you to tell us both what is and isn’t working. Your feedback helps us identify bugs and understand what we need to improve in the future. If you’d like to learn more about the developments you can also <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/M2tiv\">sign-up for our newsletter</a> and we’ll send you a monthly progress update on what’s new.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About the 2019 call</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2019 marks the fourth call for proposals within the Europeana Research Grants Programme and the first year with a call intended to support events. Embracing Europeana’s main mission to support cultural heritage institutions in their digital transformation, we decided to fund proposals for events that bring together cultural heritage professionals and researchers, such as conferences, workshops, seminar series and summer schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The theme of this year’s call was Digital Cultural Heritage for Open Science, which we felt offered valuable food for thought about the limits and potential of the reuse of digital collections as a source for research. Receiving over 70 proposals from all corners of the European Union showed that we were not wrong. The current debate related to Research and Innovation at the EU’s policy level increasingly puts in evidence the need to conceive research in the dimension of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/goals-research-and-innovation-policy_en\">Open Science</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We were impressed with the quality of these proposals, as well with the genuine interest in co-organising an event with Europeana which many demonstrated. Researchers still seem to take the lead in projects related to acquiring and producing awareness of the value of digital cultural heritage, with&nbsp;56.2 % of all proposals coming from universities and research institutes. However, the 19.2% of proposals which came from cultural heritage institutions make us hope that the number of applications from this sector will increase in the upcoming years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

Three masterclasses will take place at as many institutions in the Netherlands from April to June 2020 and will focus on the possible social impact of working with open digital cultural heritage: citizen-engaged heritage science, participatory education and training, organising and mentoring multidisciplinary research groups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium: A Research Engine for Linked (Open) Data Research on the Circulation of European and non-European Art. 1600-2000, a proposal submitted by <a href=\"https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00011413\">Koenraad Brosens</a>, full professor in Art History.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Europeana grant will be used to organise a workshop in Leuven and a public event in Brussels in March 2020 around the concepts of Linked Open Data/Data Reconciliation, Standardization and Interoperability, Web Publishing. An interdisciplinary group of scholars from art history to cultural studies, from digital humanities to computer science, will address the linking of different digital platforms as a step that can pave the way to the discovery of new patterns, and the need for new forms of narratives that can make accessible new insights to a&nbsp; wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Swedish National Heritage Board, Sweden: Enriching metadata - Enriching Research, a proposal submitted by Dr <a href=\"https://uppsala.academia.edu/AsaMLarsson\">Åsa Larsson</a>, project leader, in collaboration with Dr&nbsp;<a href=\"https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N18-926\">Anna Foka</a>, Associate Professor in Information Technology and the Humanities and Leader/Manager of the Digital Humanities Initiative at the Institute for Archives, Museums and Libraries (ABM) &nbsp;at Uppsala University.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;A joint effort by their two institutions will result in a three-day event in Stockholm in June 2020, during which researchers and heritage professionals will engage in a number of activities aimed at increasing their ability to find and enrich metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Digital Repository of Ireland: FAIR and Open Data. The opportunities for Humanities researchers, a proposal submitted by Dr <a href=\"https://dri.ie/dri-team/kathryn-cassidy\">Kathryn Cassidy</a>, Software Engineer.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The DRI is a consortium consisting of three research institutes - the Royal Irish Academy, Trinity College and Maynooth University. In collaboration with the Research Alliance Data, it will organise a face-to-face training event in April 2020 followed by an online course in June 2020. They will address issues encountered by researchers as users and producers of FAIR data, and aim to improve the skills of the participants in finding and using particularly Humanities data.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>An open platform for digitised cultural items</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A lack of granular and rich descriptive metadata affects the searchability and usability of digital content stored in museums, libraries and archives. In this context, crowdsourcing offers a great opportunity both to improve the metadata quality of digital cultural content and raise awareness about cultural heritage assets among professionals, teachers, students and culture lovers. Running from September 2018 to February 2020, CrowdHeritage is a Europeana Generic Services project which looks to take advantage of this opportunity through the development of an open platform where public audiences can participate in crowdsourcing campaigns around cultural heritage. Campaigns on the website focus on music, fashion, sport, cities and landscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project aims to engage different communities in enhancing content metadata, evaluate the usability of the platform and assess the effectiveness of the overall approach, both in terms of data quality improvement and user engagement. The platform also offers cultural heritage institutions and aggregators the opportunity to design and launch ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns for metadata quality improvement with gamification elements and measurable results. The platform is available in three different languages (English, French, Italian) and is easy to access through digital devices. CrowdHeritage is for everyone - a simple and fun way to discover the richness and variety of cultural heritage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>About out of commerce works</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many cultural heritage institutions across Europe have large collections of works which have a high cultural value, but no longer have (or have never had) commercial value. Because these works may still be under copyright, institutions need to ask permission to make them&nbsp;available to the public. Identifying and obtaining such permission from all rights holders requires a resource investment that cultural heritage institutions cannot always make. Due to the risk of copyright infringement, these works often remain unavailable to the public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the out of commerce works articles in the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (adopted by the European Union in May) provide a legal framework that removes the need for individual rights clearance for out of commerce works. A cultural heritage institution will be able to make works available to the public under an exception to copyright or license agreement concluded with collective management organisations (entities that collect copyright revenues on behalf of authors). If no such organisation exists for the type of work that can give licenses to make works available online, an exception to copyright applies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to understand the details, have a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explainer-what-will-the-new-eu-copyright-rules-change-for-europe-s-cultural-heritage-institutions\">explainer by Paul Keller</a> or at the <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2019/12/02/guidelines-implementation-dsm-directive/\">Communia Guide for the Implementation of the Directive</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Provision at a national level</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Out of Commerce Works Provision will ultimately make it easier for cultural heritage institutions to digitise and share works that are out of commerce, but much of the success of these new rules depends on what happens in each country. National law-makers can decide to turn it into a restrictive (and almost unusable) provision, or rather one that effectively responds to the needs of the cultural heritage sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crucially, you can be a part of this decision-making: the Directive establishes that governments have to consult&nbsp; cultural heritage institutions (among others)&nbsp;on the topic of out of commerce works&nbsp;by organising stakeholder dialogues. These are your chance to tell your government what matters to you regarding out of commerce works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Being Part of the Stakeholder Dialogues</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new Copyright Directive (have a look at <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790\">Article 11</a>!) states that governments must, ‘consult rightholders, collective management organisations and cultural heritage institutions in each sector before establishing specific requirements’ to decide what is an out of commerce work,&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />and organise regular sector-specific discussions,&nbsp;‘to foster the relevance and usability’ of the licenses for out of commerce works.&nbsp;In less technical terms, this means that cultural heritage institutions need to be consulted on how to define what is an out of commerce work, and should be invited to discussions around making licenses adequate and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The government (its body responsible for copyright, such as the Ministry of Culture or of Justice) should extend invitations for cultural heritage institutions to participate in these discussions. If you do not receive one, reach out to the relevant authorities&nbsp;to express your interest. Doing this ahead of this process is in any case a good idea to make sure that the government knows you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ahead of these discussions, take note of the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>You are a stakeholder!</strong> Cultural heritage institutions are clearly considered a stakeholder by the Directive, which also establishes that these discussions will take place on a sector-specific basis. There are no limits as to how many institutions (per sector or overall) can be part of the discussion - the more, the merrier!</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Prepare your arguments.</strong> This is an uncomfortable truth: you have to dive a little bit into the copyright details. Have a look at the current legislation and at the new out of commerce works provisions (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790&amp;from=EN\">articles 8 to 11 of the Directive</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2019/12/02/guidelines-implementation-dsm-directive/\">Communia Guidelines’ part on out of commerce works</a>).&nbsp;Crucial questions to consider include: what effort to determine whether a work is&nbsp;in commerce is considered reasonable? Do works under long-term loan fall under the scope of these provisions? What is a sufficiently representative collective management organisation? What are the elements that make them representative of one specific sector of creation, and of certain rights? What happens if a collective management organisation is sufficiently representative, but the negotiations with a cultural heritage institution are not successful and the license is not granted?&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Get ready to negotiate licenses.</strong> There will also be practical discussions around licensing. Are the conditions proposed fair? Are they difficult to agree? That’s the place to discuss this. Be prepared to meet some strong views and&nbsp;to negotiate. Again, you can find some more tips and further detail in the <a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/2019/12/02/guidelines-implementation-dsm-directive/\">Communia Guide for the Implementation of the Directive</a>.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage professionals in every country need to be involved in these consultations to find the answers. Making sure that adequate provisions are in place and that legislation is clear and simplified, will facilitate using and interpreting the law afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As cultural heritage professionals, you have the opportunity to bring to the table your practical experience and day-to-day struggles of dealing with out of commerce works and copyright clearance. You, better than anyone else, can judge what solution will be the most suitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have any questions, or if you have been part of these discussions already and would like to share it with others, <a href=\"mailto:ariadna.matas@europeana.eu\">reach out to us</a>.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>What we are doing</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of the next steps to progress multilingual reach in Europeana, we have put together a technical discussion paper which offers several proposals for improving the multilingual aspects of the Europeana Collections portal. This paper presents our current approach for handling the search, browse and display of the various types of translatable data Europeana holds (object metadata, textual objects, editorial content, user interface) and proposes new ways to develop these aspects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, it suggests the use of a multilingual knowledge graph, built on top of existing <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/linked-open-data\">linked data sources</a> including multilingual vocabularies available in our domain, to enhance the multilingual performance of our metadata-based search engine. Automatic translation (to English) could be used for the metadata that is not covered by the knowledge graph, and&nbsp;systematically for full-text content (such as newspapers) that is harder to align with a knowledge graph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We also continue to explore the opportunities offered by new technology such as the European Commission's <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/What+is+eTranslation\">eTranslation</a> automatic translation service and examine the challenges that Europeana and the wider cultural heritage sector will face as we build multilingual systems that can benefit our users and stakeholders. You can <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/how-we-re-working-to-make-sure-culture-is-for-everyone-in-any-language\">read more about our approach to multilingualism</a> in a previous Pro post.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How can you help?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone in the Europeana community - and beyond - can contribute to building multilingual systems for digital cultural heritage, and we would like to invite you to contribute in two ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have made our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1frFjKGW-IXVxuFXlCCgLWCSCgPual0WcPsFiHA67978/\">technical discussion paper</a> on improving the multilingual aspects of the Europeana Collections portal open to all, and we invite you to send us your feedback on these proposals by January 15. Please either comment directly in the document or <a href=\"mailto:antoine.isaac@europeana.eu\">email us to share your thoughts</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can also help by sharing any data related to cultural heritage that contains natural language text or metadata with the European Commission’s eTranslation service. eTranslation is based on Artificial Intelligence and the quality of this technology is greatly improved when it can be trained with suitable data. But to date, cultural heritage is under-represented in the training resources, which means that the service is less well-equipped to handle the specific aspects of cultural heritage data. To help redress this balance, cultural heritage institutions are invited to contribute their own data into a training pool.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Any dataset is welcome, though multilingual data are of course highly prized. You can share your data through the <a href=\"https://elrc-share.eu/\">ELRC-SHARE platform</a>; don’t forget to indicate that your dataset is relevant to the Europeana Digital Service Infrastructure! If you have questions you can also <a href=\"mailto:antoine.isaac@europeana.eu\">contact us</a> and we will be happy to help and put you in touch with the relevant people.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What is Public Domain Day?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a work (of art, music, or literature) enters the public domain, it loses copyright protection, giving wider society the opportunity to use the content. You may be familiar with the life of the author +70 years rule, which under many jurisdictions and in broad terms, defines the moment when copyright protection expires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Of course not all authors die in January, but to make calculating the date&nbsp;slightly easier, many countries choose 1 January as the day&nbsp;where works by authors who died the year before officially enter the public domain. Hence Public Domain Day (PDD) is an international celebration that takes place annually on 1 January (or throughout that month) to highlight the fact that many works have become available to the public for re-use.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why celebrate it?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li><strong>The public domain encourages creativity and innovation.&nbsp;</strong>When a work is in the public domain, there are many more possible ways for the public to reuse it. This fosters creativity and innovation - something which cultural heritage institutions can celebrate and encourage!</li>\r\n    <li><b>Without&nbsp;efforts to identify works in the public domain, we will not enjoy the benefits.&nbsp;</b>Fighting for the right laws is important, but even more so is making use of the provisions that are already in place.&nbsp;Copyright law can be complex and the public domain is no exception. A work might have several authors, terms of protection might have changed, and layers of rights may have been added. Celebrating the work done to ensure that a work has entered the public domain is one way of supporting these efforts!</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Cultural heritage institutions are the guardians of the public domain</strong>. Public Domain Day celebrations are a unique opportunity to showcase your invaluable role in preserving knowledge for the benefit of society. A work can fall in the public domain but if no one is able to preserve it, society will not benefit from it. Cultural heritage institutions host large amounts of works that are in the public domain, and the possibility for the public to use them depends, to a large extent, on you to make them available.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Public domain works can bring your collections to life</strong>. In your efforts to get citizens closer to cultural heritage, copyright might stand in the way. But when a work falls into the public domain, you can make it available to users with no restrictions. Your collections can be more widely shared and re-used, bringing value not only to the author, but also to your institution.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to get involved&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Celebrations for Public Domain Day take many forms. They might showcase public domain works and their creators, highlight the significance of making these works available to the public, discuss copyright reforms or facilitate networking for people interested in public domain and access to knowledge. You may already have a few thoughts on how to celebrate the public domain, but if you’re running short on ideas, here’s a few things you can do:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <li><strong>Raise awareness</strong>. Throughout the month of January, Europeana will focus on raising awareness of the importance of the public domain in a series of articles on Pro news. Keep your communities and network informed on the topic by sharing these articles through your channels - make sure you use the hashtag #publicdomainday!&nbsp;If you’re feeling particularly inspired, you could also write your own articles and tweets about aspects of the public domain that interest your institution; for example, last year Communia wrote a blog post entitled '<a href=\"https://www.communia-association.org/tag/public-domain-day/\">Happy birthday, Public Domain Manifesto</a>' to re-launch its public domain manifesto, and invited people to sign on to it.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Release or publicise works in the public domain</strong>. If you are a cultural heritage institution, there are probably works in your collections that are in the public domain. Find them and make them available for everyone to enjoy. If you are looking for inspiration, the Public Domain Working Group in The Netherlands runs a year-round programme that starts with a <a href=\"http://www.opennederland.nl/algemeen/uitkomsten-publiek-domein-masterclass/\">workshop for GLAMs</a> to help them identify works that will be out of copyright. If you are already aware of public domain works in your collections, Public Domain Day is the perfect time to publicise and celebrate them. Every January, many national libraries publish a list of authors whose works have entered the public domain that year - have a look at <a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/08012019/ces-oeuvres-qui-entrent-dans-le-domaine-public-en-2019\">this example</a> from the National Library of France (through Gallica).</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Organise an event</strong>. Gather people together to discuss this important topic. Cultural heritage professionals can learn about ways to identify and share public domain works, and educators and researchers might be interested in knowing how to use them.&nbsp;If you are not able to organise an event yourself but want to join other professionals interested in the topic, check out the <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/\">public domain day map</a> and participate in events in your area.&nbsp;</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Let us know what you’re doing!</strong>&nbsp;Tell us how you celebrate the public domain. We’ll add you to the <a href=\"https://www.pdday.org/\">public domain day map</a> so that others know how to join your efforts!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Find out more</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the Europeana Conference 2019, Sebastiaan Ter Burg, a public domain advocate leading celebrations in The Netherlands, presented on the importance of the public domain and encouraged all those at the conference and watching online to join him. Watch his presentation and get further inspiration in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2TCt2cgitE\">this video</a> (4h50min20sec).</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />As the director of <a href=\"http://www.timbayern.de/en/\">an industrial museum</a>, I am fascinated by the digital revolution, which has opened up completely new worlds since the end of the 20th century. The emerging possibilities appear all the clearer when you examine similarities between the digital revolution and the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. This comparison gives reason to reflect on the disruption caused by such fundamental transformations. Starting from technical innovations, both revolutions describe not just partial but rather comprehensive changes that not only affect economies and the world of work, but also political and social processes and private life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Industrial revolution</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The State Textile and Industry Museum in Augsburg demonstrates many of the potentially positive dimensions of the industrial revolution through the display of objects such as running looms. Industrial capitalism not only provided many people with new jobs, but brought about mass-produced commodities that could be purchased by a broad population at reasonable prices. What used to be luxury became open to mass consumption. For example, cotton consumption per capita in Germany increased by a factor of 20 in the 19th century. Such a consumption revolution is illustrated by the pattern book collection in the State Textile and Industry Museum, which contains more than 1.3 million textile print samples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is no coincidence that the age of industrialisation coincided with the era of democratisation, which involved an increasing number of people in political processes. With the development of media like books and newspapers, the public sphere grew, which enabled more people to participate in political matters. Yet industrialisation also had negative dimensions, including the exploitation of working-class populations and the many manifestations of alienation - both in terms of the workforce itself and their relationship to manufactured products. The State Textile and Industry Museum has explored such negative aspects through exhibitions on the discrimination faced by women during this period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital revolution</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital possibilities have massively changed the consumption habits of the Western world. Our worldwide shopping mall is just a mouse click away. Global networking, propelled by the internet and social media, has already shown social and political impact. The internet also provides an abundance of - ideally open access - information to a world population that can thus acquire education, participate in culture and engage in political decision-making. When cultural treasures as well as political ideas are freely shared, the digital revolution serves democratisation, participation and empowerment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here, museums can become active. Soon we will put thousands of recently digitised photographs online, allowing digital access to the cultural treasures of the museum. Additionally, in 2019, the State Textile and Industry Museum had a temporary exhibition which dealt with the future of the socially diverse city of Augsburg. We invited around 100 people to work together to create visions for future living. Via Facebook and Instagram, we let a wider public participate in these ongoing processes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transformation of the public sphere, which began with the Age of Enlightenment, attains a new political quality in a digitally connected world. The fact that social media in particular is suitable as a playground for fake news and post-truth manipulation calls for reliable truth-clarification tools. Only with their help will the digital revolution be able to put itself at the service of political as well as social justice. Ultimately, all revolutions are both boon and bane - it is up to civil society – including myself – to make the best of it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

(Watch it starting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9-QHb7hkps\">8:24:15 on Thursday's recording</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are always those people who work tirelessly but might not always shout about it - for them, we had our 'Unsung Heroes' awards. This year, these went to:&nbsp;Cosmina Berta - for her work with the Deutsche Digitalbibliothek and the Europeana Aggregators' Forum;&nbsp;Milena Dobreva - for her work with the Europeana Research community;&nbsp;Gregory Markus - for managing the EuropeanaTech community;&nbsp;and Maria Margarida Pedreiro Conceição Lopes - for her amazing collaboration putting on this event in her home library.</p>\r\n"

A large part of the meeting was then dedicated to the specialist&nbsp;communities and their progress, preparing priorities and activities for 2020, and ideas for interaction and cross-community connections.

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>New governance</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With most of the pioneers who shaped the ENA from its very beginning in 2015 ending their terms in December 2018, this year a new <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/members-council\">Members Council</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">Management Board</a> have worked to steer governance and develop a new strategic vision for the ENA. Among our ongoing activities, in 2019 we focused on providing guidance and ensuring the good work progress of the ENA communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Empowering Communities</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2018, the ENA established <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups\">six communities</a> - EuropeanaTech, Research, Education, Impact, Copyright and Communicators - that function as trans-national networks of professionals who create, curate, preserve, research, publish and use digital cultural heritage online. Communities help ENA members cultivate and share knowledge, expertise and best practices around a specific area of common interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year, the major focus of communities has been on establishing and empowering their Steering Groups, operationalising their communication channels, and creating, refining and implementing their work plans. They have emerged as the ENA’s main vehicle to strengthen the role of digital cultural heritage in general, and Europeana in particular. In 2019 the communities have helped cultural heritage professionals not only by trying to harmonise sectoral differences, but also by supporting digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions across Europe, finding opportunities to engage with various user groups, and working to understand the impact that digital cultural heritage has on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Europeana 2019 Conference&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This year we introduced a new format for the annual Europeana event/AGM, building on the six communities at the heart of the ENA. The communities were a driving force behind the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-2019\">Europeana 2019: Connect Communities</a> conference and pre-conference workshops that took place together with the ENA General Assembly at the National Library of Portugal in Lisbon on 26-29 November 2019. This unique interdisciplinary and cross domain event was a great success. It was the first time that the six communities coordinated sessions and demonstrated how they relate to and strengthen each other. Part of the conference was dedicated to the ENA General Assembly, where our network members got together to discuss important matters, approve key documents, and launch the 2019 voting process.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>ENA and the climate change action</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the worldwide climate strikes in 2019, various ENA Members Councillors expressed support for the action and their willingness to actively engage in the climate change movement. This initiative was led by Councillor <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/barbara-fischer\">Barbara Fischer</a>, who wrote and shared <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-transform-world-culture-barbara-fischer/?trackingId=S2ggqKgHR8Cod8%2BYsTV9Wg%3D%3D\">an article</a> and started a debate on our <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/134927/\">LinkedIn group</a> in order to call for action. She and her colleagues from the Members Council, <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/peter-soemers\">Peter Soemers</a> and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/person/killian-downing\">Killian Downing</a>, pitched their project to make ENA as a community more actively engaged in climate action at the Europeana 2019 event and beyond. We also organised the conference in Lisbon <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-2019-building-a-sustainable-event\">as climate friendly manner as possible</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More engaged members&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2019, we focused our efforts on expanding the ENA by attracting professionals working in areas related to cultural heritage, while keeping the existing network engaged and active. As a result of these efforts, between January and December 600 new members joined the ENA. Our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/network-members\">membership </a>currently stands at almost&nbsp;2,700. We have been working on actively engaging members in the ENA by creating voluntary activities that can provide&nbsp;professional and personal fulfilment and a sense of ownership and community belonging.</p>\r\n"

The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-communicators-group\">Europeana Communicators</a> community has contributed to these efforts by bringing ENA members together on Twitter and re-developing two dedicated hashtags. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typed_query\">#AllezCulture</a> shows support for digital culture and the cultural heritage sector and can be used to promote digital culture in action or as a rallying call. The new hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23europeanacommunities&amp;src=typed_query\">#EuropeanaCommunities</a> brings the ENA, its communities and other Europeana-related networks together. I encourage you to use, follow and share these hashtags for discussions and networking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Looking forward to 2020</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ENA has shown great potential in its European-level cross-domain composition, thought-leadership and innovation capacity, particularly in creating communities that help solve issues faced by many cultural heritage institutions. In 2020 we aim to build on these strengths and&nbsp; create more opportunities for our members to get involved in the work of the communities, where we foresee a lot of growth and development. We would also like to assess the impact that the ENA and its activities can have on the digital transformation of cultural heritage institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are aiming to make the ENA more inclusive for young professionals and people of all backgrounds, and make Europeana more accessible for disabled people and marginalised groups. We will support environmentally friendly policies and positive actions that can help reduce the effects of climate change, and we will make sure that our activities are as sustainable and climate neutral as possible.&nbsp;Finally, we wish to facilitate a closer collaboration with the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/services/data-publication-services/aggregators\">Aggregators’ Forum</a>, and together with the Europeana Foundation, we will work towards the overall strengthening of the Europeana initiative.</p>\r\n"

An idea arose to create an initiative that would help promote Europeana Collections in Poland, and the team at FINA (the National Film Archive - Audiovisual Institute Poland) was asked to coordinate the project. We soon realised that before we began a conversation about open access and the use of digital heritage at a European level, we needed to take a step back and discuss digital strategies, online repositories in general and possible collaborations in Poland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The result was <a href=\"http://nina.gov.pl/projekty/tu-europeana\">TuEuropeana</a>. The goal of the project is to increase the visibility and show the potential of digital collections (with Europeana at its centre) and to discuss strategies and ways of reusing archives. Four years and four editions of TuEuropeana later&nbsp;we&nbsp;run an annual programme which reaches out to GLAM professionals, educators and this year to artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/pyge5pyyissspm5/Folio_Fish-small.jpg?dl=1\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>FolioFish</em>,&nbsp;©Martyna Berger; Grand Prize Winner</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>In November, TuEuropeana ran a poster competition encouraging the creative use of material in digital repositories - can you tell us more about it?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This was one of our activities targeted at young artists, who often simply don’t know that digital archives offer ready to (re)use material and can be a great source of inspiration. Through the contest and accompanying workshops with graphic designers and IPR experts we wanted to encourage young creative minds to include digitised cultural heritage material in their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The task was to design a poster around the concept of environmental sustainability. We asked the creators to use or be inspired by archival items available on Europeana and in Polish digital repositories. We ran the project in collaboration with <a href=\"https://wallbeing.com/\">wall-being</a> – an online platform promoting the works of Polish poster designers and their collaborators. The winning works will be made available for sale via the platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qy319k25izl8wtp/ALEKSANDRA_HUMENIUK_plakat_en-small.jpg?dl=1\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>One in Eight</em>,&nbsp;©Aleksandra Humeniuk; one of three Runners-up</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why did you choose environmental sustainability as a theme?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the catchphrases we use to promote TuEuropeana is ‘archives inspire’. We do believe that archives can inspire and contribute to discussions on serious, contemporary socially relevant issues, like ecology and the environment. In the end, it’s all about reuse!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Who were the winners?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />The jury awarded prizes to four works. The main prize went to Martyna Berger for her <em>FolioFish</em> and its multi-threading of ideas, graphic thinking, creative approach and a strong, though unobtrusive message. We also had three honorable mentions: for the artistic value of the poster - Honorata Bialic for <em>Extinction - Chapter VI</em>; for the creative use of archival digital resources - Julia Rogóż (no title); for referring to the ecological theme of the competition - Aleksandra Humeniuk for <em>One in Eight</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxegsmub7qt5y6c/Honorata_Bialic_plakat-small.jpg?dl=1\" /></center>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>Extinction - Chapter VI</em>,&nbsp;©Honorata Bialic; one of three Runners-up</p>\r\n"

I also feared that we might struggle with a lack of accurate licensing on the images that artists used, but the majority of the submissions we received included proper descriptions of licences. Most of them came from Europeana Collections. I love that the winning piece was created from material found via Europeana (the <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2025902/_nnVvzRg.html\">plastic bag</a> coming from a collection day) and <a href=\"https://polona.pl/item/carassius-auratus-var-japonicus-bicaudatus-zernecke-welon,NzkzMzk1NTk/0/#info:metadata\">Polona</a> - the online repository of the Polish National Library.&nbsp;I am also proud that artists, like Julia Rogóż, were bold enough to “play” with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewess_with_Oranges\">masterpieces of Polish art</a> and used them to convey a very strong message.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><center><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/u03xvel8j33lk0q/Julia-Rog%C3%B3%C5%BC-small.jpg?dl=1\" /></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">[no title], ©Julia Rogóż, one of three Runners-up</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you have planned for the future?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We want to further promote the posters and are now working on an exhibition that will allow us to put 24 of them in the spotlight they deserve. The plan is to make the exhibition part of Polish celebrations of the Public Domain Day in January 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And for TuEuropeana? Its fourth edition has just come to an end. It’s time to evaluate the whole project and think about the plan for its 5th release in 2020.</p>\r\n"

        intro: "<p>The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market entered into force in June 2019. It creates many new opportunities for the cultural heritage sector. Europeana was part of the discussions to ensure that the text would address the actual needs of the sector. The ball is now in the member states’ court: the Directive needs to be implemented by June 2021. We tell you about the road ahead and how Europeana can support you along the way.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>We&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-reform-passed-by-european-parliament\">recently told you</a> about the adoption of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, the most comprehensive pan-European copyright reform <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029\">since 2001</a>. We had also been informing you on progress along the way: from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/discussion-about-copyright-reform-kicks-off-in-the-european-parl\">very beginning and all</a> throughout the (sometimes bumpy) <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/copyright-reform-don-t-throw-out-the-baby-with-the-bathwater\">process</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">June 20, 2019, the day the Directive entered into force, marks the start of a two-year transposition period. That means that by June 20, 2021, Member States have to have laws in place that meet the objectives of the Directive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The text holds important promises for the cultural heritage sector and this is in no small part thanks to the advocacy efforts conducted by European in line with its <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/advocacy-framework\">advocacy framework</a>. Together with organisations representing the library sector such as IFLA, LIBER, EBLIDA, Sparc Europe and the European University Association, we voiced your concerns, communicated your challenges, insisted on the need to invest in preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage and suggested solutions. All with the aim of ensuring that your public interest mission would be part of the new copyright framework.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fb3dc6e6-7fff-527f-9c6d-57871811982a\">The content</b></h1>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Directive recognizes the cultural heritage sector’s important role in the digital world. It makes it easier to digitise and share cultural heritage for the benefit of research, education, literacy, creation and culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To address cultural heritage institutions’ public interest activities in the digital environment, exceptions and limitations to copyright play a prominent role in the Directive. European legislators have made an effort to adapt these to the digital world, and to harmonise them across the European Union to ensure they work across-borders. Beyond these exceptions, the Directive touches upon the public domain, extended collective licensing, fair remuneration in exploitation of contracts of authors and performers, and on the online uses of press publications and on the use of protected content by online content-sharing service providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can have a look at the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/explainer-what-will-the-new-eu-copyright-rules-change-for-europe-s-cultural-heritage-institutions\">explainer</a> that Paul Keller wrote a few weeks ago. It tells you what the new rules mean for cultural heritage institutions, and don’t forget to pay special attention to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fb3dc6e6-7fff-527f-9c6d-57871811982a\">Preservation. </b>All European member states will have to have a preservation exception in place, allowing for reproduction to take place through any means and across-borders.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fb3dc6e6-7fff-527f-9c6d-57871811982a\">Out of commerce works. </b>All European member states will have to have a solution in place, either an exception or a license, for the digitisation and dissemination of works in cultural heritage institutions that are out of commerce.</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fb3dc6e6-7fff-527f-9c6d-57871811982a\">Works in the public domain.</b> Digital copies of works of visual arts that are in the public domain shall remain in the public domain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n    </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are several other very important articles in the Directive with an impact on research and education, such as articles 3 and 4 on text and data mining, and 5 on digital and cross-border teaching. Overall, contracts and technological protection measures (TPMs or DRM) should not get in the way of&nbsp; activities allowed under an exception.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\"><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-fb3dc6e6-7fff-527f-9c6d-57871811982a\">Next steps</b></h1>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cultural heritage institutions in each country should not miss the opportunity to make the most of what the Directive provides and make sure the strong benefits for cultural institutions are properly reflected in their country’s law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even though Europeana played an important role throughout the process, we will now take&nbsp; a step back to leave it to you to ensure the best results for the sector in your country. We will still be there to support your efforts: we are working on materials to make the content of the Directive understandable to all, we are collaborating with Communia in the writing of their advocacy guide, and we are exchanging information on how things develop at the national level through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">copyright community</a>.. Europeana will take part&nbsp; in discussions at the European level if a European interlocutor is needed, such as with the EUIPO database on out of commerce works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-copyright\">copyright community</a> will play a strong role from now on, and we encourage you to <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/sign-up\">join</a>. The community is a forum where practitioners can help each other meet the copyright challenges that we all experience in the process of making our digital collections available online for reuse. It supports the exchange of information and best-practices that will be so necessary in this changing legal landscape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">European legislators are clearly stepping up to help us make our cultural heritage visible and accessible in the digital age by ensuring that copyright does not stand in the way. It is now up to all of us to make it a reality.</p>\r\n"

Our first release numbers more than 150,000 images and other sets will follow. We are publishing the material set by set so that the copyright status of the artworks and photographs can be carefully evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Which collections and what type of images are being openly released?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paris Musées manages the fourteen museums of the City of Paris and altogether the collection numbers over a million artworks. From archaeology to fashion and contemporary art, the collections are remarkably diverse and they are still being digitised. Since May 2016 our collections have been accessible online at <a href=\"http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/en\">http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/en</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What motivated Paris Musées to adopt open access now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paris Musées has been working on its open access strategy for some time and discussions intensified during the development of our collections website. Our project team was aware of the international <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenGLAM?src=hashtag_click\">Open GLAM</a> movement and we wanted to make our own contribution to it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paris Musées’s contract with our photo agency ends on 31 December 2019 so we needed to start thinking about the future. We saw this moment as an opportunity to regain control of how we manage our digital images – a new beginning for our image publishing strategy began!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><strong>How was the policy developed? Who were the key players?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over a number of years, we worked through different scenarios that we could imagine for our images. This project team was composed of staff from departments across the organisation, including digital, collections, legal, iconographers, museum directors&nbsp;and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each scenario was evaluated against international benchmarks and then analysed in relation to Paris Musées in term of costs, personnel organisation, user legibility, etc. Gradually we eliminated some scenarios and focused more closely on others; we kept working to find the best scenario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How do you evaluate the copyright status of your collections? Who’s involved?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I stated earlier, determining the copyright status of our material is a critical step in our open access practice. We prefer to publish slowly, set by set, so we have time to fully evaluate the status of each image. This time-consuming task is done by our database manager team, in partnership with an iconographer, determining whether images are suitable for open access release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How will you measure the impact of open access?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will monitor the impact of our publication activities carefully. This will include web analytics, naturally, but we also want to see how we can best stimulate creativity through, for instance, hosting events in our museums to engage digital start-ups, or engaging citizens to reuse and remix our images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paris Musées has already participated to events such as the <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/back-from-the-first-api-culture-day-part-1-fff88d3df893\">API Culture Day</a> in June organised by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DianeDrubay\">Diane Dubray</a>, when I presented on the different kind of API that Paris Musées uses, from calendars to collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does Paris Musées have an API yet?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paris Musées will release an API in January 2020, to coincide with the release of our first image set, supported by full documentation. At this point, I can only tell you that we decided to use GraphQL.</p>\r\n"

It’s great! It is always inspiring and stimulating to meet a community when you start thinking about a project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The influencers are very diverse. Some are in cultural institutions like <a href=\"https://www.inha.fr/en/index.html\">INHA</a> – whose chief curator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PandosiaSays\">Martine Denoyelle</a> led the publication of the white paper <a href=\"https://www.inha.fr/_attachments/images-usages-ressources/Livre%2520blanc_page%2520a%2520page_ENG_BD.pdf?download=true\">Droits des images,n histoire de l’art et société</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seeksanusername\">Antoine Courtin</a>, INHA’s Head of Documentation&nbsp; and Johanna Daniel– whilst others are private researchers and entrepreneurs like Diane Drubay or Pierre-Yves Lochon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What advice would you give to other French museums considering open access?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s hard to give advice on this topic because embracing open access is a huge change for cultural institutions. Revolution is different from one country to another so I can’t really say where to start and with whom. It’s a long path with many challenges so just focus on the goal and don’t lose faith!</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>At Europe at Work Collection Days, people are invited to share their stories and material relating to their working lives. Europe at Work Collection Days have been hosted across Europe in galleries, libraries, archives and museums and are an opportunity for the public to share their own individual or family stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>EPIC’s Europe at Work Collection Day, how did it go?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a real pleasure to take part in the Europe at Work campaign and to welcome participants of all ages to the museum to engage in this worthwhile project. This was the first time the museum had&nbsp;run a collection day specifically for children and we decided to format it to better suit this target audience. We ran the project in collaboration with 4th class pupils from the Dublin 7 Educate Together National School who were approached about the project a month beforehand. We asked each pupil to interview their parents about an object that reflected their working life and to fill in a pre-designed questionnaire. They were encouraged to bring along these objects on the day itself and helped us to create a digital copy for Europeana. While some were engaged with digitisation, the others transcribed their stories directly into the Europeana platform with the help of our staff and their teachers. We split the group (25 pupils) into two and rotated them between the collecting day centre and an education workshop which we were also running for their benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also laid out some 18th and 19th century migrants’ letters so that the children could observe the difficulties in transcribing text and the benefits of learning such a skill.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall it was a very worthwhile experience for us and the children and the stories they shared were fascinating. A key observation of mine and a recommendation for others hoping to run similar events is to ensure all children have adequate time to complete the transcription and there are plenty of activities to keep them engaged between tasks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our second collection day was targeted at adults, specifically former dock workers and those who had worked overseas. We’ve found that collection days usually prove more successful when groups and individuals are invited directly rather than relying on blanket promotion. Holding them on weekends allows more people to attend who might otherwise not but it’s worth remembering that you’re competing against everything else people might occupy their limited free time with so they really need to buy into the project. A number of individuals who took part were visitors to the museum who happened upon the collection day centre and were also happy to take part but lacked objects. We opted to photograph them instead or allow them to share suitable images of their objects at a later date, which many have done. Ultimately, I would advise that to get the best results out of such projects you should generally aim to work with targeted groups and welcome any additional participants as a bonus.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

It not only provides an important platform for us to share the stories we gather with a much wider audience but gives us the benefit of the expertise Europeana can provide and links us to similar organisations all over Europe. Collection days can generally be run relatively cost-effectively and one of the features that really appeals to us and our participants is that they can retain their treasured objects after taking part. For us, it ticks all the right boxes; it encourages public participation, allows the stories that are gathered to reach a wider audience and be reused where possible and links thematically to our exhibition themes and narratives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Personal stories lie at the heart of EPIC and one of the goals of our mission is to preserve, interpret and share the history of Irish emigration through the personal experiences of the emigrants who have left the island of Ireland. Europeana allows us to achieve all three aspects of this goal and the collection day model is one of many&nbsp;tools we use to achieve this. The <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/europeana-migration\">Europeana Migration</a> campaign we took part in in 2018 was fantastic but, even without the specific migration focus, we’ve found the themes to be flexible enough that we can still easily participate, albeit with a migration focus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Do you have recommendations to improve the collection day experience in EPIC and around Ireland?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would recommend that collection&nbsp;days have no fewer than four allocated staff, one to oversee the welcome desk, two for the interview desk to cover transcription and interview the participant and one to manage digitisation. Additional staff would be preferable if available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I would also recommend establishing a scheme to train potential volunteer ‘field agents’ for Europeana who can travel the country and gather individual themed stories remotely or organise smaller ‘pop-up’ collection days in locations throughout the country. This would not only allow Europeana to establish a better presence in each country but would permit greater flexibility for participants who wouldn’t necessarily need to attend the collection days in person but could be interviewed in a setting of their choice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

One particular highlight will be the launch of a new six-part mini-series on national television titled <em>Herstory: Ireland’s EPIC Women</em> that we have helped to develop which will air in February on RTE. Later in the year, we are also looking forward to holding a collection day dedicated to diasporic sports and developing a series of new temporary exhibitions in collaboration with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Stories and objects&nbsp;from EPIC's Europe at Work&nbsp;collection days will be available in Europeana Collections shortly.

It supports the development of new forms of tourist engagement, educational resources and dance research by leveraging and promoting content from Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project’s tools include <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/movescollect-plugin/iojfnkckbebcebomogmfgjfagfclmkid?hl=en\">MovesCollect</a>, a Chrome browser extension which allows you to create bookmarks and save your favourite items while browsing Europeana Collections. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://portal.culturemoves.eu/register\">MovesScrapbook</a> tool allows you to organise this saved content and mix it with your own, creating scrapbooks that can be used for storytelling, inspiration and much more.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paying attention to the leading role video is playing in the content revolution, CultureMoves has also produced <a href=\"https://motion-notes.di.fct.unl.pt/\">MotionNotes</a>, a web-based video annotator designed for dancers and choreographers. All tools are accessible on our dedicated <a href=\"https://portal.culturemoves.eu/\">portal</a> and tutorials are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPqol4ZcH5NUKWbz7pT_pEol5yB7TktQQ\">posted on our Youtube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Promoting destinations with generative art</h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CultureMoves works to push the boundaries of creative content reuse. Our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPqol4ZcH5NW-mtZ92_GiRn9wL4LKYdYW\">Dance (Algo)rhythms</a> video installation is an example of one of the innovative ways we promote destinations through generative art. Generative art uses programmed algorithms and artificial intelligence to handle cultural heritage content and create artworks, which we then use as the interactive set of dance performances. We presented Dance (Algo)rhythms during <a href=\"https://www.internetfestival.it/\">Internet Festival 2019</a>, one of the main events in Italy dedicated to the Internet and digital technologies. You can read about other examples of employing dance for touristic promotion in our <a href=\"https://culturemoves.eu/post/78022375\">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The conference included reputed speakers from around Europe, including Pep Gatell of <a href=\"https://epicalab.com/\">La Fura dels Baus / Epica Foundation</a>, an organisation which has experimented with the integration between arts and digital technologies since 1980. Videos of the presentations from this conference are available on our<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPqol4ZcH5NVYpGZ6ep7X8xnMGv5vFLzq\"> YouTube playlist</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the research and educational context, we have also organised several LabDays, which are interdisciplinary workshops bringing together students from various disciplines (such as architecture), artists, researchers, dance educators and technologists. The LabDays tackled topics&nbsp;including the relationships between dance, public spaces and tourism. Due to the positive feedback and exciting outcomes we encourage others to take up this approach and have published a ‘LabDay toolkit’ in our <a href=\"https://culturemoves.eu/post/84359512\">White Paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

With the team of the project <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/50s-in-europe-kaleidoscope/\">50s in Europe Kaleidoscope</a>, we have developed the MOOC ‘Creating a digital cultural heritage community’. Four modules will address the intersections between culture, dance, tourism and digital technologies, with a particular focus on dance in unconventional spaces and in relation to touristic landmarks. You can register for the MOOC later in January, when it will be launched on the <a href=\"https://www.edx.org/school/kuleuvenx\">EdX platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>For several years, Europeana – through its policies, standards, and communications – has advocated against the practice of institutions using Creative Commons licences on digital copies or surrogates of a work, when the original is out of copyright and they are neither the creators nor rightsholders. Our <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter</a> establishes that in order to achieve a healthy and thriving public domain, digitising a public domain work should not take it back to being protected and non-reusable. There is a danger of undermining the public domain, a central principle in copyright law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After working to raise awareness on the issue, Europeana celebrates the adoption of Article 14 of the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019L0790\">Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive</a>. This provision establishes that works of visual arts in the public domain shall remain in the public domain once digitised, unless the digitisation is original enough that it can attract copyright protection. All 28 member states will have to adopt it and make it national law (by June 2021). <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndeeWallace\">Andrea Wallace</a>, together with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EllenEuler\">Ellen Euler</a>, has been <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40319-020-00961-8?wt_mc=Internal.Event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst\" target=\"_blank\">researching</a>&nbsp;the Article and its implications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What issue is Article 14 trying to address?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Article 14 confronts the long-standing practice of claiming a copyright in non-original reproductions of public domain works. To attract protection, a work has to be sufficiently 'original'&nbsp;under copyright law. For a while now, there has been a lack of binding legal authority on whether reproductions of public domain works, like photographs of public domain paintings, are original enough to attract their own copyright.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because of this, cultural heritage institutions, picture library agencies, and other owners have been able to build business models around claiming copyright in public domain reproductions and charging the public a fee to use the images. But this <a href=\"https://displayatyourownrisk.org/\">has the effect of excluding the public</a> from accessing out-of-copyright artworks, and it contradicts the rationale underlying the expiration of copyright and a work passing into the public domain. The public domain should be available for everyone to use for whatever purpose: to make new cultural goods, generate new knowledge, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What is the scope of article 14? Does it apply to any type of work, and to any format of digitisation?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Article 14 applies to only 'works of visual art'&nbsp;in the public domain. The Directive doesn’t define what a work of visual art is, so we’ll need to look to national law for clarification on that in each member state. Many scholars, open access advocates, Europeana and the wider public hope member states will transpose Article 14 broadly to encompass all public domain works. Otherwise, the materials resulting from an act of reproduction of a book, scientific drawing, sheet music, manuscript, map, or other important public domain works will fall outside the scope of Article 14. It also doesn’t apply to every work of visual art -&nbsp;only those for which copyright has expired. This means in-copyright artwork reproductions are not affected by Article 14.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, Article 14 is drafted pretty broadly - it anticipates that technologies and media will inevitably change. This is a strength, considering it applies to 'any material resulting from an act of reproduction'.&nbsp;For example, that might include metadata, software code, raw data from 3D scans or digital photography, as well as any materials produced via future technologies, regardless of the format.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Does it mean that GLAMs can no longer protect, via copyright and related rights, the digitisations they make of works of visual arts in the public domain?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contrary to popular belief… no. It’s not an outright cancellation of copyright. What the text does say, is that only the materials that do meet the EU copyright threshold will be protected. No more related rights protections; only copyright protections.&nbsp;The argument by picture library agencies and many cultural heritage institutions has always been that faithful reproductions of public domain works do meet that threshold. It will be interesting to see if these claims persist after national transposition, or whether owners will finally answer the public’s call to release reproduction materials to the public domain. There is a possibility that some may resist the purpose of Article 14, whether by continuing to claim copyright or by limiting access to reproduction materials in other ways, like via restrictive website terms or by not making the data available at all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are the main conclusions of your research?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to the grey area around&nbsp; Article 14 already discussed, Ellen and I also argue that there are other ways that copyright claims - or copyright-like restrictions - might persist even after national transposition. A few examples include onsite visitor photography bans, restrictive website terms and conditions, and other gaps provided by the 2019 Public Sector Information Directive. Our paper is currently under review, but we hope to make it publicly available soon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Anything you would recommend to cultural heritage institutions?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We would recommend that institutions embrace the pro-open culture spirit of the EU Directive and get excited about the potential that widespread open access carries (taking, of course, other <a href=\"https://www.jipitec.eu/issues/jipitec-10-2-2019/4910\">appropriate licensing considerations</a> into account). In fact, institutions could begin revising intellectual property rights policies now, rather than waiting for national&nbsp;transposition of the 2019 DSM Directive. The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/OpenGLAMsurvey\">Open GLAM survey</a> that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/culturedoug?lang=en\">Douglas McCarthy</a> and I manage has a column that links to open access policies in use by each institution. It’s a great place to start exploring what other GLAMs are doing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Open access can seem overwhelming. But there are a number of online platforms (and eager volunteer communities) available to aid institutions in releasing content, like Wikimedia Commons or GitHub. We recommend releasing high-quality datasets under a Creative Commons CC0 licence and letting the online community get to remixing and reusing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The momentum for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenGLAM\">Open GLAM</a> is already there and growing. Article 14 will serve as an important catalyst for adopting open access policies and it will help those already working internally to garner more support in releasing digital collections online. This is what we’re most looking forward to! We should all be eagerly awaiting the inevitable digital innovation and new knowledge generation that will result from greater access to the public domain.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>About Lóa&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I studied history at the University of Iceland. I found the subject fascinating and enjoyed working with sources and carrying out research. I then studied pedagogy and became interested in working on my subject with students. Soon after graduation I had the opportunity to teach at an upper secondary school, where I have now worked for 30 years. I love my work and continue to find it inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I always look to add to my knowledge and skills and try out new methods and teaching strategies. Professional development is very important to me. I have taken part in seminars and projects both at a national and an international level. I have benefited a lot from this participation, which has made my work more meaningful and enjoyable and to the best of my knowledge, made me a better teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are you currently working on?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I teach history full time and I also take part in various projects with my fellow teachers to try out methods of developing new teaching and learning material. As well as rewriting and rethinking the curriculum, I try to make my lessons impactful and interesting for my students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I have always tried to take part in international projects, for example around Nordic cooperation. Currently I am participating in a project with schools in Denmark, Sweden and the Faroe Islands. The project is funded by Nordplus, a programme from the Nordic Council of Ministers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What are some of the challenges in your role? What are some of your favourite elements?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Iceland the education system has undergone many changes in the last five years. In the school where I work, study is now focused around assignment-based learning with no formal exams. This calls for new approaches and the use of diverse teaching material.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important for professionals to take on challenges and for teachers to be open-minded to new approaches. I have long tried to embrace new technology in my teaching. I remember the first time I had a computer in my classroom and went online, which was over 20 years ago! Then, the room was filled with cables and wires and there was not much useful material online. Today there is more material, but the challenge is to find good and reliable resources for students. Having online platforms like <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en\">Europeana </a>and <a href=\"https://historiana.eu/\">Historiana</a> is very helpful in addressing this.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;A big challenge for a small country like Iceland is finding texts and material in our native language. Most digital material is in a foreign language and although students have large English vocabularies, they lack the specific vocabulary to use historic materials. Working with digital material can be complicated and more challenging than using traditional textbooks, but we need to embrace technology without throwing out the book!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What was your motivation for joining the Members Council?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I became interested in joining the Members Council of Europeana after I left the board of EUROCLIO - the European Association of History Educators - in 2018. Through EUROCLIO I learned about the work of Europeana and as an ENA member I wanted to contribute and play an active role in the network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What do you plan to do as a Members Councillor?&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I want to advocate for Europeana within my network and amongst teachers all over Europe, and play an active role in the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/special-interest-groups/europeana-education\">Europeana Education Community</a>. I would like Europeana to be well known source of material. I want to reach out to people in the field of education and make it easy for teachers and students to find material and sources in Europeana Collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

A series of documents that particularly drew our attention were the photographs taken by Professor Răzvan Rotta during one of the the tragic events that took place in Cluj-Napoca in December 1989, when 45 people died at the hands of military personnel. The 24 photographs that he took of the event will now be made available through Europeana Collections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n"

On this occasion, the young students also had the opportunity to meet and speak with two participants at the 1989 Revolution in Cluj. In a lively debate the students seemed well aware of how different their lives would be if the revolution had not taken place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p>During the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Europeana and the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture jointly held a meeting with high-level policymakers and experts in multilingualism to discuss the challenges and opportunities of multilingualism in digital cultural heritage. The event titled ‘Multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage - needs, expectations and ways forward’ was held on 24-25 October 2019 at the Hanaholmen Culture Centre, Espoo, Finland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the meeting, delegates from the DCHE Expert Group, Ministries of Culture across Europe, and multilingualism experts were invited to share their perspectives and experiences with each other through a series of speeches, presentations, case studies, panel discussions and workshops. Their aims were to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Stimulate reflection on multilingualism in digital cultural heritage at large using Europeana as a case study</li>\r\n    <li>Develop a deeper understanding of the multilingualism problem/opportunity space for digital cultural heritage</li>\r\n    <li>Consider what options can be pursued to provoke action at the local level, furthering the multilingual capabilities</li>\r\n    <li>Provide input and feedback for the Europeana multilingual strategy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Finland’s Ministry of Culture and Education State Secretary Tuomo Puumala emphasised the role of culture and heritage in creating a democratic and inclusive Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting focussed on multilingual metadata, content translation and user interactions. Some of the presentations and speeches included:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Juliane Stiller - The status quo, the problem space, and historical information on multilingual development</li>\r\n    <li>Rickard Domeij - Multilingualism, technology and policy</li>\r\n    <li>Andrejs Vasiljevs and Jānis Ziediņš - Learnings from the automatic translation projects and how to apply them for the culture and heritage sector</li>\r\n    <li>Heli Kautonen - UX design</li>\r\n    <li>Dasha Moskalenko - UX design and user testing</li>\r\n    <li>Matias Frosterus - Multilingual linked vocabularies and automatic subject indexing services</li>\r\n    <li>Hugo Manguinhas - Europeana case study</li>\r\n    <li>Anne Bajart - Multilingualism in Digital Cultural Heritage</li>\r\n    <li>Tom Vanallemeersch - eTranslation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Dasha Moskalenko, Hugo Manguinhas and Antoine Isaac presented Europeana case studies on UX design, multilingual knowledge graphs and automatic translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, a panel led by Andy Neale discussed conclusions and steps for progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal opportunities and challenges for various players were identified. Benefits of multilingualism were discussed. And together, delegates developed a broad set of solutions and changes needed to address the identified challenges and advance multilingualism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report summarises the key outcomes of the meeting including the benefits, challenges and solutions identified in relation to multilingualism in digital cultural heritage. Europeana is developing a recommended multilingual strategy and roadmap paper that builds on the output from the meeting in Finland. The Europeana multilingual strategy is scheduled for publication in spring 2020.</p>\r\n"

These included a <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/marking-1989-in-cluj-napoca-romania\">series of activities</a> organised by the Cluj County Library (Octavian Goga) to mark the events of the 1989 Revolution in Romania and <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-education-in-the-republic-of-moldova\">educational sessions</a> at the National Library of the Republic of Moldova with the theme ‘10 things to discover with Europeana - the cultural friend of the student and the teacher’. Thanks to Sorina Stanca and Natalia Gulco for organising these events!<b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>3. Integrate Europeana resources for education in the virtual learning environment of your organisation or project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">PHOTOCONSORTIUM, a non-profit association which promotes photographic heritage, have created an educational portal that gives access to resources and initiatives. They include <a href=\"https://www.photoconsortium.net/educationalportal/europeana-for-education/\">Europeana Education</a> on this portal, leveraging the potential of digital cultural heritage to support teaching and learning.

                body: "<h3><strong>Reflecting on rights research</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rights research is a multi-disciplined activity. It’s a mix of the methodical and messy, relying on structured data, the anecdotal, chance, persistence and creative thinking.&nbsp; It’s a game of detection that can bring the researcher into contact with the rich stories associated with the creation, production and distribution of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This activity could benefit from more attention (does anyone know of courses or training in this area?). Spending the last six&nbsp;years grappling with orphan works&nbsp;and the diligent (rights) search that the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52011PC0289\">Orphan Works Directive</a> made mandatory, has made me think about approaches to rights research in terms of how, when and why it is carried out.&nbsp;<meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Can orphan works diligent search help to develop&nbsp;thinking around the field of rights research, more widely as part of a more sustainable and longer legacy of collections management?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is seldom I hear of an organisational need to reduce or limit the amount of research, curatorial or archival, carried out on collections. But when it comes to research focused on rights, it seems to be something squeezed from the start as a necessary inconvenience. So why not look at it from a more constructive approach?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Working collaboratively&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Online resources are abundant, freely available ones less so. During the BFI’s <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/britain-on-film/unlocking-film-heritage\">Unlocking Film Heritage programme, </a>we researched over 1,000 rights holders to films in our collections and archives across the UK. We made extensive use of some designated sources, in particular volunteer run special interest and fan sites. We also used social media, including our own Facebook page, to reach out to people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Creating informal networks in other archives and organisations to seek information continues to be a wonderful way to share knowledge. We even called upon the public to help us in this task through a <a href=\"https://contribute.bfi.org.uk/#!/\">dedicated crowdsourcing site</a>. In effect, much of this is a form of guided crowdsourcing, finding ways to tap into existing research to join the dots.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I’ve also been involved with the <a href=\"http://diligentsearch.eu/\">EnDOW project</a>, which investigated the availability of resources for rights research across the EU and produced <a href=\"http://diligentsearch.eu/\">a Diligent Search tool</a> to help cultural heritage organisations navigate rights research. The next phase of the project, the EnDOW Community, will be to engage the wider public to help with the diligent search.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Adapting workflows to a changing legal landscape</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Evolution of digital access at the BFI has alternated between expansions in volume either as a result of proactive digitisation projects or reactively due to changes in copyright law. For example, the introduction of the legal provisions that allowed cultural heritage institutions to display works (protected by copyright or not) onsite (through the Dedicated Terminals exception under s40b <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents\">Copyright, Designs and Patents Act</a>) allowed the number of works available in our venue to increase from 3,000 to 60,000.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For each project, rights research often starts afresh and workflows are designed with the project objectives and available resources in mind. For example, for the purposes of <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/britain-on-film/unlocking-film-heritage\">Unlocking Film Heritage</a>, we took the decision to treat all UK non-fiction films made before 1945 as likely ‘out of copyright’ and therefore did not carry out research on these works. As the digitised works were made available in a limited way and non-commercially in the UK and Ireland only, this approach has paid off. However, it does mean that when the BFI receives requests from 3rd parties who want to do more with the works, the rights research process may have to start from scratch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>An integrated approach</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Much of the information we gather during the rights research process has no natural home other than email chains. Resourcing is focused on spreadsheets to bridge databases and to meet short term business demands at the expense of developing systematic data retention.&nbsp;So much of this valuable institutional knowledge has no central repository, with a lot of rights information kept in sync manually. This process does not support information in bulk, so there is a risk it will be lost unless we can find ways to retain and keep it validated post project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /><strong>Working with cultural institutions to promote their digital content</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsplash is a platform through which 150,000 photographers and institutions share their imagery or license it openly for reuse. Every second, 10 photos are downloaded from Unsplash, which has millions of users throughout the US and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsplash has recently begun featuring images from <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@europeana\">Europeana</a>, as well as a number of other cultural heritage institutions, including the <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nypl\">New York Public Library</a>, <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nasa\">NASA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@britishlibrary\">British Library</a>. These institutions, including Europeana, have worked with Unsplash to create official profiles on the platform, sharing a selection of their reusable digital cultural heritage content to new audiences. These profiles connect Unsplash’s community with historical and cultural imagery from around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The images featured on the Europeana's Unsplash profile were selected for their high quality and educational value, and include a variety of paintings, photographs, still lives and historical scenes. These images will become a source of creative information for the Unsplash community, who are encouraged to reuse and remix images from the platform - the <a href=\"https://madewith.unsplash.com/\">Made With Unsplash blog</a> showcases some of the most creative examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Unsplash for Education: Building a strong community of students and teachers</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsplash has found that students and teachers are increasingly using their platform to create presentations, write reports and learn about the world around them. 2.2 million students a month visit Unsplash, and the platform reaches many more via direct API integrations with 300 universities. To accommodate this growing audience, Unsplash has created a dedicated space for students and teachers called <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/education\">Unsplash for Education</a>. This connects the platform’s images with schools and universities around the world and supports digital learning experiences through integration with Google Slides and Instructure’s Canvas Learning Management Platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsplash for Education will help to bring Europeana’s collections to a wide student audience. Isabel Crespo, Europeana’s Business Development Coordinator, Education, says, ‘Europeana’s organisational profile on Unsplash, and the images included on it, bring our collections to the Unsplash community, expanding Europeana’s educational audience in countries including the US. In the new Europeana space, these audiences will have access to a curated selection of European cultural heritage material and the opportunity to find more gems thanks to the link with Europeana Collections.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Unsplash, the partnership is also valuable. ‘We were so excited to work with Europeana, an institution that works tirelessly to transform the world with culture by making Europe’s cultural heritage more available to everyone. Like Unsplash, they believe in an open, knowledgeable and creative society, and work to bring together organisations that have rich content to share.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unsplash plans to continue building a strong community of students and teachers, and with the rich cultural images from Europeana, which offers content from more than 3,500 institutions across Europe and beyond, these groups will be better equipped to bring their lessons to life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/what-we-do/education\">Find out more about Europeana’s work in education</a> and <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@europeana\">start to work with Europeana’s material on Unsplash</a>.</strong></p>\r\n"

                body: "<h3><strong>What does ‘open’ mean in the context of ‘Open GLAM’ and how does it relate to the public domain?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For over a decade, members of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenGLAM\">Open GLAM</a> (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) movement have been advocating liberal access to, and reuse of, cultural heritage held in memory institutions – most specifically, digital surrogates of public domain works in which copyright has expired or never existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the GLAM sector the precise meaning of ‘open access’ sometimes lacks consensus. The term is often opaque and self-designated. So the clarity that the <a href=\"http://opendefinition.org/\">Open Definition</a> brings is welcome: put most succinctly, it states that open means ‘anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share [content] for any purpose.’&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This philosophy relates closely to Europeana’s advocacy, through the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/the-europeana-public-domain-charter\">Public Domain Charter</a> and other outreach, for the benefits of a vibrant public domain, and against the practice of institutions using copyright and licensing inappropriately to obstruct access to digitised public domain works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tell us about the Open GLAM survey.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For almost two years I’ve been leading an international <a href=\"http://bit.ly/openglamsurvey\">survey</a> of open access policy and practice in the GLAM sector with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndeeWallace\">Dr. Andrea Wallace</a>, Lecturer in Law at the University of Exeter. We were inspired to start the survey because we couldn’t find an up-to-date picture of open access policy and practice in the sector. It seemed obvious that a shared resource to see, add and update relevant information would be valuable for researchers, policymakers and cultural heritage professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/openglamsurvey\">Open GLAM survey</a> is held in a Google Sheet and data are gathered through desk research and crowdsourced outreach to the GLAM community. Anyone can suggest survey additions or corrections by commenting in the spreadsheet, contacting Andrea or I on Twitter, or completing a Google Form. The survey is a personal research initiative and not owned by any particular institution.</p>\r\n"

                body: "<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\" />Since its creation in March 2018, the survey has grown significantly in size and sophistication. Listing fewer than 50 GLAMs at the beginning, the survey now contains over 650 instances of open access, from Brazil to Bulgaria. It includes information on&nbsp;GLAM location, institution type, Wikidata item, open licence, terms of use (for digital surrogates and metadata) and direct links to all of the open data sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What’s the scope of the survey?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey records&nbsp;instances (however small) of open access practice. It covers digital objects and metadata that GLAMs make available on their own websites, and on external platforms such as Wikimedia Commons, DigitaltMuseum, the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek and Github.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s important to say that survey inclusion does not mean that a GLAM has a blanket open access policy; merely that it has released <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/open-access-scope-in-open-glam-70461bec2bca\">some data</a> on open access terms. Nor does inclusion equal any kind of endorsement from Andrea and I; we record policy and practice as we find it. If you see any errors or omissions in the survey, let us know – we’re happy to update the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What does the survey tell us about the global picture of Open GLAM?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thanks to the survey, we now have a much clearer global picture of where and how open access is deployed by GLAM institutions. This enables new insight. For example, we can analyse copyright and licensing policy and practice <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/licensing-policy-and-practice-in-open-glam-49c867b49de8\">in detail</a>, visualise Open GLAM geographically with Wikidata, observe patterns in open access <a href=\"https://medium.com/open-glam/open-access-scope-in-open-glam-70461bec2bca\">scope</a>, and begin correlating open access policy to museum admission fees, to name a few examples.</p>\r\n"

Having a single access point to explore so much data is a huge time saver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, Europeana’s long-standing stipulation that data providers label their digital objects with a specific licence or rights statement from the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/standardization-tools/europeana-licensing-framework\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a> has proven to be very valuable. International frameworks and standardisation give users and GLAM professionals clarity in the complex landscape of copyright, licensing and terms of use.</p>\r\n"

This showed that the students and teachers enjoyed discovering and exploring digital Europeana heritage content through the activities and were inspired by their potential for further use in the educational process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2020, the National Library intends to extend their initiative to promote the digital accessibility of heritage resources and opportunities offered by the Europeana platform. They will do this through a series of actions including educational-informative sessions for teachers in the framework of the annual meeting of the Teachers' Community of Moldova (META).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in organising Europeana for Education events in your institution, please contact <a href=\"mailto:isabel.crespo@europeana.eu\">isabel.crespo@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n"

In 2019, the process started on 27 November at the General Assembly meeting Lisbon (part of the Europeana 2019 conference). At the meeting, the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/network-association/management-board\">ENA Management Board</a> presented five documents for members to vote on.

The Annual Report 2019 was approved by 90.5% of voters and the Activity Plan 2020 approved by 91%. Members also voted positively on the Financial Report 2018&nbsp; (84.2%) and the Budget spending forecast for 2020 (87.1%). The 2018 General Assembly Minutes were approved by 86% of voting members.

        title: 'CARARE and Europeana win Best Paper at Dublin Core Conference'

        body: "<p>A paper presented by Europeana and <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a> at the <a href=\"http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2013\">DCMI International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications</a> which took place in Lisbon, Portugal, in early September, won the event's 'Best Paper' award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antoine Isaac, Europeana Scientific Coordinator, says, 'This paper is an important one because it highlights the issues of interoperability between cultural aggregation projects and how we solve them. The paper was written by the teams of both CARARE and Europeana and shows how different parts of the Europeana Network are collaborating really well in spite of the difficult issues we're trying to solve.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/28801839-30d0-4ef8-ab11-77e5fbd793d6.jpg\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 323px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The team receive the award.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Achieving Interoperability between the CARARE Schema for Monuments and Sites and the Europeana Data Model</i> was written by Valentine Charles and Antoine Isaac from Europeana along with Kate Fernie, Costis Dallas, Dimitris Gavrilis and Stavros Angelis from the <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CARARE brings together heritage agencies and organisations, archaeological museums and research institutions and specialist digital archives from all over Europe to establish a service that will make digital content for Europe's unique archaeological monuments and historic sites interoperable with Europeana. It also brings 3D and Virtual Reality content to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"Creepy doll!\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Antoine Award-001.jpg\" style=\"width: 378px; height: 570px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Close-up of the distinctive award statue.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The paper discusses how mapping between different data models in a data aggregation context always presents significant interoperability challenges. It describes the challenges faced and solutions developed when mapping the CARARE schema designed for archaeological and architectural monuments and sites to the Europeana Data Model (EDM), a model based on Linked Data principles, for the purpose of integrating more than two million metadata records from national monument collections and databases across Europe into Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2013/paper/view/171\">Read the award-winning paper</a> and find out about the <a href=\"http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/awards-2013\">other contenders</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations to all involved!</p>"

        title: 'New widget searches Europeana, DPLA and Polish Libraries'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Four members of the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center <a href=\"http://dl.psnc.pl\">Digital Libraries Team</a> - Marcin Mielnicki, Ola Nowak, Krzysztof Sielski and Marcin Werla - have created a widget called 'CHContext' that uses the Europeana API. We asked Marcin Werla to tell us all about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/87af143f-1680-4c01-b8d8-9c3bf91c465e.png\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 298px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The widget in use on the <a href=\"http://blog.libver.gr/en/?p=553\">Veria Central Public Library blog</a> (top right)</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What does your new widget do?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The widget allows you to enrich your website with links to items from Europeana (or the Digital Public Library of America or the Polish Digital Libraries Federation). The selection of links is based on an element of your choice. It can be anything – for example the title of a blog post, or a blog post's tags. Or if you want to enrich a books catalogue, you may choose one of the elements of a book description as the input for the widget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Who should use the widget and where can they find it?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The widget can be used by anyone who has a website, but I think it may be especially valuable for cultural heritage institutions which would like to enrich their online catalogues or websites with links to Europeana. It may also be useful for bloggers who are writing about culture and related topics. For example, one of the first users of the widget was <a href=\"http://szukamy.org/\"> Szukamy, a Polish service </a>similar to the Public Domain Review. They use our widget to automatically provide links to heritage materials which are related to their posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Marcin3.png\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 376px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The widget in use on <a href=\"http://szukamy.org/\">Szukamy</a> (right).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The widget comes in two variants. For use on any website, you should use the pure JavaScript version, which is <a href=\"https://github.com/psnc-dl/chcontext\">available at Github</a>. If you are running a WordPress-based site you can use the WordPress edition of our plugin. Just search for 'Europeana' in the new plugins section of the admin panel of your blog. Or <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-chcontext/\">download the plugin here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What made you set up the widget?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial idea came from a workshop organised last year as a part of the Europeana Awareness project, where we were trying to find new ways to promote Europeana among public libraries. One of the promising directions was to promote the use of the Europeana API, so we tried to design and develop quite a generic widget, one that would work with different sites maintained by public libraries all over the Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How long did it take to set up?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was about a week of fun for Marcin, Ola and Krzysztof to make the JavaScript version of the plugin with support for the three data sources mentioned above. And an extra three days for me to develop the WordPress version of the widget based on their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/marcinfood.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 389px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The widget in use on a <a href=\"http://lukrecjusz.pl/papierowki-kompot/\">Polish cookery blog</a> (bottom right).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why is the Europeana API useful to you?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1660413\">previous experiments</a>, we found that users of our digital library services really are using links to Europeana materials that we provide automatically thanks to the use of the API. So the main benefit for us from using the Europeana API is that we can provide a more valuable service to our users, based on the open data aggregated by Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you have any other plans to use the Europeana API?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have an idea to create an application for browsing Europeana based entirely on search facets. The same idea can also be developed further to make simple 'Europeana analytics' allowing you to find answers to questions like 'What’s the distribution of content language from Polish Europeana data providers?' or 'How often are different licence types used by particular Europeana data providers?', etc. But this is at the ideas stage at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Anything else you’d like to to tell us?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that readers of this blog will find our widgets useful and we are looking forward for any comments on how we can improve them.</p>"

        body: "<p><i>Blog by Àlex Hinojo, Europeana Consultant.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Europeana launched a project called 'Europeana 1989', asking people to share their personal experiences of 1989. The goal is to create a digital archive of first-hand accounts of the fall of the Iron Curtain and other revolutionary events of 1989 like the Baltic Way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/80613825-cce9-4025-adfa-1c282cfe61a1.jpg\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 259px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Baltic Way - one of the events being documented by Europeana 1989 - CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To complement this work, we now present the first Wikipedia 1989 Online challenge! Partcipants are invited to improve the Wikipedia articles in their own languages that are related to the European Revolutions of 1989. The challenge organisers have provided a <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1989#Topic_list\">short list of topics</a> that may be improved or translated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Berlin%20Wall%20Wiki.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall\">Wikipedia page on the Berlin Wall</a> - just one of the pages that could be updated as part of the challenge. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the editing process, Wikipedians can re-use the many fantastic pictures that have been gathered so far by the Europeana 1989 project and its roadshows. These images can now be used in as many articles (and their various language versions) as possible, making sure that Europe's common history is well presented on the fifth-most-visited website in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wikipedia editors will be given points for the expansion, translation or creation of one of the articles in the topics list, and for the addition of images to the articles. The person with the most points at the end of the challenge will receive a special related prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accept the challenge and <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Europeana/1989\">register here</a>. The contest starts on 1 October and closes on 30 December.</p>"

        title: 'Academy Award for Europeana'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>The Europeana Foundation has been presented with this year’s European Museum Academy Award!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2013 EMA was given to Europeana by the EMA Board after wide consultation with museum experts, specialists and directors from different backgrounds and from all over Europe. It recognises the outstanding organisation that has contributed most to the development of museum practice at the international level over the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/94fe37d3-134f-4a7d-a4a6-6b7e8b4ed39a.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The EMA Prize, which is held by the winner for one year and is not necessarily presented every year, consists of a piece of sculpture by the Swiss artist, Etienne Krähenbühl (b.1953) and is given by the EMA Board on the basis of proposals submitted by its Pool of Experts, National Representatives, Institutional Supporters or other groups that are involved in EMA activities during the year.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its statement, the Academy says that: ‘Europeana is projecting itself into the cultural landscape of tomorrow… using new tools, finding new partners and experimenting with innovative models of participation. The very idea of a ‘virtual museum’ has been better defined and enriched by the results achieved by Europeana’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeanmuseumacademy.eu\">European Museum Academy</a> is a society of museum experts of different national and cultural backgrounds united for the advancement of museological knowledge based on a curriculum of proven capacity in carrying out innovative museum projects. The academy identifies in museums a relevant tool to face socio-economic and cultural challenges in contemporary society and stresses the role of the modern museum as a meeting place and as a most promising forum for the development of scientific debate, creativity, social cohesion and cultural dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accepting the award on behalf of the Europeana Foundation, its Executive Director, Jill Cousins, said: ‘It’s a huge honour to be awarded this prize by such a prestigious group of international museum experts. It is great to see that Europeana is really valued as a catalyst for change among museums. Europe is a world leader in the quality of our cultural treasures and their display in our well known and wonderful museums: we are now showing that, by working together, we can transfer the fundamental ideas of access, innovation and participation effectively onto the internet.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Academy statement speaks of museums facing the challenge of a conceptual and methodological revolution in the information age. The digital dimension of cultural heritage enormously increases audience numbers and how they can be engaged in museum activities. Europeana has received the award for the ways in which it is facilitating that transformation in close collaboration with an extensive association of heritage institutions. Europeana is extending the boundaries of contemporary museum practice on many fronts, including collecting families’ own stories as part of Europeana 1914-1918 and Europeana 1989, conducting research into Linked Open Data, piloting new Open Culture apps, advocating clear rights labelling and establishing the Europeana data model internationally. Linking museum material to that of other cultural heritage institutions also improves its discoverability. People exploring archaeology, for example, can read the books and accounts of finds, see the photographs of the sites and objects and even explore 3D representations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana is a hub within a strong network of participating heritage institutions, engaging them in dialogue with new cultural players such as Wikipedia. The award statement cites two particular initiatives, Europeana Fashion and Europeana Creative, that are brokering new relationships between the creative industries and the cultural heritage sector. Creative industries - software, arts, publishing, broadcasting - are showing strong growth across European economies, and Europeana provides them with access to the kind of digital data and content that fuels enterprise and innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Academy’s statement ends: ‘This daring and stimulating vision is the heritage of Europeana – it is something which should be shared, endorsed and actively sustained.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/05989111-f40f-4704-b553-b11a2ebf90be\" /></p>"

        title: 'Introducing Europeana''s Aggregation Team'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>Read an introduction to\_one of the Europeana Foundation's teams - the Aggregation team.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p><b>Aggregation - Noun - The act of collecting together</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people in the Aggregation team are the ones who are closest to Europeana's hundreds of data providers. Together, we aim to build the open trusted source for European cultural heritage content. On a daily basis, we work to ingest the millions of records that are being sent to us by around 100 different providers and aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to understand how this works, you need to know a bit more about the structure of Europeana. The project currently offers over 29 million records, coming from more than 2,300 cultural institutions from all over Europe. As a relatively small organisation with about 40 employees (and an aggregation team of 8) based in The Hague, it would be impossible for us to work directly with all of these institutions. For this reason, aggregators serve as bridges between the cultural institutions and Europeana. They collect the data on a national, thematic, or project-based level, harmonise it, and deliver to Europeana. Aggregators are also important because they share a background with the organisations whose content they bring together, so there is close understanding between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aggregation model enables Europeana to collect huge quantities of data from thousands of providers, through only a handful of channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/cdf8d566-e92d-4b3a-96f8-514df45aa020.png\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 446px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schematic overview of the Europeana Ecosystem. Image taken from the Europeana Essentials presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, the four operation officers (members of the Aggregation team) pick up and process the data through the ingestion tools that are constantly under development. They check the quality and edit where necessary. Every month, the newly added or updated datasets are published and made available on the Europeana portal. From this point, anybody can access the data freely through the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana portal</a> or the <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/page/apis\">Europeana API</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Joris%202%20-%20aggregation%20team.png\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 412px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Meet the Europeana Aggregation team.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make the most of this huge collection of cultural heritage records from all over Europe, it is important that the data is of high quality. Basically, the better your metadata is, the more likely it is to be found - and more importantly - used. A few months ago, our then technical director Jan Molendijk wrote about the importance of high quality metadata in more detail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana wants to present the cultural diversity of all Europe’s countries. That is why we are constantly looking for additional data providers and why we help national aggregators to get off the ground. As you can see in <a href=\"http://marijerooze.nl/projects/Europeana/\">this visualisation</a>, Europeana now includes cultural objects from each EU member state. Looking for new partners and helping the existing ones to develop further is therefore a core part of our activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all these activities raise a lot of issues and questions for both the aggregators and content providers. For that reason, we also produce a lot of <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/share-your-data/process\">documentation</a> and organise workshops with the providers in order to make this process as smooth as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have additional questions about the work we are doing here, or are interested in joining Europeana as a cultural heritage institution, please get in touch (email joris.pekel@kb.nl). We’re always happy to help existing and new providers to connect their cultural heritage treasures to the rest of Europe and - especially now as we are teaming up with other large initiatives like the <a href=\"http://dp.la\">Digital Public Library of America</a> and <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/\">Trove</a> in Australia - the world.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'RLUK Introduces The European Library to Members'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Blog by Elizabeth Joss, Editorial Officer of The European Library. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 24 September 2013, the UK consortium of scholarly libraries, <a href=\"http://www.rluk.ac.uk/\">Research Libraries UK</a> (RLUK), will host an event to introduce The European Library to its <a href=\"http://www.rluk.ac.uk/content/member-list\">member libraries</a>. This follows a <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newsitem/2450\">recent announcement</a> that RLUK has joined <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a>, a not-for-profit membership organisation providing researchers with access to more than 200 million records and digital items from all of Europe’s national and research libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/5aa0f968-447c-492a-920b-1484e39dbdfc.jpg\" style=\"width: 415px; height: 41px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Details of the Event</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.rluk.ac.uk/content/rluk-introduction-european-library-24-sep-2013\">one-day event</a> aims to impart information about the many advantages of this new partnership. It will also allow for greater cooperation between the two parties and will encourage ideas around the sharing of resources and data through The European Library portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event will take place from 10:30–15:30 on 24 September 2013 in the Lutyens Room, RIBA, 66 Portland Place, London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Screen shot 2013-08-21 at 13 51 59.png\" style=\"width: 433px; height: 494px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Linked Open Data To Be Ingested</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>'The first outcome of joining The European Library will be the release of a very large amount of linked open data (LOD),' says RLUK deputy director, Michael Mertens. 'This amounts to approximately 20 million bibliographic records that describe and point to some of the richest collections in the UK, covering subjects from anthropology to zoology.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Shared national research collections held at top research-level institutions in the UK, including the collections of the three national libraries, as well as items held by the V&amp;A and the Welcome Trust Library, will be made available via The European Library site. The entire holdings of RLUK, some 50 million unique titles, will also be added. We hope to enrich what is already available on The European Library website, and thereby enrich the learning experience of citizens of Europe and beyond,' continues Mertens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'In collaborating with The European Library, we will be augmenting a metadata aggregation that already totals around 200 million records, and this will lead to a strategic impact and relevance for our own future direction as a consortium of research-intensive organisations – the increased dissemination of scholarly output through closer cooperation with European partners and stakeholders. Openness of output and depth of network achieved through being part of The European Library will mean that the work of RLUK and its members will be both better known and more applicable to the pressing political and social issues of the day, which ultimately, only knowledge, wherever it is held, will solve for everyone.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Furthermore, RLUK will be able to achieve many of its strategic and tactical aims through our partnership with The European Library. We will be able to make available knowledge of national treasures to an even greater audience, in line with our principles of openness and accessibility.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Library is steered by three influential library organisations: <a href=\"http://www.cenl.org/\">CENL</a> (the original founder of The European Library), <a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/\">CERL</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/aboutus\">Further details about The European Library</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rluk.ac.uk/\">RLUK</a> (Research Libraries UK) is a consortium of 33 major research organisations in the UK and Ireland, including the three UK National Libraries, the Wellcome Trust and the V&amp;A (Victoria &amp; Albert). RLUK’s mission is to work with their members and partners, nationally and internationally, to shape and to realise the vision of the modern research library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p>The Europeana Professional blog is now one year old! The blog was launched at the Europeana Project Group Meeting last year on 10 September and its first big news was the release of all <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-opens-up-full-dataset-for-re-use\">Europeana metadata under the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's hard to believe that this is the 175th blog in just 52 weeks! In that time, we've notched up close to 40,000 page views with readers spending an average of 2.5 minutes looking at the blogs. And the blog has developed to regularly count for more than 10% of all of the Pro website's monthly traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/125d356f-3705-4387-987f-5339c29027e1.jpg\" style=\"width: 242px; height: 350px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Happy birthday to the Pro blog!

Around half of our blogs come from guest bloggers. So far, we've heard from more than 20 of the projects in the Europeana Project Group and we're working on making sure the remaining projects are represented over the next few weeks. Blogging for Pro is a great way of letting others know about your project's progress and of making contact with people interested in the same areas of work. We tweet every blog to our 12,000 Twitter followers as well as provide a weekly summary of blog posts on LinkedIn, so the reach can be large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are the most popular blogs of our first year...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1587205\">Case Study: Europeana &amp; Partners on Pinterest</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1494947\">Europeana Launches Rights Labelling Campaign </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1614449\">Recommendations for the representation of hierarchical objects in Europeana </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/new-datasets-available-for-linked-open-data-initiatives\">New Datasets Available for Linked Open Data Initiatives</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/moving-to-new-europeana-data-model\">Moving to New Europeana Data Model</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1650486\">Open Image Archive opens up 40,000 Swedish images</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And here are some more gems that you may have missed...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1334656\">Creating 3D Content for Europeana - a Big Challenge </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/end-user-research%3A-why-we-love-visitors-from-social-media\">End-User Research: Why We Love Visitors From Social Media </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1402324\">Natural Europe: natural heritage and educational pathways </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1475656\">Q&amp;A with Marco Rufino, Europeana Fashion </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1538026\">Sharing Metadata Expertise With DPLA </a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/social-semantic-web%3A-interview-with-europeanatech\">Social Semantic Web: Interview with EuropeanaTech</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1748477\">Taking design lessons from the Rijksmuseum</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/89-voices%3A-fascinating-first-hand-accounts-from-1989\">89 Voices: fascinating first-hand accounts from 1989</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We're always looking for new stories and new bloggers, so if you have something you'd like to shout about on the Pro blog, please email beth.daley@bl.uk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscribe to the Pro blog <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/blogs/rss?companyId=10108\">RSS feed</a></p>"

        body: "<p>The Linked Heritage project draws to a close at the end of September 2013. Linked Heritage – with the strapline, ‘Share culture, link content’ - was a content-focused project, which aimed to bring large quantities of content into Europeana, to enhance metadata quality and to improve the search, retrieval and re-use of Europeana content. So, has it achieved its aims? What has it brought to the world of digital cultural heritage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/78dfa236-96cd-4faa-b3c5-3d36b95e18fc.jpg\" style=\"width: 437px; height: 528px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Download the Linked Heritage end-of-project brochure in <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/getFile.php?id=521\">English</a> or <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/getFile.php?id=400\">French</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>30 months on, its results are impressive. 38 partners from 26 countries, together with 10 more external contributors recruited during the project including Lithuania, Russia, Croatia and Ukraine, coordinated the aggregation of over 2.7 million items to Europeana, making it one of Europeana's biggest aggregators. The <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:Linked+Heritage\">Linked Heritage aggregation</a> includes data from archives, museums, libraries, research centres and universities, and covers 3D models, manuscripts, ancient prints, medieval antiquities, archaeological artefacts, monuments, Greek and Latin inscriptions, fossils, ancient and modern paintings, ethnographic collections and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LinkedHBike.jpg\" style=\"width: 548px; height: 428px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of Linked Heritage data now available in Europeana. Michel Tordeux, Vélocipède, 1868-1870, copyright KMKG-MRAH. From project partner Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, KMKG, Belgium.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this, the project implemented a smooth workflow for mapping and aggregation activities, as well as training for content providers in the aggregation process. The Linked Heritage aggregation platform was made available online for training and validation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metadata quality, the project gave advice about the use of persistent identifiers and their use in linked data. It addressed the issue of non-standard descriptive terminologies, enhancing the quality of Europeana content in terms of metadata richness, re-use potential, and uniqueness. The project also explored the management of metadata in the private sector and outlined the benefits of private sector interoperability with Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LinkedHPalace.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 434px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of Linked Heritage data now available in Europeana. Łazienki Królewskie (Royal Baths) in Warsaw, Palace on the Water, one of the most outstanding Neoclassical palaces in Poland, built in 1770 and commissioned by King Stanisław August Poniatowski. From project partner ICIMSS, Poland.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marie-Claire Dangerfield, from Europeana's Aggregation team, worked closely with Linked Heritage and says, 'The Linked Heritage technical team maintained strong communication links with the Europeana throughout the project, particularly relating to the submission and ingestion of datasets. With their help we were able to communicate with their providers in a timely manner. The project’s focus on metadata also contributed to the way in which the Aggregation team will deal with metadata and metadata quality in the future.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LinkedHStone.jpg\" style=\"width: 518px; height: 346px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of Linked Heritage data now available in Europeana. Monument to Nicolaus Copernicus in Toruń univeristy campus, erected in 1973. Photo by Piotr Kożurno. Copyright by ICIMSS, Poland.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linked Heritage published several reports that explored the state of linked data, its applications and potential:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A best practice report on cultural heritage linked data and metadata standards</li>\r\n    <li>A state of the art report on persistent identifier standards and management tools</li>\r\n    <li>A specification of the technologies for large-scale implementation of cultural heritage linked data</li>\r\n    <li>A linked data demonstrator</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The project’s work with metadata was continued with an exploration into the management of metadata in the private sector and the benefits to Europeana of interoperability with the private sector. Key documents for this work are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>A vest practice report – Public-Private Partnerships</li>\r\n    <li>A specification of the technologies chosen</li>\r\n    <li>A specification of legal/licensing environment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Another working group addressed the large gap between the actual state of terminology management in cultural institutions, and the skills and means necessary to deliver these vocabularies in a standardised format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LinkedHRennie.jpg\" style=\"width: 243px; height: 543px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of Linked Heritage data now available in Europeana.

Copyright ICIMSS, Poland.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>So what happens now? </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project website and the showcase on Digital Meets Culture will be maintained. meaning that the main results (deliverables, publications, training material, learning objects etc.) remain available for interested users after the end of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of the content providers will continue to send their data to Europeana through the new best practice network <a href=\"http://www.athenaplus.eu/\">Athena+</a>, which started in March this year. Athena+ will carry on the work on terminologies too, with the aim of realising a stable version of the Terminology Management Platform developed in Linked Heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, go to the <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.org\">Linked Heritage website</a> and visit the <a href=\"http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/heritage-showcases/linked-heritage/\">Digital Meets Culture</a> showcase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Download the Linked Heritage end-of-project brochure in <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/getFile.php?id=521\">English</a> or <a href=\"http://www.linkedheritage.eu/getFile.php?id=400\">French.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p>In 2012 and 2013, Europeana collaborated with Wikimedia Sweden to organise a series of edit-a-thons. We have now presented our experiences in a case study. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/82db7491-c6f1-49f1-93ad-6ef392ba86f7\">Read the Wikipedia edit-a-thon case study</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An edit-a-thon is an outreach event that brings Wikipedians together with professionals from GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) to generate and/or improve Wikipedia content using and linking back to institutional holdings. Edit-a-thons are usually based on one particular topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/37c8af8d-197f-4029-92ae-6625d1f440cf.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 376px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>First World War edit-a-thon in progress.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Wikipedia receives 500 million unique visitors per month, accurate representation of institutions and their content on the site is important. But how do you get your content on Wikipedia? When you have never written or edited a Wikipedia article before, it can be a frightening undertaking. An edit-a-thon helps - by bringing together volunteers from the Wikipedia world and a crowd of people who are knowledgeable about a certain topic, you can build your representation online and get in touch with your local community of Wikipedia editors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/editathon%20fashion.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Fashion-themed edit-a-thon in progress. Picture by Erwin Verbruggen, CC BY SA.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our experience organising edit-a-thons has taught us that they are win-win for everyone involved: the Wikipedia community gains much-needed helping hands; the world at large receives expanded knowledge; and GLAM institutions get valuable exposure with free contextualised content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An edit-a-thon on the First World War saw 20 images from Europeana added to 62 Wikipedia articles. These articles were then viewed nearly 2 million times over the next six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/editathon%20Hitler.png\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 555px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of a Wikipedia page that was updated during an edit-a-thon: a page on Adolf Hitler now incorporates a postcard written by Hitler himself in 1916. It was brought to a <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> family history roadshow </i><i>by a member of the public</i><i>. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another event looked at the theme of fashion, a topic that is under-represented on Wikipedia. 72 articles in eight different languages were enhanced during the event and viewed 600,000 times in the following four months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final event looked at how to run an edit-a-thon in conjunction with another event, in this case a <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989</a> collection day. Items brought to the collection day by the public were digitised and immediately used in Wikipedia articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case study looks at each event in detail and provides plenty of tips and advice for dealing with Wikimedia and for setting up your own edit-a-thons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/82db7491-c6f1-49f1-93ad-6ef392ba86f7\">Read the Wikipedia edit-a-thon case study</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p> <img src=\"/files/blogimages/0657c4bd-21ac-47f7-997d-1a5720c11177.png\" style=\"width: 111px; height: 160px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a key event for Europeana and its Network. It provides all partners with the opportunity to share experiences and discuss and develop ideas around specific areas of mutual relevance and interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year, around 200 cultural professionals met on 27 November in the beautiful Hamburger Bahnhof Museum of Contemporary Art in Berlin for a day of intense working sessions. We reviewed the activities and successes of the ‘network of activists’, congratulated our ‘Unsung Heroes’ and got many valuable contributions which shaped the strategic direction of Europeana. Europeana Network Chair Nick Poole said it all: ‘It was a successful event…and great to see such momentum and energy behind our works.’ Read our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1412565\">blog about last year's AGM</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/AGM1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Brainstorming on the Europeana Business Plan 2013 at last year's AGM</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we are gearing up for the next AGM to take place on 2 December in De Doelen, Rotterdam. The meeting will focus on the <i>Europeana Business Plan 2014</i> and Task Forces and there will be ample networking opportunities during the open format sessions. Please take a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/14XHMmt\">look at the agenda.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Network AGM 2013 is an integral part of <a href=\"http://www.dish2013.nl/\">DISH2013,</a> the biennial international conference on digital strategies for heritage, to be held on 2-3 December at the same venue. The two-day event is organised by three leading institutions in the field of digital heritage: <a href=\"http://thenewinstitute.nl/\">The New Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://www.den.nl/\">DEN</a> and Europeana. The conference will be made up of small interactive sessions interspersed with inspiring keynote talks around three main themes: business for creative industries, active audiences and new competences. Both events are key opportunities to network and look ahead to the challenges and opportunities facing the cultural sector in the years ahead, so we hope that you will be able to attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/AGM2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Deep in discussion at last year's AGM</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Network members can attend free of charge both the AGM and the reception on the evening of 2 December, which is open for all AGM/DISH participants. Europeana Network members who wish to attend the DISH conference can do so at a special discount price of 115 EUR (excl. 7,19 EUR payment processing fee by Eventbrite). All Europeana Network members will be compensated for travel and subsistence according to the Europeana v2 reimbursement rules (1 night to be refunded). If you're not a Network member yet, please <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/apply\">join the Network</a> before registering for the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dish2013.eventbrite.nl/\">Register for the AGM and DISH now</a> and join us for two days of intense knowledge sharing, idea exchange and sector-wide networking!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p>The European Commission has launched a partnership to support young entrepreneurs and tech start-ups in Europe and to promote their contribution to the economy. Through an online platform, the Startup Europe Partnership will bring together young web entrepreneurs and online startups from all over Europe, with serial entrepreneurs, large companies, specialised investors, mentors, accelerators and media. All of these groups have a special interest in web businesses and web entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vice-President of the European Commission Neelie Kroes has now created The Startup Europe Leaders Club — an independent group of founders in the field of tech entrepreneurship, including the CEOs of Spotify, Rovio Entertainment and Tech City UK. All of the members provide guidance on strengthening the business environment for web entrepreneurs in Europe. Neelie Kroes says, 'We need a Voice for the tech startups in Europe. To fight for them.' In March 2013, the Club was invited to develop a manifesto for economic growth. Since June 2013, the initial recommendations based on the grass roots perspective of these successful web entrepreneurs have been further strengthened with the support and collaboration of the Founders Forum in London. This forum is a community of the best global entrepreneurs, select inspiring CEOs and key investors in media and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img alt=\"kroes\" src=\"/files/blogimages/31e9cac4-0eef-447c-b218-2d28a7c5bd61.jpg\" style=\"width: 419px; height: 452px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Vice-President of the European Commission Neelie Kroes</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Startup Europe Leaders Club has now launched the Startup Manifesto campaign which aims to address the challenges of tough economic conditions in Europe - the European Commission forecasts that euro-zone GDP is set to shrink by 0.4% this year. Yet the growing importance of internet-driven economic growth could transform this picture by helping improve lives by providing new jobs, new skills and renewed hopes for a better future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the manifesto, 22 actions and five recommendations have been identified which can help secure future success for Europeana businesses. The recommendations are: education and skills; access to talent; access to capital; data policy, protection and privacy; and thought leadership. Find out more on the Startup Manifesto's website - <a href=\"http://startupmanifesto.eu/\">startupmanifesto.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urging members of the Leaders Club to work together, Neelie Kroes said, 'Sometimes you may think of each other as competitors, but in this project you are compatriots: you are creating an ecosystem together. This is a sector, the startup sector, that needs to mobilise and have its voice heard. And you can use all your creativity and imagination to do that. We're in a world where an online campaign about an unknown issue is watched by 50 million in 3 days. Where an irritatingly catchy tune - in a language incomprehensible to most - hits number 1 thanks to a YouTube sensation. This Manifesto contains a powerful message. It's time this message, too, went viral.'</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What can you do?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/startups.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 293px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Sign the <a href=\"http://startupmanifesto.eu/\">Startup Manifesto</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support the programme by signing the Startup Manifesto - see the options at the bottom of the <a href=\"http://startupmanifesto.eu/\">startupmanifesto.eu</a> page. You can sign via Facebook, Twitter or email. Closing date is 30 September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your organisation is in the position to be able to provide support services, you can submit a tender for the Startup Europe Partnership for a service contract of up to 90,000 euros. But be quick, the deadline is 16 September.<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/support-services-catalyse-startup-europe-partnership-smart-2013n005\">More information about the tender.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow the <a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu\">Europeana Creative</a> project which shares the same vision of supporting creative entrepreneurs and providing them with business and technological support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Veraliah Bueno from ARROW Plus and The International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the last 28 months, <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/ \">ARROW Plus</a>, a Best Practice Network under the financial support of the European Commission’s Competiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, has been working on a number of developments that demonstrate a well consolidated - and enhanced - rights identification tool: the <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/presenting-arrow-system\">ARROW system</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/c724c328-74c1-4462-8a1a-3045d8947929.jpg\" style=\"width: 314px; height: 92px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARROW Plus, a public-private partnership, brings together 33 representatives from all relevant parts of the book value chain from 17 European countries – libraries, publishers and booksellers' associations, ISBN agencies, reproduction rights organisations (RROs) and other collective management organisations, international organisations and technology developers. The project runs until late 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Arrow book.jpg\" style=\"width: 582px; height: 387px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Arrow Plus represents all aspects of the book value chain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The achievements of this project include the enhancement of a system originally envisaged back in 2008, a legal entity, and most importantly, a tool to help libraries and others identify, in a streamlined and automated way, the rights, authors, publishers and rights statuses for in-copyright text and image-based works. The tool works by querying a network of data sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ARROW, the system developed by this inclusive partnership, is a completely customisable tool that has not only been piloted but is already in operation in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, with significant progress also being made in other European countries. It is also being used in a number of study cases and considered by important stakeholders for large-scale digitisation projects. ARROW is not limited to the European territory - it can be used anywhere. <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/experience-using-arrow\">Find out more about who's using ARROW</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The expectations and results of the ARROW Plus project have been regularly referenced not only by the interested stakeholders, but also by politicians and experts all over the world. The results of the project have proven that the book industry is not only well-organised, but also willing to work out solutions for the current problems related to orphan works, out-of-commerce works and diligent search, and to help remove some of the obstacles for digitisation projects in order to improve cultural access and heritage policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Arrow crowd.jpg\" style=\"width: 555px; height: 416px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Arrow Plus General Meeting</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early December 2013, ARROW Plus will hold its final conference. The event will give us the opportunity to demonstrate the developments of the last couple of years and also to look ahead to the system’s future. For more information on the project, go to the <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/ \">ARROW Plus website</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Making historical newspaper content accessible: Europeana Newspapers'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Europeana Newspapers' Marieke Willems, LIBER Communication Officer EU Projects.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newspapers are an everyman’s source of information reporting on major events, natural disasters, famous people and everyday life. Today’s newspapers are accessible to all in paper or electronic format, but how accessible are newspapers from over 100 years ago?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers project</a> conducted a <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/D4.1-Europeana-newspapers-survey-report.pdf\">survey</a> to discover the current state of newspaper digitisation in European libraries. One of the key points revealed by the survey was the fact that only 26% of the libraries have digitised more than 10% of their newspaper content. The survey showed that a third of the surveyed libraries had never employed any techniques to make the full text of their newspaper content searchable. Of the libraries who had experimented with Optical Character Recognition (the process by which scanned images of handwritten or printed text are converted into a machine-readable format), only half were confident enough in the quality of this work to make it available to their users. It is worth mentioning that the majority of the surveyed libraries (85%) give free access to their digitised newspaper collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/92c2a67e-7ea9-42b1-908d-c43b712a14e2.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 402px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From Europeana Newspapers</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Newspapers project aims to improve access to historic newspaper content by making 18 million newspaper pages from 12 European libraries freely accessible via <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/\">The European Library</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a>. What's more, 10 million of these pages will be refined with Optical Character Recognition, Optical Layout Recognition and Named Entity Recognition which will allow users to search the full text for individual articles, people, geographical places and organisations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Newspapers2.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 533px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From Europeana Newspapers</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A browser uniquely for newspapers is being developed by The European Library to make this rich collection of 250 years of historic newspapers - the oldest dating back as far as the 17th century - easily accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Newspapers project is a Best Practice Network and shares its best practices in workshops, national information days and through its website <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">www.europeana-newspapers.eu</a>. Take a look at the video of our first workshop at which we shared best practices in refinement.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//www.youtube.com/embed/SJtWmMh5hzE\" width=\"560\"></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>The next workshop is about 'Aggregation and Presentation' and will take place at The European Library’s conference: <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/amsterdam\">Promoting innovation in Europe</a> on 16 September in Amsterdam. At this workshop, the Europeana Newspaper browser will be presented and tested. Would you like to be one of the first to test the Europeana Newspapers Browser? <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/workshop_aggregation_presentation/\">Register now for the Amsterdam workshop</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Newspapers3.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 602px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From Europeana Newspapers</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work in all of these areas will continue until the Europeana Newspapers project finishes in January 2015. We are interested in hearing from any libraries with digitised newspaper collections, who may want to join the project's network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please see <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">www.europeana-newspapers.eu</a> or follow our project news via the <a href=\"http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=d6917fe9aedb5cab842024bb9&amp;id=e1f7433e2e\">newsletter</a>, Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurnews\">@eurnews</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaNewspapers\">Facebook</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'A history of Europe''s relationship with culture'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>About two years ago, I spent my days in the University of Amsterdam library working on my Masters thesis. I researched the European Union cultural policy which aims to construct a European identity. This blog post provides a brief summary. You can <a href=\"http://uva.academia.edu/JorisPekel\">read the whole thesis here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana project is almost 5-years-old. But why was it created in the first place? Here's a brief overview about the cultural policy of the European Union which eventually led to the foundation of the largest cultural heritage aggregation project in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Europeana launched in 2008, Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Union, gave the following speech:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'I believe that Europeana has the potential to change the way people see European culture. It will make it easier for our citizens to appreciate their own past, but also to become more aware of their common European identity. And anyone in the world with an interest in literature, art, politics, science, history, architecture, music or cinema will be able to see the important contributions that Europe has made in all these fields, without even leaving their home.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of using culture in order to construct a European identity was far from new. After the Second World War when six European countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community, which would later become the EU, culture was seen as an important element for the creation of a thriving Europe. Founder Robert Schuman said in 1951:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Much more than an economic alliance, Europe has to become a cultural union.' <a href=\"http://arc.eppgroup.eu/Activities/docs/divers/infodoc-schuman-en.doc\">Schuman</a>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e246595e-612f-40de-bc79-670ca19540a4.jpg\" style=\"width: 431px; height: 529px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Winner of Europeana's Europe Day competition. Europeana asked the public to nominate items from its cultural collections that expressed the idea of 'Europe'. This image is the interior of Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, from Fondo Fotográfico de la Universidad de Navarra - Public Domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1973, the first significant steps towards defining the cultural basis for a European Union were made when the European Economic Community (EEC) signed the ‘Declaration on the European Identity’. This step was the first attempt to create a European awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The declaration led to the introduction of several measures to improve the visibility of Europe in the daily lives of the European citizens. A European flag was created, Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ was chosen as the European anthem and a standardised European passport created. In 1988, a new policy was introduced which focused specifically on using cultural heritage to demonstrate our common history, involving Europe’s architectural and artistic heritage. The EEC sponsored various arts-related craft and restoration projects and helped preserve a number of monuments that played a big role in the European history, such as the Acropolis, the Parthenon and Mount Athos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, the EEC changed into the EU with the signing of the Maastricht treaty. From that point, constructing a European identity became an even more important topic. The European Union had a clear vision of how this European identity could be constructed: with the use of cultural heritage. The idea was that when the citizens of Europe gained a better awareness of their shared identity, they would realise that they themselves had a European identity alongside their national and regional ones. Article 128 from the Maastricht treaty, which specifically concerns culture, states the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the member states, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore. Action by the Community shall be aimed at encouraging cooperation between member states and, if necessary, supporting and supplementing their action the following areas: improvements of the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the European peoples; conservation and safeguarding of cultural heritage of European significance; non-commercial cultural exchanges; artistic and literary creation, including the audiovisual sector. The Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of this treaty.' (Commission 1992a: 13)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It is interesting to see how similar the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/foundation\">mission statement</a> of Europeana is to the text above. Basically, all you have to do is replace the word ‘Community’ with ‘Europeana’ and you get a pretty accurate idea of Europeana’s core activities. In my thesis I therefore argue that Europeana can be considered Europe’s most visible representation of the cultural policy of the European Union and therefore of major significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Culture%20-%201914-1918%20UK-Germany.png\" style=\"width: 591px; height: 194px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>In <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a>, stories from different sides of the First World War sit together.

One of the first projects that showed the great potential of bringing together this material from all over the world is the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> project, in which cultural objects from all sides of the conflict are being used to tell a new story about the Great War.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p>A network of public libraries being formed as part of the Europeana Awareness project wants new members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The network currently stands at 55 libraries across 31 countries in Europe, which is a great start and the organisers now want to double the membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary Rowlatt of MDR Partners - a partner in the work package developing the network - says 'We're looking at ways to develop new partnerships for Europeana and there are many synergies between public libraries and Europeana. Public libraries are under pressure to offer their customers new digital services and Europeana, which provides one stop access to the rich digital resources of Europe's museums, libraries, archives and audio visual collections, is a natural partner for them.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/867154f4-e32e-4add-902b-fc74fc917003.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 445px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Marius Katiliskis Public Library in Pasvalys, Lithuania, is a member of the Public Library Network</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By joining the Public Library Network, organisations also benefit from cooperation with other public libraries and access to all Europeana’s digital expertise. Together, public libraries and Europeana can devise innovative uses of digital content and raise awareness of Europeana’s resources with library users.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Converted_file_7349a411.jpg\" style=\"width: 567px; height: 378px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>First Europeana Public Libraries Network meeting in Burgos. 11 October 2012.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public libraries can also play an important role as collecting centres for user-generated content, for example, by hosting events to collect, digitise and describe memorabilia, objects, photographs, documents and stories. The Public Library Network will be sharing guidelines and experiences from libraries which have taken part in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989</a>: the fall of the Iron Curtain campaigns. So, joining the network and working closely with Europeana also offers participating libraries new opportunities to interact with and develop relationships with their own audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/01 The Head of the Center  with library visitors.jpg\" style=\"width: 592px; height: 625px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Vitalija Kazilionyte, head of the Pasvalyus Public Library's Cultural Heritage Documentation Centre, explains how librarians digitise and upload documents to the internet.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Marius Katiliskis Public Library in Pasvalys, Lithuania, is a member of the Public Library Network and also part of the Europeana 1989 project. Librarians there have uploaded documents and stories (such as <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#|map/#!/geo:50.762829,13.759035/zoom:5/dialog:33828052/tab:details/\">newspapers</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#|map/#!/geo:50.762829,13.759035/zoom:5/dialog:33611017/tab:details/\">chart of the Baltic Way</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu/en/explore/#|map/#!/geo:50.762829,13.759035/zoom:5/dialog:35377004/tab:details/\">handwritten poetry</a>) to the Europeana 1989 Baltic Way map. Jūratė Genytė says, 'The librarians take involvement in Europeana 1989 as a great opportunity to promote the history of Pasvalys online and to strengthen local people's patriotic feelings by inviting them to share their personal experiences from the Reform Movement of Lithuania. It also helps us to involve our local young people in the events that their parents and grandparents were a part of.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/publiclibraries2.JPG.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 348px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Pasvalys Public Library website includes a Europeana search function that gives results from Europeana about Pasvalys.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any public library can join the network - regardless of whether or not they currently provide data for Europeana. Public libraries will also be encouraged to join the Europeana Network - an open forum for experts across Europe, from content providers and aggregators to providers of technical, legal and strategic knowledge and the creative industries. This forum represents and reflects the diversity of Europeana and gives its members an opportunity to voice their views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One key benefit for Public Library Network members is an invite to the public libraries conference on 9-10 December in Athens. Europeana Awareness is hosting this event in partnership with the <a href=\"http://about.futurelibrary.gr/\">Future Library</a> project in Greece. Some funding will be available for members to attend - further details and the numbers that can be supported will be provided at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To join the public libraries network please contact:<br />\r\nMary Rowlatt<br />\r\nMDR Partners<br />\r\nmary.rowlatt@mdrpartners.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Q&A with EuropeanaBot developer'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Developer Peter Mayr has used the Europeana API to create something called the 'EuropeanaBot'. It's essentially a Twitter account that tweets interesting objects found in Europeana. Follow it at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot\">@EuropeanaBot</a>. We chatted to Peter about why and how he created the EuropeanaBot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/4ee70a8c-0687-45ae-9013-1d9aaa40654d.png\" style=\"width: 346px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What do you do for a day job?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am an administrator and software developer for the inter-library loan system and two other projects at the <a href=\"http://www.hbz-nrw.de\">North Rhine-Westphalian library consortium</a> in Cologne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How did you hear about Europeana?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't recall exactly, but since I am part of the 'library scene', Europeana is a big topic in our professional circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What made you set up the EuropeanaBot?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was really delighted that Europeana offers an API so that people can access the whole wealth of data and build their own projects on top of it. However, I had no idea what I wanted to to with all these possibilities. And then the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DPLAbot\">DPLA (Digital Public Library of America) Bot</a> came along and I liked that idea. Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I took it as an inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentation of digital resources is difficult for libraries. It is no longer possible to just explore, browse the stacks and make serendipitous findings. With Europeana, you don't even have a physical library to go to. So I was interested in bringing a little bit of serendipity back by using a Twitter bot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, this was also a nice technical challenge for me to learn something about the Europeana API and the Twitter API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What does EuropeanaBot do?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, the EuropeanaBot presents interesting random images from the Europeana collections. For this I used several 'seeds' as starting points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One 'seed' is a list of Austrian place names, because I thought there might be some interesting historical photographs and maps in Europeana. (I am Austrian, so it made sense to start with something familiar.) I also thought that the names of famous people would make a good 'seed' so I used a list of all the Nobel prize recipients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I implemented the Nobel prize list, the Bot found some interesting images but Europeana provided little context. So in order to find out more about these people, I integrated Wikipedia. Now, EuropeanaBot also provides a link to the relevant Wikipedia page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in the latest version, I used Wikipedia's 'Random Page' feature to get search terms for Europeana, so now the bot also tweets images of obscure stuff like 'fish ladders'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/europeanabotunicorn.jpg\" style=\"width: 591px; height: 699px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2023826/san_index_php_t_objekt_oges_16803.html\">Unicorn picture</a> tweeted by EuropeanaBot. From Museum Schloss Bernburg, museum-digital and Linked Heritage. CC BY-NC-SA.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I just wanted to present (semi)random Europeana findings, I wouldn't have needed Twitter - an RSS-Feed or a web page would be enough. However, I wanted to infuse EuropeanaBot with a little bit of 'Twitter culture' and give it a personality. I am a big fan of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarcasticRover\">Sarcastic Rover</a> account. So besides just tweeting random images, the EuropeanaBot also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot/status/366820168002830336\">hates Monday mornings</a>, participates in 'Follow Fridays', likes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot/status/366583339588657153\">cat pictures</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot/status/366489833318776832\">unicorns</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot/status/366925575568367619\">'90s Hip-Hop</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, all of these features are not strictly necessary, but I wanted EuropeanaBot to be more than just a Europeana data delivery service, I wanted it to bring a little bit of fun to resource discovery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How long did EuropeanaBot take to set up?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am not sure how many hours it took, but it was a nice weekend project to set up and now I am using about two to three hours a week for bug fixes and new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Why is the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana API </a>useful to you?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think it's easy to use, has good documentation, an API console to try things out and uses standard formats and methods. So building an application with it was a good learning project for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Do you have any plans to develop the EuropeanaBot further? Or to use the Europeana API for anything else?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the moment, the EuropeanaBot tweets every hour. I suspect this kind of predictability might become boring so I would like to add a little bit of interactive behaviour. An interesting example is the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TroveNewsBot\">TroveNewsBot</a> which searches the National Library of Australia's historic newspapers collection. You can message this bot with a query and it returns a link to a search result. So this could be one possible direction for further development for EuropeanaBot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaBot\">@EuropeanaBot</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Right content, right context: Europeana Fashion Tumblr'
        posttype: blog

        body: "<p>For the past five months, Europeana and Europeana Fashion have been collaborating on <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">a special Tumblr blog</a> to share fashion-related content. We have now produced a case study detailing the story so far, complete with its successes and lessons learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/56e68335-4e83-4d91-b3b8-01f5fcedafdc\">Read the case study</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3f8362b4-ad16-4871-a0ed-180194e67964.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 528px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>This month, the Europeana Fashion Tumblr is curated by Missoni</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The idea</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to engage a new online audience with Europe’s cultural heritage, collaborate with Europeana Network partners, and connect cultural institutions with a new social platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumblr was founded in 2007 as a microblogging platform and social networking site. It allows users to blog in various forms: texts, photos, citations, links, music, videos. Users can upload posts via their browser, mobile phone, desktop or email. Each Tumblr blog is easy to personalise by the creator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors and users of Tumblr can follow other users’ blogs, as well as make private blogs. Individual posts are easy to share and re-post. Visitors can search for topics across all of the blogs. Currently there are 90 million blogs online on Tumblr with a daily amount of 77 million posts. The service is most popular with teen and college-aged users - half of Tumblr’s visitor base is under the age of 25.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tumblr and fashion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Tumblr founder and CEO David Karp, approximately 180 of the top 1,000 Tumblr blogs are fashion-related. And fashion-related Tumblr posts are re-blogged on a much greater scale than general Tumblr posts, says Tumblr Fashion Director Rich Tong, suggesting that 'there's a huge capacity for fashion content to go viral on Tumblr.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We agreed to run the platform together for five months. Europeana provided an online strategy and promoted the platform to its followers. Europeana Fashion selected curatorial themes in collaboration with Europeana and its partners and also promoted the Tumblr to its followers. After this first five months, Europeana Fashion and its partners would select the content together and take care of the daily postings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Tumblr2.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 223px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/post/56413447741/marilyn-monroe-singing-diamonds-are-a-girls-best\">Marily Monroe singing Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to organise the posts by themes, like shoes, or art and fashion. Each theme would be on display for a month. This meant we could retain a curatorial look and feel. We wanted it to be an online fashion blog but at the same time to let it be almost like an online exhibition, to follow the tradition of the cultural institutions that we worked with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The themes we used were: Shoes; Art &amp; Fashion; the History of the Antwerp Fashion Department; Colour from the Emilio Pucci Archive; and the shoe collection from Museo Rossimoda della Calzatura.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The results</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the first five months, the Tumblr received over 15,500 page views. Three of the biggest countries were fashion-forward nations Italy, the United States and France. They were joined in the top five by the Netherlands and Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With any project, there are challenges to overcome. We found that curators sometimes needed support because of other demands on their time, technical proficiency or language barriers. We also needed to address copyright issues, making sure all content was properly credited and linked to the providing organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tumblr is now open to all Europeana Fashion partners and the second half of the calendar years has already been filled by partners wanting to curate their own themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Tumblr3.png\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 462px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Europeana Fashion Tumblr uses a grid style</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the partners that have already participated, the experience enabled them to reflect on their current practices as a museum. Associate partner Museo Salvatore Ferragamo is looking forward to using new media for a larger public, not just for the people coming to visit the museum. For Museo Rossimoda, the Tumblr was a way to re-think curatorial practices. The museum’s permanent exhibition is arranged chronologically and by designer, while the Tumblr evolved around themes. The Tumblr thus functioned as a platform to experiment with a thematic approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MoMu - Fashion Museum Province of Antwerp - has already reserved the Tumblr for a second time. Next year, a curatorial intern will prepare a Tumblr curation alongside an exhibition on feathers. This example shows how the Tumblr can also be used as a place in which junior curators can develop their curatorial practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thank you</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Geer Oskam, Senior Marketing Specialist from Europeana says, 'We're really pleased with the results of the Tumblr. It's down to the hard work of all the people involved, particularly Michelle van Duijn and Neil Bates from Europeana and Alessandra Arezzi Boza and Gabrielle de Pooter from Europeana Fashion. We'd also like to thank all the institutions who helped by opening up their content, and the curators for taking the time to put the themes and images together. Fashion content and Tumblr go well together - it's the right context for the right content and that's what has made it successful. It's also easy to use, easy to customise, which enables us to create something that's both playful and engaging.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/56e68335-4e83-4d91-b3b8-01f5fcedafdc\">Read the case study</a></p>\r\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>Guest blog from Gabrielle de Pooter, Communication Advisor for Online Media for the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion</a> Project.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the lectures from the first Europeana Fashion International Conference are now available to watch online. The conference, held in April 2013 in Florence, attracted leading figures from different fields within the fashion industry, from museums and universities to commercial organisations and media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference explored the possible interconnections between the fashion industry and the community of galleries, libraries, archives and museums. The collection of lectures provides exciting perspectives on traditional and new aspects of the relationships between fashion, culture and media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e5750550-8200-4679-b96e-204976346545.png\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 403px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Panels on discussing 'museums, archives and fashion' and 'fashion and education'. Image by Europeana Fashion used under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chaired by Mariuccia Casadio of <a href=\"http://www.vogue.it/en\">Vogue Italia</a>, the morning session on the first day saw speakers from prominent museums and private archives discuss the changing roles of museums, archives and fashion. Raffaello Napoleone from <a href=\"http://www.pittimmagine.com/corporate.html\">Pitti Immagine</a>, an Italian trade fair organiser, provided an interesting viewpoint on fashion and culture from a more commercial perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Collection-Image-2-665x445.png\" style=\"width: 599px; height: 401px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The panel on handling new media in fashion. Image by Europeana Fashion used under a Creative Commons Atribution-ShareAlike licence.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The afternoon session took fashion education as a starting point. Speakers from leading universities, libraries and research centres, like <a href=\"http://www.polimoda.com/en/home.html\">Polimoda</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.smb.museum/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=6&amp;p=122\">Lipperheide Costume Library</a>, discussed how fashion is currently taught, but also how it can be and should be taught in the future, adapting to the changing nature of fashion itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The open workshop on the second day included a collection of lectures from speakers discussing different online and offline fashion media platforms. The subject was approached by a mix of professionals, film-makers, educators and editors stressed the power and potential of the online fashion world. Agnès Rocamora from <a href=\"http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/\">London College of Fashion</a> closed the session by re-evaluating the balance between online and traditional media and emphasised the need to study new online fashion phenomena closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/conference-2/conference/\">Watch all the lectures of the 2013 Europeana Fashion International Conference</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Europeana API used in One Week | One Tool''s Serendip-o-matic!'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><a href=\"http://oneweekonetool.org/\">One Week | One Tool</a> is a project run by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Virginia, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities in the US. The project gives developers one week to create and build a tool that will be of use to digital humanities scholars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project ran last week and on Friday, the Center announced that they had made a tool that pulls data from the Europeana API, among others, to facilitate serendipitous discovery. The tool is called <a href=\"http://serendipomatic.org/\">Serendip-o-matic</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's what the One Week | One Tool team has to say about Serendip-o-matic...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After five days and nights of intense collaboration, the One Week | One Tool digital humanities team has unveiled its web application: Serendip-o-matic. Unlike conventional search tools, this 'serendipity engine' takes in any text, such as an article, song lyrics, or a bibliography. It then extracts key terms, delivering similar results from the vast online collections of the Digital Public Library of America, Europeana, and Flickr Commons. Because Serendip-o-matic asks sources to speak for themselves, users can step back and discover connections they never knew existed. The team worked to re-create that moment when a friend recommends an amazing book, or a librarian suggests a new source. It's not search, it's serendipity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serendip-o-matic works for many different users. Students looking for inspiration can use one source as a springboard to a variety of others. Scholars can pump in their bibliographies to help enliven their current research or to get ideas for a new project. Bloggers can find open access images to illustrate their posts. Librarians and museum professionals can discover a wide range of items from other institutions and build bridges that make their collections more accessible. In addition, millions of users of the free research tool <a href=\"http://zotero.org/\">Zotero</a> can easily run their personal libraries through Serendip-o-matic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Serndipomatic search.png\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 568px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Just enter your text and click 'Make some magic!'</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serendip-o-matic is easy to use and freely available to the public. Software developers may expand and improve the open-source code, available on <a href=\"https://github.com/chnm/serendipomatic\">GitHub</a>. The One Week | One Tool team has also prepared ways for additional archives, libraries, and museums to make their collections available to Serendip-o-matic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Serendipomatic results.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 458px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Keywords are extracted from your text and results are shown from Europeana, the DPLA and FLickr Commons</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A team of 12 dynamic scholars, librarians, and students conceived and built Serendip-o-matic during the One Week | One Tool Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and hosted by the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. Twelve strangers worked toward a common goal and stepped into unfamiliar roles. 'The intense process isn't just about rapid prototyping - it's about building rapid trust,' reflected Mia Ridge, the lead of the design and development team. The group members learned new skills that they will take home and share with their colleagues around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What will you discover on <a href=\"http://serendipomatic.org\">Serendip-o-matic</a>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow One Week | One Tool on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23owot&amp;src=typd\">#owot</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Wiki Loves Public Art - winners, successes and challenges'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Over the past few months, we’ve been charting the progress of the Wiki Loves Public Art photo competition. Now the contest has finished, we can take a look at the winners and at Europeana's involvement in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the Wiki Loves Public Art (WLPA) contest was to get as many pictures of public art as possible available under a free licence on Wikimedia Commons. The submissions can now be seen and used by anyone, anywhere. These pictures will help Wikipedia (the world’s sixth largest website) to see a boost in its art coverage as photos in the contest can be added to illustrate articles in the online encyclopedia. The contest was organised by Wikimedia Sverige, Europeana and volunteers in the Wikimedia chapters and affiliated groups in each of the participating countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased to say that it succeeded beyond expectations as there were a total of 9,250 photos submitted by 224 contestants in Austria, Finland, Israel, Spain and Sweden. These photos of over 2,155 different artworks are now available on Wikimedia Commons under free licences, which means they can be re-used in, for example, online projects such as Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prizes for the three internationally best pictures are travel gift certificates for 500 euros, 300 euros and 200 euros, and on top of that Europeana has sponsored high quality prints of the winning pictures that will be sent to the winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3af0fb32-5b37-4a29-aea1-205d9032620c.jpg\" style=\"width: 419px; height: 556px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>First place: Coldcreation‘s image of Ricardo Bofill´s artwork 'Les quatre barres de la senyera catalana', in Barcelona, Spain. Comment from the jury: Simple and bright, well balanced, good composition, lighting, catches the spirit of Barcelona. Credit: ‘Ricardo Bofill (Ricard Bofill Leví), Les quatre barres de la senyera catalana’, by Coldcreation, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the challenges of this contest was the lack of national databases of public artworks. The countries participating in the contest have a diverse set of copyright laws, which means that the public artworks that could be photographed and uploaded online for the contest differ between countries. For example, in Finland the contest focuses on outdoor sculptures made by artists who have been dead for 70 years or more. In Spain and Austria, on the other hand, any public artwork can be photographed. 'This has also made a difference to the amount of artworks photographed in different local contests. From Barcelona we had over 6,000 pictures, whereas from countries with stricter copyright laws we understandably have fewer contributions', states John Andersson, Wikimedia Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Aino_patsas_Lahden_Kartanopuisto.jpg\" style=\"width: 417px; height: 545px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Second place: Kartanofoto’s images of Emil Wikström’s fountain 'Aino', in Lahti, Finland. Comment from the jury: Vivid and vibrant photo, nice dominance of green color (background, reflections in the water, statues).Credit: ‘Aino-suihkukaivo (1912) – Emil Wikström. Sijainti: Fellmanin kartanon puisto’, by Kartanofoto, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Senior marketing specialist Geer Oskam says, 'The availability of national lists or databases was a problem - even if a local government has collated such a list, it is hard for the Wikimedia Chapters to get hold of them and even more difficult to find a suitable way of distributing them.' To make it easier for people to find the artworks suited for the contest, volunteers in national Wikimedia chapters created lists on Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other challenge Geer reports is the similarity with the <a href=\"http://www.wikilovesmonuments.org/\">Wiki Loves Monuments</a> photo contest which Europeana also promotes. Because the two contests are similar in format, theme and timing, many Wikimedia communities just don't have the resources or manpower to support both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of increasing awareness of Europeana through WLPA, we can report some success. The press coverage for WPLA has been good, with many mentions of the contest in the region's taking part. Geer says, 'Europeana's visibility on Wikimedia Commons has grown as a result of the contest. Whilst this may not be easy for the public to see on Wikipedia, it shows Wikimedians themselves how involved we are. Finally, the most interesting thing, for us as co-organisers, is that WLPA has provided a hook for local communities. Together with the local Wikimedia partners, we have been able to motivate people to upload nearly 10,000 images, thus gaining grassroots awareness about Europeana and about the importance of sharing cultural heritage information openly.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/PikiWiki_Israel_32088_Beating_Heart.jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 360px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Third place: Gila Brand’s images of Yaacov Agam’s sculpture A Beating Heart, in Jerusalem, Israel. Comment from the jury: Strong, expressive and charming photo, well chosen camera angle and focus, emphasis on the most significant details. Credit: ‘Yaacov Agam’s sculpture A Beating Heart’, Gila Brand, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how has the experience been for Europeana overall? Geer says, 'Europeana and Wikimedia Sweden have happily worked together on the organisation of the Wiki Loves Public Art photo contest. For Europeana, it was a chance to show our devotion to the Wikimedia community, building new relationships with Wikimedians and Wikimedia Chapters all over Europe. By organising WLPA, we have opened a door to Wikimedia chapters in Europe, showing that we are committed to working together with them on their own terms and finding mutual benefits - that's what true collaboration is about.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browse the <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Public_Art_2013\">full results of WLPA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information on the <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/07/international-winners-of-wiki-loves-public-art-2013/\">judging process for the competition</a></p>"

        title: 'Legal Barriers Workshop at Budapest Networking Event'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Extracted from a blog by Jeanine Tieleman, Quality Manager, Digital Heritage Foundation, The Netherlands. View the full <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/blog/a_report_from_the_workshop_on_legal_barriers_at_the_2nd_networking_event_in_budapest.html\">blog post on Europeana Inside</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12-13 June 2013, the Second Networking Conference of the Europeana Inside project took place in Budapest, Hungary. The meeting took place in the beautiful Petöfi Literary Museum, once home to Hungarian aristocratic families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the conference, a workshop for content providers looked at reducing legal barriers to participation in Europeana. Discussions focused on the Europeana Licensing Framework, Intellectual Property Rights issues and <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/assets/media/PDF/157.pdf\">a report that analyses IP practices</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">Europeana Inside</a> project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/de1e615e-3d46-4440-b421-e5370ec4e1f4.jpg\" style=\"width: 283px; height: 213px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Dimitra Atsidis (Europeana) at the 2nd Network Meeting in Budapest, picture by SPK</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report by IPR consultants Naomi Korn and Professor Charles Oppenheim identified some of the key legal, licensing and policy challenges that are inhibiting organisations from contributing their previews and metadata to Europeana. It drew on responses to a questionnaire answered by 9 organisations. Despite the small basis for conclusions and recommendations, the barriers, constraints and recommendations mentioned in the report are generally recognised by organisations in the Europeana Inside consortium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop highlighted a discrepancy between one of the recommendations in the report, namely that more training of staff on IPR issues is required, and current practice - Europeana already puts quite a lot of effort into organising workshops on training in IPR all over Europe. It would be interesting to find out what causes this discrepancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/30JulyA.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 240px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Marco Streefkerk (DEN) at the 2nd Network Meeting in Budapest, picture by Jeanine Tieleman, DEN</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the subject of metadata, the main point of concern for organisations turned out to about controlling the (quality of the) metadata. Interesting in this respect is the discovery that the more organisations are forced to open up their data at one level, the more they are inclined to tighten their grip on their data at another level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop ended with discussions about lobbying by the cultural sector at the EU. While there is fierce lobbying in Brussels by adversary parties such as right holders, publishers etc. for their interests, the cultural sector remains silent on this issue. Consequently, the interests of the cultural sector are not (well) represented and therefore in general not known in Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/30Julyb.jpg\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 240px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The network at work, picture by Jeanine Tieleman, DEN</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cultural sector has to adapt to the new realities, which nowadays means not only concentrating on the management of beautiful collections, but also, being able to defend the interests of the sector on different levels - nationally as well as on a European level. Building strong networks for representation and lobbying will strengthen the position of cultural heritage institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of having this IPR research as part of the Europeana Inside project is not only to end up with a list of IPR-related problems, but also, within the Europeana Inside project, to try to follow up the recommendations as much as possible. Therefore the next goal on the agenda is to compile a European checklist on IPR for institutions wishing to participate in Europeana. In order to involve the knowledge and concerns of as many cultural heritage institutions as possible, a draft list will be developed and distributed among the Europeana Inside partners for feedback and discussion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more on the workshop and the discussions that took place, see the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/blog/a_report_from_the_workshop_on_legal_barriers_at_the_2nd_networking_event_in_budapest.html\">Europeana Inside blog</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/06727598-fa9f-484a-85b6-8ebc95036ec2.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 139px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The #AllezCulture campaign, which we launched in May, is gathering evidence and support for Europeana's continued funding under the European Commission's Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). We have now reached the end of the first phase of activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Thank you</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director, says:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Thank you for all of your tremendous and impressive efforts for the #AllezCulture campaign over the past couple of months. This has been hugely important in helping to persuade decision-makers in Brussels of the case for funding digital cultural heritage. Thank you also for the efforts that you have made to express support for and demonstrate the value of Europeana at a national level via your cultural and governmental institutions. Your efforts have had a real and direct impact in building support for our cultural heritage related projects and Europeana in the European Parliament and the European Council. As a result, we end this first phase of the #AllezCulture campaign with the European Commission recognising the value the cultural heritage and digital communities place on Europeana. This is an important achievement for our community and will be a great foundation for the work that still lies ahead of us after the summer break.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>Examples of support</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The petition (titled 'Keep Europe’s culture open to everyone online') that we launched on 21 June closed with well over 7,500 signatures and hundreds of valuable and inspiring comments, including these examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>From Jeremy Ottevanger: Europeana is the single most important international digital initiative for culture that I know of, both for what it does directly and what it enables. The waves it makes spread everywhere!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>From Ulf Preuß: Wohin soll denn die Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek exportieren? Wie sieht es mit den ganzen Inhalten der Europeana Projekte aus? Was für eine bessere Möglichkeit zur europaweiten Präsentation einer gemeinsamen Idee gibt es denn sonst?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>From Leboutte René: Europeana est un outil fondamental pour l'avenir intellectuel et culturel de l'Europe</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your efforts signing and sharing this petition. The strong response shows policy-makers in the EC that we are doing this together, that cultural heritage organisations across Europe need and want Europeana to continue, indeed that those organisations <i>are</i> Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the campaign, we've had support from a huge range of people, from Europe and beyond, including Dan Cohen of the Digital Public Library of America, who tweeted this to his 11,000+ followers: 'Voicing my strong support for continued funding for @EuropeanaEU, which has connected Europe &amp; democratized access to culture. #AllezCulture'. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">See more #AllezCulture tweets</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of the many organisations that have blogged on #AllezCulture include: <a href=\"http://researchkb.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/europeana-the-case-for-funding-tweet-allezculture/\">the National Library of the Netherlands</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.euscreen.eu/?p=3949\">EUscreen</a>, who called Europeana the 'innovative hadron collider for the cultural sector'. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllezCulture/\">See more blogs on the #AllezCulture Facebook group</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have also had support from policy-makers themselves. Commissioner Neelie Kroes has tweeted five times about Europeana during the #AllezCulture campaign and this <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/69069677\">supportive video</a>, made by the leader of the European Parliament's Culture Committee, Doris Pack, was shown to representatives of Member States at the Europeana conference in Dublin as part of the Irish Presidency.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/69069677\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/69069677\">Europeana Address by Doris Pack, EU Committee on Culture and Education</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>More examples of #AllezCulture activity can be found in our <a href=\"http://storify.com/Europeana/allezculture-1\">Storify feed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Next steps</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Commission will now take time to gather and look at information on all of the Digital Infrastructure platforms that could potentially be funded, and to set out its process for the next stage of planning and decision-making in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the summer, we will start phase two of our #AllezCulture campaign to influence this next stage. I hope that we can continue to count on the inspiring support that you have shown over the past few months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Fashion in the library: Encounters with Wikipedians of a GLAM kind'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>This extended guest blog is by Erwin Verbruggen from the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Fashion project is organising a number of Wikipedia editathons about fashion. In the process, we’ve been learning about how museums can benefit from working with the Wikipedia community. Organising the editathons has shown us how we can get people to come down to our libraries to share knowledge and taught us the differences between the Wikimedia and the GLAM (galleries, libraries, museums and archives) ways of working.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fashionable edit-a-thons</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/36676b43-66e9-484c-89fa-2d35da96a2f4.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 111px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Europeana Fashion project, the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/research\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> coordinates a series of Wikipedia 'editathons'. An editathon is a scheduled time where people edit Wikipedia together, whether offline, online, or a mix of both; typically focused on a specific topic.[1] Editathons improve the encyclopedia and can be a great way to teach people how to edit on Wikipedia. The aim of our editathon series is to provide a historical context for the materials that the 19 museums and private fashion archives contribute to <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion</a>. They also boost knowledge about fashion history on Wikipedia by adding new and improving incomplete articles. The collaboration with Wikipedia is a meaningful way to promote Europeana Fashion. They improve public knowledge about fashion history on Wikipedia, offer context to the beautiful materials Europeana Fashion brings online and connect different communities around a shared passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/editathon%20stockholm.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Editathon in Stockholm, picture by Erwin Verbruggen, Europeana Fashion, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison to its cultural importance, there are not that many articles on the topic of fashion on the English-language Wikipedia. When the Europeana Fashion project started, there were about 3,886 articles, most of which were of 'Start Class' or 'Stub Class' quality. [2] Most fashion articles on Wikipedia are of specialist interest - there were only 37 articles that were deemed as must-have topics to be included in an encyclopedia. Most of the incomplete fashion articles on Wikipedia cover topics of top importance - like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Coco_Chanel\">Coco Chanel</a> or the profession of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Model_(profession)\">modelling</a>. Some fashion articles are not tagged, which makes them very difficult to find. Furthermore, some topic descriptions definitely need to be extended as they do not constitute even the minimal knowledge on the topic and many articles about specific fashion brands, fashion icons or fashion magazines do not exist yet. The conclusion from this analysis was that the Europeana Fashion project had a lot of ground to cover and our efforts could provide a great boost to improving the presence of fashion knowledge in the world’s free encyclopedia. Not only in the English language!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/editathon%20utrecht.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 333px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Editathon Utrecht, pciture by Sebastiaan ter Burg, Europeana Fashion, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bringing out collections</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Bringing people together to share knowledge and write together is wonderful. But where the power of Europeana Fashion comes out is in the marvellous collections we are bringing online. The editathons are an excellent opportunity to make use of this content and knowledge and use it to illustrate the articles, improve on existing ones or spawn new article ideas. All the images, sounds and videos used on Wikipedia come from the Wikimedia Commons platform: a database of 17,690,872 freely usable media files to which anyone can contribute. Europeana Fashion is growing a collection of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcommons.wikimedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCategory%3AEuropeana_Fashion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6hfpS06s07q72DHFEVgWzF9w3wQ\">images and videos from its content providers</a> on Wikimedia Commons so that participants can easily find them during the events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All content on Wikimedia Commons needs to be either in the public domain or available under a ‘free culture’ licence. By organising these editathons, the participating curators are talking to their management about how many materials they could make available this way. From our experience, it is important to think big - by starting small. Organisations who find it difficult to begin can select 5 images to run through the process. The easiest step here is to start with Public Domain material or material for which the institutions own the copyright. Many projects in the Europeana Network have written extensive reports about researching and realising correct use of copyrighted or out-of-copyright items, such as the <a href=\"http://www.eclap.eu/axmedis/8f3/00000-8f3eddd4-e03d-4805-863b-dc11b478a13a/4/~saved-on-db-8f3eddd4-e03d-4805-863b-dc11b478a13a.pdf#toolbar=0&amp;navpanes=0\">ECLAP report on IPR for the performing arts</a>. The Europeana Fashion report on IPR bundles best practices for the fashion heritage sector and will be published after the summer - keep an eye on the <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion channels</a> to stay up-to-date. Once images are starting to be used to illustrate or exemplify topics on Wikipedia, it’s exciting to follow how quickly these items gain attention in different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connecting knowledge realms</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The second strength of the Europeana Fashion project is that it can introduce fashion experts to the Wikimedia community. Traditionally, there’s little overlap between the ambitious volunteers who intend to amass the world’s knowledge and the fashion industry, fashion GLAM community and those with a general interest in fashion. Differences between these two fields can be felt - and overcome - by joining forces. Not all Wikimedia volunteers are fond of paid professionals meddling with Wikipedia. Sometimes, volunteers disagree heavily on the cultural value of dress-related topics. Much has been written, for example, about <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/13/kate_middleton_s_wedding_gown_and_wikipedia_s_gender_gap_.html\">Kate Middleton’s wedding dress</a> and how it does or does not prove a valid topic for Wikipedia. Museums like to closely monitor knowledge management and communication. Wikimedia volunteers embrace a <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/wikimedia.html\">culture of open communication and collaboration </a>on all levels. The open nature can be challenging to curators with highly specialised knowledge. The invitation to correct erroneous details or careless wording by enthusiastic amateur fashion historians can seem like an extra workload to take on. Some cultural institutions have embraced this collaboration by inviting a <a href=\"https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian_in_Residence\">Wikipedian in residence</a> who can bridge the gap between these two - so closely affiliated - realms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, our events have a number of positive outcomes. GLAM representatives get a first-row insight into the machinery of Wikipedia. Collaborating with local museums has the wonderful effect that Wikimedians learn about the values of a museum or archive and the various levels of expertise that exist in, what is for them, an unfamiliar field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://prezi.com/embed/wkjckbuifhau/?bgcolor=ffffff&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;autohide_ctrls=0&amp;features=undefined&amp;disabled_features=undefined\" width=\"550\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Onwards and upwards with the arts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the coming two years, Europeana Fashion will be expanding its collaboration with the Wikipedia community. Together with our colleagues from Europeana Awareness, we are planning to host events in <a href=\"http://wikifashion-be.eventbrite.com/\">Antwerp</a>, Venice, Vienna, London and Lisbon. Meanwhile, we’re working on a handbook for GLAMs with more hints and tips for organising editathons around the globe, which is expected to be released after the summer.

        title: 'Successful parallel WWI editathons held in 7 countries'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by John Andersson from Wikimedia Sweden.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Saturday 29 June 2013, a series of parallel First World War editathons was organised all over Europe and Australia by <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Sverige\">Wikimedia Sverige</a> as part of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a> project. To get people involved, we contacted a bunch of Wikimedia Chapters and individual volunteers, many at the GLAM-WIKI 2013 conference, which just goes to show the great value of physical meetings! We told them about our plans and we were happy to receive great interest and positive responses, not to mention a few great suggestions for improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had four reasons for holding these events. Firstly, there is always a spike in Wikipedia visitor numbers around the dates of a major event, and so we wanted Wikipedia's articles about the First World War to be as good as possible before the centenial anniversaries. As many articles were created and improved during the editathons, we believe this to have been a step in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/56293013-26ee-4626-a983-c177aa32e064.png\" style=\"width: 557px; height: 363px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>This postcard was uploaded from Europeana by a volunteer and it now illustrates the English article <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Hessen\">SMS Hessen</a>. A bunch of beautiful images of old ships was uploaded during the day. Europeana, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, we looked at an editathon as a perfect way of getting representatives from different galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) to cooperate with each other and with us, and a great way of engaging experts. The idea was that this would give us a chance to approach the GLAMs and initiate collaborations in order for them to release pictures and work with us in other ways during 2014. At the European level we are already cooperating with Europeana and the Europeana Network in order to reach even more GLAMs. As Europeana's material was frequently used in the editathons, the events further strengthened our partnership with them and the GLAMs participating in their Network. As part of the events, several Wikimedia Chapters also initiated new relationships with their local GLAMs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our third reason behind hosting the editathons was that we wanted to increase the use of Europeana's enormous digital collection on Wikipedia and make the community aware of this partnership and the many similarities between our two organisations. Europeana has many thousands of pictures connected to WWI that have the right licences to enable their use on Wikipedia. It would be a shame not to have these amazing pictures illustrating Wikipedia articles. The pictures come both from the public and from Europeana's vast network of content providers. During these events, we showed GLAMs why they should use a truly free licence (suitable for use on Wikipedia) and what the end-users, us Wikip/medians, could do with their content. The editathons were very successful as plenty of images from Europeana were used and contextualised in our articles and we were all happy to see that volunteers explored Europeana's material themselves and uploaded many more great images during the day. Also, there was a lot of work done in London on digitising and working with material from the British Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/18July2.jpg\" style=\"width: 557px; height: 355px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>This image is now used on plenty of language versions and it is one of two Europeana images used in a <a href=\"http://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A7%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AC_%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1_%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD_%CE%91%CE%84_%CE%A0%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%83%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%A0%CF%8C%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%BC%CE%BF\">Greek article about Chemical weapons in WWI</a>, and it was uploaded by yours truly in advance of the pilot event we had in Sweden last November. Europeana contributor: Benjamin Hirschfeld on behalf of Christoph Herrmann, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we hoped that a series of events across borders would spawn a lot of great press coverage and really show the collaborative strength of our international community. As a few of the volunteers were interviewed about the events and we also had some nice blog posts written about the event this was partly successful. But more could be done and I hope that all Chapters consider creating lists of newspapers (based on themes such as history, computer science, local media etc.) to which they can send out press releases regarding their events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We really wanted to have the editathons at the end of June as the week around 29 June is filled with central events connected to the First World War. For example, 28 June was the day that Gavrilo Princip shot the Archduke which evidently led to the starts of the war. The Second Balkan War also started on that date. These editathons really were a testament to how far we have come from the international wartime political situation as so many of the countries involved in the war took part in the joint edit-a-thons, spreading neutral knowledge about WWI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/18July3.jpg\" style=\"width: 552px; height: 367px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Hard-working volunteers created and improved a bunch of different articles during the day. Here you see some of them in Stockholm, Sweden.John Andersson, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical WWI editathons took place in five countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Successful online editathons also ran in Australia and Greece. All in all, well over 50 volunteers took part in the editathons. The Europeana Challenge, that participants could enter if they used an image from Europeana, was won by Glavkos from Greece after a very impressive and productive day. Glavkos received a 300-euro travel cheque as his prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the 7 countries that organised the events, a couple of others also examined the possibility, but didn’t find a large enough group of volunteers this time. However, the fact that so many Chapters and volunteers found this interesting makes us think that we might be onto something with this type of international and gamified parallel editathon. As such, we are inspired to do something similar again later this year!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a couple of very successful fashion editathons in both Sweden and the Netherlands (more info on the Pro blog soon!) we are thinking about using fashion as the theme next time. The fashion editathons we've hosted so far have been valuable in involving more female Wikipedians. We hope that you will join us and help us develop our events further. Perhaps we can take another small step towards changing the gender balance on Wikipedia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>Blog by Elizabeth Joss, Editorial Officer, The European Library</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libraries across Europe are invited to attend <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/amsterdam\">The European Library Annual Meeting</a> taking place on 16-17 September 2013 at The Amsterdam Central Public Library. This informative and engaging event aims to promote innovation across Europe’s national and research libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ff39cf15-ef99-4169-a1db-d42d6a12375f.jpg\" style=\"width: 478px; height: 480px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BibliotheekOBA_2.jpg\">Amsterdam Central Public Library</a>, Wikipedia Commons, by Ceinturion, CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event venue, <a href=\"http://www.oba.nl/pagina/22992.central-library.html\">The Amsterdam Central Public Library</a>, is the embodiment of innovation and cutting-edge research in the Netherlands. The library is a modern architectural gem comprising 7 floors, a theatre, broadcasting facilities and panoramic views of the city. It is the ideal venue for library representatives and those interested in library innovation and digitisation to come together and explore the latest ideas in the field. Furthermore, the library is conveniently located within walking distance from the Amsterdam Central Station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"270\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\" src=\"http://system.videoculture.nl/vcp/axx/v|ce6f2955f794aa40f31a1db213217372\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"480\"></embed></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who Can Attend The European Library Annual Meeting?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Current and prospective partners of The European Library, thought leaders and anyone interested in the digital innovation of libraries are strongly encouraged to attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What to Expect</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the event you will meet the new Management Committee of The European Library and hear about our exciting future plans. Expect to attend hands-on workshops and learn about the projects in which we are involved and how they may benefit you. These projects include cloud infrastructure, full-text aggregation and discovery, data mining and virtual research environments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential partners will also learn about the many benefits of joining The European Library – increased exposure for libraries and how we work with libraries to save time and money in delivering key services to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Library of the Month Campaign</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/TEL croatia.jpg\" style=\"width: 365px; height: 535px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/record/1000096335886\">Croatia revived. Croatia rediviva, regnante Leopoldo Magno caesare / deducta ab eq. Paulo Ritter</a>', The European Library, Rights Reserved - Free Access</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many benefits of joining The European Library is the exposure it gives libraries. At the Annual Meeting you will learn about The Library of the Month Campaign, just one of the ways in which we work towards ensuring greater coverage of libraries across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This campaign has the purpose of celebrating one of our partner libraries each and every month. We work towards promoting the many magnificent treasures housed at the chosen library and made available digitally on The European Library portal. The campaign includes promotion of libraries through online editorials and social media marketing. In this way we are able to establish and foster concrete relationships with partner libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National and University Library in Zagreb is currently our Library of the Month for July. The campaign importantly coincides with Croatia joining the European Union this month. We have importantly strengthened our relationship with this library through the campaign and we have brought the library’s resources to a much wider audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs Breza Šalamon-Cindori, the Website and Social Networking Manger at The National and University Library in Zagreb has the following to say about the campaign thus far:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The presentation of the National and University Library in Zagreb as Library of the Month for July was both an honour and a challenge for us. We presented The European Library in a special manner to online users of the National and University Library in Zagreb. Our portal has over 540,000 visits annually. We also introduced The European Library to around 6,700 active followers on our various social networks.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In a short space of time, potential and current partner libraries are spreading word of the campaign, therefore growing our audience to other libraries, their users and to researchers. The beauty of the campaign is that it is generating awareness far beyond social media and our stories have been picked up by numerous websites in the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of the reach of our campaign and the sense of community it creates can be seen below. The Russian State Library has in fact promoted the National and University Library in Zagreb as Library of the Month in the form of a <a href=\"http://www.rsl.ru/ru/s6/s373/s3734405/s37344057736\">blog post</a> on their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/TEL russia.jpg\" style=\"width: 584px; height: 364px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Register for The Annual Meeting Now</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Complimentary tickets to the Annual Meeting are available for partner libraries, research and national libraries, potential partners and anyone interested in digitisation and innovation in the libraries sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can easily <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/event/6679286927/eorg\">register with Eventbrite</a> to obtain your free ticket. Ensure you register by Monday 2 September to secure your place. You can also read more about accommodation options, the agenda of the meeting and further details on <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/amsterdam\">The European Library website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>We encourage you to take this great opportunity to network with fellow professionals, learn more about the benefits of joining The European Library, and attend workshops and discussions about innovative library practices. </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/TEL logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 357px; height: 340px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        title: 'Moving to new Europeana Data Model'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: "<p>EDM allows us to make explicit links between Europeana objects, e.g. the different volumes of an encyclopedia, or between an object and contextual information.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>Europeana and partners have been working hard for more than two years to change the data model behind Europeana from its original and simple <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/ese-documentation\">ESE (Europeana Semantic Elements)</a> to the richer <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">EDM (Europeana Data Model)</a>. EDM allows us to make explicit links between Europeana objects, e.g. the different volumes of an encyclopedia, or between an object and contextual information, e.g. an object and the geographic location it relates to, and allows us to display more than one image for each entry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process of moving to EDM has been a long one, but now we are delighted to announce that EDM has been implemented both front-of-house on the Europeana portal and behind-the-scenes in the process for incorporating new datasets. For data providers, this means that they can now send us their richer EDM metadata and we can make it visible on the Europeana portal. This is a big step forward - until now we have only been able to publish data in the flatter ESE format. As we ingest more EDM data, we will also be making changes to our services, so that users can take advantage of the benefits this richer data provides.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The United Ingestion Manager - a new tool for EDM publication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make all of this happen, we have introduced a new workflow for the ingestion of EDM metadata and a new tool - the UIM (United Ingestion Manager). With the help of several plug-ins, the UIM facilitates the different steps of the ingestion process, e.g. harvesting, mapping, de-referencing, enrichment, thumbnail caching and link checking, all of which are necessary before metadata can be published on the Europeana portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first EDM publication using UIM happened in June. This first publication was only possible after extended developments and rounds of testing, which meant that the normal monthly ingestion cycles were slightly delayed. The good news is that a larger EDM publication is currently being prepared by the aggregation team, and monthly ingestion cycles will be reinstated as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of the UIM, with a workflow which is more automated and connected than before, and the possibility to publish EDM, will now allow the aggregation team to focus more on the quality of the metadata received and on issues like persistent identifiers, thumbnails and geo-references.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first publication with EDM included native EDM metadata (data that we had already received in EDM format) from partners like <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22HOPE+-+Heritage+of+the+People%27s+Europe%22&amp;rows=24\">HOPE - Heritage of the People's Europe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:CARARE&amp;rows=24\">CARARE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22MIMO+-+Musical+Instrument+Museums+Online%22&amp;rows=24\">MIMO - Musical Instrument Museums Online</a>. Forthcoming publications will feature even more native EDM data from these partners as well as others such ECLAP - e-library for Performing Arts, DCA - Digitising Contemporary Art, and Hispana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(21).jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020708/8326702B3496AC345E92DFD34E19271C974B79F2.html\">Midwinter sunset, Stonehenge</a> from CARARE, Archaeology Data Service &amp; Clive Ruggles, CC BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Updated Documentation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can imagine, during the testing and implementation process, we have learnt a lot and made further amendments to EDM, taking for example into account recommendations of the EuropeanaTech <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech/-/wiki/Main/Taskforce+on+hierarchical+objects\">Task Force on Hierarchical Objects</a>. To support data providers, and to reflect the changes in Europeana's data, we've updated our technical documentation on ingestion:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">EDM Definition and Mapping Guidelines</a> - UPDATED</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/providers-faq\">FAQs</a> - UPDATED</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/technical-requirements\">Technical Requirements</a> webpages - UPDATED</li>\r\n    <li>\r\n<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/ese-documentation\">ESE documentation</a> - UPDATED</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>We also maintain a list of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/case-studies-edm\">EDM case studies</a> that providers willing to send us EDM metadata can use as examples. Although partners can still send us ESE for the time being, the output of the UIM workflow is EDM and providers are encouraged to now provide Europeana with EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Your feedback</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We are well aware that in spite of all our efforts, understanding and applying EDM is not easy. This is why we are very eager to hear any comments that could make our documentation better. We also remain deeply committed to answering questions from our partners, especially when providers are preparing metadata for ingestion! So please don't hesitate to email <a href=\"mailto:content@europeana.eu\">content@europeana.eu</a></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><em>Blog by Thorsten Siegmann, Project Coordinator, Europeana Collections 1914-1918.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 2014 will be marked by the international commemoration of the beginning of the First World War in summer 1914. Numerous projects in research and education in Germany, Europe, and worldwide will be dedicated to this event. The projects <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>, <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\">European Film Gateway 1914</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu/en\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> have digitised hundreds of thousands of sources from archives, museums, libraries, and individuals. These are, for the first time ever, being made available to the general public for free via the virtual library, museum and archive of Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/acf890d4-23d6-4572-b3f3-f887511c52c6.jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 287px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200137/780A01392F40A6E62675B5B824B1D7148C0B99FD.html\">Warrior's Farewell</a>, postcard from Europeana Collections 1914-1918, CC-BY-NC-ND</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The completion of Europeana Collections 1914-1918 and EFG1914 in 2014 offers the opportunity for a presentation and discussion of new digital offerings around the First World War and Europeana. The two-day conference at the Berlin State Library '<a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/unlocking-sources/\">Unlocking Sources - The First World War online &amp; Europeana</a>' will discuss how history is presented online. The international conference will be jointly organised by the projects' co-ordinating institutions: Berlin State Library; the Department of History at the Humboldt University in Berlin; the German Film Institute - DIF e.V.; and the Europeana Foundation. It will address interested scientific audiences and the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Russian prisoners of war (1).jpg\" style=\"width: 450px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200137/EE1FEA725545D45685666C82791A97518BDCB886.html\">Four Russian prisoners of war</a> from Europeana Collections 1914-1918, CC-BY-NC-ND</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference focuses on the use of digital resources: How do digitised materials fit into research and teaching? How can different online activities contribute to the 'digital humanities'? What ideas for the teaching of history in schools, museums, and media have been developed? What are the strengths, and what are the weaknesses of the existing and newly created offers? In addition to the critical discussion and reflection of the panels, innovative digital projects approaching the theme of the First World War can present their results to a broader public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scientists, teachers, representatives of archives, libraries and museums are invited to reflect on questions of mediating history online and to present their research projects, course offerings / materials or digital sources in a 20-minute talk (English, German). Please send in an abstract (one page max) <b>today - 15 July 2013</b>. In addition, projects and ideas for projects can be presented as a poster or a presentation stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed sections and panels will focus on the following topics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li>Memory Cultures and the 'seminal catastrophe of the 20th Century'</li>\r\n    <li>Digital sources in research, education, and for the public - teaching of history and didactics</li>\r\n    <li>Everyday life history of the First World War</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/unlocking-sources/\">More information</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a> project is at its halfway stage. To mark this milestone, project partners got together at the <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/?xSET=lang&amp;xLANG=2\">National Museum</a> in Prague this week for the Europeana Awareness Assembly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img p=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/43495b01-4e78-4ef5-850e-a2a6f6bf25ab.jpg\" style=\"width: 570px; height: 426px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Thank you to our hosts at the National Museum, Prague!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking around Prague during this two day event, it struck me just how many ways there are to get around the city - I saw trams, buses, boats, pedalos, vintage cars, pedalos that look like vintage cars, segways, tricycles and even a hot air balloon. So many different ways of achieving just one thing - getting around. One goal with many solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you might expect from its name, the goal of the Europeana Awareness project is to raise awareness of Europeana. Like transport in Prague, there are many ways in which the project approaches its goal and we got to hear about them all throughout the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Prague1.jpg\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Look closely at this view from the Charles Bridge in Prague and you can see at least four different ways of solving the problem of how to get around the city.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of Europeana Awareness is immense and the activities varied. A key part of the project is its series of month-long PR campaigns - one for each of the 30 partner countries involved. Each campaign aims to achieve media coverage online, in print and on TV or radio and we're doing well so far! Over 1,200 media mentions achieved to date. At this event, we heard about recent PR campaigns in Bulgaria, Italy, Belgium and Poland, and looked ahead to future campaigns in France and the Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Prague5.png\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 503px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Just some of the headlines made by Europeana Awareness this year</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>People across Europe are, thanks to Europeana Awareness, finding out about Europeana through a number of means - <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/06/linked-across-borders-and-time-travelling-exhibition/\">travelling exhibitions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> First World War family history roadshows and the new <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989</a> programme of events, as well as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-and-wikimedia-partnership-update\">Wikipedia editathons</a>, use of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana API</a>, through a public libraries network and through the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">#AllezCulture</a> campaign. And there is more to come - a digital story telling platform is in the making, as are partnerships with organisations in the tourism sector and links with family history/genealogical services. All of this activity is supported by advances in the legal framework and progress on Europeana's <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-launches-rights-labelling-campaign\">rights labelling campaign</a> which are making more and more of Europeana's dataset available for re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img p=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Prague2.jpg\" style=\"width: 570px; height: 426px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The event included an expert guided tour of the <a href=\"http://www.nm.cz/Czech-Museum-of-Music/Long-term-Exhibitions-CMM/Man-Instrument-Music.html\">National Museum of Musical Instruments</a>. To the right, a giraffe piano. To the left, a piano played by Mozart himself!</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the course of the event, it became clear just how much work and effort is involved in the project. We heard many success stories as well as tales of challenges and discussions about how they can be overcome. We're building on what we have learnt so far - the event brought partners involved with the Europeana 1989 launch events in Poland, which achieved the most media attention of any campaign so far, together with those from the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany who will be launching their own 1989 events shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img p=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Prague4.jpg\" style=\"width: 588px; height: 288px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Discussions at the Europeana Awareness Assembly</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partners were congratulated for their fantastic work and reminded that we still have a long way to go - the project continues until the end of 2014. Interim Programme Manager, Els Jacobs, said, 'This event has been great, one of the main achievements being the exploration of common ground between the work packages. We need to keep doing this and we also need everyone involved in the project to build on what has been accomplished, to take advantage of the work already done and to use the structures already put in place. To achieve our goals and to raise awareness amongst policy-makers, we need everyone to join forces, to build local partnerships and to tell more people about Europeana and the great work being done.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Keep up the good work and tell the world about it by tweeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">#AllezCulture</a> or sharing it on this blog!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>By Milena Popova, Europeana Senior Marketing Specialist.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of a series of 'business lounge' events organised by the Apps4Europe project took place on 29 June in Amsterdam alongside the Amsterdam Hackathon 2013. <a href=\"http://www.appsforeurope.eu/\">Apps4Europe</a>, which has the strapline 'Turning data into business', is a support network that provides tools to transform Open Data app prototypes into viable businesses. The project started in February 2013 and brings together 19 partners from 10 European countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/c56e608a-e479-47ac-af6a-521befa13269.jpg\" style=\"width: 584px; height: 426px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Business Lounge event gets underway. Photo by Julian Tait, FutureEverything, all rights reserved.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Apps4Europe project will build on 20 local and two pan-European open data competitions over the next two years by adding a 'Business Lounge' format, a special programme to guide developers in creating and commercialising apps that have market potential. The best local and EU contestants will be invited to pitch their plans to investors, incubators and entrepreneurial non-profit organisations at the Pitch &amp; Prize event during the <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\">FutureEverything</a> conferences in Manchester in 2014 and 2015. Additionally, the project's online Wiki space will offer practical advice on different start-up topics, such as business and policy, data and licensing, media exposure for start-ups, technical tooling and community building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BusinessLounge2.jpg\" style=\"width: 554px; height: 409px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Experts Milena Popova and Alberto Abella evaluating prototypes. Photo by Julian Tait, FutureEverything, all rights reserved.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first Business Lounge event, 16 developer teams from the Netherlands, Finland and the UK presented their prototypes to an expert panel made up of marketing and technical experts and investors. In the morning, the panel (Julian Tait, FutureEverything, UK; Ville Meloni, Forum Virium, Finland; Milena Popova, Europeana, Netherlands; Alberto Abella, Rooter, Spain) conducted 15-minute interviews with each team, developing first impressions of their apps and evaluating their potential using a special scorecard. In the afternoon, the participants’ ideas were explored further in a 10-minute speed-date with experts in capital investment, crowd-funding, incubation and business. These experts represented companies like Peak Investment, Startupbootcamp, Rockstart, Hinsprong, Portugal Telecom, De Investeerdersclub and GetYourGuide. The day’s winner was one who had impressed both groups of experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BusinessLounge3.jpg\" style=\"width: 578px; height: 427px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Developing ideas in the Business Lounge. Photo by Julian Tait, FutureEverything, all rights reserved.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The competing prototypes covered themes such as digital community services, education, transport and tourism, legal consultations, housing, app CMS (content management systems) and publication platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://ikringloop.com/\">iKringloop</a>, an app for peer-to-peer exchange of unwanted belongings, was selected as the best local contestant and will get free entrance to the FutureEverything conference in 2014, including travel costs to Manchester up to 250 EUR, and extra media attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Business Lounge ikringloop.png\" style=\"width: 438px; height: 481px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Screenshot of <a href=\"http://ikringloop.com/\"> iKringloop</a> - the winning app.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.muse-opensource.org/\">Muse Open Source platform</a>, on which the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=646414251&amp;mt=8\">Europeana Open Culture app</a> is built, came fourth and got very positive feedback from Peak Capital representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Event pictures, short interviews with the participants and more information on the next Business Lounge events will be available shortly on the <a href=\"http://www.appsforeurope.eu/\">Apps4Europe website</a>.

        intro: null
        body: "<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Last month, people across Poland shared their memories of the changes </span><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">of the 1980s, contributing to an online archive of documents, memorabilia and stories </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">that shares their experiences with the world and with future generations. Among these items were: a collection of underground press documents, black and white music festival photographs and an album of illegal postage stamps. The most surprising item was a white Polonez car produced in the ‘80s. Photographs of all memorabilia gathered in Poland can be viewed at <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1989\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>. </span><br>\r\n\_</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/326e93a0-cc5e-4727-9f9a-dcc4aac441d8.png\" style=\"width: 515px; height: 348px;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<em><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Polonez car digitised at the Warsaw event.

Europeana 1989 encourages European citizens to share their experiences, stories and memorabilia in time for 2014 when the world will celebrate the 25th anniversary of an extraordinary year: 1989. </span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The project was launched in Poland in June. Europeana, together with the National Audiovisual Institute, organised three events in Warsaw, Poznan and Gda</span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">ń</span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">sk. During these events, volunteers took photographs or made other digital versions of everyday objects, pictures, movies and audio recordings. Once digitised, items were returned to their owners and their electronic versions were made available in the online archive: <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1989\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>. Poles brought hundreds of souvenirs and unique personal stories which show that while the ‘80s are associated with politics and Solidarity, they also provided a remarkable backdrop to the joys and sorrows of everyday life.</span><br><br><strong><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">The diversity of memories</span></strong><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">\_</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Among the items brought in were underground press (independent newspapers), election leaflets, food stamps, old bank notes, documents and family photos, clothes and toys.

The popular event attracted many subcultures, which you can see in this photo collection. Another person brought whole albums of illegal postage stamps depicting well-known opposition activists of the ‘80s. Their owner made and copied them with his friends in secrecy in a private apartment.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Many stories present how\_ bizarre life behind the Iron Curtain could </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">sometimes </span><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">be. Take the story of a Gdańsk citizen who bought a car in exchange for copper. He said that in 1989 there was a general lack of goods, so he sold about two tons of copper wires, at the time worth half a million PLN. What is more, the bank gave him this amount of money in cash. Afterwards, he bought a Fiat 126p and went on holiday with his family. This, and many other everyday life stories describing the ‘80s are on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Europeana 1989\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>.\_ </span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">‘The motto of the project is ‘Europeana 1989 - We made history’. Our goal is to document that history – showing it from the perspective of ordinary people living at the time, recording their stories and struggles, so that people’s real experiences are kept for our children and for future generations’, said Frank Drauschke, Europeana 1989 project coordinator. ‘Ordinary people make extraordinary history and that's what we want to highlight.’</span></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n<span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">'We are happy that Poles brought such a variety of souvenirs.

        title: 'Recommendations for Europeana''s future from Irish conference'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Delegates at Europeana's conference on 'Funding digitisation: can accessible cultural heritage fuel social and economic growth?' provided clear recommendations for the future direction of Europeana - as a catalyst, as a hub and as a coordinator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event, which was held as part of the Irish EU presidency at Dublin Castle on 21 June 2013, began with addresses from Jimmy Deenihan, Minister of Culture for Ireland, and Gudrun Stock from <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/en/content/dg-connect\">DG Connect</a>, European Commission. The speakers that followed represented a range of highly respected organisations including the Rijksmuseum, Retronaut, Trinity College Dublin Library and Historypin. Nick Poole, Europeana Network Chair and Chief Executive of the Collections Trust and Harry Verwayen, Deputy Director of Europeana, discussed the long-term perspective on the future of the cultural heritage sector and Europeana's #AllezCulture campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See all of the <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/europeana/presentations\">event presentations on Slideshare</a> and browse <a href=\"http://bit.ly/10Qmd7i\">photos on Flickr.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3cc2bcc1-f76c-47e7-ac88-d98dcee3cde1.jpg\" style=\"width: 595px; height: 397px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Europeana's Harry Verwayen and Irish Minister for Culture, Jimmy Deenihan</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the event, Doris Pack of the EU Committee on Culture and Education, recorded this short video for us, encouraging everyone to support Europeana's bid for continued funding:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/69069677\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/69069677\">Europeana Address by Doris Pack, EU Committee on Culture and Education</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry would like to thank all those who participated in the conference and says that your valuable contributions 'have very much helped in strengthening our mutual understanding about the role that culture can and should play in fuelling a new digital economy, and in raising awareness for Europeana. Over the next couple of weeks, we will build a strategic outline for the future of Europeana based on your recommendations, and we hope to receive your continuous support in making the case for funding of Europeana under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the event was a roundtable discussion on the question ‘How can Europeana be of most value?’ This topic was very adequately addressed and has given us some sound recommendations. Rather than focusing on the portal as the single point of access, delegates proposed that the unique value of Europeana was to work with the Europeana Network to coordinate solutions. This is important because without Europeana, individual member states would still have to develop the same solutions but at much higher costs. Specifically, the recommendation was that Europeana should focus on creating ‘European added value’:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Be a catalyst: driver of innovation, of change, a connector with other industries</li>\r\n    <li>Be a hub: of data, of knowledge, of connections, of new ideas</li>\r\n    <li>Be a coordinator: of principles, of licenses, of partnerships, of standards</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also suggested that the representatives should support the #AllezCulture campaign in the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Sign <a href=\"http://bit.ly/allezculture\">the petition</a> and send it on</li>\r\n    <li>Ensure that letters of support are sent from cultural institutions to Brussels</li>\r\n    <li>Dig up case studies, facts, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">tweet</a> or post them on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllezCulture/\">Facebook</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Allez!</p>"

        title: 'Sharing Europeana R&D successes'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>By Valentine Charles, Europeana Interoperability Specialist.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana's Research and Development (R&amp;D) team aims to facilitate discussions around a range of activities undertaken by the Europeana Network and external projects such as the <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA). We collaborate with other institutions, getting involved with small R&amp;D projects, we play an advisory role in Task Forces, we participate at conferences, and we communicate our news through blog posts and on Twitter. Because of the nature of R&amp;D, our activities often run for months before we have results to share. We are pleased to say that the work we've been involved with recently has now proved fruitful for the team and we would like to share some of the key results with you. .</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ba615e5c-a007-4601-8497-585b4420d206.png\" style=\"width: 596px; height: 233px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Research and Development in the Europeana context</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key activity of the R&amp;D team is to spread the word about the Europeana Data Model (EDM) and its extensions. For this reason, presenting our activities at internationally recognised conferences is of great importance to us. We will be presenting a range of papers at events over the course of the next few months and we're looking forward to meeting as many of you as possible there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have collaborated with the <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a> project on EDM mapping for archaeological and architectural monuments and sites. This effort resulted in the paper <i><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2869\">Achieving interoperability between the CARARE schema for monuments and sites and the Europeana Data Model </a></i>which will be presented at the next <a href=\"http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2013\">Dublin Core conference</a> in September 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EDM-related activities will be complemented by a tutorial on <a href=\"http://tpdl2013.upatras.gr/tut-edm.php\"><i>Mapping cross-domain metadata to the Europeana Data Model</i></a> at the Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL) conference in September and a tutorial on <a href=\"http://jcdl2013.org/tutorials\"><i>EDM and collections</i></a> at the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) conference in July - the USA equivalent of TPDL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The R&amp;D team also collaborates with other institutions in small R&amp;D projects. The collaboration with Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is one example. For more information on this collaboration, see our recent <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/hierarchical-clustering:-making-sense-of-europeana-data\">blog entry</a>. The results of this collaboration are summarised in the paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2866\"><i>Hierarchical structuring of Cultural Heritage objects within large aggregations </i></a>which will be presented at the next conference on Theory and Practices of Digital Libraries (TPDL) in September 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some projects, such as the <a href=\"http://elag2013.org/the-glamwiki-toolset-project/\">GLAMwiki toolset</a> or the implementation of the <a href=\"http://schema.org/\">schema.org</a> semantic mark-up, are more internal but were also promoted at the last <a href=\"http://elag2013.org/\">Europeana Library Automation Group (ELAG)</a> conference in May.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The R&amp;D team also helps promote work done by projects on topics that are important to Europeana to a wider audience. Two additional papers related to Europeana have been <a href=\"http://tpdl2013.upatras.gr/accepted.php\">accepted at the TPDL conference</a>: the <a href=\"http://www.paths-project.eu/\">PATHS</a> project with <i> Exploring Large Digital Library Collections using a Map-based Visualisation </i>and the <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a> project with <i>A Curation-Oriented Thematic Aggregator</i>. Our close colleague, Nuno Freire from <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/t\">The European Library, </a>will also present his work on <i>Word Occurrence Based Extraction of Work Contributors from Statements of Responsibility</i> at the conference. Although this work focuses on the library domain, it remains of great interest for Europeana in the context of cross-domain aggregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These projects not only develop technologies that are relevant to Europeana, they also re-use the work done by Europeana. For instance, the paper <a href=\"http://eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/papers2013/szekely.pdf\"><i>Connecting the Smithsonian American Art Museum to the Linked Data Cloud</i></a> from the Smithsonian Institute, which describes their work on mapping their museum data to EDM and publishing it as Linked Data, was presented at the <a href=\"http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/\">European Semantic Web Conference</a> in June. This initiative follows a similar effort by the Digital Public Library of America which has based its <a href=\"http://dp.la/info/map/\">metadata application profile</a> on EDM. It is great for Europeana to see that its activities are finding uses across the pond with different communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the paper <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2013.05.001\"><i>Key choices in the design of Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)</i></a> was published last month, marking a milestone in the history of the SKOS standard for representing vocabularies, like thesauri, that are of key interest to Europeana. Europeana's own Antoine Isaac was heavily involved with this research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep informed about tech news, please follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaTech\">@europeanatech</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>Lisette Kalshoven from Kennisland gives us an overview of important discussions at a recent licensing workshop.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second Europeana Licensing Workshop took place in Luxembourg on 13-14 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop was part of research undertaken for the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a> project by the <a href=\"http://www.bnl.public.lu/fr/index.html\">Bibliothèque nationale de Luxembourg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\">Kennisland</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/\">Institute for Information Law (IvIR)</a> of the University of Amsterdam. The workshop discussed a legal framework for cross-border licensing of copyright-protected works in Europe. The research explores the conditions under which a system allowing the use of copyright-protected works, contained in the collections of cultural heritage institutions, would be workable on a cross-border basis in the context of Europeana. A final report is due in June 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e246f124-b3b6-4758-a7bb-68865f237a22.png\" style=\"width: 388px; height: 433px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the first day of the workshop, <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/over-kennisland/mensen/paul-keller\">Paul Keller</a> from <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\">Kennisland</a> started the presentations with an overview of the status of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=b16bdaf6-4e53-4f58-968a-9d4943a5d297&amp;groupId=858566\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a>. Europeana is currently darfting recommendations for reviewing the Licensing Framework, which was impletemented in 2011. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/about/staff\">Julia Fallon</a> from <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> then updated the participants on the Europeana Commission's <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/audiovisual-heritage-working-group-wg3\">Licences For Europe working group on audiovisual heritage</a>. There are two agreements under development in this field - a memorandum of understanding and a model contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch, Enrico Turrin from <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/\">ARROW</a> discussed ARROW’s distributed system for facilitating rights information management in mass digitisation programmes. He pointed out that the programme is scalable for further applications. After which Godfrey Rust, from <a href=\"http://www.rights.com/\">rights.com</a> explained the possible applications for the <a href=\"http://www.linkedcontentcoalition.org/#!press-room/c12fz\">Linked Content Coalition</a>’s (LCC) Rights Reference Model in the cultural heritage domain in the context of developing rich rights metadata. Francesca Schulze from the <a href=\"http://www.dnb.de/EN/Home/home_node.html\">German National Library</a> spoke about the implementations of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/orphan_works/index_en.htm\">Orphan Works directive</a> (an orphan work is a copyrighted work for which the copyright holder cannot be contacted) in the German cultural heritage domain. They are developing a pilot infrastructure now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the evening, a guided tour of the - unfortunately very rainy - old city was on the programme, followed by the workshop dinner, offered by the Bibliothèque nationale de Luxembourg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day of the workshop, which focused on the legal environment, contractual arrangements and ongoing developments, <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/staff/guibault.html\">Lucie Guibault</a> from <a href=\"http://www.ivir.nl/\">IvIR</a> talked about the interaction between the memorandum of understanding, the Orphan Works directive and the proposed directive on collective management concerning cross-border use of music. Olav Stokkmo from <a href=\"http://www.ifrro.org/\">IFFRO</a>, the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations and Publishers, spoke about making out-of-commerce works available legally. After which, Réka Markovich from <a href=\"http://www.euscreen.eu/index.html\">EUscreen</a> discussed the legal issues in the online collections of European audiovisual heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antoinette Graves from the <a href=\"http://www.ipo.gov.uk/\">UK Intellectual Property Office</a> spoke about the UK domestic Orphan Works Scheme. It is based on the Canadian model as the Extended Collective Licensing (ECL) model was not deemed compatible with the desired commercial use possibilties. From the <a href=\"http://www.kb.se/english/\">National Library of Sweden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/JerkerRyden\">Jerker Rydén</a> discussed the issues for cross-border commercial use of the Nordic Extended Collective Licensing interoperability initiative. He stated that use of ECL commercially is possible, but that there is the risk of a massive opt-out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.irights-law.de/team/dr-paul-klimpel/\">Paul Klimpel</a> has written a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/904448/35dacbce-235b-4740-aac2-72e944964442\">paper on legal fictions in copyright clearance</a>. He illustrated this paper during the workshop, offering an enriching point of view in the current debates. Marco Giorello, deputy head of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/internal_market/index_en.htm\">Copyright Unit (DG MARKT)</a> of the European Commission gave an update on the ongoing work and implementation of the Orphan Works directive. He stated that Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic have proposals for implementing the directive ready. Lastly, Luis Ferraro, Principal Administrator <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/\">for the Creativity Unit of the European Commission (DG CONNECT)</a>, spoke about culture and creativity in the digital realm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All together, the presentations gave a good review of the current state of affairs in the realm of clearing rights for cultural works in Europe. <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/EuropeanaConnectWP4\">View all the presentations</a>. The review on the Europeana Licensing Framework will be presented later in June as a project deliverable.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>Last week we launched a petition (in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/AllezCulture\">English</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/AllezCultureFR\">French</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/AllezCultureDE\">German</a>) to gain support for Europeana's continued funding. We have had a great response - already, over 5,000 signatures and a lot of great supporting comments. Thank you to all who have signed and shared the petition. Please continue to do so - we still need more signatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/06727598-fa9f-484a-85b6-8ebc95036ec2.jpg\" style=\"width: 139px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside the petition, we are doing an analysis of Europeana's economic impact. Europeana and the Europeana Network support economic growth by building services that lead to cost savings and improve the work of professionals in cultural heritage organisations. We already have <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/0/AllezCulture+leaflet\">some indicators to demonstrate the impact of Europeana</a>. We now need your help in making the argument stronger by presenting more examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have developed a <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/europeana-services\">short survey</a> that will give us concrete and valuable information to build upon so that we can meet your needs more efficiently. The survey asks you to consider whether Europeana leads to cost savings in your organisation, and how much Europeana is worth to your organisation. The information gathered will enable us to evaluate our services accurately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a member of the Europeana Network, or represent a Europeana partner organisation, or if your organisation uses Europeana in some way, please complete the survey. It will only take you a couple of minutes and will help us tremendously. Closing date is Wednesday 3 July. Thanks a lot for your time!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/europeana-services\">Take the survey now</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For other ways to support us and for the latest news on our progress, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">Europeana #AllezCulture on Twitter</a>, join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllezCulture/\">Facebook group</a> or visit our dedicated <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/protect-our-cef-funding\">campaign web page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

        body: "<p><i>At the end of May, we brought you <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1751145\">the news</a> that a tool developed by Europeana project partners had been shortlisted for a prestigious award. Today, we're very pleased to have a guest blog by Sam Leon, Project Manager, Open Knowledge Foundation, with a very special update.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/7a37f69e-3059-4c98-aac8-a77f0470e282.jpg\" style=\"width: 604px; height: 453px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Simone Fonda receives the LODLAM award in Montreal</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://thepund.it\">Pundit</a>, the semantic annotation tool developed by Italian SME Net7 as part of the <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu/\">Digital Manuscripts To Europeana (DM2E)</a> project and other EC-funded projects, has won the <a href=\"http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/\">LODLAM (Linked Open Data in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) Challenge</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pundit enables humanities researchers to create RDF annotations on digital content from Europeana and the wider Linked Data Web. It promises to offer the next generation of humanities scholars a means to connect and contextualise the vast amount of digital heritage now being made available via Europeana and other cultural heritage portals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/\">LODLAM Challenge</a>, which ran over the course of 6 months, involved a first round of community voting on the LODLAM website and culminated in all finalists pitching their projects to a panel of judges at the LODLAM Summit held in Montreal, Canada, on 19-20 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simone Fonda, one of the lead developers behind Pundit who pitched the tool in Montreal, said of the team’s success:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'A very exciting competition with a lot of interesting projects. And I’m not only referring to the finalists. We are working hard to bring Pundit to the next level and this important reward will fuel future developments with new and fresh enthusiasm. The whole team is just so happy!'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see Simone’s winning presentation pitch here:</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"356\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/23256854\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" width=\"427\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/simonefonda/lodlam-challenge-winner-pundit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LODLAM Challenge 2013 winner: Pundit\">LODLAM Challenge 2013 winner: Pundit</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/simonefonda\" target=\"_blank\">simonefonda</a></strong></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Pundit team will receive a $2,000 cash prize as well as the bragging rights that come with overcoming a field of tough competitors and some of the finest and most marketable projects from the linked cultural heritage domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information: visit <a href=\"http://thepund.it\">Pundit</a> and <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu\">the DM2E project</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\"); <a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</p>"

        body: "<p><i>Today, Neil Bates, Marketing Specialist at Europeana, talks about a new engagement concept around Europeana 1989 that builds a personal connection between the stories and objects being digitised.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ve probably heard about our latest project, <a href=\"http://europeana1989.eu/\">Europeana 1989</a>, an initiative that asks people to share their own stories, photos, videos and sound recordings of the revolutions of Eastern Europe in 1989. The result will be a fascinating archive for present and future generations that can be explored for learning, personal interest and research work. Europeana 1989 is a collaboration between 11 partner institutions, <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/\">Historypin</a> and the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 1989 project kicked off with the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-1989-launched-in-warsaw\">first collection day in Warsaw</a>, Poland, on Saturday 8 June. Many Warsovians came to the House of History to share personal memories and belongings that paint a picture of what the changes in 1989 meant to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/597e669d-fceb-4eda-963b-053cf1f57fbc.jpg\" style=\"width: 405px; height: 444px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the back of the collection days, we want to dig a little deeper and build a stronger personal connection between the different objects we are digitising and the stories being recorded. Through <a href=\"http://www.89voices.eu\">89 Voices</a>, we’ve created an oral history and social engagement initiative that aims to record and preserve 89 fascinating first-hand accounts from individuals who experienced the fall of communism and the reunification of Europe. 89 Voices will interview 89 people who bring their objects and unique stories to collection days in Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Germany and the Baltic States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Warsaw-89-Voices.jpg\" style=\"width: 542px; height: 391px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Recording a story from <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/post/52622352766/sarmite-elerte\">Sarmīte Ēlerte</a> (56) at Europeana 1989 collection day in Warsaw.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 89 audio recordings will highlight personal historical information about individuals, families, important events, and everyday life during the revolutions of 1989. 89 Voices adds a new element to Europeana’s already successful collection days and strives to record valuable information from different perspectives that cannot be found in photographed objects or written sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Press play to listen to Anna's story.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96389102&amp;color=ff3f3f&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Anna-89-Voices.jpg\" style=\"width: 410px; height: 583px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://89voices.eu/post/52627905447/anna-misiewicz\">Anna Misiewicz</a> (32) from Warsaw talks about the objects she brought along to the Europeana 1989 collection day and the memories associated with them.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project uses <a href=\"http://tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/\">SoundCloud</a>, and will continue until 2014, the 25th anniversary of the start of the revolutions of Eastern Europe. SoundCloud is the world’s leading social sound platform where anyone can create sounds and share them everywhere. Through SoundCloud, poeple can record and upload sounds, and share them privately with their friends or publicly on blogs, sites and social networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://89voices.eu/\">89voices.eu</a> and meet the people who experienced an extraordinary year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-via=\"EuropeanaEU\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\">Tweet</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaEU\">Follow @EuropeanaEU</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script></p>"

We are still in the running but we are now in direct competition with health, justice and safer internet programmes. If we lose the funding, much of the hard work we have put in will be wasted. More information on this on our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/protect-our-cef-funding\">dedicated campaign page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana works with galleries, libraries, archives and museums in every European country to make knowledge and culture available online. We connect everyone in Europe with their shared history and heritage – 27 million books, pictures, films and recordings so far. With our partners across Europe, we’re pioneering new ways to engage people in culture through websites, apps, software and social media, through sharing our expertise, business models and code, and through services for education and tourism. Europe needs our innovation – there’s faster progress in the digital sector than most other areas of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting Europeana is supporting Europe. None of us can afford to lose a service that is both good for people and good for the economy. So please pledge your support by <a href=\"http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/keep-europes-culture-open-to-everyone-online/\">signing the petition</a> and sharing it however and wherever you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Other ways to support us</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For other ways to support us and for the latest news on our progress, follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">Europeana #AllezCulture on Twitter</a>, join our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AllezCulture/\">Facebook group</a> or visit our dedicated <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/protect-our-cef-funding\">campaign web page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget to share the petition wherever you can!

        title: 'How the Irish Traditional Music Archive went digital'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today, Europeana and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Ireland, are holding a conference entitled 'Funding digitisation: can accessible cultural heritage fuel social and economic growth?' at Dublin Castle, Ireland, as part of the Digital Agenda Assembly and the Irish Presidency of the EU. To celebrate, we have a guest blog from Grace Toland, Librarian of the Irish Traditional Music Archives, which is now <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=irish+traditional+music+archive&amp;rows=24\">accessible through Europeana</a>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.itma.ie/\">The Irish Traditional Music Archive</a> (ITMA) is now celebrating its 25th year. Since its inception in 1987, it has amassed the world’s largest multimedia collection of materials relating to Irish traditional song, instrumental music and dance. It is a not-for-profit national resource centre which is open free of charge to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/820ef194-413b-49f1-a16e-338ace9c8fbb.jpg\" style=\"width: 293px; height: 126px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>© Irish Traditional Music Archive</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITMA has embraced the potential of digital access and the sharing of resources where possible. This ethos led us to sign our first Europeana Data Provider Agreement on 1 February 2011. Since then, we have contributed metadata for almost 2,000 digital items for inclusion in the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=irish+traditional+music+archive&amp;rows=24\">Europeana portal</a> and plan to double this figure in 2013/2014. We supported the publishing of metadata under the terms of the CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Declaration in 2012. ITMA would like to see the Europeana portal continue to gather and grow and to receive the funding necessary to make this possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Computerised databases have been used since 1987 and the Archive has adopted other digital equipment and digital functions as technology has become available. Currently field and studio recording, cataloguing, indexing, audio and video storage, music engraving, book design and layout, audio editing and web publishing are all carried out digitally in ITMA. It has had a web presence since 1992 and in April 2011 launched a major re-design and upgrade of its <a href=\"http://www.itma.ie/\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15404/071D632B37255A4E254697ED254CEE514AC128EC.html?start=56&amp;query=irish+traditional+music+archive&amp;qf=TYPE:VIDEO&amp;startPage=49&amp;rows=24\">Video recording of ITMA staff in ITMA Studio, 2012</a>, © Irish Traditional Music Archive</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of the new site is the <a href=\"http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary\">Digital Library</a>, providing remote access to audio, text, video, images and interactive scores at item level and also contextualised in thematic collections. Contemporary items are presented with the agreement of the performer and historical items generally come from older material which is now out of copyright. The DL also includes <a href=\"http://www.itma.ie/digitallibrary/interactivescores-all\">interactive music scores</a> created by ITMA staff using Sibelius Scorch. These music notations can be viewed on screen and played back in user-friendly ways. We add digital material regularly with a planned programme of media selection to provide users with a taste of the variety of items held in our premises in Dublin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ITMA3.png\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 474px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>ITMA Digital Library homepage, © Irish Traditional Music Archive</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We digitise selected media in-house, adhering to international standards for sound, images, text and video. Master copies at full resolution are archived on servers in-house. These master files are then copied and used to create web-friendly versions which are stored using Amazon web services. For print items, we also make a PDF quality file to allow downloading. Videos are accessed through the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ITMAVideos\">ITMA YouTube channel</a>. Once we have created our files for upload, we then attach these and create metadata using the content management system, Expression Engine. We use the Dublin Core metadata format. In order to contextualise these individual items, they are then linked to a playlist, gallery or printed items collections page. The user can then read a short introductory piece which puts the individual item in its traditional music context. Users can therefore browse thematically or, alternatively, search for individual items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ITMA4.jpg\" style=\"width: 597px; height: 448px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15404/928A41A686283C2B3039A32FDEC1F61E8712BFFE.html?start=58&amp;query=uilleann+pipes&amp;startPage=49&amp;rows=24\">Cylinder recordings of Irish-American piper, Patsy Touhey, 1900s</a>, © Irish Traditional Music Archive</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, ITMA embarked on a new delivery platform, a microsite which linked approximately 2,000 digital items relating to the singing tradition of the Inishowen Peninsula in Co. Donegal. The <a href=\"http://www.itma.ie/inishowen\">Inishowen Song Project </a>was a partnership between a local traditional singing organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.inishowensinging.ie/\">Inishowen Traditional Singers’ Circle (ITSC)</a> and ITMA with funding provided by <a href=\"http://www.inishowen.ie/\">Leader</a>. ITSC wished to make field recordings freely available as a teaching tool and to create a tangible record of its invisible local heritage of traditional singing. The project required sensitivity in presentation, ease of navigation and its own identity. Over two years, 600 audio and video recordings were digitised, as well as images and related publications. Songs were transcribed and made available as PDFs, biographies and metadata were created, linking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roud_Folk_Song_Index\">Roud Folk Song Index</a> numbers were attached and all items were related to each other. ITMA intends to partner with other organisations using the microsite model in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ITMA5.png\" style=\"width: 598px; height: 478px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Inishowen Song Project microsite, © Irish Traditional Music Archive</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ITMA is proud to be part of this European cultural project, and to see Irish traditional music sit alongside its cultural cousins for all to share. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23allezculture&amp;src=typd\">#AllezCulture</a></p>"

        title: 'Hierarchical clustering: making sense of Europeana data'
        posttype: Blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>By Valentine Charles, Europeana Interoperability Specialist.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana now gives access to 27 million objects (books, paintings, sound recordings, videos etc) contributed by over 2,200 cultural heritage institutions from all over Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aggregating such heterogeneous collections raises issues such as ambiguity between original and derivative versions of the same object, or even duplication if different providers give access to the same object. Relationships between objects within Europeana or between Europeana and external objects or collections are often lost. The loss of these semantic relationships is mostly due to a metadata quality issue: simple formats like Europeana’s former data model (Europeana Semantic Elements - ESE) are not good at capturing internal and external semantic links between objects. In addition, Europeana’s providers are not always in the position to provide rich data. The result can be an unsatisfying browsing experience for Europeana’s visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May 2012, a small team of experts from the Europeana Office and from <a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research.html\">Online Computer Libary Centre (OCLC) Research Europe</a> started collaborating to address these challenges. In particular, investigating automatic clustering (grouping) of cultural heritage objects so that we can find relationships between objects within Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/7ffa4f36-e0a6-4359-a4f5-de4221bf6397.jpg\" style=\"width: 566px; height: 440px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From left to right: Titia Van de Werf (OCLC), Antoine Isaac (Europeana), Shenghui Wang, Rob Koopman (OCLC), Valentine Charles (Europeana). </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main goals of the experiment were to create semantic links between objects and to detect duplicates. The OCLC team developed an advanced clustering methodology which was applied to the entirety of the Europeana dataset. Results have been analysed and categorised, looking out for similarities in the metadata and digital representations of the grouped objects. Examples of clusters include: all parts of the same object (e.g. scanned pages of a book), translated copies of the same archive, multiple letters belonging to the same set of correspondence, multiple digital representations for the same object.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find a more detailed presentation of the work in Shenghui Wang’s presentation 'Hunting for Semantic Clusters: How Can We Find Interesting Stuff in Over 22 Million Europeana Objects?' given at the OCLC Annual Meeting in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" id=\"iframe_container\" src=\"https://prezi.com/embed/5sqpkvoerrtt/?bgcolor=ffffff&amp;lock_to_path=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;autohide_ctrls=0&amp;landing_data=bHVZZmNaNDBIWnNjdEVENDRhZDFNZGNIUE43MHdLNWpsdFJLb2ZHanI5ejlGaTN3VkYrMlpQc2xnWStSdDNJY2hRPT0&amp;landing_sign=O7G_Aus8ao5ps9Cvvrc9ffp_GtBrS94lQovBeecdhoc\" width=\"550\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work on the categorisation of similar clusters is very relevant to Europeana as it will provide new ways of organising and visualising objects in Europeana. This work is also crucial for Europeana’s data quality improvement plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The research findings of the project are discussed in the paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2866\">Hierarchical structuring of Cultural Heritage objects within large aggregations</a> which will be presented at the next conference on <a href=\"http://www.tpdl2013.info/\">Theory and Practices of Digital Libraries</a> in September 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Extending the Europeana Licensing Framework'
        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Paul Keller from Kennisland asks for feedback on a discussion paper - 'Extending the Europeana Licensing Framework'.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February this year, work started on two new Europeana projects: <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a>. While the former aims to kickstart creative re-use of cultural heritage objects that are available through Europeana, the latter aims to build a cloud storage infrastructure for Europeana and to make Europeana a better tool for researchers across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that both of these projects have in common is that they are pushing the boundaries of the existing <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/licensing\">Europeana Licensing Framework</a> that was adopted in 2012. Europeana Creative aims to develop a Content Re-use Framework that will allow data providers to make high quality digital objects (as opposed to metadata only) available for re-use under specific conditions. Europeana Cloud aims to make it easier for data providers to share rich metadata by allowing licensing conditions other than CC0.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/a1c92c6a-cade-4644-b54c-65b230d46e7e.jpg\" style=\"width: 582px; height: 600px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Join the conversation. Image: '<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/48DC5A32C1F6A41AFAB682BD980ECA4FB64C726D.html\">Two men standing talking to each other</a>', Rijksmuseum, public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to achieve these objectives, the existing Europeana Licensing Framework will need to be extended. This work is coordinated by <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/\">Kennisland</a> in close cooperation with the Europeana Foundation. Today, as part of this effort we are publishing a discussion paper that outlines the approach that we are proposing for extending the Europeana Licensing Framework. This <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/904448/aec1d872-08c7-41f7-86ae-b02a7f71e973\">discussion paper</a> has been drafted in consultation with key stakeholders from the Europeana Creative and Cloud projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that we are proposing that all extensions will be on top of the existing Europeana Licensing Framework without changing the existing framework. This means that <b>data providers who do not want to use any of the additional capabilities provided by the Europeana Creative and Europeana Cloud projects will not be asked to make any changes to how and under which conditions they provide metadata to Europeana. In other words, the proposed extensions of the licensing framework will be available on a opt-in basis.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though these extensions are voluntary, we want them to be as useful as possible for as many of the Europeana Network members as possible. This is why we encourage all data providers to read and comment on the discussion paper. If you have feedback (or questions) please provide it in the comments of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/904448/aec1d872-08c7-41f7-86ae-b02a7f71e973\">Discussion paper: Extending the Europeana Licensing Framework</a></p>"

        title: 'Spotlight on Europeana content-gathering campaigns'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>If you follow our blogs and social media regularly, you'll know about <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989</a> - two major projects collecting real stories, experiences and memorabilia from the public about two important periods of Europe's history. You might also be aware of our work with Wikimedia, particularly around the recent Wiki Loves Public Art competition (read our <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2013/06/wiki-loves-public-art-check-out-the-entries/\">blog on the competition's progress</a>), which is being used to increase the amount of art-related imagery in Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these campaigns is a user-generated content campaign, and the Europeana Awareness project has now produced a very accessible and interesting report on all of this work, with a particular focus on the success of the most established of these&nbsp; - Europeana 1914-1918. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/f70be745-abcd-443f-a7eb-e4cab6446b96\">Read the <i>Report on the content gathering campaigns</i></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows have been run in nine countries (Germany, Denmark, Slovenia, UK, Ireland, Cyprus, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg). Over the next two years, further roadshows will take place in Romania, France, Germany, Slovakia, Belgium, Portugal and Greece. Almost 50,000 digital files have been ingested into the Europeana portal from the Europeana 1914-1918 campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/790a20ee-d006-4bf9-a800-3ee28e6778bd.jpg\" style=\"width: 587px; height: 474px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>‘Captured’ during the war, these four little toy bears once belonged to British officers. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main objectives of the roadshows is to provide the press and broadcast media with something tangible to record. Their broadcasts and articles raise the awareness of Europeana and specifically of the request for the public to contribute their family stories about the First World War to Europeana 1914-1918. Broadcast news on the day has included local and national radio. In Belgium, there was even a TV show that followed one of the volunteers at In Flanders Field Museum to show 'a day in the life' of a curator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ucc1.jpg\" style=\"width: 537px; height: 345px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>News cameras take atmospheric shots of a child's farm animal toys during the roadshow at the National Library of Luxembourg, (March 2012)</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're interested in learning more about what goes on during a roadshow, what partners do and how members of the public are taken through the process of digitising their family stories, see section 1 of the report, or watch this specially made video.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"211\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/65900546\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/65900546\">Europeana - An impression of our 1914-1918 roadshows (short)</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>Roadshows have been running for two years now, and over this time, the process&nbsp; has been established and improved with experience. <a href=\"http://runcoco.oucs.ox.ac.uk/1914/\">Guidelines</a> on how to run a community collection online have been published by the University of Oxford, and Oxford staff and other partners have trained local staff across Europe on how to run their own First World War Family History Roadshow. If you're running an event like this, take a look at section 1.4 of the report for some really useful lessons learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ucc2.jpg\" style=\"width: 364px; height: 607px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>At Oxford University, teams from more than 7 countries were trained by Europeana Awareness partners over two intensive days, (February 2012)</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attendance figures collected from the roadshows show that nearly 4,000 people have been introduced to the Europeana brand, the portal and Europeana 1914-1918, not to mention hundreds of local staff and volunteers who are not included in the figures. The roadshow with the most visitors (those who came along but didn't necessarily contribute their stories) was Antwerp with 971. The roadshow with the most contributors was Amberg with 276. Dublin saw high levels of both visitors (600) and contributors (214). Online, the figures are even higher. In the 16 months from January 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.Europeana1914-1918.eu\"> site</a> had 122,581 visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/ucc3.jpg\" style=\"width: 585px; height: 385px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The log book and photo album from this Royal Flying Corps Captain (Giles Blennerhassett RFC) was contributed by his son, now aged 92. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the technology side, the content-gathering campaign has enabled Europeana to further develop Oxford's open source community contribution collection software called 'RunCoCo'. The Europeana 1914-1918 website is based on this software, and the project has also supported the development of the website to bring it in line with parallel digitisation projects on the same topic - <a href=\"http://project.efg1914.eu/\">European Film Gateway 1914</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeana-collections-1914-1918.eu/\">Europeana Collections 1914-1918</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wider benefits of this programme of activity are also outlined in the report. The roadshows are great for the hosting institution as they act as a friendly face and an easy introduction. The archive itself has clear research potential. The new artefacts and data about a particular period of time cover all sides of the story, giving researchers a balanced view. The history is complete in that it looks at both the military and the social history, so we can learn about the home front, art and culture as well as military operations and life as a soldier. For teachers and students, Europeana 1914-1918 is a valuable resource, making local, national and international historical information available for use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information and many great photos of the campaigns, <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/f70be745-abcd-443f-a7eb-e4cab6446b96\">download the report</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Historypin joins Europeana in adoption of CC0 licensing of metadata'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog by Jon Voss, Strategic Partnerships Director at Historypin.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://historypin.com/\">Historypin</a> is a non-profit project dedicated to the sharing and discovery of historical content, and the fostering of community around local history. Our ongoing participation in the Europeana Network, and our involvement in global efforts such as the <a href=\"http://lodlam.net/\">Linked Open Data in Libraries Archives and Museums Summits</a>, have led to our decision to make Historypin metadata available to the public under the terms of the <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 2010, when Historypin was just getting off the ground, we had a vision of sharing the millions of photos, home movies, and audio recordings stored in shoeboxes and attics around the world in order to build community and conversation around local history. We found that individuals were excited to contribute to the historical record and were discovering that their own time-worn snapshots had an important role to play in community memory, alongside a growing number of archival collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FdT3eKdto4w?rel=0\" width=\"500\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, in addition to over 48,000 registered users and half a million app downloads, there are over 1,200 institutions around the world contributing content to Historypin, from school groups and local historical societies, to national libraries and archives. We’re running projects with and for <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/en/project/16690005-1989/\">cultural heritage institutions</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/interactive-map/abolitionists-map/\">public television programmes</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/project/13388066-remember/\">commercial partners</a>. We’ve won prestigious <a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/presscentre/\">awards</a> for our design. We’re participating in <a href=\"http://crowdsourcingthehumanities.blogspot.com/\">major research projects</a> to improve the way in which academics engage with the public in humanities research. But what’s most important is that we’re actively participating in a global community that’s finding new ways to share, improve, and build upon cultural heritage data — and the example and precedent set by Europeana. It’s leading to innovative new products, unique community engagement strategies and evolving research methodologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/8cf7489b-4bd4-4b30-bbbe-6e8009b8e8a8.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/map/#!/geo:48.822951,3.655579/zoom:10/dialog:2829030/tab:streetview/\">Troop Mobilisation, WWI</a>' - public domain content from National Library of France (BNF). </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaborating with Europeana not only opens the door to significantly increase the amount of European cultural heritage content on Historypin, but also to allow the public to engage with that content in exciting new ways. It’s critical that we make it possible for those interactions to be captured in ways that can be most useful for the contributing institutions, researchers, search engines and the general public alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/historypin2.png\" style=\"width: 593px; height: 330px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.historypin.com/map/#!/geo:38.912609,-77.026068/zoom:15/dialog:25199002/tab:streetview/\">'Auto wreck'</a>, a colourised photo of public domain content, shared and pinned on Historypin.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May, we took an important step towards one of our key goals of diversifying and enriching the holdings of global cultural heritage institutions. Nick Stanhope, CEO of We Are What We Do (the creators of Historypin), said, 'By making metadata on Historypin available as CC0, we’re aligning our metadata licensing with Europeana and other global projects, and joining the effort to maximize the re-use and discovery of cultural heritage assets in a way that everyone can benefit from and build upon.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to continuing on this path with Europeana and the global community engaged in helping make cultural heritage accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Jon Voss is the Historypin Strategic Partnerships Director. Together with global collaborators and the Historypin team, he’s helping to build an open ecosystem of historical data across libraries, archives, and museums worldwide. His innovative work at the intersection of technology and cultural memory is also getting him closer to his childhood dream of perfecting time travel.</i></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana 1989 launched in Warsaw'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana recently launched a new project called 'Europeana 1989'. In the same way that we've been encouraging people with family stories about the First World War to share them by coming to roadshows or uploading them online, we're now asking people with personal experiences of 1989 to do the same. The goal is to create a digital archive of first-hand accounts of the fall of the Iron Curtain and other revolutionary events of 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/5fd0a0fe-0345-41d5-bd2b-d8d64c681d53.png\" style=\"width: 139px; height: 200px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">Europeana 1989 project</a> asks people from every country involved to digitise their own stories, photos, videos and sound recordings of 1989. The result will be a fascinating archive for present and future generations that can be explored for learning, personal interest and research work. Europeana 1989 is collaboration between eleven partner institutions, Historypin and the Europeana Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project kicked off in Warsaw, Poland, on Saturday 8 June. Many Warsovians came to the House of History to share the personal memories and belongings that paint a picture of what the changes in 1989 meant to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/pieces of wall.jpg\" style=\"width: 596px; height: 387px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Original pieces of Berlin Wall. Wir Waren So Frei, Stiftung Deutsche Kinemathek, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The event started with a lively public debate on the importance of preserving the experiences and memories of ordinary people. Each partner country was represented by a project ambassador who played a significant role in the events of 1989 and who will now continue to support and promote Europeana 1989. The project ambassadors are: Sarmīte Ēlerte from Latvia, Vytautas Landsbergis from Lithuania, Tunne Kelam from Estonia, Petr Janyška from the Czech Republic, Wolfgang Templin form Germany and László Rajk from Hungary. Poland is represented by former Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and photographer Chris Niedenthal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/debate.jpg\" style=\"width: 601px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Europeana 1989 ambassadors debate the importance of preserving the experiences of ordinary people.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'The common democratic uprising of the people of central and eastern Europe in 1989 paved the way for the unification of Europe. Europeana 1989 will now bring the personal experiences of these citizens’ movements together, help to transfer the knowledge to younger generations and unite Europe even further,' said Tadeusz Mazowiecki during the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Tadeusz Mazowiecki.jpg\" style=\"width: 601px; height: 400px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Former Prime Minister of Poland, Tadeusz Mazowicki</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the conclusion of the debate, the project ambassadors launched the collection day by sharing their own private memorabilia and stories. People from Warsaw and across Poland then followed suit with personal memorabilia ranging from photos to underground pamphlets, and from a teddy bear up to the biggest object digitised so far: a Polonez car, produced in Poland during the '80s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/teddy.jpg\" style=\"width: 453px; height: 680px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Teddy bear brought to the first Europeana 1989 collection day.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Wikipedia editathon took advantage of the first collectoin day, putting some of the first contributions into context and using them to create new Wikipedia pages or to enrich existing ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All campaigns in the partner countries will highlight important events from 1989. In Poland, for instance the collection days coincide with the anniversary of the first free election; in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, events tie in with the Baltic Way, the biggest peaceful demonstration in history; and in Hungary, events will relate to the actual cutting of the Iron Curtain on the border with Austria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone is welcome to bring their memorabilia of 1989 to collection days, organised by Europeana and the project partners. Bring your photographs, sound and video recordings, leaflets, letters and other memorabilia. Experts will be on hand to make digital copies of these items and to record the stories that go with them for future generations. The next events will be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>14-15 June, 10:00-20:00, Kórnik Library, Działyńskich Palace, Poznan, Stary Rynek 78/79</li>\r\n    <li>21-22 June, 10:00-20:00, European Solidarity Centre, Gdansk, Wały Piastowskie 24</li>\r\n    <li>August 2013 in Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can’t attend one of our events, then you can contribute online. It’s simple. Just register on <a href=\"http://www.europeana1989.eu\">www.europeana1989.eu</a>, upload your items along with the stories that go with them, and pin them to the map of Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep track of what’s going on in the project on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Europeana1989?fref=ts\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Europeana1989\">Twitter</a>.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana GLAMTools publishes Wikimedia Recommendations'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>This blog post was written by Maarten Zeinstra from Kennisland. Kennisland is project partner in the Europeana GLAMTools project.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana GLAM (Galleries/Libraries/Archives/Museums) Wiki Toolset is a collaboration between Europeana, <a href=\"http://www.wikimedia.nl/\">Wikimedia Nederland</a>, <a href=\"http://wikimedia.fr/\">Wikimedia France</a>, <a href=\"https://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia United Kingdom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en\">Kennisland</a>. In this project, a software tool is being developed that will make it as easy as possible for you to put your digitised cultural objects into <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the mediabase of Wikimedia Projects. In parallel, the project has researched what information GLAMS need and want in order to measure the effects of making their collections available on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first half of 2013, we developed a tool that means organisations can mass upload their collection data (public domain or openly licensed content together with its metadata) to Wikimedia Commons. This was already possible but with considerably more effort and custom work so the new tool, which will become more widely available in the second half of this year, makes the task much easier. (<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-wiki-glam-toolset%3A-your-opinion-needed\">Read our blog on the Wiki GLAM Toolset</a>.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is the benefit of uploading collections to Wikimedia? Well, collections from cultural heritage institutions on Wikimedia projects like Wikipedia often see an enormous increase in attention and numbers of views. A <a href=\"http://beeldenvoordetoekomst.nl/nl/news/effectmeting-nationaal-archief-joins-wikipedia%20\">study by Kennisland</a> about a small collection of 1,000 images by the National Archives of the Netherlands showed that the images were accessed over 17,000 times more on Wikipedia than on the institution’s own website. So, by sharing your collections through Wikimedia, you reach a much, much larger audience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"oip_media\">\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<br><span class=\"license\"><a href=\"http://openbeelden.nl/media/13421\">First cooperative freezer in the Alblasserwaard</a>, by <a href=\"http://www.openbeelden.nl/users/beeldengeluid\">Polygoon-Profilti (producer) / Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision (curator)</a>, is licensed under <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\">Creative Commons – Attribution-Share Alike</a>.</span>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><i>This video about refrigeration is from the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision and made available through the Open Images project. It is available on <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/2021601/1A452C01555D027EB9A05B1B2927E0D46DB73591.html\">Europeana</a> and on <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eerste_co%C3%B6peratieve_diepvrieskluis_in_de_Alblasserwaard_Weeknummer,_56-25_-_Open_Beelden_-_13421.ogv\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. The video has been used on Wikimedia pages about refrigeration in <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BChlschrank\">German</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator\">English</a>. The Wiki pages have been viewed over 4.5 million times.</i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to have access to statistics about the use and re-use of your collections on Wikimedia projects. We have written a recommendation report for the Wikimedia analytics team which suggests that they implement a series of openly available statistical tools to make more accessible and comparable figures available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/GlamWikiReportgraph.jpg\" style=\"width: 565px; height: 206px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Example of the type of information the report recommends making available. In this graph, GLAMS could see the number of views that their collections have received on Wikimedia month by month.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of May, we presented this report to the Wikimedia analytics team, who will now review these requirements and integrate them into their own analytics systems. This report is an important step in gathering evidence about what involvement in Wikimedia projects can mean for the access and reach of cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/uploads/fckconnector/d0342958-7aad-4882-83d4-28143bcefc84\">Download 'Report on Requirements for Usage and Re-use Statistics for GLAM Content'</a></p>"

        body: "<p><em>Do you follow the <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918.eu blog</a>? Here's the latest news about the series of Family History Roadshows held in Italy.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows continued their tour of Italy in May, with events on 15 May at the Rome National Central Library, and on 18 May at Valli del Pasubio in the striking location of Monte Maso Fort. The Rome event was organised in collaboration with the Central Institute for the Single Directory of Italian Libraries of MIbAC (Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities) and with the support of the National Museum of the Italian Renaissance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/6542223a-bbe9-4708-9c3f-05c96fe67312.jpg\" style=\"width: 602px; height: 451px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Monte Maso Fort, Italy- venue for a Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many members of the public contributed their personal stories and brought their families’ letters, diaries, notebooks, photographs and medals from the battle front. Among them were the story of a man who was saved by a gold medal that stopped a bullet, and the tale of a mother who, having woken in the middle of the night with a feeling of terror, found out that her son was killed by a grenade at the time she woke up. Among the memorabilia there was also a touching letter written from the front in which a man gave the custody of his three-year-old child to his brother, and other letters sent from a soldier to his wife, in which he signaled his position on the back of the stamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Rome, we collected over 70 stories and more than 600 files to illustrate them, whilst in Valli del Pasubio, 40 personal stories and 150 items gave us over 1,800 images to do with the First World War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Roma_Europeana_DSC_8990 blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 590px; height: 362px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Roma_Europeana_DSC_8986 blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 594px; height: 439px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Photography items collected at the Rome Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also had the opportunity to hold an educational seminar about the use of First World War digital archives. The seminar, aimed at schools, got the web generation involved in preserving historical memories through the use of new technologies, and engaged them in contributing to Europeana 1914-1918, the Europe-wide archive of a unique and important period of world history.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Tech Task Force Report: EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>A <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/project/edm-frbroo-application-profile\">EuropeanaTech Task Force</a> has been working to reconcile library concepts with those found in the data model developed by Europeana. The outcome is presented in a new report - <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/EuropeanaTech/EuropeanaTech_taskforces/EDM_FRBRoo//TaskfoApplication%20Profile%20EDM-FRBRoo.pdf\"><i>EDM – FRBRoo Application Profile Task Force</i></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Task Force was established following the recommendations of one of the final deliverables (D3.4 - Final Technical &amp; Logical Architecture and future work recommendations) from the Europeana Version 1 project. The library domain is familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records\">Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)</a> concepts of Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item, (WEMI) and their treatment as independent entities in the <a href=\"http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbr_inro.html\">FRBR object-oriented model (FRBRoo)</a>. The Task Force has produced an application profile of FRBRoo showing how these entities can be represented in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/9c0e26db-4821-43fa-b771-2af962a249dd.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 267px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The WEMI hierarchy mapped to EDM classes (available in the report).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of the Task Force was based on existing datasets which were mapped to FRBRoo and EDM. The report provides the principles behind the modelling and the mapping rules based on the data examples. The resulting application profile details the classes and properties that can be mapped directly and those that should be introduced as specialisations in EDM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Hamlet_examples_Page_01.jpg\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 345px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example based on the work 'Hamlet' by Shakespeare (available in the report).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report has been produced by the collaborative efforts of institutions who work with Europeana. Thanks go to the chairs, Stefan Gradmann (KU Leuven) and Martin Doerr (ICS-FORTH), and all the members of the Task Force for their contributions to the report.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>We are delighted to announce that we have launched Europeana's first free iPad app. 'Europeana Open Culture' introduces the public to hand-picked and beautiful collections from some of Europe's top institutions, and allows people to explore, share and comment on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed by Glimworm IT during a <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/hackathons\">Europeana hackathon</a>, the app provides an easy introduction to Europe's glorious art treasury through five specially curated themes: Maps and Plans, Treasures of Art, Treasures of the Past, Treasures of Nature and Images of the Past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/2d056458-e515-44b9-8dbe-61bc3d48d2aa\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/068d0d37-88a1-4086-861a-4cc411a46ce3\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The home screen and an item's details on the Europeana Open Culture app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana Open Culture presents stunning visual collections from Europeana.eu with large images - great for those smaller details - and a 'comment' option that opens up the possibility for dialogue between many people exploring the same images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Europeana Executive Director says:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>We're really pleased to launch the first ever Europeana app. By downloading Europeana Open Culture, more people can now explore, share and have fun with Europe's cultural heritage. It's only a small snapshot of the whole of Europeana's collections but small is beautiful. We're enthusiastic and excited about the 'Connect' feature which you can use to link images to articles elsewhere on the web, or to content in Wikipedia. And for the first time, you can make your own comments on the individual images.'</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/1b8e51fd-44b8-4872-87c4-16ebf67260bb\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/89999/911c615c-f8ea-427c-99f9-c7e83d4cb0c5\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring and filtering results on the Europeana Open Culture app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 350,000 images available through the app come from collections as diverse as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh, UK</li>\r\n    <li>Rijksmuseum, The Netherlands</li>\r\n    <li>National Library of Poland</li>\r\n    <li>The Archaeological Museum, Portugal</li>\r\n    <li>Bulgarian Academy of Sciences</li>\r\n    <li>Digital Library of the Spanish Ministry of Defence</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you've downloaded the free app, start exploring by entering a keyword in the search field or by selecting one of the five themes. Tap a thumbnail to view the image in full resolution, read other users' comments, post your own impressions and connect the image to other relevant pages on the web (for instance, Wikipedia). You can also add the image to your favourites and create your own personal museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All images included are either in the public domain or are openly licensed which means they can be used for any purpose, for example in a school project or a thesis, in a presentation to your local history society, on blogs, Wikipedia, or even commercially. What's more, Glimworm IT have released the open source code behind the app, meaning that developers can get hold of it, use it and experiment with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Manwaring, Creative Director of Glimworm IT, commented:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started work on an interactive museum idea at the Europeana hackathon in Leuven, which became Muse Open Source - a free software platform. We then released the Muse app for the Rijksmuseum. After this success, Europeana asked us to create an app for them - they wanted something open source so that other developers could build on it. We were delighted that they really got the idea of using an app to make digital libraries and archives fun and accessible. We are really happy that the new Europeana app is helping people to enjoy culture in new ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on how the app works, go to <a href=\"http://muse-opensource.org/\">http://muse-opensource.org/</a>. Those interested in the code can check the <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki\">GitHub repository</a> and provide their feedback to <a href=\"mailto:api@europeana.eu\">api@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/europeana/id646414251\">Download the app from iTunes</a> and start your cultural treasure hunt!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What language is the app available in?</strong><br />\r\nThe interface is in English, but the collections are in their original languages: English, Dutch, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Bulgarian and Latin!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What operating system is the app available in?</strong><br />\r\nApple for iPad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I get the app on Android?</strong><br />\r\nRight now it's only available for Apple iOS but the code is open source, meaning that others can develop it as they choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I get the app on my iPhone or iPod?</strong><br />\r\nRight now it's only available for iPad but the code is open source, meaning that others can develop it as they choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I use the images for my project?</strong><br />\r\nYes. All the images in the app are public domain or openly licensed and so available for re-use, both commercially and non-commercially. Tap the 'Rights' link in an image's details to learn whether it is in the public domain or is licensed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where can I find the source code?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki\">https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where can I download the app?</strong><br />\r\nDownload the app from iTunes: <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/europeana/id646414251\">itunes.apple.com/nl/app/europeana/id646414251</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The contributing collections are: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Biblioteca Virtual del Ministerio de Defensa, Spain</li>\r\n    <li>Biblioteca Valenciana Digital, Spain</li>\r\n    <li>Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliografico, Spain</li>\r\n    <li>Biblioteka Narodowa, Poland</li>\r\n    <li>Catálogo Colectivo de la Red de Bibliotecas de los Archivos Estatales, Spain</li>\r\n    <li>Central Library of Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Bulgaria</li>\r\n    <li>Central Library of Fondo Fotográfico de la Universidad de Navarra, Spain</li>\r\n    <li>Institute of Balkan Studies and Thracology, Bulgaria</li>\r\n    <li>Museu Nacional de Arqueologia, Portugal</li>\r\n    <li>Rijksmuseum, The Netherlands</li>\r\n    <li>The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, UK</li>\r\n    <li>University of Tartu - Museum of Geology, Estonia</li>\r\n    <li>University of Tartu - Natural History Museum, Estonia</li>\r\n</ul>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Have you seen our round-up of the Europeana Network's 2012 achievements yet? The <i>Annual Report and Accounts 2012</i> celebrates a significant year for the Europeana ecosystem and the world of digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/Images/Publication_thumbnails/Annual-Report-and-Accounts-2012.jpg\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 353px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Read the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/99cea5ba-46ce-4037-a913-a9c81080079b\">Europeana Annual Report and Accounts 2012</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the foreword to the report, Europeana Executive Director Jill Cousins says: '2012 was a year in which content providers and aggregators to Europeana fundamentally changed the world of digital cultural heritage. By releasing all Europeana metadata under a Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication (CC0), it became possible for anyone and everyone to re-use it either commercially or non-commercially. This is the first time a move of this magnitude has been made anywhere in the world, and was the result of intensive advocacy, legal work and engagement with partners and the Europeana Network.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/1963 - Il presidente Kennedy in trattoria a Roma blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 343px; height: 457px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Example of some of the new content ingested in 2012: ‘1963 - Il presidente Kennedy in trattoria a Roma’, courtesy of ANSA, EURO-Photo.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launching Europe’s unrivalled cultural dataset under CC0 changed the rules that have governed cultural heritage data for decades. This has been the single most radical achievement of the project so far, and paves the way for innovation by SMEs and the digital research community. Above all, in the words of Commissioner Neelie Kroes, this puts cultural heritage in a position to ‘maximise the sector’s contribution to Europe’s recovery’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/3d glasses for blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 291px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Ministers don 3D glasses for a demo of the Europeana eCloud at a Europeana Awareness event in May 2012</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report charts the progress made against the objectives of 2012 as set out in the <i><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/c0c6e31f-5174-4898-9771-f9b9a8d1d4d7\">Europeana Business Plan 2012</a></i>. Highlights include: increasing Europeana Network membership by 55%; achieving a 'good' rating for both major projects coordinated by the Europeana Foundation - Europeana Awareness and Europeana Version 2; achieving fantastic media coverage for the Europeana 1914-1918 PR campaigns running under Europeana Awareness; a series of successful hackathons and over 500 requests to use the Europeana API; increasing social media presence, including collaborations with partners on Pinterest; launching new virtual exhibitions including one in partnership with the Digital Public Library of America - <a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\">Leaving Europe: A new life in America</a>; huge improvements to search engine optimisation and the quality of metadata held in Europeana; and a total rebuild of Europeana to work with the Europeana Data Model ensuring the ability to deliver hierarchical and truly semantically related results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Dublin roadshow 2 blog.jpg\" style=\"width: 472px; height: 313px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Crowds wait at the Dublin Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshow</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking forward, Jill says, 'What has been, up to now, largely an aggregation project is now moving to face outwards, engaging people with their heritage, promoting the exchange of ideas and information, delivering value for content providers, and contributing to a thriving knowledge economy. We are building momentum fast; we are building a movement. I would like to take this opportunity to thank every single person involved in every project, every aggregation scheme, every hackathon, every workshop and every discussion because without you, the achievements of 2012 would not have been possible. Thank you.'</p>"

        body: "<p><i>By Sam Leon, Open Knowledge Foundation.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dm2e.eu\"> DM2E (Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana)</a> project team is pleased to announce that Pundit, a semantic annotation being developed for humanities researchers, has reached the final of the <a href=\"http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/\">LODLAM Challenge</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://lodlam.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Lodlam-header-mock-ups.png\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge is part of the <a href=\"http://summit2013.lodlam.net/\">Linked Open Data in Libraries, Archives, and Museums Summit ('LODLAM Summit')</a> which brings together leaders in their respective areas of expertise from the humanities and sciences to set in motion practical, actionable approaches to publishing and consuming Linked Open Data. This year, the Summit will be held in Montreal, Canada from 19-20 June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DM2E entered Pundit into the challenge for creating data visualisations, tools or mash-ups that use Linked Open Data in libraries, archives, and museums. The Pundit team will now receive grants to go the the LODLAM Summit in Montreal and have the opportunity to to compete for the top cash prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DM2E project has been working hard to develop a suite of tools specifically for scholars working with digitised manuscripts in Europeana. Pundit is the backbone of this suite and it allows researchers working over multiple texts to connect and contextualise these digital resources using Linked Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team behind Pundit made a fantastic video to accompany their application to the LODLAM Challenge:</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6uUQ4f3z_E0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish them all the best in Montreal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more info on Pundit and to find out how to deploy it yourself visit <a href=\"http://thepund.it\">thepund.it</a>.

        title: 'Taking design lessons from the Rijksmuseum'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: ''
        body: "<p>In April of this year, a major event in the cultural life of the Netherlands took place - the <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en\">Rijksmuseum</a> in Amsterdam reopened after more than a decade of renovation and reconstruction. The Rijksmuseum boasts one of the most monumental art collections in the world, but I don't want to talk about that! In this blog I want to talk about the building itself, its long history, and in particular the fascinating renovation process that has just been completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rijksmuseum was designed by the famous and prolific Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers and opened to public in 1885. Cuypers’ original design is considered an architectural gem due to the clear relation of structure and function, the unique combination of different architectural styles, and the many innovative solutions, such as the underpass that went through the building from the north to south side. However, from its very inception, the building faced problems. Cuypers’ plan to position two entrances in <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92034/938F18B341962C3E44FEF24A9B42B39098BFE79F.html\">the underpass</a> was abandoned because of pressure from Amsterdam City Council which insisted on the entrances being located on the northern side of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/blogimages/fb959374-1cc1-46a9-b6bc-000368249ee5.jpg\" style=\"width: 330px; height: 503px;\">\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/C0F8FC7A40B87C2663EF6A1842A1B11DF5E0985E.html\">Portret van P.J.H. Cuypers</a>', Rijksmuseum, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wasn't the only deviation from the original design. Right up until it closed for renovation in 2003, the building had been continuously undergoing changes - new internal and external additions were introduced, spaces were filled in and internal layouts were altered. The building has always been a 'work-in-progress' - something that has done no good for the museum's image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/rijks.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 364px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200166/EE87DB69A9786A9512E928627904CA62A015CF27.html\">Amsterdam, Rijks-Museum</a>', Zentralbibliothek Zürich and The European Library, CC0</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building acquired a reputation for being unfriendly on the outside and extremely complicated on the inside. The decision to locate entrances outside the underpass resulted in generations of faithful <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2022007/C969626B148C0CD4BB2EA41CDA9D1A9BD1D46295.html\">visitors queuing outside</a> at the mercy of the not always merciful Amsterdam weather. After the inner courtyards, designed by Cuypers as the ‘lungs of the museum' providing it with space and air, were filled in, it became notoriously difficult to find one’s way even to the most famous Dutch paintings, let alone to the ‘ordinary’ collections. One of the museum directors himself verified this by following an occasional visitor, reaching the sad conclusion that the quickest way to get to Vermeers was to have a personal guide. According to the chief architect, the need to make the museum more organised and easier to understand became clear to everyone by the beginning of the new century. The gradual uncontrolled deviation from the original Cuypers’ design finally brought about the need for a total renovation of the Rijksmuseum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Cuypers2.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 366px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020704/B85D3B630C55D2BEE066010241B1DE07799043EA.html\">Portret van architect Pierre (dr. P.J.M.) Cuypers</a>', Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed and CARARE, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Running an art institution of the scale of a national museum, like the Rijksmuseum, is a tremendously complex venture, for which the demands of many must be satisfied: the public, national authorities, local authorities, art community, media. And all this should be done within one edifice with its own original design reflecting the creator’s vision as well as the mundane and practical needs of a public building, its entrances, exits and restrooms. From my first visit to the reopened Rijksmuseum, I believe it has finally achieved it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what can we learn from this process? The craft of managing digital cultural collections is relatively young, but as everything digital it develops fast. It is too early to draw across-the-board comparisons between institutions caring for digital collections, like Europeana, and pantheons of national art like the Rijksmuseum. But some concrete parallels do exist and the digital should learn its lessons from the non-digital. A digital collection must be curated, organised, annotated and presented to a visitor just like a 'real life' one. Overloaded museum halls, like the ones seen in the Rijksmuseum before the renovation, are as poor an experience for a museum visitor as crowded web pages are for a website user. Inconvenient orientation in a museum space undermines the ability of the visitor to appreciate the richness of its collection in the same way as poorly designed navigation across a website runs the risk that some important materials will not be found. A clear design of a museum interior with its halls and corridors is as important as a clear design of a website with its individual pages and links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europeana, we host an impressive collection of 27 million cultural objects but we try to be sensitive to the importance of clearly designed halls and passages of our museum. A new design was recently rolled out and more improvements are under way. We hold evaluations by end-user groups to get a feeling of how a visitor feels in our virtual space. We are aware that it is probably a never-ending process; the good news is that changing a layout of a web page is much quicker than doing construction work in a museum. And we can always call by at the renovated Rijksmuseum for some inspiration!</p>\r\n"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>By Lars Wieneke, Researcher at Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, Time magazine declared 'You', the individual content creator on the internet, as its '<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_%28Time_Person_of_the_Year%29\">Person of the Year</a>'. While Time didn't invent user-generated content, the accolade brought public attention to the effort of individual volunteers that have invested millions of hours of work on building large-scale repositories for video (YouTube), images (Flickr) and knowledge (Wikipedia). Since then, user-generated content (UGC) has become part of our everyday lives. Some of us now naturally create and share our stories and experiences with each other through UGC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very often this creation takes place outside of the institutional framework but some memory institutions have found ways and means to make user contributions a meaningful part of their mission. The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/task-forces/overview#UGC2\">Europeana Network Task Force on Understanding the Role of User-Generated Content in Europeana</a>, which has nine members, wants to gather these experiences to encourage a discussion at the Network level about the role and relevance of user-generated content, the obvious and hidden challenges of its application and potential future ecosystems that could be shared between all members of the Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"UGC Task Force meeting\" src=\"/files/blogimages/UGC TF workshop.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 165px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>User-Generated Content Task Force meeting, Hilversum, The Netherlands</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a first part of this mission, we invite you to fill in a short survey so that we can find out more about the status quo of user-generated content. Who uses it and how? Who doesn't use it and why not? What can we learn from each other and what kind of services could the Europeana Network offer to turn user-generated content into a true asset for its stakeholders?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/UGC survey.png\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 382px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://goo.gl/8CEig\">Take the survey now!</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey launched at the beginning of May and so far more than 20 institutions have responded, showing a great diversity of uses. In the next phase of our Task Force, we will conduct individual interviews with members who want to share their best practices. Then in autumn this year, look out for the results! We will share them on the <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=4143376&amp;trk=myg_ugrp_ovr\">Europeana Network LinkedIn</a> page, this blog and during the Europeana Network Annual General Meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey is open until 28 May and takes less than 8 minutes to complete. Even if you have no experience with user-generated content, your voice is important to us, as we also want to find out more about the obstacles and concerns regarding UGC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://goo.gl/8CEig\">Take the survey now!</a></p>"

        body: "<p>We are now halfway through the Wiki Loves Public Art photo contest, which runs throughout May 2013. Volunteers in Austria, Finland, Israel, Spain and Sweden have taken over 5,000 pictures of a total of 1,385 public artworks! All of these photos are uploaded under a free licence, so that they can be used, for example, in online projects such as Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/e30d04e7-3003-4345-a2b0-af9d38a1f86f.jpg\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 125px;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/wikimedia%20sweden.png\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 150px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of the Wiki Loves Public Art (WLPA) contest is to get as many pictures of public art as possible available under a free licence on Wikipedia’s online database, Wikimedia Commons. The 5,000 photos uploaded so far can then be seen and used by anyone, anywhere. At the same time, the world’s sixth largest website, Wikipedia, will see a boost in its art coverage as photos in the contest can be added to illustrate articles in the online encyclopedia. The contest is organised by Wikimedia Sverige, Europeana and volunteers in the Wikimedia chapters and affiliated groups in each of the participating countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Paparazzi_In_Bratislava.jpg\" style=\"width: 256px; height: 485px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'Paparazzi statue in Bratislava', photograph by DMY, CC-BY.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>'We are doing this to increase our common collection of photos of artworks and to make them easily accessible to everyone through Wikipedia. This is also a fun way to start contributing for volunteers', says the international WLPA coordinator, John Andersson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contest has been challenging to organise because most countries lack a national database of their artworks. In addition, the countries participating in the contest have a diverse set of copyright laws, which means that the public artworks that can be photographed and uploaded online for the contest differ between countries. For example, in Finland the contest focuses on outdoor sculptures made by artists who have been dead for 70 years or more. In Spain and Austria, on the other hand, any public artwork can be photographed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'This has also made a difference to the amount of artworks photographed in different local contests. From Barcelona we have over 4,000 pictures, whereas from countries with stricter copyright laws we understandably have fewer contributions', states John Andersson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make it easier for people to find the artworks suited for the contest, volunteers in national Wikimedia chapters have put together lists on Wikipedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The photos uploaded for the contest will first be judged nationally, and the ten best pictures from each country will be sent to the international jury. The prizes for the three internationally best pictures – which will be announced in July – are travel gift certificates for 500 euros, 300 euros and 200 euros and on top of that Europeana has sponsored high quality prints of the winning pictures that will be sent to the winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enter, go to <a href=\"http://www.wikilovespublicart.com\">wikilovespublicart.com.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, contact John Andersson, Wikimedia Sverige, by phone: +46 (0)733965189 or email: john.andersson@wikimedia.se</p>"

        title: 'Spotlight on PRELIDA - Preserving Linked Data'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Today's blog introduces you to a great European Commission-funded project called Preserving Linked Data, or 'PRELIDA' for short. The project launched in January this year and is now looking forward to its first major working group meeting in June. A great opportunity, we thought, to tell you what it's all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project aims to build bridges across the digital preservation and linked data communities, with the view of</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>making the linked data community aware of existing outcomes of the digital preservation community; and</li>\r\n    <li>working out the challenges of preserving linked data, posing new research questions for the preservation community, and developing a roadmap for addressing them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/Images/Project_logos/Prelida.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 300px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheer amount of data offered and consumed on the internet, and the volume of data being digitally stored and exchanged, is growing exponentially. This generates the potential for many new types of products and services, and a whole new industry implementing services on top of large data streams. The impact of this emerging economic sector - the data economy - may soon outrank the current importance of the software industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlo Meghini, project coordinator and long-standing partner on Europeana projects, says, 'An important part of the data economy is the linked data movement, which is about using the web to connect related data that was previously not linked, or using the web to lower the barriers to linking data. With the increasing adoption of the linked data paradigm by governments and organisations, the requirements in terms of quality, usability and maturity increase. In order to continue to develop and increase uptake of linked data as a platform for publishing open data, we need to address the issues surrounding preserving linked data. For example, they are different to other data sets in that they are in RDF, they use URIs as identifiers, and they rely on shared vocabularies. Whilst these are all good features of linked data, they are likely to create preservation problems that other types of data do not have.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Carlo Meghini.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 395px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Carlo Meghini, project coordinator. Image taken from a <a href=\"http://www.casparpreserves.eu/training/advanced-digital-preservation-training-lectures/16.html\">video lecture by Carlo</a> on data preservation.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PRELIDA team is convinced that the preservation problem of linked data can only be solved satisfactorily if the digital preservation and linked data communities come together with their complementary skills and technologies. So an important task of PRELIDA is to raise awareness of existing preservation solutions and to facilitate their uptake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project will produce a report on the current state of linked data and its preservation needs, and will develop a roadmap focusing on the most promising research paths, and the resulting problems to be addressed. This research will drive the scientific and technological development of the field, as well as future research programmes that the European Commission may wish to fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges of preserving linked data are expected to be related to intrinsic features of linked data, including their structuring, interlinking, dynamicity and distribution. PRELIDA will implement its aims through a coherent collection of activities, including a working group, open consultations, holding three dedicated workshops, two summer schools, and a broad dissemination action, addressing the scientific community, technology providers, key user groups, and policy-makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main partners for the project are <a href=\"http://www.isti.cnr.it/\">CNR-ISTI</a> (Italian National Research Council of the Institute of Science and Information Technology), <a href=\"http://www.alliancepermanentaccess.org/\">APA</a> (the Alliance for Permanent Access), <a href=\"http://www.hud.ac.uk/\">the University of Huddersfield</a> in the UK and the <a href=\"http://www.uibk.ac.at/\">University of Innsbruck</a> in Austria. As a leader in linked data thinking, Europeana is involved with PRELIDA in a sub-contracting capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of PRELIDA are looking forward to the first workshop of their working group. The group is made up of around 20 world experts and has been formed to help PRELIDA achieve its goals. It will meet three times during the course of the project. The first meeting takes place in Tirrenia, Italy on 25-27 June. Then in September, the project will be represented at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESWC_SumSchool\">European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) Summer School</a> in Kalamaki, Crete, running seminars on the topic of preserving linked data. We look forward to reporting on the discussions and developments that come out of these events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on PRELIDA, go to their <a href=\"http://prelida.sti2.org\">website</a> or follow them on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/prelida_project\">@Prelida_Project</a></p>"

        title: 'Hack4LTL: first Cultural Heritage & Digital Humanities hackathon in Lithuania'
        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>By Ingrida Vosyliūtė, Coordinator of Hack4LT and Project Manager at Vilnius University Faculty of Communication.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kf.vu.lt/en\">Vilnius University Faculty of Communication</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mb.vu.lt/\">Vilnius University Library</a> recently hosted the first cultural heritage and digital humanities hackathon in Lithuania - <a href=\"http://www.kf.vu.lt/en/hack4lt\">Hack4LT</a>. The event was inspired by Lithuania's co-operation with both <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> with its significant multilingual online collection of digitised cultural heritage, and <a href=\"http://www.dariah.eu/\">DARIAH</a>: Digital Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities, a major European digital humanities network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2-day event took place in a recently opened <a href=\"http://www.mkic.mb.vu.lt/en/nauda/\">National Open Access Scholarly Communication and Information Centre</a> – the most modern library in the Baltic countries. It started symbolically on 4 April, also known as the day of St. Isidore of Seville, who is a declared patron of the internet, computers and computer users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/0d0da533-52ef-440d-8836-a5e552b4df59.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Hacking is fun! Photo - Darius Verseckas.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hack4LT aimed to foster collaboration between scholars of digital humanities and software developers. The event encouraged technology-driven experimentation with existing Europeana datasets. Open access to this resource stimulates a broad public interest in European culture and challenges cultural institutions to seek new ways of engaging people and developing innovative tools. Because of the richness of Europeana's collections and the nature of preserved digital content, it is a valuable data source for digital humanities researchers and can enhance digitally-enabled research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hackathon brought together 20 young software developers, who were encouraged to try out their ideas for creative re-use of Europeana content in order to build applications showcasing the social and scholastic value of open cultural data. Two 500 EUR prizes were available for the best prototypes meeting the needs of digital humanities and the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Darius-Verseckas.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Dr E. Champion from DARIAH with the 'Manuscript' team, Digital Humanities category winners. Photo - Darius Verseckas.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hackers formed small teams and worked on ideas they had discussed beforehand. Hacking ran till late in the evening with a few enthusiasts staying awake all night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2 days of hacking resulted in 3 prototypes. After presentations of the results on the second day, the prototypes were judged by the jury of 7 experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best prototype in the digital humanities category was ‘Crowdhwr’, developed by team ‘Manuscript’ (A. Gimbutas, J. Sadzevičius &amp; M. Zimnickas). They created a crowdsourcing manuscript transcription system, tested using examples from Europeana. The prototype allows users to mark words in a digitised manuscript and prepare it for analysis. The winners were happy with the results and are planning to continue developing this prototype. Their goal is to create a tool allowing users to convert image to text in order to perform automatic search of a manuscript’s content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best prototype in the general public category was ‘Gamepad 2.0’, developed by team ‘CodeUnited’ (S. Mikalonis, K. Rutkauskas, M. Sorokin &amp; M. Ūba). The team created a fun, educational quiz game, which uses Europeana data to generate questions, concerning various aspects of Lithuanian history, art and culture. The quiz encourages players to compete with each other by giving answers in a limited amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Darius-Verseckas_1.jpg\" style=\"width: 511px; height: 417px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'CodeUnited' team, the winners in the General Public category. Photo - Darius Verseckas.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A consolation prize was also given to the third prototype developed by I. Bačius, M. Baranauskas, J. Jaronis &amp; I. Pliavgo. They created a Europeana plugin, which can be set up in databases and web portals that use the <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a> framework. While using an existing search of digital objects, the plugin links the search with Europeana's data and shows similar results found on the Europeana portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Darius-Verseckas_2.jpg\" style=\"width: 505px; height: 337px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Hack4LT participants with the rector of Vilnius University, prof. habil. dr. J. Banys (centre). Photo - Darius Verseckas.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rector of Vilnius University, prof. habil. dr. J. Banys, congratulated the participants of Hack4LT saying: ‘You are a revolutionary part of our society, having so many great and fresh ideas. I am glad that these ideas matter. Moreover I hope there will be more of them in the future.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Follow Hack4LT on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/hack4lt\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Hack4LT\">Facebook</a> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.331623366965977.1073741830.300253576769623&amp;type=1\">Browse Hack4LT's photo gallery</a></b></p>"

        intro: "<p>Last week, EuropeanaTech released two major new documents. Today's blog looks at the work and the people behind one of them, interviewing Maarten Brinkerink and Marlies Olensky.</p>\r\n"
        body: "<p>First of all though - a quick look at the two new documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first, titled, '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Version2/Deliverables/Ev2%20D7.2%20Report%20of%20Inventory%20of%20FLOSS%20Documentation%20and%20Sustainability.pdf\">Core Inventory of FLOSS in the Cultural Heritage Domain, second iteration</a>' analyses the Free/Libre and Open-Source Software landscape and provides a baseline for the development of innovative applications in the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second, called '<a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Projects/Project_list/Europeana_Version2/Deliverables/D7.5-%20Functional%20specifications%20for%20social%20semantic%20functions.pdf\">Functional specifications for social semantic functions</a>' is the first step in a process of building two prototypes that will articulate user-generated metadata with semantic functions in Europeana v2.0's R&amp;D work package. It provides functional specifications and a description of prototypes. To find out what that's all about, we've spoken to two of the minds behind it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/9757b024-b25b-4d31-ad46-534ddd834e11.jpg\" style=\"width: 298px; height: 295px;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Marlies%20Olensky.jpg\" style=\"width: 234px; height: 295px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Maarten Brinkerink and Marlies Olensky</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your day-to-day role/where do you work?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: I'm a project manager for Research &amp; Development at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, mainly working on projects that aim to provide meaningful access to digitised audiovisual heritage.<br>\r\nMarlies: I'm a researcher at the Berlin School of Library and Information Science (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin) where I work on the Europeana v2.0 project. I've previously been involved in another Europeana project: Europeana Connect where I worked on the semantic data layer (2009-2011). I'm also doing my PhD, which is not related to cultural heritage but is about data quality in bibliometric studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your involvement with Europeana?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: For the Europeana v2.0 project, Sound and Vision works on several tasks within the 'innovation' work package, including one on the developers' network and FLOSS inventory and one on the development of innovative apps. The aim of the work package is to foster a research and development community around Europeana, to stimulate innovation that benefits the projects, Europeana Network and the broader cultural heritage domain.<br>\r\nMarlies: Like Sound and Vision, Humboldt University is a partner in the innovation work package, responsible for the Semantic Web &amp; Linked Data and multilinguality tasks. The aim of the Semantic Web &amp; Linked Data task is to make Europeana more 'semantics aware' and to integrate it into the emerging paradigm of Linked (Open) Data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Tell us about the 'Functional specifications for social semantic functions' work. What problem are you trying to solve?</b><br>\r\nMarlies: The aim of the task was to demonstrate and try out some options for social semantic web functions that could be useful for Europeana. The semantic web is basically the idea of turning the web into a web of data that can be processed by machines, so it adds machine-readable metadata to human-readable web documents. The social part here means that we would like to employ the users to make this vision happen. In other words, we looked for ideas for what or how the user can contribute to existing content by tagging, correcting, or organising objects or their metadata. So, we tried to come up with innovative functionality that can be tested out using the prototype tools we developed.<br>\r\nMaarten: The functional specifications for social semantic functions and prototype code builds on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/beeldengeluid.nl/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ag_7rVJwt0CpdFRJOEJxdEk4ZEMxQ01jaDgxQXFSTkE#gid=0\">earlier research</a> done within the work packages on identifying open source tools for the cultural heritage domain (led by Sound and Vision) and the social semantic web (lead by Humboldt). It describes how two selected open source tools (the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeldengeluid/waisda\">Waisda?</a> Video Labelling Game and <a href=\"http://crowdcrafting.org/about\">Crowdcrafting</a>) can be further developed to support metadata enrichment via crowdsourcing. Waisda? is a crowdsourcing video annotation platform that has been released as an open source framework by Sound and Vision. Crowdcrafting/PyBossa is a platform for creating and running crowdsourcing applications that utilise online assistance in performing tasks that require human cognition, knowledge or intelligence such as image classification, transcription, geocoding and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/PyBossa_24.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 318px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Screenshot from Crowdcrafting/PyBossa</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What was your involvement in this work?</b><br>\r\nMarlies: In the beginning, I researched what social semantic web solutions are already out there. Then we had several brainstorming sessions to discuss possible functionalities for the two selected tools. We had a very good and close cooperation between Maarten and his colleagues at Sound &amp; Vision and myself which in the end led to a very satisfying document on functional specifications. Sound &amp; Vision was then responsible for developing the prototypes.<br>\r\nMaarten: Sound and Vision supported Humboldt University in writing the functional specification and further developed the tools in the form of prototypes that showcase the functionality that is described in the deliverable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What challenges did you encounter?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: When setting up these open source tools for datasets on Europeana, we noticed that only a few data providers are linking out to their digital objects in their metadata. We set out to make tools that could actually present rich content - instead of only metadata - to the users during the crowdsourcing tasks. Another challenge was to find suitable controlled vocabularies to support users in describing the material. Ideally, these vocabularies should fit with the content, be available in <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/\">SKOS</a>, be licensed for free re-use and be multilingual.<br>\r\nMarlies: For me, the main challenge was the one Maarten already mentioned: As we (along with data providers) employ controlled vocabularies to describe the information objects in a standardised way so as to make them retrievable. It was important to find suitable ones that match the terms that users would want to use to describe objects. Another challenge was narrowing down the functionality options we wanted to try out first and identifying those that seemed most feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What have you achieved?</b><br>\r\nMarlies: Well, I think we've created an important showcase by demonstrating what kind of social semantic web functions could be leveraged to improve or augment Europeana content.<br>\r\nMaarten: By creating prototypes based on the functional specifications written by Humboldt, Sound and Vision was able to further develop two crowdsourcing tools, enhancing the opportunities to re-use them in the Europeana context. As a result of this work, it is now relatively easy for Europeana data providers and/or projects to set up their own instance of either or both tools. A European data importer was built for both tools, using the Europeana API, so others will be able to set up their own crowdsourcing tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What are the next steps?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: Next we will further develop the prototypes to encompass all functionality that is described in the report and make the code available to the Europeana Tech community, allowing for Europeana projects and data providers to set up their own instances of the tools to enrich their metadata via crowdsourcing. The European Film Gateway has already shown interest in re-using the <a href=\"https://github.com/beeldengeluid/waisda\">Waisda?</a> Video Labelling Game technology.<br>\r\nMarlies: Indeed, and Humboldt will support Sound &amp; Vision in this second development phase where needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Waisda.png\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 495px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Screenshot from Waisda?</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What response are you looking for from readers?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: We look forward to feedback on the specifications, suggestions on further developing the prototypes and pointers to controlled vocabularies that could be used for a next iteration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How can people contact you with their feedback?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: They can send me a message through Twitter: <a href=\"www.twitter.com/mbrinkerink\">@mbrinkerink</a> or drop me a line at mbrinkerink [at] beeldengeluid [dot] nl.<br>\r\nMarlies: You can get in touch with me at marlies [dot] olensky [at] ibi [dot] hu-berlin [dot] de.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Finally, a little something beyond Europeana. What do you do when you're not working?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: When I'm not working I <a href=\"http://maartenbrinkerink.net/music/\">write and record music</a>. I used to perform quite a bit as well, but I'm currently in between bands. I'm also a volunteer for Wikimedia Netherlands, helping them to join forces with cultural organisations.<br>\r\nMarlies: At the moment, I don't have much free time, as most of my time is dedicated to my PhD research. But I do need some balance which I find in travelling, practising yoga and spending time with my family and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>What is your favourite item from Europeana?</b><br>\r\nMaarten: <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/90402/18B27E0B0BE485841E31A57093650D3431F36444.html\">'Het melkmeisje' by Vermeer.</a> I chose this item not only because is it is a visually compelling and quite iconic piece of art. But for me it is also a best-practice example of how cultural heritage is accessible through Europeana. The Rijksmuseum has really raised the bar for providing open access to art collections on an international level. Their metadata is available through an open API under a CC0 licence, allowing for aggregation by, among others, Europeana. They explicitly mark the works in their collection that are in the public domain as such, using the Public Domain Mark and, last but not least, they provide links to beautiful high resolution digital representations of the artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/The%20Yellow%20Milkmaid.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 561px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Milkmaid, Vermeer. Rijksmuseum, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marlies: My favourite item in Europeana is a <a href=\"http://europeana.eu/portal/record/00901/7D1F2919B80CE8BF070CE1695BF304473FE07419.html\">radio recording</a> that is a curiosity about my home country, Austria and my current country of residence, Germany. It's a recording from 1978 when Austria beat Germany at the soccer world cup in Cordoba, Argentina, (for the first and only time in a world cup). And believe me, everyone in Austria is still proud of that victory and nobody in Germany even remembers that match any more! <a href=\"http://atom.oaw.mediathek.at/atom/139F00E4-10A-00046-00000C74-139E6537\">Listen to the recording.</a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Aggregation and Enlightenment in Slovenia'
        posttype: Blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>In the latest in our series of blogs following the progress of aggregation schemes for Europeana, we hear how our team visited Slovenia, talked masterpieces, and found enlightenment! David Smith writes...</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 21 March, the Europeana Business Development and Ingestion teams ran a workshop in conjunction with the National Library of Slovenia in the city of Ljubljana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Library has been aggregating material to Europeana for many years via its <a href=\"http://dlib.si/\">Dlib.si</a> portal. In the past year, the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=PROVIDER%3a%22Slovenian+National+E-content+Aggregator%22&amp;rows=12\">National eContent Aggregator </a>was initiated as a cross-domain national aggregator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the workshop, we were lucky enough to be shown around the impressive National Library building, designed by Slovenia’s most famous architect, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=Jo%C5%BEe+Ple%C4%8Dnik&amp;rows=24\">Jože Plečnik</a>. Through the building's imposing brass front doors, the potential reader is led up a dark, marble-pillared staircase towards the light-flooded, wooden-panelled reading room. To access collections here, you literally have to walk up towards enlightenment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/1667b4df-3043-4b5e-bf64-ffb9d2a4440e.jpg\" style=\"width: 484px; height: 203px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2020108/0DE25072A520422F80DA63A512EBFEEEA695D091.html\">Main Entrance Staircase of the National and University Library</a> by Jože Plečnik, 2009. Slovenian National E-content Aggregator, CC-BY-NC.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshop itself was held at another site on the outskirts of the city. Around 20 participants engaged in a day of discussions about Europeana and aggregation in Slovenia. After an introduction, Annette Friberg from Europeana gave a presentation on Europeana's current and future plans. This included development of Europe’s network of aggregators and some current interesting projects. Zoran Krstulović then introduced the National eContent Aggregator project including technical details regarding how the system is working. Zoran’s presentation was in Slovenian and created quite a buzz of discussion with the attendees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slovenia%201.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 367px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following this, I presented Europeana’s key areas of development: audiovisual material, masterpieces and the API. A common trend across all the places I have done my presentation is the reception of the audience when presented with a potential list of their country's masterpieces. The requirement for the availability of digitised masterpieces was a recommendation of the EC’s New Renaissance paper and something we have been working on for the past year. Mobilising national aggregators and other organisations to make these available is a priority area of Europeana but not without its pitfalls. The Slovenian audience was receptive to the idea, which was reassuring to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slovenia%202.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 367px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Francesca Morselli from the Europeana Ingestion team then presented and ran a workshop on metadata quality and rights statements. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-launches-rights-labelling-campaign\">Rights statements are a key focus</a> for Europeana in 2013 and the workshop gave us an opportunity to work through issues associated with providing accurate rights statements for content coming into the Europeana portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After lunch, the final workshop looked at simplifying the process of making material available via Europeana. During this workshop, we discussed the possible benefits of the work being done on the <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">Europeana Inside</a> project. The audience clearly saw the benefits of that project and how it could relate to their own work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slovenia%203.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 367px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with all workshops, the end of the day was marked with very quick goodbyes and next steps before the rush back to the airport. Throughout our time in Slovenia, we were assisted by the National Library of Slovenia, to whom we are very grateful for their hospitality and organisational support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>More blogs about aggregation:</b><br><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/finland%E2%80%99s-national-digital-library-formula-for-success\">Finland's National Digital Library Formula for Success</a><br><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/working-towards-a-bulgarian-national-aggregator\">Working Towards a Bulgarian National Aggregator</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>We have published another case study from our series of real-life examples on the use of open data that were presented at Europeana’s Open Data Case Studies workshop in Paris earlier this year. This week we are looking at how the <a href=\"http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en/netherlands-institute-sound-and-vision\">Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision</a> are measuring the impact of opening up their datasets via <a href=\"http://www.openimages.eu/\">Open Images</a>, an open media platform that provides online access to audiovisual archive material to stimulate creative re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(22).jpg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>Maarten Brinkerink</em><em>, Project Manager for R&amp;D at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, presenting at Europeana’s Open Data Case Studies Workshop in Paris.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn a little bit more about Open Images, we caught up with Maarten Brinkerink, Project Manager for R&amp;D at the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_<strong>What is the ‘big idea’ behind this project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MB: <em>Together with <a href=\"http://www.kennisland.nl/en/\">Kennisland</a>, we set up Open Images in 2009 with the aim of facilitating\_re-use of the collections we hold, along with content from individuals and collections from other institutions. Access to the material on Open Images is provided under the\_Creative Commons licensing model or a Public Domain Mark. This enables the freedom to approach copyright in a more flexible manner and make work available in a way that encourages re-use.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did the project create value for users of Open Images and the institutions involved?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MB: <em>Open Images is accessible to anybody who wants to upload their own material and assign an open licence to it to encourage re-use. We’re not just about institutes and producers, but all ‘netizens’ who create material and want to enable the re-use of it via Open Images. Wealso provide an API, which enables developers to easily re-use material and create mash-ups. After launching Open Images, material was almost immediately re-used within several projects.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What benefits have resulted from Open Images?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MB: <em>Aside from traffic and usage figures on Open Images increasing, we have also seen the external re-use of material increase as well. The Sound and Vision videos from Open Images are, for instance, also available on Wikimedia Commons and in Europeana. This is facilitated by the open infrastructure of the Open Images platform, which effectively distributes open content by combining open source software components, open media formats, open standards and an open API.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MB: <em>In response to the growing need within the cultural heritage field to receive statistics on the impact of the opening up of cultural data sets, Sound and Vision will perform impact analysis research together with Kennisland for Open Culture Data. In order to do so, the data providers from the Open Culture Network, along with international initiatives, are requested to provide data on the impact and re-use of their data sets. The results of this impact analysis will be made public in the course of 2013.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn more about Open Images and its results from the embedded case study below, or alternatively you can\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/eb152065-2809-4559-b100-d93086fd3205\">download it</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"570\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/20478114\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_If you are interested in learning more about Open Images or have questions related to measuring the impact of cultural datasets you can contact Maarten Brinkerinkon Twitter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mbrinkerink/\">@mbrinkerink</a>) or directly through email <a href=\"mailto:mbrinkerink@beeldengeluid.nl\" title=\"blocked::mailto:mbrinkerink@beeldengeluid.nl\">mbrinkerink@beeldengeluid.nl</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have already published three other case studies from the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1640887\">Statens Museum for Kunst - the National Gallery of Denmark (SMK)</a>, the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1660413\">Polish Digital Libraries</a> and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1587205\">Europeana</a> – so check them out if you haven’t already done so. We will soon be publishing our final case study in this series next week. The final case study from the BBC, along with the others, will then form a larger white paper on open data, due to be published later this spring.</p>\r\n"

        posttype: blog
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today's blog comes from Bogna Wróż, Adam Dudczak and Marcin Werla, Digital Libraries Team Members at Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/0657c4bd-21ac-47f7-997d-1a5720c11177.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 111px; height: 160px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://accessitplus.eu\">ACCESS IT Plus</a> is a two-year (2011-2013) project funded by means of the Culture 2007-13 programme. This project is a continuation of the successful ACCESS IT project (2009-2011), which supported institutions from Serbia, Turkey and Greece. ACCESS IT Plus extends the original scope of this initiative to reach institutions from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. The cultural heritage of these countries is a significant element of European culture and should be widely accessible online, including through international portals such as <a href=\"http://europeana.eu\">Europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ACCESS IT project delivered a unique package of practical training and skills development, supported by clear guidance, to enable smaller, local cultural organisations to effectively deliver and disseminate arts and cultural offerings to the citizens of Europe. One of the main activities was the creation of two e-learning courses, in order to support self-development of knowledge and skills about cultural heritage collections digitisation, online access and aggregation, with respect to the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/technical-requirements\">Europeana requirements</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/accessit1.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 334px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>One of the ACCESS IT workshops held in Central Public Library of Veria (Greece).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first course, 'Digital Repositories for Small Memory Institutions' includes the subjects: how to digitise cultural heritage objects, how to prepare them for online presentation and how to describe them with metadata and organise them in collections. Besides the necessary theoretical background, the course also provides practical instructions which will enable small institutions to create high quality digital content and make it available online to services like Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second course, 'Cooperation with Europeana', is aimed at those who want to provide their metadata to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a>. It covers the underlying vision of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> and explains its technical infrastructure. It also provides a detailed explanation of the procedures which have to be followed in order to make digital cultural heritage resources available through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first version of both courses was released in October 2010. Now, as part of ACCESS IT Plus, PSNC together with other project partners, have started work on a major update of these materials to increase accessibility of the courses and enrich them with more examples of digitisation projects. Several changes were also suggested by course users from Serbia, Turkey, Poland and Greece. The most recent version of the courses was released in July 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distribution and deployment model for the courses was as follows: a base version in English was made available at <a href=\"http://dl.psnc.pl/moodle\">http://dl.psnc.pl/moodle</a>, under a Creative Commons licence. Each of the participating countries was asked to make a copy of the base courses in order to translate and adapt them. As a result, each country partner is running its own version of the course based on the generic one. At the moment, the following adaptations are available:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://e-ucionica.nub.rs/\">Bosnian</a>, prepared by the National and University Library of the Republic of Srpska from Banja Luka</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://accessitplus.gkr.hr/\">Croatian</a>, prepared by the Public Library of Rijeka</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://accessit.libver.gr/\">Greek</a>, prepared by the Central Public Library of Veria</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/elearning/\">Polish</a>, made by PSNC</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://accessitplus.gkr.hr/\">Turkish</a>, prepared by Haccettepe University</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"http://e-ucionica.nb.rs/moodle \">Serbian</a>, prepared by Belgrade City Library and the National Library of Serbia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to make the above model possible and to support parallel development of all course adaptations, each time a new version of the base course is released, PSNC publishes a list of changes made since the last release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/AccessIT2.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 372px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>DigitLab in action during one of the conferences in Poland.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the courses, the project has developed one more important tool. In order to simplify the digitisation process and support education based on practice, a set of open source applications has been identified and combined together into a dedicated operating system: <a href=\"http://digitlab.psnc.pl/\">DigitLab</a>. This is a digitisation ‘Swiss army knife’ which can be launched from a USB stick and does not require installation on the user’s computer. Examples of DigitLab usage include: creation of searchable PDF files with free OCR tools, preparation of high quality digital versions of old maps and preparation of audiovisual collections for both archiving and online delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from tools dedicated to post-processing of digital content, users can also play with three example digital libraries created using different software packages (dSpace, GreenStone and dLibra). This Ubuntu-based operating system can be <a href=\"http://digitlab.psnc.pl\">downloaded for free,</a> as an ISO image. The project wiki contains detailed instructions which should help users to create a bootable USB stick and use it for various digitisation scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The courses described in this article provide a huge body of knowledge about digitisation, digital libraries and Europeana. They include detailed, step-by-step manuals showing how to work with digital versions of cultural heritage objects. Thanks to the availability of DigitLab, anyone who is interested can use the knowledge and manuals presented in the courses in practice. If you are interested in using or making your own adaptations of materials and tools that we have prepared, feel free to <a href=\"http://dl.psnc.pl/contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The courses will be further developed as a part of the <a href=\"http://locloud.eu\">LoCloud Best Practice Network</a>, which includes partners from 28 European countries and aims to support digitisation and accessibility via Europeana of the cultural heritage held by small and medium sized memory institutions, through provision of cloud-based solutions and training.</p>"

        title: 'Europeana Inside’s One-Year Anniversary'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog from Carolien Fokke of the Collections Trust.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"/files/blogimages/0657c4bd-21ac-47f7-997d-1a5720c11177.png\" style=\"float: left; width: 111px; height: 160px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard to believe that the Europeana Inside project kicked off just a year ago, in April 2012. The work that the 26-partner consortium has done in such a short amount of time is incredible, and we would love to share the story of our journey so far with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Inside_TP1-Meeting-The-Hague-03.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 282px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Europeana Inside meeting in The Hague, The Netherlands. Image by SPK (Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who are less familiar with the project, Europeana Inside is a Best Practice Network connecting content providers with technical partners throughout Europe. We aim to achieve a lasting transformation in the quantity, scope and usability of the content available to Europeana from European cultural institutions. We mean to reach this goal by developing the <a href=\"http://www.collectionslink.org.uk/programmes/european-projects/1549-europeana-inside-partners-prepare-new-open-source-connection-kit\">Europeana Connection Kit</a> (or ECK) – a set of open-source software tools that will enable cultural heritage institutions throughout Europe to share their collections online via Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this past year, much has already been achieved. The project was off to a good start with the creation of <a href=\"http://europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">our website</a> and social media channels, as well as a bunch of printed dissemination material. Then it was on to gathering the user requirements from the content providers, developing use case scenarios, and investigating the current technical standards. At the end of 2012, a <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/news/technical_specification_for_eck_defined.html\">technical specification</a> was written which combined all the information gathered over the previous months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Inside_ECK-box.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 260px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The ECK box! Image by SPK (Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The user requirements and specifications have since served as the basis that the technical partners use to do what they do best: develop software. The first iteration of the ECK is due at the end of this month, which means that we can start testing the prototype software very soon. This is an enormous milestone for the project, and we are all looking forward to the cooperative testing and evaluation process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past year, we’ve also extended the Europeana Inside family with a number of <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/blog/associated_partners_enter_inside.html\">Associate Partners</a> ranging from content providers to aggregators and Content Management System vendors who are sharing their expertise and knowledge with us. We are always looking for more Associate Partners so if you’re interested in becoming involved with the project, please <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/partners/participation_welcome/index.html\">contact us via the website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the highlights of the past year was certainly the first Europeana Inside Review in Luxembourg on 15 February. The management board was excited about the opportunity to show the European Commission how much work had been done by all partners with so much enthusiasm. It was wonderful to hear from the reviewers that the project was well on its way to becoming very successful, and that the work that had been done was excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, it’s been one amazing year, and we’re all sure that next year is going to be even better!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are keen to receive updates about the project, what’s been happening, and what’s going to be happening, you can always <a href=\"http://europeana-inside.eu/home/index.html\">visit our website</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/EuropeanaInside\">like us on Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EuropeanaInside\">follow us on Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Europeana-Inside-4929202?trk=myg_ugrp_ovr\"> join our LinkedIn group</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.europeana-inside.eu/newsletter/index.html\">sign up for our newsletter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Inside_TP2-Meeting-Leuven-06%20(1).jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 372px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Europeana Inside meeting in Leuven, Belgium.

        body: "\r\n<p>On 18 April, the <a href=\"http://www.histech.nl/www/en/\">Foundation for the History of Technology</a> in Eindhoven - ‘the city of bulbs and brains’ - hosted a discussion about ways of diffusing historical knowledge via new media with a focus on two case studies - the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/het-spel-van-de-gouden-eeuw/id589774656?mt=8\">Golden Age Game</a> and the virtual exhibit, <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">Inventing Europe.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first case study presents scientific knowledge in a <a href=\"\">gaming format</a>. Gamers acting as merchants during the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age\">Dutch Golden Age </a>can get acquainted with the ins and outs of the financial markets of the time. The Inventing Europe exhibit showcases an excellent online platform that connects research results with cultural heritage collections, visualising context and allowing visitors to make (sometimes unexpected) correlations. It is a pioneering collaboration between historians and cultural heritage institutions across Europe and explores the modern history of Europe through six curated exhibitions and 36 tours. These virtual journeys are based on the objects and images of partner heritage institutions and are enriched with relevant materials from Europeana collections through the Europeana API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the event, in the presence of more than 150 researchers, students, partners and journalists, Drs Mary-Ann Schreurs, Eindhoven alderman of innovation, design, culture and public space, announced the launch of the newer version of Inventing Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/c541a7b7-b458-462b-b992-a3f25f802cb9.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Drs Mary-Ann Schreurs, Eindhoven alderman, launches the new Inventing Europe site.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This portal version has built upon its technology and content to become the <a href=\"\">Inventing Europe: European Digital Museum for Science and Technology</a>. The website now has an improved design and code, and a better functioning content management system. It also uses the new Europeana API (2.0) which ensures access to over 26 million objects from Europe’s cultural and scientific heritage and feeds the visitors’ research with extra objects in a more efficient way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The website now includes an extended educational environment which is a result of the project’s seven-month collaboration with 11 teachers in eight universities in seven European countries. The site gives teachers access to ready-made tools for lecturing and samples of shorter and longer assignments on modern European history. There are also outlines for two complete courses built around the themes and exhibitions of Inventing Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BvOF%20Inventing%20Europe-Schreurs%201.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 320px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The new Inventing Europe website is launched.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this contextually rich, very visual and interactive portal, the newly launched Inventing Europe: European Digital Museum of Technology and Science is certainly on the way to becoming a dynamic and engaging educational online space for researchers, students and cultural professionals. Explore it at <a href=\"http://www.inventingeurope.eu/\">www.inventingeurope.eu</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today, Geer Oskam, Europeana Senior Marketing Specialist, tell us about a couple of interesting Wikimedia events that Europeana was involved with last month.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, there was the Europeana Fashion Edit-a-thon in Stockholm in collaboration with the Nordic Museum and Stockholm University. At the event, no less then 47 participants showed up to edit the fashion pages of Wikipedia, 23 of them female. Wikipedia is very male dominated (only 9% of all editors are female), which apparently makes the topic of fashion very poorly represented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/c966ab57-02a4-4618-918c-5f7ea48ab338.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 697px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>One of the images from the Nordic Museum used in the edit-a-thon: 'Hattmode. Modeplansch från 1874', public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparation for the event, the <a href=\"http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/\">Nordic Museum</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.momu.be/\">MoMu Fashion Museum</a> in Antwerp (partners of Europeana and <a href=\"http://www.europeanafashion.eu/\">Europeana Fashion</a>) uploaded hundreds of fashion images to Wikimedia Commons. These, and other images, uploaded during the 10-hour edit-a-thon were incorporated into numerous Wikipedia pages. 57 images were used 72 times in articles. Ten new articles were created and articles were edited in eight different languages. <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Europeana_Fashion_Editathon_in_Stockholm\">View photos of the event.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn't the first edi-a-thon we've been involved with. Read about our Europeana 1914-1918 edit-a-thon in <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/wikipedia-ww1-articles-enhanced-with-europeana-content\">this blogpost</a>. That event was a big success with the number of views of the collection images used hitting the 900,000 mark within 3 months. The lesson we learned from this is to try and get interesting content linked to well-read articles (for example, a postcard written by Hitler was linked to various articles about the man).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing about the latest fashion edit-a-thon is that although the number of views might not be as high as those from the World War One themed event, from a Wikimedia perspective it was very successful in terms of participants (women) and the subject (the underrepresented pages on fashion). With both edit-a-thons, we have helped to increase the coverage of cultural heritage on the largest free encyclopaedia in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GLAM Wiki Conference</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In April, Europeana attended the <a href=\"https://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM-WIKI_2013\">GLAM-Wiki 2013 Conference</a> in London to present our collaborations with Wikimedia. We gave a presentation about the fashion edit-a-thon mentioned above, and talked about future events including the Wiki Loves Public Art contest (of which more later!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second day of the conference, Europeana hosted a workshop for Wikimedians and GLAM (gallery, library, archive, museums) staff on the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1468668\">GLAM Wiki Toolset</a>. This set of tools is being developed in the Europeana Office to make it as easy as possible for GLAMs to upload their content to Wikimedia Commons, meaning that their collection items can be featured in Wikipedia pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, it was a succesfull conference at which we shared our experiences and showed how Europeana is valuable for Wikimedia and the GLAM sector, building bridges and creating possibilities to work together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find more highlights from the event in this <a href=\"http://openglam.org/2013/04/17/glam-wiki-london-2013-highlights/\">blog by Joris Pekel</a> from the Open Knowledge Foundation, Netherlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Wiki Loves Public Art contest</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Paparazzi_In_Bratislava.jpg\" style=\"width: 256px; height: 485px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'Paparazzi statue in Bratislava', photograph by DMY, CC-BY.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you live in Sweden, Spain, Finland, Israel or Austria you can participate in improving online access to artworks as the <a href=\"http://www.wikilovespublicart.com/\">Wiki Loves Public Art (WLPA) photo contest</a> kicks off in May. The goal of the contest is to get as many pictures of public art as possible available under a free licence on Wikipedia’s online image database, <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. The photos can then be seen and used by anyone, anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wiki Loves Public Art contest is organised by Wikimedia Sverige, Europeana and volunteers in the Wikimedia chapters and affiliated groups in each of the participating countries. There are great prizes to be won: travel gift certificates for 500 euros, 300 euros and 200 euros. On top of that, Europeana has sponsored high quality prints of the winning pictures that will be sent to the winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make it as easy as possible for people to find artworks suitable for the contest, volunteers in national Wikimedia chapters have put together lists on Wikipedia with information about art that you can find while you're out and about. While in some countries, the focus has been on working with national art museums so that people can go there and take photos of items from the museums' collections. Find out everything about the contest on <a href=\"http://www.wikilovespublicart.com/\">the contest website</a> or at <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wiki_Loves_Public_Art_2013\">Wikimedia Commons</a>. Please help us spread the word about the contest and of course: participate yourself!</p>"

        title: 'Case Study: Europeana API Implementation in Polish Digital Libraries'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>It’s time to share another insightful case study on the use of open data, this time from our friends at the <a href=\"http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra\">Digital Library of Wielkopolska</a> (DLW) and <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/owoc.html\">Digital Libraries Federation</a> (DLF) in Poland. Along with case studies already published by <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1587205\">Europeana</a> and the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1640887\">National Gallery of Denmark (SMK)</a>, this case study was presented at the Open Data Case Studies Workshop that took place at the end of January in Paris. These case studies along with others will form \_a larger white paper on open data, due to be published later this spring – so keep your eyes peeled here for more examples that demonstrate the value of open data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, <a href=\"http://dl.psnc.pl/\">PSNC</a>, the operator of Polish Digital Libraries Federation, began working with Europeana and exploiting the potential of promoting Polish cultural heritage content across Europe with the aim of creating wider access and facilitating re-use of their content. <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/api\">Europeana’s API </a>has provided a good platform for this, both enriching existing services and providing a wider breadth of content to users of the DLW and DLF services. Through a number of widgets, DLW and DLF have utilised Europeana’s API to bring in content from Europeana that is related to search queries on their existing websites. This provides end-users with more choice as results are returned from hundreds of other trusted heritage institutions across Europe via the Europeana API.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/apicase.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 739px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about the project we caught up Marcin Werla, author of the case study and Digital Libraries Team Leader at Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the ‘big idea’ behind this project?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MW: <em>We’ve been working closely with Europeana since 2009 and we recognised the strategic potential to provide access to Polish heritage content to a wider pan-European audience. In 2010, shortly after the announcement of the Europeana API, we joined a pilot programme with the intention of creating an automated way of accessing aggregated data which could significantly increase the visibility of European cultural heritage among the users of Polish Digital Libraries.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did the project create value for end-users, DLW and DLF?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MW: <em>Thanks to the integration of Europeana’s API, we’re able offer our users the ability to search not only our collections, but the collections of hundreds of other heritage institutions across Europe. Through the widgets that we developed on top of Europeana’s API, we were able to integrate something that is seamless and adds value to the experience for users of Polish Digital Libraries; it was always our intention to include the integration within the current workflow of our users.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What benefits have resulted from these API implementations?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MW: <em>After looking at the usage statistics we were impressed to see the number of our users clicking through to Europeana search results. For example, 5.17% of visitors who saw search results on DLF decided to click through to Europeana via the widget we developed. This clearly shows that enrichment based on the Europeana API not only directed users to an additional source of information, but also that they enjoyed this additional source.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>MW: <em>We will continue to utilise Europeana’s API within our current integrations and always explore new ways for Europeana’s data to be used via our different services. We would also like to see other institutions take a closer look at the Europeana API and consider implementing additional features for their systems based on this API – for us we have seen that it has really added value for our users on top of our existing services.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can learn more about what the Polish Digital Libraries did and what the results were from the embedded case study below, or alternatively you can\_<a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/947dd339-a0fe-492e-86fa-425fb26a754a\">download it</a>.\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"570\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/19153659\" width=\"600\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana API enables the development of applications, websites and mash-ups using the extensive heritage collections available via Europeana – it’s free and open to anybody.

        body: "<p>The Digital Public Library of America goes live with two million objects at 12:00 EST (18:00 CET) on Thursday 18 April.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/63e3d338-f541-476b-a248-8f514c614ac6.png\" style=\"width: 483px; height: 56px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celebratory launch events have been put on hold due to the terrible events at the Boston marathon, which took place right in front of the Boston Public Library, the launch venue. The DPLA's <a href=\"http://dp.la/2013/04/16/a-message-from-executive-director-dan-cohen/\">Executive Director Dan Cohen</a> said, 'From all of us at the Digital Public Library of America, our hearts go out to those affected by the terrible events in Boston. I have been in touch with Amy Ryan, the President of the BPL, and I extended our sympathies to the BPL staff and their loved ones.' He went on to say that, 'The new DPLA site will still go live at noon ET on Thursday as planned, and we look forward to sharing the riches of America’s libraries, archives, and museums. I see the building of a new library as one of the greatest examples of what humans can do together to extend the light against the darkness. In due time, we will let that light shine through.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/dpla%20screenshot.png\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 372px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://dp.la/\">DPLA site</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first content for the DPLA will come from state and regional digital archives, special collections of major university libraries and federal holdings. The <a href=\"http://dp.la/about/elements-of-the-dpla/\">DPLA says</a> that it will 'incorporate all media types and formats including the written record - books, pamphlets, periodicals, manuscripts, and digital texts - and expanding into visual and audiovisual materials in concert with existing repositories. In order to lay a solid foundation for its collections, the DPLA will begin with works in the public domain that have already been digitised and are accessible through other initiatives. Further material will be added incrementally to this basic foundation, starting with orphan works and materials that are in copyright but out-of-print.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DPLA and Europeana <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/press-release?p_p_id=itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c&amp;p_p_lifecycle=1&amp;p_p_state=normal&amp;p_p_mode=view&amp;p_p_col_id=column-2&amp;p_p_col_count=1&amp;_itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c_itemId=861972&amp;_itemdetailsportlet_WAR_europeanaportlet_INSTANCE_FX4c_javax.portlet.action=setItemId\">announced their collaboration</a> in December 2011. Speaking at the time, Robert Darnton, a DPLA Steering Committee member and University Librarian at Harvard, said, 'The association between the DPLA and Europeana means that users everywhere will eventually have access to the combined riches of the two systems at a single click. The aggregated databases will include many millions of books, pamphlets, newspapers, manuscripts, images, recordings, videos, and other materials in many formats.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since then, the DPLA has worked closely with Europeana, adopting the Europeana Data Model, sharing metadata expertise, inspiration and lessons learned, and working to make the two digital datasets interoperable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/1.D.2%20-%20SDf-002L.00011%20EMMA.jpg\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 220px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>From 'Leaving Europe' exhibition: Peder (Peter) Martinson Øyen', Credit: FylkesFOTOarkivet i Møre og Romsdal, Norway, free access</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 2012, as a result of collaboration with curators, content partners, project staff and others, the DPLA and Europeana launched a joint virtual exhibition - '<a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\">Leaving Europe: A new life in America</a>'. Jointly curated by the two digital libraries, the exhibition uses photographs, manuscripts, broadsheets, paintings, letters, audio, government documents and other unique materials to chart people's journeys across the European continent and their settlement in the United States. The digital items displayed are from U.S. and European libraries, museums and archives and the accompanying narrative has been commissioned specially for the exhibition from U.S. and European experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dp.la\">Explore the DPLA</a><br><a href=\"http://exhibitions.europeana.eu/exhibits/show/europe-america-en\">Explore 'Leaving Europe: A New Life in America' exhibition</a></p>"

The survey, which is available in four languages, will assess the potential role of local archival collections of all kinds in the future development of Europeana. Its responses will give us a better picture of the digital holdings and planned digitisation work in local, regional, smaller and other specialised archives. This is important because archives are currently underrepresented in both the Europeana dataset and in the Europeana Network. The survey's findings will go some way to helping us look at how to address this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey will be open until the end of May and the findings will be analysed in June, after which time they will be shared with the Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you work for a local, regional or specialist archive, please help us to ensure that the wealth of valuable digital content held by Europe’s archives of all kinds is fully accessible through Europeana in the years to come by taking the survey and joining the Europeana Network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Awareness%20D3.2%20Image.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 347px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A pilot survey carried out in 2012 began the process of scoping out digitisation in local archives. This chart shows the answers to the question, 'By how much is the amount of digital content likely to increase by 2017?'</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why are local archives important?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Local and regional archives are broadly defined to include heritage objects, documents and knowledge held, for example, by local history societies, associations for genealogical studies, church councils etc. as well as municipal and regional archives. This currently underexploited sector forms a bridge between the more formal cultural institutions whose content is currently ingested by Europeana on the one hand and user-generated content on the other. A vast reservoir of potential content exists in such collections. For the public, they provide a vital link to their own local cultural history, and beyond that to both the cultural history of others and more widely known heritage. Proper digitisation and access would greatly enhance the durability and value of these local, regional and specialist archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Take the survey</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The survey takes less than 15 mins to complete!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/991675/EAwareness-Local-Archives-Collections-Survey\">Take the survey in English</a><br><a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1086967/EAwareness-Enqu-te-sur-les-archives-collections-locales\">Take the survey in French</a><br><a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1087125/EAwareness-Befragung-lokaler-Archive-Sammlungen\">Take the survey in German</a><br><a href=\"http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1086017/EAwareness-Archivos-locales-Colecciones-Encuesta\">Take the survey in Spanish</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Become a Network member</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have completed the survey, a link will take you directly to the Europeana Network registration form. Please consider becoming a Network member if you are not one already. The Europeana Network is an open forum for content providers and experts across Europe that represents and reflects the diversity of Europeana and gives its more than 600 members an opportunity to voice their views. The Europeana Network is united by a common cultural mission to 'work together to improve access to Europe’s cultural heritage in balanced and sustainable ways'. As a Europeana Network member, you can influence strategic decisions, collaborate with experts, improve your knowledge and find new opportunities (using Europeana channels for publication, project funding, etc.).</p>"

        title: 'Europeana 1914-1918 roadshows inspire Slovenian librarians'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Guest blog from Breda Karun, Zavod Jara, an institute for library development in Slovenia.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a story of the First World War, it is a story of how Slovenian librarians, inspired by Europeana 1914-1918 Family History Roadshows, are developing new services using the principles of 'crowdsourcing', 'everyday history' and 'user-generated content'.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with three <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> Family History Roadshows as part of our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness</a> PR campaign in spring 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hosting libraries invited volunteers from other regional and smaller libraries to help. The response was very good and we had plenty of staff on hand on the days of the roadshows. Experts on the First World War from museums and archives were also keen to be a part of it and were happy to get in contact with contributors for possible future cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volunteers shared their positive experiences when they returned to their libraries, so more libraries decided to organise roadshows in 2013 at their own expense. Two more roadshows ran in spring 2013 and another two are coming up in the autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/YoungOld.png\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 453px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Young and old: left, a young girl looks up at the Ljubljana roadshow poster, and right, a 100-year-old man with his contribution.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the five roadshows run so far, we have welcomed 130 contributors who brought with them a total of 220 stories and 900 objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The response from the media has been incredible. We documented 108 mentions in the media around the three collection days in 2012, and more than 50 covering our two events in 2013, including interviews on the most prominent radio and TV stations, newspapers, social media and websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slovenian%20interview.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 334px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Television interview in progress at the Ljubljana event</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We noticed that the events brought satisfaction to both staff and contributors. Older people were grateful to have the opportunity to tell their stories to very enthusiastic listeners. Slovenians are traditionally introverted people, sharing their private stories mostly within their family or social group. For this reason, we didn't expect many contributors and were positively surprised about 30-40 people coming to each event. Being able to share the stories through Europeana, Europe's digital library, was an additional stimulation for staff and contributors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were so pleased with our results that we presented our experience of Family History Roadshows at the public libraries conference in Macedonia (February 2013) and at the international conference of archivists (April 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Slovenian%20objects.png\" style=\"width: 493px; height: 738px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A couple of the interesting objects brought to the Slovenian roadshows</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Beyond World War One</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The successful events sparked interest among librarians and stimulated them to come up with the idea of inviting local people to share memories related to their communities, outside the realm of WWI. One of the planned topics is industrial history - inviting people to share stories about the important industries that were ruined in the 1990s. Whole generations of people worked in factories that have since been closed or destroyed, and many people still keep photos and documents from the time when industry was flourishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our enthusiasm for this type of content collection has also speeded up the development of a user-generated content module on our own regional portal (<a href=\"http://www.kamra.si/\">KAMRA</a>). At present, all the information from KAMRA is uploaded to Europeana on a monthly basis. We are looking forward to discussing with Europeana how our new user-generated content could be incorporated later this year.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Karin Nilsson, head of the department of digital resources at <a href=\"http://lsh.se/en\">LSH (The Royal Armoury, Skokloster Castle and the Hallwyl Museum, Sweden)</a>, tells us about the bold work they've done recently to open up their archives for free re-use.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Sweden%20open%201.jpg\" style=\"width: 454px; height: 257px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 6 March, the entire image archive from the Swedish national agency, LSH (made up of three museums: The Royal Armoury, Skokloster Castle and the Hallwyl Museum), was made available on the internet. All 40,000 images are published under open licences, about a third of them in high resolution. The release of the archive has attracted a lot of attention in Swedish social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 2012, we started the 'Open Image Archive' project. The objective was to make the museums’ image archives freely available to the public. The project consisted of three parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Develop the web interface for our collection database, in order to be able to display high resolution images.</li>\r\n    <li>Deliver linked open data and images to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:%22Swedish+Open+Cultural+Heritage%22&amp;rows=24\">K-samsök</a> - the Swedish national aggregator for cultural heritage data. This would allow users to collect and build new applications using the data.</li>\r\n    <li>Donate all of our high resolution images to <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, in order to increase the reach of the material.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eMuseumPlus1.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 660px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=literature&amp;objectId=73759&amp;viewType=detailView\">Porträtt, karikatyr'</a>, from Skoklosters slott, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2012, we launched the web interface for our collection database. This first stage enabled users to search for objects and people related to these objects. Each object record held one related image. The database contains about 90,000 object records and 40,000 related names of people and organisations. The data is licensed with the Creative Commons Zero Public Domain Dedication (CC0).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until the launch of Open Image Archive, the three museums had distributed images manually, through an FTP server solution. Just like most museums, we used to charge the users for both reproduction and usage rights. In January 2012, LSH decided that the images should be made public and available free of charge, since they have already been paid for through taxes and belong to the public. Now the work could really begin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eMuseumPlus2.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 240px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=literature&amp;objectId=86399&amp;viewType=detailView\">Frukt- och grönsakshandel, Målning, Grönsaker</a>', from Hallwylska museet, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Objective</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The objective of the Open Image Archive project was to ensure free access to our image collections and make it possible to use and re-use the images, in accordance with the expected expansion of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_the_re-use_of_public_sector_information\">Directive on the re-use of public sector information</a>. In order to maximise usability, the images need to be structured in a machine-readable format and be provided with all necessary metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a user is to make the most of this new openness, it has to be easy to find and re-use images. They need to be available for both non-commercial and commercial purposes. To achieve this, we had to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Expand the existing web interface of our database with a new module which allowed us to display and structure all images, with or without object relations. We also needed a function for downloading high resolution images.</li>\r\n    <li>Process and correct image data and metadata, e.g. key words for increased searchability, licence templates and info about photographers.</li>\r\n    <li>Provide all images with licences, we have used CC BY-SA, CC0 and public domain.</li>\r\n    <li>Donate all high resolution images to <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikimedia Commons</a>, linking back to our own database.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/eMuseumPlus3.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 281px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://emuseumplus.lsh.se/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=literature&amp;objectId=87978&amp;viewType=detailView\">Hjälmkrossare, Webbprojektet, Stämningsbild</a>', from Livrustkammaren, CC-BY-SA</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also one of three Swedish contributors to the Athena Plus project, meaning that we will soon be delivering <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/linked-open-data\">linked open data</a> to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All digitised or digitally born images are made available free of charge for the user. Analogue images can be digitised on demand, at a marginal cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of this project is better quality data and increased possibilities for the use and re-use of our material, for example for children preparing school work, for innovators building applications or for researchers who can study objects closely, through high resolution images.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope that this will contribute to building a platform for an increased use of our cultural heritage and that people around the world will benefit from this step.</p>"

        title: 'Case Study: Danish Museums on Twitter'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>The Open Data Case Studies Workshop took place at the end of January in Paris, organised by Europeana and INA (Institut national de l'audiovisuel). The aim of the workshop was to evaluate the potential of ‘Open’ and analyse real life examples of services based on open data and open content in the cultural heritage sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/casestudydanish.jpeg\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 399px;\"><br><em>Merete Sanderhoff</em>, <em>Researcher at SMK, presenting at Europeana’s Open Data Case Studies Workshop in Paris.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five case studies were presented from the BBC, Statens Museum for Kunst - the <a href=\"http://www.smk.dk/en/\">National Gallery of Denmark (SMK)</a>, Netherlands Sound and Vision Institute, the Polish Digital Libraries Federation and Europeana. These case studies will form a larger white paper on open data, due to be published later this spring. In the meantime, we will be highlighting each case study on an individual basis. We have already \_showcased <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1587205\">the work Europeana did with partners on Pinterest </a>on the Pro blog and now we’re looking at <a href=\"http://hints.o8e.dk/\">HintMe</a>, a shared mobile museum platform using Twitter's API to connect collections and engage users in dialogue about art. Users in a gallery can use HintMe on their mobile device to see what others have said about the artwork they are looking at and add their own comments on Twitter using the designated hashtags.<br>\r\n\_<br>\r\nA group of Danish art museums joined forces to develop \_a shared mobile platform based on open content. SMK initiated the collaborative pilot project between 11 Danish art museums. One of the main objectives was to build a mobile tool for art interpretation and engagement to be used by many museum partners based on the following three common principles; all Public Domain content is freely shareable and re-usable, an existing platform is utilised without custom-building a new one, and target users take part in creating and developing the experience. We caught up with Merete Sanderhoff, Researcher at SMK and asked her a few questions to get some more insight on the project:<br>\r\n\_<br><strong>What is the ‘big idea’ behind this project?</strong><br>\r\nMS:<em>Basically the main idea for us was the close collaboration between art museums in Denmark to explore the benefits of opening up collections for re-use online. As a result of re-licensing these collections, we wanted to facilitate our visitors to start using mobile devices as in-gallery tools, enabling them to engage with the museum, artworks and each other online.</em><br><br><strong>How did the project create value, both for end-users and participating institutions?</strong><br>\r\nMS:<em>We believe that through opening up collections and utilising the viral power of Twitter, we are exposing our collections to the unlimited possibilities of re-use across the web – essentially enabling digitised art collections to become useful and relevant in new ways. I like to think that we are bridging the gap between institutions, their collections, visitors, and online engagement. As a result, we are creating proactive dialogue online, which in the end encourages the creation of content.</em><br><br><strong>What channels were used and why? Also, what benefits have resulted from this pilot project?</strong><br>\r\nMS:<em>In order for the project to scale we wanted to use a platform that already existed, therefore we utilised Twitter because it provided us with the functionalities that we needed, for example, content production is manageable and hashtags offer a simple way to tag individual artworks. As mentioned in the case study, one of the major benefits so far has been the adoption of Creative Commons licences by a number of Danish Museums. By communicating the benefits of CC licences, we hope to attract other museums to open up their collections for re-use on Twitter and other social platforms.</em><br><br><strong>What’s next?</strong><br>\r\nMS:<em>We are interested in exploring ways in which we can make HintMe an indispensable tool for museums. We are also considering how we can increase participation and integrate audio on the platform to enhance the user experience and encourage users to look closer at the artworks. As this is an experimental pilot project, we are interested in hearing your ideas and experiences.\_As a result of the project there has been keen interest from the Danish educational sector at the prospect of gaining access to more Open Educational Resources from the country's art museums. Furthermore, Wikimedia Commons is keen to harvest more high quality images from Danish art museums, and we are keen to look into the benefits of uploading our collections on Wikipedia.

        body: "<p>Being involved with both culture and technology, Europeana gets to attend some pretty great events that bring the two realms together. Yesterday, we told you about our time at the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1638389/maximized?p_p_auth=hERB5qDp\">Paris Book Fair</a>, complete with VIPs. Another exciting event we've been to recently was the FutureEverything Conference 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/summit/conference/\">FutureEverything Conference 2013</a> was held in Manchester on 21–22 March 2013. Speakers came from around the world, from prestigious organisations such as Google, Vimeo &amp; the BBC, making the conference, according to its organisers, 'one of the most exciting and inspirational we have hosted in recent years.' FutureEverything was recently hailed by the Guardian as one of the top ten international ideas festivals, alongside TEDx, 99% and South by South West (which our Antoine Isaac attended - <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/1578465/maximized?p_p_auth=HNSu8uFZ\">read his blog</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference and workshops brought together hundreds of delegates from around the world from across the creative industries, new technologies, innovation, arts, public sector and academia. Its three themes for 2013 were those that are instrumental in shaping the digital future: Creative Code, Future Cities and The Data Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With UK partners - the BBC, Creative Exchange and Lancaster University - FutureEverything is investigating the potential of a <a href=\"http://2012.futureeverything.org/research/publications/digital-public-space-theme/\">Digital Public Space</a>, which it describes as 'a framework for thinking about the ways in which the arts and culture will reshape themselves in the screen-based, online world'. The Digital Public Space will, say FutureEverything, 'enable digital content to be made as freely available as possible for anyone from anywhere, doing for the whole range of digitised cultural content what the Open Data campaign is doing for publicly-funded datasets. Within the Digital Public Space every digital asset that can be shared will be shared, and as we digitise more of the analogue past this will stretch to encompass the whole of recorded culture.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/fea66d9a-b3f8-4f85-b9a8-109dff2ae5b2\">presentation at FutureEverything 2013</a>, Europeana Executive Director, Jill Cousins said, 'Europeana has a huge number of similarities to the Digital Public Space. It exists so that everyone, everywhere can have unrestricted access to culture and knowledge. It has pushed for open standards and interoperability and for me, it is about creating the backbone, the hub, the space, the commons where others can seize the opportunities presented there and develop new ones.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/futureEverything.png\" style=\"width: 502px; height: 675px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/publications/digital-public-spaces/\">download the FutureEverything publication</a> exploring the idea of the Digital Public Space, which includes an article by our very own Jill Cousins (page 12).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as presenting at the conference, Europeana also partnered up with others to run a Europeana Mashup Workshop at which participants could remix Europeana content with content from other online sources using <a href=\"https://popcorn.webmaker.org/\">Mozilla's Popcorn Maker</a>. The workshop focused on introducing participants to the possibilities of hands-on manipulation of historic archives, providing support for participants to explore these resources and their potential. The workshop also encouraged discussion about the potential impact of the emerging digital public space and its affect on knowledge transfer, curation and interaction with culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the results of the Mashup Workshop was this cute work-in-progress video entitled 'A little film made on Mozilla Popcorn celebrating the job of caravans - Travelling for Pleasure' by Lara Devitt, aka <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lil_madam\">@lil_Madam</a>. It includes photos, videos and text relating to the iconic vehicle that is the caravan, and draws some of its resources from Europeana, all to a soundtrack of Goldfrapp's 'Caravan Girl'.</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>At the end of March, Europeana participated for the first time in the prestigious <a href=\"http://www.salondulivreparis.com/\">Paris Book Fair</a>. Europeana shared a stand with the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) for two days as part of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness\">Europeana Awareness project</a>, which, as its name suggests, aims to raise awareness of Europeana across all EU member states. Throughout the two days, we told visitors all about Europeana and demonstrated how to search for their favourite cultural items on the portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/bnf.png\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 607px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Europeana/BnF stand</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentine Charles, Europeana interoperability specialist, was representing Europeana at the event. She said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'The Book Fair was a great opportunity to present Europeana to the French public who may not always be familiar with European initiatives. People were really enthusiastic and particularly appreciated the Europeana exhibitions which allow them to explore Europeana content while learning more about its context. It was really interesting to get direct feedback from the audience and to discuss their interests and the topics of their research with them. Being at the Book Fair was also a fantastic experience for a book lover like me!'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/bnf2.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 374px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>All ready at the Europeana/BnF stand</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two very important guests received their own guided tour of Europeana during the event - French President, François Hollande, and Vice President of the European Commission, Neelie Kroes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/BnF%20Hollande.jpg\" style=\"width: 480px; height: 640px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>French president François Hollande is shown a demo of Europeana</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Neelie%20bnf.jpg\" style=\"width: 409px; height: 421px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Valentine Charles (right) shows Neelie Kroes (left) the Europeana portal</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge thank you from Europeana to our partners at the BnF for inviting us share their stand. Merci à tous!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Version française</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A la fin du mois de mars, Europeana était présente au prestigieux Salon du Livre de Paris. Elle partageait le stand de la Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) pendant deux jours au titre du projet «\_Europeana Awareness\_» qui, comme son nom l’indique, vise à promouvoir\_ Europeana parmi tous les Etats membres de l’Union européenne. Pendant ces deux journées, nous avons expliqué à nos visiteurs le fonctionnement d’Europeana et comment rechercher leurs objets culturels favoris sur le portail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentine Charles, spécialiste de l’interopérabilité, représentait Europeana lors de cet événement : «\_Le Salon du Livre était une belle opportunité pour présenter Europeana au public français qui n’est peut-être pas toujours très au fait des initiatives européennes. Les visiteurs étaient très enthousiastes\_; les présentations ont été particulièrement appréciées. Elles ont permis aux visiteurs d’explorer le contenu d’Europeana et d’en apprendre plus sur le contexte de sa mise en place. C’était très intéressant d’avoir des retours directs du public et de parler avec les visiteurs de leurs intérêts et de leurs projets de recherche. Le Salon du Livre a été aussi une expérience formidable pour la passionnée de livres que je suis\_!\_»</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Une démonstration privée d’Europeana a été proposée à deux hôtes de marque\_: le Président de la République, François Hollande, et la Vice-présidente de la Commission européenne, Neelie Kroes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Un grand merci à tous nos collaborateurs de la BnF pour nous avoir invités à partager leur stand\_!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Légendes</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Le stand Europeana / BnF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fin prêts sur le stand Europeana / BnF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Présentation au Président de la République, François Hollande</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valentine Charles (à droite) présente le portail Europeana à Neelie Kroes (à gauche)</p>"

We recently blogged about the launch of <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-cloud-kicks-off-under-clear-skies\"> Europeana Cloud</a>. Today, Sarah McSeveny-Aril from Arts Council Norway, tells us about another cloud-based project launched recently - LoCloud.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The launch of the <a href=\"http://www.mdrpartners.com/projects/locloud/\">LoCloud project</a> took place at the National Archives of Norway in March. 32 partners from 28 different countries gathered on a Tuesday morning at the venue in the snow-covered forest on the outskirts of Oslo to discuss the project's main goals: the development and strengthening of local institutions through cloud-based technology. Norway is one of the countries represented in this project with both the National Archives of Norway taking the leading role as project coordinator, and the Norwegian consultancy company Avinet as one of the technical partners in the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LoCloud1.jpg\" style=\"width: 490px; height: 367px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The National Archives of Norway - the snowy venue for the LoCloud launch</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Content from smaller local institutions such as archives and libraries is still sorely underrepresented in the digital European arena. This important content needs to be made accessible and the current trend toward cloud-based technology could prove the solution to increasing the availability of local historical data. The LoCloud project aims to develop new cloud-based models and instruments that will offer smaller institutions user-friendly and affordable tools that can be used in the digitisation and aggregation of their data. The project will explore the possibility of a cloud-based infrastructure for aggregating local content. It will also look into developing a number of micro-services, which will be able to offer geolocation enrichment, metadata enrichment, multilingual vocabularies for local history and archaeology, a historical place name gazetteer and a Wikimedia application to handling relevant ‘crowd-sourced’ content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/LoCloud2.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 303px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The LoCloud launch in full swing</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project plans to add over 4 million new items to Europeana, and the hope is that these cloud-based services will help ensure that local content can be more easily aggregated while also increasing its searchability and interoperability. LoCloud aims to build on the achievements of <a href=\"http://www.carare.eu/\">CARARE</a> in establishing a repository-based aggregator for archaeological and architectural heritage and of <a href=\"http://www.europeanalocal.eu/\">Europeana Local</a> in its work with local institutions and their regional and national aggregators, which resulted in the contribution to date of well over 5 million items to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was clear from the kick-off that this project has a strong group of partners eager to take on the ambitious task ahead of them. As project coordinator Gunnar Urtegaard from Riksarkivet underlined during the meeting's close: 'If we can keep it simple for content providers, keep it simple for users and remove all the complexity in-between, then this project has the potential to be a great success.'</p>"

        title: 'Europeana at Culture Geek Conference'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><em>Today's blog comes from Geer Oskam, Senior Marketing Specialist at Europeana, and tells how he found out how cultural organisations can use their own audience to fuel growth.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, I visited <a href=\"http://www.culturegeek.com/speakers\">Culture Geek</a>, a one-day conference about cultural marketing in the rapidly changing digital landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Culture Geek\" src=\"/files/blogimages/culturegeek1.jpg\" style=\"width: 496px; height: 271px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the day, multiple speakers gave their thoughts about how to respond to the changes of the digital revolution; and in short how to include our audiences, let them be part of the experience, be a partner in the conversation. The most interesting discussions were around the trends in using your audience for your own organisation's growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was much praise for our friends of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Their presentation about their new web approach, which shows off all their public domain images (125,000 documents) got much enthusiasm from the audience. Visit the Rijksstudio here, all the images can be used in any way you like: <a href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/rijksstudio\">https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/rijksstudio</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Rijkstudio\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Rijksstudio%20(1).jpg\" style=\"width: 284px; height: 177px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another enlightening presentation came from the <a href=\"http://www.si.edu/\">Smithsonian Museum</a>. They used extensive audience research to get an idea of what their audience thinks about them. This way they became aware of their 'brand' as experienced by their users. They asked their audience to formulate their brand in the form of a 'persona'. The result was a persona that was not entirely how they would like to see themselves - namely a pipe-smoking, older white male, condescending and authoritative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the question became - how could they change this brand into the person that they wanted to be? After describing this person: age, tone of voice etc., the Smithsonian put a lot of time into implementing their new brand internally: identifying internal evangelists, spreading ownership about the brand across the organisation. This took them one year, making guidelines, creating hands-on workshops, creating tools and reference materials. One of the things I found particularly smart is that they gave workshops to employers on how words and images shape organisations (this is something that not many of your coworkers think about on a day-to-day basis).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this year of internal implementation, they went public with their new brand. They used advertising but their campaign relied heavily on social media. The two target groups were 'millenials' (young adults, everyone accustomed to using the web) and stay-at-home moms - apparently they are very internet-savvy and aware of what is happening online. The overall idea of the campaign was 'asking questions, finding answers', for which the answers were to be found in the Smithsonian and they came up with multiple 'ask the curator' concepts. What the Smithsonian found particularly helpful was asking: 'how can we be useful to our followers' lives? They came up with a smart way of thinking, setting up a 'newsroom approach', taking news of the day and creating a link to their own collections. This way they gave their users more in-depth news, creating a natural link to their own collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fellow Dutchman Joost Heijthuijsen got much love from the audience for his 'open approach'. As director of the Incubate Festival in Tilburg, The Netherlands, Joost used visitors as programmers for the festival, letting them decide what to book for the festival. Joost said that: 'being open and showing how fragile we are actually helped us'. Visitors felt more connected to them and tried to help them where they could. In return, the Incubate Festival handed out loyalty cards to followers for social media activities, rewarding them for their contributions. Their philosophy is: if you get everyone invested in your brand, you don't need a marketing team.</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Recommendations for the representation of hierarchical objects in Europeana'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today's blog comes from Valentine Charles, Interoperability Specialist for Europeana and The European Library.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network/task-forces/overview#Hierarchical%20objects\">Task Force on hierarchical objects</a> is pleased to announce that its report, 'Recommendations for the representation of hierarchical objects in Europeana' is now available. This report has been put together thanks to the collaboration of representatives from the various domains contributing to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term ‘hierarchical objects’ refers to items in Europeana which relate to each other in some way, for example, archive or library items. Hierarchical relationships are important if a user is to make sense of a related group of items. The Task Force's aim is to identify different cases where hierarchies (including sequenced hierarchies) could represent a challenge in Europeana. For example, a book where each page has been digitised separately, an archival fonds, a film divided into several sequences. For each of the identified cases, the Task Force provides a representation in the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM). </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/arbre.jpg\" style=\"width: 463px; height: 637px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200103/6CD4CA425CA1EF2593A51F41A9B9D73C0B422F65.html\">Arbre généalogique des descendants de Henri IV</a>: [estampe], Bibliothèque Nationale de France, public domain</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue of hierarchical objects has always been an important topic for Europeana’s network of projects and data providers. The implementation of solutions in the Europeana portal has been delayed for a long time mainly due to the fact that complex objects required the development of new functionalities that could not be supported by the Europeana Semantics Elements (ESE) model. The creation of this Task Force has been motivated by the creation and implementation of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">Europeana Data Model (EDM)</a> in Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report is based on the findings made in case studies provided by each member of the Task Force. It identifies the various types of hierarchies that can be found in cultural heritage objects and the challenges they contain. For each challenging situation, the Task Force has proposed data representation solutions using the Europeana Data Model. This includes best practices for handling various cases such as the representation of missing parts in hierarchies and data propagation issues. The report also provides some ideas for the display of these complex objects in search interfaces such as Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Task Force hopes that these recommendations will encourage data providers to provide more complex objects to Europeana and therefore will allow Europeana to build new functionalities for its portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/get-involved/europeana-tech/europeanatech-task-forces/hierarchical-objects\">Download the report: 'Recommendations for the representation of hierarchical objects in Europeana'</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thank all the members of the Task Force for their contributions to this report: Alessia Bardi (HOPE project), Allison Kupietzky (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem), Antoine Isaac, (Europeana Foundation), Dan Matei (CIMEC), Donald Weber (HOPE project) Kerstin Arnold (Bundesarchiv, APEx project), Maria Luisa Martinez Conde (Ministry of Culture Spain), Michael Fingerhut (Bibliomus.org), Robina Clayphan (Europeana Foundation), Rodolphe Bailly (Cité de la musique), Stefanie Rühle (Goettingen State and University Library), Valentine Charles (Europeana Foundation) , Xavier Agenjo (Fundación Ignacio Larramendi).</p>\r\n"

        title: 'High school students use Europeana to celebrate library anniversary'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana is helping the '<a href=\"http://www.libvar.bg/library/slaveikov-eng.html\">Pencho Slaveykov</a>' Library in Varna, Bulgaria, to celebrate its 130th anniversary with a national competition engaging students with their digital cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Varna Library’s collaboration with Europeana started in 2008, when it began enriching Europeana's content with digital objects from Bulgaria. The cooperation proved valuable and today there are more than 30,000 Bulgarian items available online through Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Library is helping to raise awareness of Europeana in Bulgaria and at the start of this year a national contest called 'My Europeana' was launched in schools across the country to coincide with the library’s 130th anniversary. The aim of the contest was to encourage high school students to explore and discover the rich cultural treasures of Europeana and to either make a short video or write an essay on their favourite place, person or event from Bulgaria’s cultural and historical heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Emilia%20Milkova%20(liavo)%20pobediteli%20v%20konkursa%20i%20Eleanor%20Kenny%20(diasno).jpg\" style=\"width: 468px; height: 261px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Competition winners with Emilia Milkova, Director of Varna Library (left), Eleanor Kenny from Europeana (right), and a birthday cake celebrating 130 years of Varna Library.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jill Cousins, Executive Director of Europeana said:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Varna Library has been an important partner in making Bulgaria’s rich cultural heritage available for everyone to discover online through Europeana. And we are delighted that on its 130th anniversary, it has taken Europeana into schools and introduced a whole new generation to European cultural treasures via their smartphones, tablets and laptops.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Dozens of essays and videos were received from students on subjects ranging from Maria Atanasova, the first Bulgarian woman pilot who commanded commercial flights and is the only woman to have landed a heavy plane in difficult weather at Heathrow, to the history of the famous writer, Aleko Konstantinov. From the entries, it is clear that Europeana has been inspirational to students. Their entries showed how, inspired by the competition, they had visited a 4th century basilica, rediscovered the heritage of their region, learnt about the history of foreign language education in Bulgaria, and used Europeana as a tool in completing their school homework in many subjects!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/62602288\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/62602288\"><i>Bulgaria Europeana Awareness competition winner 1</i></a><i> a group entry by students from the 'Cinema man' club from High School of Foreign Languages, Varna, from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a></i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Converted_file_c733da3c.jpg\" style=\"width: 469px; height: 250px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>One of the members of the 'Cinema man' club (left) receives their prize for first-placed video from Europeana's Eleanor Kenny (centre) and judge and artist Vladimir Ivanov (right).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essays and videos were judged by a panel of library and cultural professionals including renowned artists from Varna, known for their contribution to the culture and development of the city. Six winning entries, submitted by entrants aged between 14 and 18 years old, received their awards at a special ceremony in Varna Library on 21 March. The prize for first-place in the video and essay categories was a Nexus tablet, second-placed winners received Kindle e-readers and the third-placed entrants received digital cameras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/62602290\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/62602290\"><i>Bulgaria Europeana Awareness competition winner 2 </i></a><i>by Anelya Kalcheva, 18 years old, First Language High School, who would like to pursue a career in photography from Varna, from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a></i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/900548/f03ba04d-e6bd-4341-9f8b-25f14455bc5d\">Read the winning essays here</a>, by 18-year-old Yulia Videva (National High School of Humanitarian Studies and Arts), 14-year-old Alexandra Peneva (Mathematics High School), and 18-year-old Steffany Jeliazkova (First Mathematics High School).

It is expected that the exhibition will open in Sofia in summer 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/62602289\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/62602289\"><i>Bulgaria Europeana Awareness competition winner 3 </i></a><i>by Damyana Petrova, 15 years old, First Language High School, Varna, from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</i></p>\r\n"

        body: "<p>After weeks of testing, 3 surveys and countless feedback from you all – we’re now excited to announce the launch of the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">new and improved Europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/new%20portal.png\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 432px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest improvements that you’ve probably seen us blog and tweet about is that the new portal is responsive, meaning it now automatically adapts to a range of different devices and screen sizes. So whether you’re using a touch screen smartphone or a large desktop, the portal will tailor its presentation so it always looks great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/New%20portal%20multiple%20devices.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 271px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another neat improvement is to do with the automatic suggestions that pop up as you type your search query. This means it’s now easier and faster to search Europeana because we’ll predict what you’re looking for and make recommendations based on that before you’ve even finished typing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve made changes so that it’s easier for users to identify Europeana’s treasures and get on with exploring them. Together with those improvements, the new homepage includes a stronger focus on our curated content, with a bigger image slideshow, a featured partner section and a carousel highlighting our latest pins on Pinterest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you'd like your organisation or content to be included as a featured partner or featured item, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:marcomms@europeana.eu\">marcomms@europeana.eu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has provided feedback during the review process. You can now go to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">new portal</a> and give it a whirl - let us know what you think!</p>\r\n"

        body: "<p><i>Today's blog is from Julia Brungs, Policy and Projects Officer at the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitisation and preservation of cultural heritage is a subject which is close to everyone’s heart. It is essential for our everyday work and defines how institutions are run, how material is made accessible, and most importantly how it is preserved. Last year in September, UNESCO hosted the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/events/calendar-of-events/events-websites/the-memory-of-the-world-in-the-digital-age-digitization-and-preservation/\">Memory of the World Conference</a> in Vancouver, Canada. The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (<a href=\"http://www.ifla.org/\">IFLA</a>) took part by representing the library sector at this important event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Ingrid%20Parent%20IFLA%20president.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 739px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Ingrid Parent, IFLA President, speaking at the Vancouver conference.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after the event, UNESCO released the ‘<a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/mow/unesco_ubc_vancouver_declaration_en.pdf\">Vancouver Declaration on Digitisation and Preservation</a>’. IFLA, together with International Council on Archives (<a href=\"http://www.ica.org/\">ICA</a>), played a key role in formulating the goals outlined in the resulting Vancouver Declaration. Some of the most important recommendations to UNESCO, its Member States, professional stewardship associations and the private sector, are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>the creation of a cohesive, conceptual and practical digital strategy to address the management and preservation of recorded information in all its forms in the digital environment;</li>\r\n    <li>the creation of a digital preservation framework and practices for management and preservation;</li>\r\n    <li>the adaption of an international legal framework of copyright exceptions and limitations to ensure preservation of and access to cultural heritage in digital format;</li>\r\n    <li>the encouragement of closer collaboration among international professional associations and other international bodies to develop academic curricula for digitisation and digital preservation, and to implement training programmes for management and preservation of digital information;</li>\r\n    <li>the creation of a multi-stakeholder forum for the discussion of standardisation in digitisation and digital preservation practices, including the establishment of digital format registries;</li>\r\n    <li>the formulation of strategies for open government and open data that address the need to create and maintain trust and reliance in digital government records;</li>\r\n    <li>the enhancement of cooperation with the private sector for the development of products that facilitate the long-term retention and preservation of information recorded in a digital format.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Digitisation%20at%201914-1918%20roadshow.jpg\" style=\"width: 499px; height: 666px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Digitisation of World War One memorabilia at a <a href=\"http://www.europeana1914-1918.eu\">Europeana 1914-1918</a> Family History Roadshow.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Declaration furthermore stresses that the current trend of the underestimation of the value of digitised objects has to be stopped in order to preserve our heritage for future generations to come. This will ensure everybody’s right to access to information, as formulated by the Declaration of Human Rights article 19, with regards to our digital heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana addresses the issue of digital preservation in its everyday work as well as through several of its related services and projects such as <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a> and <a href=\"http://www.apex-project.eu/\">APEX</a>. The outcomes of the Vancouver Declaration and the roadmap following on from it therefore relate directly to Europeana and the Europeana Network. IFLA, ICA, and the Dutch Commission of UNESCO are actively working on implementing the roadmap of the Declaration.

        body: "<p>I have worked in the Europeana Office for just over three years now as its Technical and Operations Director. It has been a wonderful experience, and now it is time for me to move on. And I still love Europeana – here’s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana connects people with their cultural heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is, of course, our core mission, the reason Europeana exists. With a lot of digitisation efforts under way throughout Europe, creating a place where people can actually find information about digitised content helps maximise the value of those efforts. People use Europeana for entertainment and travel, for education, for research. Not just through our portal, <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana.eu</a>, but also through other sites and apps built on our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">API</a>. Try it out for yourself: do a search on your family name, your home town, your favourite author and be surprised by the riches that you will find. For example, I found this image, titled <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92034/666518D4D3B2808F4891C0205E7D41214CA5F108.html\">'Familie Molendijk uit Pernis'</a> - it's my great-great-uncle and his family, in the village that I grew up in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana connects people IN cultural heritage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Europeana Network, we connect to over 500 professionals in the cultural heritage field. In the European Commission sponsored projects, we work with hundreds of institutions toward a common goal. In doing so, we see all sorts of relationships develop between those partners, all moving forward towards the idea of a Cultural Commons. An ecosystem is springing up of institutions, projects, aggregators, professionals, and scientists. As in every ecosystem, some of these will thrive and some will struggle, but they are all connected by the common goal of caring for and providing access to culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana not only creates ‘Open Culture Labs’, in a very real sense it already is one</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Practical innovation is the core of what we do, with <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/edm-documentation\">EDM</a> (our cross-domain data model), with large-scale aggregation processes, by encouraging data providers to open up their metadata under CC0 etc. These processes are open and inclusive – we encourage and actively seek Network contributions and all of our software and models are available under an Open Source licence. We have already seen a first commercial spin-off of Europeana in <a>Delving</a>, a company that supports cultural heritage institutions with software and services, building on our Open Source code.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana is a group of very talented and motivated people, both in the office and the Europeana Network</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The 50 or so people in the Europeana Office and The European Library (TEL) are under quite some pressure, because there is always more that we want to do. They work very hard, and with a smile, too. Through a more structured process of business planning, we have become better at defining and prioritising our activities, which should help in relieving some of the pressure. The Network is a great help as well – there is just so much knowledge and experience out there, and many people in the Network have been quite generous with their time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Europeana gives access to an incredible amount of great stuff</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This never ceases to amaze me and fill me with pride at the same time. Saying that we now hold almost 27 million objects is meaningless – people are very bad at grasping such large numbers. What it means for me in practice is that whenever I want to find something about any particular subject, I almost always find relevant and exciting ‘stuff’. An example: you may know the American sitcom ‘The Big Bang Theory'. Its opening sequence is a rapid-fire series of images illustrating the history of the world from the first amoeba to the present day. Harald Kraft, a German fan, has created <a href=\"http://haraldkraft.de/thebigbangtheory/\">a list</a> of these images and did research on what they represented. In all there are 109 images, and in more than 90 cases I was able to find a corresponding object in Europeana, the majority of these under an open licence. Here's one of them:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Pyramids.jpg\" style=\"width: 501px; height: 346px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/A3FA9A851EB5E251264084F135ADA1E27476670F.html\">'Egypt: the pyramids at Giza and the Sphinx'</a>, Wellcome Library, CC-BY-NC</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During 2011, I kept a <a href=\"http://jmeuropeana.wordpress.com\">blog</a>, that (almost) every day illustrated historical events with Europeana objects. If a nerd like me can create such things, imagine what really creative people like you can do with the content in Europeana. It is all there, waiting for you to explore, enjoy and re-use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS. The title for this blog I borrowed/stole from Douglas Adams’ series 'The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy'. And yes, Europeana holds not one, but two <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=hitchhikers+guide\">references</a> to this, both literary studies into the genius that is Douglas Adams. And there are lots of <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=vis+prent\">fish in Europeana</a> as well. Need I go on?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PPS. In case you’re wondering, after leaving Europeana, I will be working in the field of educational publishing, going back to an application of ICT that I explored in my masters thesis over 25 years ago. At the time you would have been hard-pressed to find even one PC per school, and now a PC or tablet for every student is quickly becoming the norm. I am looking forward to also make the connection between education and Europeana content. I’ll be in touch!</p>\r\n"

        title: 'Europeana Impressions: Pinterest, Facebook & Wikipedia'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p>Europeana’s 2013 Business Plan was <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-business-plan-2013-published\">published last week</a>. You might have noticed an interesting KPI (and a personal favourite of mine) under the ‘Distribute’ track - we hope to generate 20.5 million impressions of Europeana content on other sites, namely Facebook and Wikipedia this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to online measurement,we are excited to be exploring new avenues, in particular off-site metrics and the reach of the content available via Europeana. It is easy enough to measure on-site metrics such as visits, bounce rates and time on site. I think it’s safe to say we have mastered that; however what happens to the content we hold once it is re-used and lives outside its original source? Does re-use on social media and Wikipedia ultimately impact traffic to Europeana and do impressions convert to visits or engagement? We are on a mission to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(23).jpg\" style=\"width: 630px; height: 420px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to the launch of a new analytics suite within Pinterest, we are now able to estimate the number of impressions of Europeana content on that platform in 2012 and compare them with corresponding metrics for Facebook and Wikipedia. As mentioned in my previous blog post this is great news as one of the main pitfalls highlighted in our <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1587205\">Pinterest case study</a> is the lack of integrated statistics, now we will be able to see how content really performs, rather than simply relying on referral traffic as a loose indication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We estimate that Pinterest generated 3.5 million impressions last year – that is, content from Europeana.eu pinned by Europeana and end-users that appeared on Pinterest in someone’s main feed, in search results, or on boards. On Facebook, content from Europeana’s Facebook page appeared on people’s news feeds \_4.2million times. Finally, on Wikipedia, we estimate that 173 images from Europeana that are part of Wikipedia articles were seen 13.7 million times.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of total impression numbers,Wikipedia wins hands downs due to the obvious volume of traffic to articles; however Facebook sends almost as much traffic to Europeana as Pinterest and Wikipedia combined. As a result, we can calculate some conversion rates: 0.71% of Facebook impressions resulted in a visit to Europeana, 0.24% on Pinterest and 0.16% on Wikipedia. These figures are simply indications; Wikipedia visits include those unrelated to content impressed in an article – however they are certainly interesting and definitely food for thought.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, there were an estimated 32,000 engaged users on Europeana’s Facebook page. An engagement indicator includes any click or story/post created by Europeana. Pinterest saw an estimated 12,000 re-pins of Europeana content, however unfortunately this figure does not include comments or ‘likes’ on content. Despite this, 0.34% of impressions resulted in re-pins and 0.76% of impressions on Facebook resulted in an engagement indicator. These findings show that content impressions on other sites are more likely to raise engagement indicators on the platform rather than send traffic directly to your own website. It is also interesting to see that despite the fact that we are unable to record comments and ´licks´ on Pinterest, the engagement rate is still higher when compared to Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that the measurement of off-site metrics is important as it not only helps justify the value of re-use and social media, but highlight the potential of end-user engagement outside of the Europeana portal. By mapping out the jigsaw, we can build a more complete picture of our users and how re-use can lead to engagement indicators and visits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next year, we will be working to expand our measurement of off-site metrics and we are interested in hearing about your own experiences. Are you measuring the re-use of content on social media, Flickr, Wikipedia, etc.? If so get in touch with Neil Bates (neil.bates@kb.nl).</p>\r\n\r\n"

        body: "<p>Yesterday, we announced the launch of Europeana Cloud. Today, it's the turn of Europeana Creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeanacreative.eu\">Europeana Creative </a>is an exciting new European project which will enable and promote greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by Europe’s creative industries. The project was launched at the end of February 2013 at the Austrian National Library in Vienna and will run for 30 months. 26 partners from 14 European countries with diverse backgrounds are contributing to the project. These include content-providing institutions with world-famous collections, creative industry hubs and organisations, the tourism and education sectors, living labs, software developers and multimedia experts, as well as think tanks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/Images/Europeana_Creative_images/Meeting%20photos/Creative%20kickoff.jpg\" style=\"width: 432px; height: 300px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The Europeana Creative team</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> provides access to more than 26 million digitised cultural heritage objects from Europe’s libraries, museums, archives and audiovisual collections. The Europeana Creative project sets out to demonstrate that Europeana can facilitate the creative re-use of digital cultural heritage content and associated metadata. Partners will develop a number of pilot applications focused on design, tourism, education and social networks. Building on these pilots, a series of open innovation challenges will be launched with entrepreneurs from the creative industries to identify, incubate and spin-off more viable projects into the commercial sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project goals will be supported by an open laboratory network (the Open Culture Lab), an on- and offline environment for experimentation with content, tools and business services, and a licensing framework where content holders can specify the re-use conditions for their material. The project will be supported by continuous evaluation and business modelling development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The re-use of digital content is an essential part of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Several activities are already stimulating the re-use of cultural heritage in order to demonstrate the social and economic value of cultural content. With the publication of the Europeana metadata under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0) in September 2012, further development of innovative applications based on this metadata is now possible. Europeana Creative takes this a step further by facilitating re-use of the digital objects themselves.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Blog by Friedel Grant (The European Library) and Susan Reilly (LIBER).</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its potentially inauspicious title, the kick-off of the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud</a> project took place over two sunny and cloud-free days in The Hague.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This initial meeting on 4-5 March marked the official start of three years of collaboration between 35 partners. It is a diverse group, including representatives of libraries, research infrastructures, developers, publishers and researchers. They come from many different backgrounds but nevertheless share a common goal of establishing a cloud-based system for Europeana and its aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana-Cloud-Group-Kick-Off%20-smalljpg.jpg\" style=\"width: 630px; height: 398px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Partners at the Europeana Cloud kick-off meeting</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Europeana Cloud </a>website describes the project’s goals as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Content providers and aggregators across the European information landscape urgently need a cheaper, more sustainable infrastructure that is capable of storing both metadata and content. Researchers require a digital space where they can undertake innovative exploration and analysis of Europe's digitised content. Europeana needs to get closer to the target of 30 million items by 2015. Europeana Cloud meets these needs.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The kick-off meeting was opened by Europeana’s Executive Director, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JilCos\">Jill Cousins</a>. She introduced the Europeana ecosystem and outlined the drivers and motivations for establishing a cloud-based service to be used by Europeana and its aggregators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Project coordinator <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alastairdunning\">Alastair Dunning</a> followed this by describing the work of the project, its stakeholders and the challenges that need to be addressed over the course of the next three years. He also introduced the three initial aggregators which will provide content to the cloud: <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:The+European+Library&amp;qf=TYPE:VIDEO\">Europeana</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/virtual/regia\">The European Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://fbc.pionier.net.pl/owoc\">Polish Digital Libraries Federation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Cloud%20kick-off%20meeting.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Generating ideas at the Europeana Cloud kick-off meeting</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main aim of the meeting was to encourage interaction and discussion between project partners, many of whom had not worked together before. Several workshops took place during the meeting and through these sessions, participants explored barriers to research, information access and collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They also identified solutions to these barriers, outlined the types of content that should be made available in Europeana Cloud and discussed the technical requirements of such an infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is much work to be done over the coming years in order to ensure that Europeana Cloud realises its potential and becomes a robust infrastructure, serving the needs of the humanities and social science researcher as well as the content provider. The first step is to engage researchers, in order to scope potential tools and services as well as gaps in content that need to be filled. Legal and technical issues will also arise and will need to be addressed. Work on this last point will be done through engagement and dialogue with related projects such as <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative\">Europeana Creative</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-cloud\">Find out more about this project and its partners</a> and see <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-office/presentations/-/document_library_display/pEx5/view/1592299\">presentations </a>from the kick-off meeting.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>In 2012, our end-user engagement programme explored the value of <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana\">Pinterest</a> for cultural heritage institutions, taking content from five Europeana partners, the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/jordi-sabater-pi-by-the-university-of-barcelona/\">University of Barcelona</a>, <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/barcelona-of-the-past-by-the-biblioteca-de-catalun/\">Biblioteca de Catalunya</a>, the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/carl-curman-collection-landscapes-by-the-swedish-n/\">Swedish National Heritage Board</a>, <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/the-black-sea-coast-by-the-varna-public-library/\">Varna Public Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/the-royal-armoury-swedish-royal-history/\">Swedish Royal Armoury</a>. By presenting their content outside the constraints of the portal and institutional websites, Pinterest provided new visibility and interaction with collections that might otherwise have remained unseen. We were curious to explore the effects of opening up data for re-use on social media, in particular, to see what would happen in terms of social interactions on Pinterest and the nature of the referral traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/image_gallery%20(24).jpg\" style=\"width: 630px; height: 353px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project started with two clear aims. We wanted to boost traffic from social media, which currently represents 2% of the overall traffic for Europeana.eu. This may seem like a small amount, but we know that those 2% are <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/end-user-research%3A-why-we-love-visitors-from-social-media\" title=\"blocked::http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/end-user-research:-why-we-love-visitors-from-social-media\">good quality visitors</a>. We were also interested to see what kind of activity we could expect from Pinterest users and we would analyse this by looking at the traffic the platform sends to Europeana. Ultimately we anticipated that sharing 225 high-quality images from five European heritage institutions across 10 thematic collections on Pinterest had the potential to reap great rewards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center; \"><em>\"Pinterest allows us to highlight and distinguish content from the Biblioteca de Catalunya that might otherwise be hidden; it’s a great way to reach new audiences that are not aware of our Library and the collections we hold.\"</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: right; \">Eugenia Serra<br>\r\nDirector, Biblioteca de Catalunya</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div>You can learn more about what we did and what the results were from the embedded case study below, or alternatively you can <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/0/Case+Study%3A++Europeana+%26+Partners+on+Pinterest\">download it</a>.</div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"570\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/17224879\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:5px\">\n<strong><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/NeilBates2/case-study-europeana-partners-on-pinterest-neil-bates\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Case Study: Europeana &amp; Partners on Pinterest\">Case Study: Europeana &amp; Partners on Pinterest</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/NeilBates2\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Bates</a></strong>\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of January I participated in an Open Data Case Studies Workshop in Paris, organised by Europeana and INA (Institut national de l'audiovisuel). Our Pinterest case study will form part of a larger white paper on open data. In order to evaluate the potential of ‘open’, we analysed other real-life examples of services based on open data from the BBC, the National Gallery of Denmark, Netherlands Sound and Vision Institute, and the Polish Digital Libraries Federation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Next Step – Case Study Version 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to an <a href=\"http://blog.pinterest.com/post/45179268152/introducing-pinterest-web-analytics\" title=\"blocked::http://blog.pinterest.com/post/45179268152/introducing-pinterest-web-analytics\">announcement this week from Pinterest</a> on the launch of their new ‘Pinterest Web Analytics’, our Pinterest case study will soon be updated to include clicks, reach and impressions on the platform. Great news as one of the main pitfalls highlighted in the case study is the lack of integrated statistics, now we will be able to see how content really faired, rather than simply relying on referral traffic as a loose indication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana marketing team are planning four more of these engagement concepts throughout 2013, working with partners on the re-use of content on new and innovative platforms. With a strong focus on tracking and measuring these concepts, we will be sharing our experiences with you throughout the year in the form of a number of case studies, so keep your eyes peeled. We are also interested in hearing your experiences, be it on social media, Wikipedia or other platforms – what have you learnt?</p>\r\n"

        title: 'How the Horizon Report Museum Edition was developed'
        posttype: News

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i><a href=\"http://www.nmc.org/publications/2012-horizon-report-museum\">The Horizon Report 2012 Museum Edition</a>, which mentions Europeana as an example of ’Open Content in Practice’, is an influential publication </i><i>that focuses on technology use in museums and is </i><i>read by over one million people a year. The work that put it together took place on a wiki and could be described as 'crowd-sourced research'. </i><i>In this extended blog post, </i><i>Dr Susan Hazan, Curator of New Media at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, </i><i>describes the reality TV-style processes and the brave choices the Board faced. Dr Hazan </i><i>is on the Horizon Project’s Advisory Board and is also is a Europeana Network member, a member of the Europeana End-User Research Workgroup and is Co-Chair of the User-Generated Content Task Force. </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Horizon_cover.jpg\" style=\"width: 493px; height: 426px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Image from the cover of the Horizon report. © Harold M. Miller, courtesy of The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://museum.wiki.nmc.org/Advisory+Board\">Horizon Project Advisory Board</a> came together last September with project leader Dr. Larry Johnson (Chief Executive Officer of the New Media Consortium, Horizon Project Founder and Co-Principal Investigator), Koven Smith (Project Co-PI) and Dr. Holly Witchey (Editor and Co-PI), to produce the second Museum Edition of the Horizon Report. The group of multi-disciplinary thinkers, including 42 curators, educators, web developers, and cultural heritage specialists, focused on the application of emerging technologies for museums. The Report dealt with digitally mediated platforms and experiences drawn from museum practice around the world with the goal of surveying them for their educational and interpretation qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Described as the consensus sapientum (unanimity of the wise), the <a href=\"http://www.nmc.org/horizon-project\">Horizon Project</a> is a qualitative research project that crowd-sources the expertise of the group in order to identify museum education technologies, to rank their potential impact for digitally mediated interpretation, and to map them across specific timelines. The goal of this process was not to prescribe tools, but rather to highlight those technologies with the greatest potential for education and interpretation. As the intense research progressed, the group whittled down the list to eventually reveal the six key emerging technologies that would influence museum education over the next five years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of this process was a report on the projects that promised the widest impact and potential for adoption from across the museum sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Time-to-Adoption Horizon: One Year or Less\r\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile Apps</li>\r\n    <li>Social Media</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTime-to-Adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Augmented Reality</li>\r\n    <li>Open Content</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTime-to-Adoption Horizon: Four to Five Years\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The Internet of Things</li>\r\n    <li>Natural User Interfaces\r\n    <ul></ul>\n</li>\r\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The previous Museum Edition had been downloaded more than 25,000 times and the Board expected an increased readership the following year. With such an impressive track record of readership, this suggested a significant impact on strategic technology-planning in museums in dozens of countries around the world. NMC estimates that the readership of the Horizon Report - covering various aspects of education - stands at over a million people a year across all its various editions and spans more than 150 countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work took place via a wiki. As we logged in, we discovered extensive resources alluding to the work up ahead: a hoard of news and press clippings; Delicious.com-tagged resources; links to our previous editions of the report; descriptions of dozens of emerging technologies, and much, much more! Those of us who had participated in the previous Museum Edition helped the others to understand that we were growing this resource together as we worked. For the newcomers, as I remembered from the previous year, this must have looked like quite a daunting challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started out by reviewing the articles, reports, press clippings and other materials on the site, adding our own as we ploughed through the maze of information and ideas. The material had already been carefully culled by the project staff from hundreds of leading sources. The background reading was both challenging and inspiring. We tagged the press clippings with our signature by simply adding 4 tildes to the end of the article, like this ~~~~. This made the popular content more visible because as soon as the signatures started to populate the articles, it became clear where the consensus was emerging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were, in fact, a couple of hundred links in our secondary research, all annotated and organised into seven categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Emerging Technologies</li>\r\n    <li>Challenges and Trends</li>\r\n    <li>Published 'Technologies to Watch' Lists</li>\r\n    <li>Technology in Popular Culture</li>\r\n    <li>Reports and Research</li>\r\n    <li>Miscellanea - Stories, Examples, Food for Thought</li>\r\n    <li>Essays and Interviews on the Future</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>We were asked to review the headlines in each category and to select 2-3 items that we thought our colleagues on the Advisory Board should definitely read. As we continued with our evaluation into our chosen sections, we again added our 4 tildes (~~~~) to indicate what we thought was worth sharing. Although this was fairly labour intensive, the material was so fascinating that it was difficult to ‘switch off’ and go back to our usual work duties and day jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the editorial team, the work was meant to accomplish two things from a research perspective:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\n<li>To provide a quick and dirty way to reduce the set of background readings for the group with the sorted list persisting as an artifact of the work that can be shared with others.</li>\r\n    <li>To improve the reliability of the responses the group would put to the research questions once the Advisory Board had crowd-sourced the data.</li>\r\n</ol>\n<p>Once again, we were invited to add our own clippings, comments or examples of our own work to further enhance the data set before answering the research questions on the wiki. At this stage, we were asked to select around 5 topics in order to identify the critical challenges museums face when making technology choices. The next stage was designed to capture key trends that we considered were fuelling the development of technologies of interest to museums. At all stages we were encouraged to add our own comments or URLs to the list if we felt that anything was missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final and most critical stage was the ranking of the research questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dealing with each of the research questions in turn, we were asked to identify technologies that we judged will be important along each of 3 adoption horizons. Our votes were divided into 3 sub-questions, one for each adoption horizon and we were allowed to assign multiple votes per horizon according to our own assessments. The way we used our votes was up to us – we could allot all 10 votes to a single item, 2 votes for one or more items, or spread out all of the 10 votes equally. As we whittled down the list, voting for a specific topic on one horizon, it was no longer available on any of the other two horizons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we moved on to the short list. Using the 'Horizon Project Voting Tool' we tackled the 12 semifinalists for the report, along with 10 key challenges and 11 key trends. Our goal was to eliminate just one item from each of the horizons leaving three still standing in each horizon, and one each from the trends and challenges in a reverse-ranking process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we had spent many hours reading and mulling over the material up to this point, the voting process was reminiscent of a reality show and really quite fun. We were cued to start the voting process like this…</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><b>'Welcome to SURVIVOR! Horizon.Museum Edition. The tiki lamps are lit, and the Advisory Board is assembled in virtual space. Each of you now faces a set of difficult choices. </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(cue tom-toms)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Which of the items listed within each of our three adoption horizons do you think is weakest and *least* deserving of inclusion in the report? And which of the trends and challenges?</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><u>You</u> will decide...</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(cut to screen shots of the web)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(louder tom-toms, camera close up, pans Advisory Board members' faces as the narrator intones...)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>...which of these are <u>not going to survive?</u></b>'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(cue discordant musical flourish; quickly fade to black)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking our way through the topics, challenges and key trends we bravely made our choices; chopping away at the ones we felt least relevant and laying bare the ones who were to survive. I found the process fascinating and now we hope that you will find the Report interesting and useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>More information</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The Report is available on: <a href=\"http://www.nmc.org/publications/2012-horizon-report-museum\">http://www.nmc.org/publications/2012-horizon-report-museum</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NMC Horizon Report: 2012 Museum Edition is a publication of the New Media Consortium and the Marcus Institute for Digital Education in the Arts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citation<br>\r\nJohnson, L., Adams Becker, S., Witchey, H., Cummins, M., Estrada V., Freeman, A., and Ludgate, H., (2012).

        body: "<p>Europeana's scientific coordinator Antoine Isaac is today participating in a panel on '<a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP4580\">Culture Hack: Libraries &amp; Museums Open for Making</a>' at this year's <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/interactive\">South By Southwest Interactive Festival</a> in Austin, Texas. The event offers the 'unique convergence of original music, independent films, and emerging technologies. Fostering creative and professional growth alike, SXSW® is the premier destination for discovery.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The programme describes Antoine's session as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>'Around the world, libraries, archives and museums are opening their doors to hackers, makers, enthusiasts and creatives of all kinds. By publishing Open Data, cultural heritage institutions are finding new ways to open access to their collections for remix and re-use, and promote new uses and interpretations of the works they hold. These international panelists will explore the many ways in which cultural heritage institutions are sharing content, what people are doing with this content, as well as exploring some of the thornier issues of open access across borders and institutions.'</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, the panel reflects our continuous efforts to <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/support-for-open-data\">raise awareness on Open Data issues </a>in the cultural domain and to reach a wider audience, as SXSW is one of the major conferences for emerging technology and (digital) culture. It is also an opportunity to re-enforce strategic partnerships and technology cross-fertilisation on both sides of the Atlantic, ahead of the coming <a href=\"http://lod-lam.net/summit/\">Linked Open Data in Libraries Archives and Museums (LOD-LAM) summit</a>, which will focus on Linked Open Data issues. Today's panel features prominent figures like: Rachel Frick, Program Director at CLIR Digital Library Federation; Emily Gore, Director for Content Digital Public Library Of America; and Sam Leon, OpenGLAM Community Coordinator at the Open Knowledge Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/sxsw.png\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 494px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year's SXSW is witnessing a strong presence from the <a href=\"http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2013/03/why-south-by-southwest-is-important-for-libraries-archives-and-museums/\">library, archive and museum community</a>, who are more and more aware of the importance of technical innovation in cultural heritage and digital information management. There is an awesome line-up of sessions on <a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP1149\">digital maps</a>, <a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP4032\">visualisation of large heritage collections</a>, <a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_MP4948\">citizen archivists</a> or <a href=\"http://schedule.sxsw.com/2013/events/event_IAP2696%5D\">libraries as a playground</a>. Other community-engagement actions include things like '<a href=\"http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/dplaalpha/2013/03/09/dpla-librarybox-and-sxswi/\">library boxes</a>' (digital file distribution tools which demonstrate the importance of libraries in a networked, social media-driven world) sponsored by the DPLA, which have been distributed at the event. Another initiative is the Er&amp;L (Electronic Resources and Libraries)<a href=\"http://www.electroniclibrarian.com/ideadrop\"> #ideadrop house</a> at SXSW, which will 'serve as a seriously fun place to drop ideas and a seriously great opportunity to dialogue about topics affecting libraries when the creative juices are flowing and where the big ideas are percolating.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More information</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch a <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/channel/ideadrop\">live video stream</a> of what's going on in the #ideadrop house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sxswLAM&amp;src=typd\">#sxswLAM</a> on Twitter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch <a href=\"http://sxsw.com/live\">live streaming</a> of the SXSW event sessions.</p>\r\n"

        intro: ''
        body: "<p>Europeana is pleased to announce that the <i>Europeana Business Plan 2013</i> is now available for download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Business Plan has been put together in consultation with the Europeana Network through a variety of workshops and meetings, and so is the result of much discussion and collaboration. We would like to thank all those who have contributed; we feel that this plan will provide us with real guidance over the coming year and truly reflects the priorities that we have set together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Business%20plan%202013.png\" style=\"width: 296px; height: 422px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Download the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/9d4632d3-3f6d-4162-ba29-27a9a739946d\"><i>Europeana Business Plan 2013</i></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As stated in the introduction to the document:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Europeana is part of an ever-expanding ecosystem. This is reflected in the number of projects, both technical and content-driven, the number of providers and aggregators, its funding and its current governance. The <i>Strategic Plan 2011-2015</i> is now halfway through its life. Each year, the Business Plan prioritises work according to the overall vision and the needs of the Network. 2013 is pivotal as the year in which emphasis can go into distribution and the year in which Europeana should start to show a return on investment. Release of the metadata under a CC0 waiver creates huge opportunities to place culture in the workflow of users but also delivers massive challenges in the development of a distributed system in which the portal is a channel in a wider family of services. Prioritisation needs to strike a balance between achieving the longer term vision of providing new forms of access to cultural heritage, inspiring creativity and stimulating social and economic growth, and being able to deliver to expectations.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, the Europeana Foundation and Network have identified three main areas to focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>The first is that Europeana needs to behave as an ecosystem, a community of shared interests and mutual dependencies. We will ensure that this is reflected in the ways that we communicate with each other and solve problems together, for example in the Task Forces. By acting as a movement, we can greatly increase our impact both inside and outside of the sector.</li>\r\n    <li>The second area of focus is our development into a Core Service Platform. This reflects the need for the Europeana Foundation to act as a facilitator - a catalyst of change in the cultural heritage sector. This means that we will work on developing interoperable resources and standards, including the source code, the dataset, the Europeana Data Model, the Licensing Framework and the API. Anyone in the cultural heritage sector and the creative industries should be able to benefit from this work to build new, innovative services.</li>\r\n    <li>Finally, we will concentrate on showcasing the value of opening up. Now that we have released the dataset under the CC0 waiver, we are in a much better position to develop valuable new services on top of the API and Linked Open Data set that will bring more visibility and re-usage for your content. We will work with you on establishing impact indicators and develop case studies to highlight the value that open data can create.</li>\r\n</ul>\n<p>You will see these priorities reflected across all of the work we do in the 4 strategic tracks (Aggregate, Facilitate, Distribute and Engage) through which we organise our activities. Even more than <i>what</i> we do, this will dictate <i>how</i> we do our work: always as a collective of partners, in a facilitative role, and with a strong belief that opening up access to our collective memory will contribute to a better shared understanding of our cultures and support a strong knowledge economy in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep an eye on this blog for information on our progress throughout the year.</p>\r\n\r\n"

        body: "<p><i>Neil Bates, Marketing Specialist, tells us why he's leading research into what users do and what users want.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Europeana has established a workgroup with the goal of increasing our collective knowledge of end-users – who they are, what they do, and what they want. The End-User Research Workgroup has 12 members from Europe’s museums, libraries and archives, and aims to analyse and generate meaningful and reliable research about the users of both Europeana and partner services. As the web becomes more fragmented and dispersed, we want to look at the bigger picture and from that, gain a better understanding of where users fit in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/End-User%20Research%20WorkGroup.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 330px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Image by <a href=\"http://500px.com/AlexanderRentsch\">Alexander Rentsch</a> - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/\">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first meeting entitled ‘Benchmarking Success’, which took place on 31 January in The Hague, members discussed a framework for benchmarking their websites against others, including Europeana. The meeting also explored the potential of opening up usage and traffic data across the Europeana Network. Doing this will give us a better and broader understanding of end-users across the cultural heritage sector and enable us to translate this data into real use cases – we can discover what implications end-user actions have on a site’s metrics. This will in turn facilitate the workgroup to explore why users engage with certain types of content, design, platform, or layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have already been very successful benchmarking initiatives on a national level, such as <a href=\"http://weareculture24.org.uk/projects/action-research/how-to-evaluate-success-online/\">Culture24’s 'Let's Get Real'</a> report from 2011. However, through Europeana and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/network\">its Network</a> there is a real opportunity to develop a similar study that is cross-domain and pan-European. It is evident that the people who are interested in the content Europeana and its partners hold, want to find it in places with which they are familiar. It is therefore not enough to analyse visits on Europeana or partner websites individually, we also need to look at the behaviour of users in the larger ecosystem of web services such as Wikipedia, Facebook and Pinterest. This way, we will learn much more about users of digitised cultural heritage across the sector than if we analysed only our own user bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Take Part: Benchmark Your Visitors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving forward from the first meeting, it has been agreed that members participating in the workgroup will contribute their traffic and usage data for a pilot study to be published in April. The study will be the basis for the next meeting which is due to take place in spring of this year, and at which the decision will be made on whether to expand the study further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to gain broad cross-domain representation from across the Network, we are inviting all heritage GLAM institutions to contribute their data to the study. In order to make things as easy as possible, we have generated custom report configurations for Google Analytics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those of you who want to participate, we have created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B91Rk6Y4HaPocjg3Wk9fRU8wSW8/edit?usp=sharing\">step-by-step guide</a> that tells you exactly what you need to do. The guide links to a series of Google Analytics custom reports – using these ensures that we are all collecting the same data, in the same way, giving us accurate and reliable data. We have also included optional steps for those of you willing to contribute Facebook Insights - as mentioned earlier, we are really interested in analysing the behaviour of users in the larger ecosystem of web services they use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For questions related to this study, the End-User Research Workgroup, or if you’d like to submit your traffic and usage data – please contact <a href=\"mailto:neil.bates@kb.nl\">Neil Bates</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        body: "<p><i>Europeana's Geer Oskam writes about an exciting new user engagement project. Read on if you like blogs, fashion in general or shoes in particular...</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the slipstream of the amazing coverage about the anticipated launch of Europeana Fashion - see <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/02/17/europeana-fashion-online-fashion-archive-to-launch\">Vogue UK</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/fashion/18iht-feur18.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1361797425-FlEvawWk0nBdnMSTQZ6UXA\">International Herald Tribune</a> – the Europeana Marketing and Communications team has launched a <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Fashion%20Tumblr.jpg\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 375px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The <a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">Europeana Fashion Tumblr</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana Fashion Tumblr is an end-user engagement project, much like the <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/europeana/\">Europeana Pinterest </a>project which was launched last year. The aim of these kinds of projects is to get Europeana content spread across the web, engaging end-users with unique cultural heritage in an innovative way. <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> is a microblogging service with over 70 million users, mainly young adults. Postings vary from texts and photos to quotes and videos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Europeana content provider that we will feature on the Tumblr is Northampton Museums. To begin with, we're focusing on their amazing <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=%22northampton%22\">shoe collection</a>. In the following months, we will post more fashion content and monitor users’ engagement with it, looking at things like referral traffic. This will give us a specific insight into the users’ behaviour. In a few months, we will hand over the Tumblr completely to the Europeana Fashion team after which we can explore user engagement on other platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Fashion%20shoe.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 497px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Women's Glace Kid Cromwell Shoes. Pointed toe, fastening with four bars and buttons in front; 5\" wooden plaster covered heels engraved with a gilt rococco pattern. Made by Charles Hind of 22 Park Terrace, Regents Park, London. These shoes were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. <a href=\"http://www.northampton.gov.uk/museums\">Northampton Museums &amp; Art Gallery</a></i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By setting up the Tumblr, we gain not only by spreading Europeana content and letting users engage with it but also by adding this project to a ‘Europeana end-user engagement repository'. The repository will be called GLAMusers and it will be used to inform and inspire the Europeana Network to do more with social media platforms. We are currently building the repository so do send us your suggestions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Help us make the Tumblr a success by sharing the link on your social media and, of course, pay it a visit for your own pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://europeanafashion.tumblr.com/\">europeanafashion.tumblr.com </a></p>\r\n"

        title: 'Introducing Network Officer Anne Bergman'

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today, we introduce you to another of our Europeana Network Officers. Meet book-lover Anne Bergman, Director of the Federation of European Publishers.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello, I have been asked to write a few lines of presentation for this blog...</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/blogimages/Anne%20Bergman.jpeg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 373px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Anne Bergman</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A medieval historian by training, for the last several years I have worked to support the European publishing community. I love reading, to a point where finding room for all these books is now becoming an issue! I have always been around books in libraries, book shops, in schools, in universities. I don’t think I have spent a day in my life without reading at least a few pages. Books are a fantastic way of travelling from your sofa to new countries, new lives, of discovering new habits, being a backpacker one day, a young Jewish girl hiding in the cellar the next, a Russian activist on yet another day - through reading, I can live hundreds of lives and I just love it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if books are my true passion, the other creative and artistic expressions are also very close to my heart. Going to art shows and exhibitions, watching ballets, movies or listening to concerts, these are fundamental to a person's well-being and self-building, certainly to mine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the internet, and the fantastic opportunities and great challenges it brings, could only capture my attention. How will we access these works now that everything seems seamless? How will this access impact on new creations and the lives of creators and investors? These are fascinating years, when everything seems possible, when everything can happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is all about balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a legitimate wish to access as much as possible of the culture that is out there, to hunger for culture. This is a huge opportunity for us publishers to develop new ways of accessing our books through multiple channels, to work with everyone, not forgetting our traditional allies - the booksellers and the librarians. The ecology of the book chain is a fragile one and we need to work together to find ways of preserving it as all the links are crucial. A book needs many actors, from the author to the prescriber via all the necessary steps of the publishing process, to transform itself from a manuscript (or rather a typescript?) into an object (or a file) which is desired by the readers. The internet has changed many things and today, if an author wants, he/she can decide to offer (for free or with a fee) his/her work directly to the public. Many authors still prefer to go down the more traditional publishing road, although anyone visiting a publishing house today will see that the traditional has actually become very modern. Authors have the choice. Once that choice is made it must be respected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How we will read books tomorrow (and the day after) is difficult to predict. Probably the only prediction we can make is that the devices will be different, they have evolved so much in the last few years and they will continue to do so in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as access is concerned, we need to look at solutions that nurture the ecology. For commercially available books, the solution will be different than for out-of-commerce works. I am happy that things are moving along in that field with the <a href=\"http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000027119991&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id\">French decree on out-of-commerce works</a>\_ having been finally published today (following a law passed year - 1/03/2012), and positive movements in Germany. Other countries should also follow the same path using the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/20110920-mou_en.pdf\">Memorandum of Understanding we signed last year with libraries</a>. Commercially available books can be accessed through booksellers/online retailers and many new initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.youboox.fr/\">streaming for comic books </a>and this is only the beginning… Publishers and librarians all over Europe are experimenting with innovative licensing models, and this needs to be encouraged. The future is bright for all those with an open mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is my take and this is what I can bring to the Europeana Network. I am encouraging publishers and other cultural and creative sectors to explore collaboration with Europeana. Culture is what makes Europe a very unique place, we cannot achieve anything alone, united we stand much stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to pursue the discussion with me, please <a href=\"mailto:abergman@fep-fee.eu\">write to me.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\_</p>"

        title: 'Tool compares Europeana and DPLA APIs'
        posttype: News
        featured: false
        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today, Xavier Agenjo from DIGIBIS (a company offering digitisation services and software solutions for cultural heritage institutions) tells us about their experiment comparing the Europeana API with the Digital Public Library of America API.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here at <a href=\"http://www.digibis.com/\">DIGIBÍS</a> we have been following the development of the Europeana ecosystem with great interest. We were the first Spanish company to integrate the Europeana Application Programming Interface (API) into a production website: <a href=\"http://hispana.mcu.es/\">Hispana</a>, the Spanish national aggregator and have since embedded the API for some other Spanish digital libraries. We also developed <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/europeana4j\">europeana4j</a>, a Java library that provides a clean Java interface for the Europeana Search API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Europeana4j%20(1).jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 332px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>The <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/europeana4j\">Europeana4j</a> Java library</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think that the <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/api\">Europeana API</a> is useful not only for large libraries but also, and perhaps even more so, for small and medium-sized institutions that can use it to complement their collections by adding all the content from Europeana in one search. We are also using the API from the <a href=\"http://dp.la/\">Digital Public Library of America</a> (DPLA), with the same basic objective. Many American institutions have large Hispanic collections about the history and culture of Spain and Latin America which are of great interest to us. Connections between European and American cultural heritage are obvious, as shown in the Europeana/DPLA exhibition <a href=\"http://blog.europeana.eu/2012/12/leaving-europe-a-new-life-in-america/\">'Leaving Europe: A New Life in America'</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are following the development of the Digital Public Library of America closely. We greatly appreciate the openness of this project, with its early prototypes and public discussion of its <a href=\"https://github.com/dpla/platform/wiki\">APIs</a>, and the collaboration between the DPLA and Europeana. The rapid maturing of the DPLA APIs, and the launch of the <a href=\"http://europeanalabs.eu/wiki/EuropeanaOpenSearchAPI\">EUROPEANA version 2 API</a>, gave us the idea of preparing a simple experiment to compare both APIs and evaluate the work needed to implement the DPLA API. Bartosz Zawada (DIGIBÍS Software Department) quickly accepted the challenge of preparing the tool you can find at <a href=\"http://www.digibis.com/dpla-europeana\">digibis.com/dpla-europeana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our test website presents a simple search box and shows the search results found at the DPLA and Europeana side by side. It allows quick comparison of the number of results from both sites, and easy navigation through those results, as an example, see this search for ‘<a href=\"http://www.digibis.com/dpla-europeana/#q=Albert+Einstein\">Albert Einstein</a>’. Each record shows all the information that the APIs return, with a link to the original source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/quixote.jpg\" style=\"width: 491px; height: 295px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>An example search of the Europeana and DPLA APIs for '<a href=\"http://www.digibis.com/dpla-europeana/#q=Quixote\">Quixote</a>'.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This little experiment shows that it is necessary to refine your queries if you wish to obtain only the most relevant results. There are features we would like to see added to both APIs, such as the possibility to sort results in the Europeana API, which would permit a better comparison by presenting both result sets sorted by author or by date. Europeana, but not the DPLA, provides a quick way of showing a thumbnail of an item, which greatly improves the page design. And the DPLA retrieves items with full text, not just the metadata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> the Europeana and DPLA APIs make it easy to discover information sources that were previously unknown or unforeseen and to go directly to a <a href=\"http://lowcountrydigital.library.cofc.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/ROS&amp;CISOPTR=623\">digital version </a>of an item. I hope our little tool will encourage other developers to use these fine APIs, and will encourage the API developers to keep up the great work and continue adding new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><a href=\"http://www.larramendi.es/i18n/estaticos/contenido.cmd?pagina=estaticos/bibliotecaIL\">Fundación Ignacio Larramendi</a></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DIGIBÍS is a company, owned by the Fundación Ignacio Larramendi, which offers digitisation services and software solutions for cultural heritage institutions, with a heavy emphasis on research, development and innovation in the domain of digital libraries, archives and museums.</p>"

        intro: null
        body: "<p>Could you help Europeana be more widely understood?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are looking for volunteers to create high quality translations for texts on the Europeana portal. We need people who can work in the following languages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\n<li>Basque</li>\r\n    <li>Czech</li>\r\n    <li>Croatian</li>\r\n    <li>Irish</li>\r\n    <li>Estonian</li>\r\n    <li>Italian</li>\r\n    <li>Lithuanian</li>\r\n    <li>Hungarian</li>\r\n    <li>Romanian</li>\r\n    <li>Slovenian</li>\r\n    <li>Slovakian</li>\r\n    <li>Swedish</li>\r\n</ul>\n<h2>Is it a big commitment?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As some translations have been undertaken in the past, to varying degrees, some languages have a longer 'to-do' list than others. The list above shows the languages we need the most urgent help with. We already have a good translation team in place for the other European languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translation tasks will vary, from just a few words to whole paragraphs, and as we can have up to two people working on each language, you can share the load with someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because you'll be working on the static content of the portal e.g. the About page or Help information, we won't be making frequent requests - once the pages are all up-to-date with good translations, we'll only ask for your help when new static content is added, or something is changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Teamwork.jpg\" style=\"width: 318px; height: 549px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200104/6BE5A0C9A32ABB77DD13BB5115DB5B942648609C.html\">Teamwork</a>', 2008, The Wellcome Library and The European Library, CC-BY-NC-ND.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What will you be translating?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The static text on the Europeana portal - so, the permanent text that is presented on every language version, such as the Help pages. If you'd like to see an example, go to the <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/aboutus_faqs.html\">FAQ page\_</a> and select 'Slovenský' (Slovak) from the 'Choose a language' drop-down list at the top right. You can see that some text has been translated into Slovak, but some remains in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/Bible%20translators.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 337px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>An article about translation wouldn't be complete without this great image from Europeana of scholars translating the Bible.

We'll provide documentation that shows you how to use it and you can contact us with any questions. Once you have an account, it's easy to log in, see what needs to be done and start adding your translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why should you help?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Because you'll be doing something concrete to help the citizens of Europe access and understand their cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because your real-life language skills are so much more useful than automated translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because Europeana is a real team effort, and we want you to be part of that team.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Want to help?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a good knowledge of English and can provide high quality translations into one (or more) of the languages listed above, we want to hear from you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please email Anna at <a href=\"mailto:marcomms@europeana.eu\">marcomms@europeana.eu</a></p>"

        posttype: blog

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today's blog is written by Friedel Grant of The European Library.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that a fifth of Europeana’s 26 million items come from one aggregator – <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/\">The European Library</a>? From <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=books&amp;qf=PROVIDER:The+European+Library\">books </a>and <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=manuscripts&amp;qf=PROVIDER:The+European+Library\">manuscripts </a>to <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92062/4B378D585A4A5DBBA80B4E871BD43020B4E6AD2E.html\">historical portraits</a> and some <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=*:*&amp;qf=PROVIDER:The+European+Library&amp;qf=TYPE:VIDEO\">1,500 videos</a>, The European Library has channelled nearly 4.5 million digital objects from Europe’s libraries to the Europeana portal. This makes it Europeana’s biggest single provider of content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/TEL1.jpg\" style=\"width: 498px; height: 353px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/9200105/27E20E85E6694F16EC076D1B8AE0815F6301A48E.html\">Various types of steam-driven vehicles and flying machines</a>', The Wellcome Library and The European Library, CC-BY-NC.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this material is supplied by the 48 national libraries which established The European Library in 1997. The total number of contributing organisations is, however, much greater. Nearly <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/discover/contributors\">80 libraries and repositories </a>have partnered with The European Library at various points in its history to share bibliographic data, full-text objects and digital items with academic communities and the general public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This number is expected to expand rapidly, now that full membership in The European Library is open to research libraries across Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'The response so far has been very encouraging. University College London have already signed up and we’re in discussions with several other major university libraries and library consortiums,' said marketing manager Nienke van Schaverbeke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major benefit of membership in The European Library is its commitment to the development of new skills and knowledge-sharing between members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Library directors, technical experts and marketing professionals from across the network regularly collaborate on cutting-edge projects, coordinated by The European Library and funded by the European Commission. Current projects include <a href=\"http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/\">Europeana Newspapers </a>and <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-ecloud\"> Europeana Cloud</a>. Critical topics such as linked data, copyright and the latest technical developments are also discussed at its yearly conference and via working groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/TEL2.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 270px;\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>'<a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92038/F957247D6B98D6E7AB795842101470B39AB6B936.html\">Ober-Krain</a>', National and University Library of Slovenia and The European Library, public domain.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Library’s aggregation infrastructure is another highly-appreciated feature of its service. It converts all data gathered from libraries into a common format and semantically enriches this data by connecting names, places and subjects. The transformed records are then supplied to The European Library and Europeana websites, to search engines and back to the contributing library. The aggregation system is highly efficient and capable of handling large amounts of data. In 2012, for example, nearly 1 million records a week were added to the central index of The European Library website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these services, The European Library is committed to cooperating with other major library organisations and academic initiatives. Through the recent <a href=\"http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/pro-blog/-/blogs/europeana-libraries-rich-legacy\">Europeana Libraries</a> project, for example, The European Library formed a new partnership with the research library networks <a href=\"http://www.libereurope.eu/\">LIBER</a> and<a href=\"http://www.cerl.org/main\"> CERL</a>. It also provides expertise and data to projects such as <a href=\"http://www.arrow-net.eu/what-arrow-plus\">ARROWPlus </a>and <a href=\"http://www.enumerate.eu/\">ENUMERATE</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on The European Library, please visit <a href=\"http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org\">The European Library website</a>.</p>"

        body: "<p>On 23 February, organisations around the world will be holding hackathon events to celebrate Open Data Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://opendataday.org/\">International Open Data Hackathon</a> is, 'a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption of open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/logo_odhd3_sm.png\" style=\"width: 206px; height: 68px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will be the third Open Data Day, the first two having taken place in December 2010 and December 2011, and it is the brainchild of Canadian David Eaves. Read David's announcement about his year's event on his <a href=\"http://www.govloop.com/profiles/blogs/international-open-data-day-an-update\">Open Data Day blog post</a>. In the first year, 60 cities across 5 continents held events. The second year, it spread to 6 continents (having reached Australia). This year, there are events in over 70 cities across the world. You can check out what's happening near you on the <a href=\"http://wiki.opendataday.org/2013/City_Events\">Open Data Day Wiki</a> page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are just a few examples of the types of events taking place this weekend across Europe...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Open Knowledge Foundation (which now also manages the Open Data Day website) is running an <a href=\"http://nl.okfn.org/2013/02/07/open-data-day-in-amsterdam/\">Open Data Day event in Amsterdam</a>, together with the Waag Society. They invite you to join their 'School of Data' team on a 'data expedition into the world of tax havens', and to join in with work on the Open Data Census.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Scotland, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/Edinburgh-GB/878412/\">Edinburgh University</a> will work with the Open Knowledge Foundation to explore links between local communities and businesses, software develoeprs and organisations that collect, store and provide data, in a event they say is 'a wee bit different' and that welcomes non-technical people too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Warsaw, the <a href=\"http://epsiplatform.eu/content/warsaw-three-days-open-data\">European Public Sector Information Platform </a>(ePSI) is holding three days of intensive open data activities, culminating in a hackday at which developers will work on, amongst other things, making public transport timetables available to all, and creating a map of Warsaw showing places that the city would like to rent to NGOs (non-governmental organisations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us know what you're doing for Open Data Day by adding a comment to this blog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might be only an annual event at the moment, but we'd like to think that one day every day will be an open data day! And since we're on the subject, here's our Linked Open Data video for those who haven't seen it yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/36752317\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36752317\">Linked Open Data - What is it?</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/europeana\">Europeana</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\r\n"

        intro: null
        body: "<p><i>Today's blog introduces a fascinating new project, Europeana EAGLE, which is due </i><em>to kick-off in Rome on 2-3 April this year. This post is by <a href=\"http://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/heritage-showcases/eagle/\">digitalmeetsculture.net</a>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EAGLE is a best practice network that brings together the most prominent European institutions and archives in the field of Classical Latin and Greek epigraphy (epigraphy = the study of inscriptions/epigraphs), to provide Europeana with a comprehensive collection of unique historical sources which constitute a veritable pillar of European culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/EAGLE1.jpg\" style=\"width: 492px; height: 258px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>A 'touch' reading of a partially-faded inscription in the catacombs of St. Alexander on via Nomentana in Rome. Picture by Giorgio Crimi.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, it will supply inscriptions from 25 EU countries, providing more than 1.5 million images and related metadata, including translations of selected texts, for the benefit of the general public. This represents approximately 80% of the total amount of inscriptions in the Mediterranean area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, EAGLE will implement an inscription-specific metadata model based on standards and recommendations developed through related Europeana projects and a bespoke service platform for epigraphy to allow for multi-format ingestion and multi-device distribution of content. The project will also bring new content providers and users to Europeana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/EAGLE2.jpg\" style=\"width: 497px; height: 703px;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>Base of a statue dedicated to the Emperor Septimius Severus by a group of soldiers in Ostia. Picture by H.G. Kolbe</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two flagship applications will be integrated to validate the project’s results with real users and to step up the mass adoption of EAGLE: a mobile application to enable tourists to understand inscriptions they find on location, and a storytelling application to allow teachers and experts to assemble epigraphy-based narratives for the benefit of less experienced users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A multilingual wiki will be set up for the enrichment and curation of epigraphic images and texts, with special emphasis on translations – providing a basis for future translations of inscriptions in other European languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of EAGLE will be disseminated to the epigraphers' community and to the general public to ensure the sustainability of the project. To this end, EAGLE will foster a tight integration of its collections with Wikipedia through their publication to Wikimedia Commons and it will develop an inscription-themed documentary with a related teaser video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EAGLE will coordinate its activities with <a href=\"http://www.europeana.eu\">Europeana</a> and the Europeana family of projects to ensure full integration of services.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Contacts</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA<br>\r\nPiazzale Aldo Moro, 5 – 00185 Roma, Italy - <a href=\"http://www.uniroma1.it\">www.uniroma1.it</a><br><b>Project Coordinator:</b> <a href=\"mailto:silvia.orlandi@uniroma1.it\">Silvia Orlandi</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PROMOTER SRL<br>\r\nVia Boccioni, 2 - 56037 Peccioli (PI), Italy - <a href=\"http://www.promoter.it\">www.promoter.it</a><br><b>Technical Coordinator:</b> <a href=\"mailto:prandoni@promoter.it\">Claudio Prandoni</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Project email address:</b> <a href=\"mailto:info@eagle-network.eu\">info@eagle-network.eu</a><br><b>Project website: </b><a href=\"http://www.eagle-network.eu\">www.eagle-network.eu</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/files/blogimages/EAGLE%20logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 481px; height: 262px;\"></p>"
